<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fly is a smart, decentralized hosting that allows your application to run faster by assigning virtual machines in the data centers that are located close to your users.  When users connect to your global IPs, Fly dynamically assigns compute powers in datacenters closest to that particular user’s location, contrary to solutions globally duplicating resources in every datacenter near where your customers are. So basically Fly is a solution allowing you to run Docker images on servers in many different cities and a global router connecting users to the nearest available instance.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location-Smart</strong> - when a user connects to a Fly application, the system determines the nearest location for the lowest latency and starts the application there.</li>
<li><strong>Auto-scaling</strong> - with Fly new instances are being created as more connections appear at a specific location,</li>
<li><strong>Agile</strong> - your applications adjust to users’ demand, relocating power to the locations where demand is expected to be higher,</li>
</ul>
<h2>GraphQL Server example with Fly</h2>
<p>Creators of <a href="https://github.com/fly-examples/edge-apollo-cache">Fly provided an example presenting the performance benefits</a> coming from using their service combined with a global Redis cache and Apollo Server. These three technologies power a GraphQL server able to perform queries super efficiently.</p>
<ol>
<li>When a query arrives at the Apollo Server, it is being filtered through the set of defined GraphQL types and being matched with corresponding resolvers. </li>
<li>When a REST query is executed, the server will respond with a JSON containing the requested data and cache the results (if it was configured to do so). Next incoming queries will be checked if the server already has cached results ready to be served.</li>
<li>The app creates the RedisCache (either locally or using Fly’s global Redis service), environment variables with a connection string to the server. The last step is the creation of an Apollo Server using provided configurations so it could start listening for incoming requests.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://blog.graphqleditor.com/fly-decentralized-graphql-server/fly.io">Fly</a> offers significant performance improvement over traditional hosting. Here are some sample results of the response times test performed for this example app. As you can see results when being hosted on Fly looks much better than results of requests made to the Open Library API directly:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Request Method</th>
<th>Test 1</th>
<th>Test 2</th>
<th>Test 3</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Open Library API</td>
<td>2.06s</td>
<td>1.70s</td>
<td>1.24s</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fly.io (uncached)</td>
<td>1.01s</td>
<td>1.03s</td>
<td>2.27s</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fly.io (cached)</td>
<td>0.13s</td>
<td>0.11s</td>
<td>0.09s</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h5>Source: <a href="https://github.com/fly-examples/edge-apollo-cache">github.com/fly-examples</a></h5>
<p>The above results were possible thanks to requests being served from the node located closest to the user’s querying for data, as well as using Redis to cache responses. After the first request made to a specific location Redis will keep data live for approximately an hour, so the next matching requests being sent to this location could be served significantly faster.</p>
<p>If you are still skeptical just visit the example app page on <a href="https://github.com/fly-examples/edge-apollo-cache">GitHub</a>. There is a detailed instruction provided on how to deploy it using Fly so you could test it yourself. </p></div><p>The GraphQL Editor is a supportive tool for both advanced GraphQL users as well as those taking their first steps with GraphQL APIs. Our all-in-one development environment for GraphQL will help you build, manage &amp; deploy your GraphQL API much faster thanks to dozens of built-in micro features. Its graphical interface will also fix communication within your product team. Visualization is the key!</p></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="abstract"><div><h6><i></i> Abstract</h6><p>Risk-based Authentication (RBA) is an adaptive security measure that improves the security of password-based authentication by protecting against credential stuffing, password guessing, or phishing attacks. RBA monitors extra features during login and requests for an additional authentication step if the observed feature values deviate from the usual ones in the login history. In state-of-the-art RBA re-authentication deployments, users receive an email with a numerical code in its body, which must be entered on the online service. Although this procedure has a major impact on RBA's time exposure and usability, these aspects were not studied so far.</p><p>We introduce two RBA re-authentication variants supplementing the de facto standard with a link-based and another code-based approach. Then, we present the results of a between-group study (N=592) to evaluate these three approaches. Our observations show with significant results that there is potential to speed up the RBA re-authentication process without reducing neither its security properties nor its security perception. The link-based re-authentication via "magic links", however, makes users significantly more anxious than the code-based approaches when perceived for the first time. Our evaluations underline the fact that RBA re-authentication is not a uniform procedure. We summarize our findings and provide recommendations.</p></div></div></div>]]>

              <p>Navigating in the ocean of Haskell possibilities is challenging even though Haskell is a powerful language that helps to implement robust and maintainable programs. The language supplies you with tons of awesome approaches, but it is not always trivial to see how and where to use them properly.</p>
<p>Fortunately, like any other mainstream programming language, Haskell also has its best-practices and recommended ways for producing high-quality code. Knowing Haskell programming patterns helps you create better libraries and applications and make their users more pleased. And, yes, Haskell actually has FP-oriented programming patterns in addition to the best-practices shared with other languages.</p>
<p>If you are aware of the best ways to solve common problems, you can become a better Haskell developer by using more efficient programming techniques specific to the language. Likewise, you can apply Haskell-specific patterns successfully outside of Haskell.</p>
<p>This blog post contains a structured collection of some programming mini-patterns in Haskell with the detailed description and examples, some small “quality of life” improvements that would help everyone on their developer journey.</p>
<p>📚 In this article, each pattern contains at least one task with the hidden solution, so you can test your understanding of a pattern by solving the proposed task.</p>
<h2 id="newtype">Newtype<a href="#newtype">🔗</a></h2>
<div>

<p>Newtype</p>

<p>Lightweight data wrapper.</p>

<p>When using the same primitive type (<code>Int</code>, <code>Text</code>, etc.) to represent semantically different entities (name, title, description, etc.).</p>

<div>

<li>Improves maintainability.</li>
<li>Increases code readability.</li>
<li>Enables writing custom instances.</li>
<li>Allows reusing instance definitions with <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#deriving-via">DerivingVia</a>.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div>
<ol type="1">
<li>Additional wrapping and unwrapping.</li>
<li>Deriving boilerplate is required to duplicate existing behaviour of the underlying type.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p>One of the most common and useful Haskell features is <code>newtype</code>. <code>newtype</code> is an ordinary data type with the name and a constructor. However, you can define a data type as <code>newtype</code> instead of <code>data</code> only if it has <strong>exactly</strong> one constructor with <strong>exactly</strong> one field.</p>
<p>It is extremely easy to define a <code>newtype</code> in Haskell as no extra effort is required from the user compared to the data type declaration. For example, the following are the valid <code>newtype</code> definitions:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>-- + Valid definition of a wrapper around Double</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span>newtype</span> <span>Volume</span> <span>=</span> <span>Volume</span> <span>Double</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><span>-- + Also valid newtype definition with the record field</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><span>newtype</span> <span>Size</span> <span>=</span> <span>Size</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6">    {<span> unSize ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb1-7">    }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But you can’t declare the following data types as a <code>newtype</code>:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>-- - Invalid newtype definition: more than 1 field</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><span>newtype</span> <span>Point</span> <span>=</span> <span>Point</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3">    {<span> pointX ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4">    ,<span> pointY ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5">    }</span>
<span id="cb2-6"></span>
<span id="cb2-7"><span>-- - Ivalid newtype definition: more than 1 constructor</span></span>
<span id="cb2-8"><span>newtype</span> <span>Shape</span></span>
<span id="cb2-9">    <span>=</span> <span>Circle</span> <span>Double</span></span>
<span id="cb2-10">    <span>|</span> <span>Square</span> <span>Double</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>newtype</code>s have a lot of great benefits but I’m going to focus only on the <em>code maintainability</em> in this section.</p>
<p>You can think of a <code>newtype</code> as a lightweight data type. Newtype has the same representation in memory as the wrapped type. Wrapping and unwrapping are also free operations in runtime. So, <code>newtype</code> is a <strong>zero-cost</strong> abstraction.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding from the compiler point of view, different <code>newtype</code>s are different data types. And since they don’t have any runtime overhead compared to the ordinary data types, you can provide a safer interface to your API without sacrificing performance.</p>
<p>Shall we look at the example now. Consider, that you have a function which takes a password, a hash and verifies whether the given hash is the hash of the given password. Since both password and hash are merely textual data, we could write the following function:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>validateHash ::</span> <span>ByteString</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>ByteString</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The problem with this function is that you can easily pass arguments in a different order and get faulty results. And you need to think about proper order of arguments each time you are calling this function. Should it be <code>validateHash password hash</code> or <code>validateHash hash password</code>? This approach is error-prone.</p>
<p>But if you define the following <code>newtype</code>s instead:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>newtype</span> <span>Password</span> <span>=</span> <span>Password</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2">    {<span> unPassword ::</span> <span>ByteString</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3">    }</span>
<span id="cb4-4"></span>
<span id="cb4-5"><span>newtype</span> <span>PasswordHash</span> <span>=</span> <span>PasswordHash</span></span>
<span id="cb4-6">    {<span> unPasswordHash ::</span> <span>ByteString</span></span>
<span id="cb4-7">    }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can implement a more type-safe version of the <code>validateHash</code> function, and additionally this improves the code readability:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>validateHash ::</span> <span>Password</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>PasswordHash</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now, <code>validateHash hash password</code> is a compile-time error, and it makes it impossible to confuse the order of arguments.</p>
<hr>
<p>Another popular way of increasing code readability without sacrificing performance is introducing a new alias (which is simply another name for a data type) by using the <code>type</code> keyword. Unfortunately, this approach is only a partial solution since it helps only a developer, not the compiler as the compiler doesn’t see the difference between type alias and type itself. And if you don’t help your compiler, the compiler won’t be there for you when you need it.</p>
<p>For example, the following code is flawed:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>type</span> <span>Attack</span>  <span>=</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><span>type</span> <span>Defense</span> <span>=</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3"></span>
<span id="cb6-4"><span>calculateDamage ::</span> <span>Attack</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Defense</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Attack</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Of course, the above type signature is better than <code>Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int</code>, but the compiler sees it exactly like this. So, you still can write <code>calculateDamage monsterDefense playerAttack</code> and get a runtime bug.</p>
<p>The approach of using <code>type</code>s instead of <code>newtype</code> can bring even more damage when you have a lot of similar data types. The more types you have the harder to maintain them without external help. Below you can see a code sample from one of the Haskell libraries:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>type</span> <span>WorkerId</span> <span>=</span> <span>UUID</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><span>type</span> <span>SupervisorId</span> <span>=</span> <span>UUID</span></span>
<span id="cb7-3"><span>type</span> <span>ProcessId</span> <span>=</span> <span>UUID</span></span>
<span id="cb7-4"><span>type</span> <span>ProcessName</span> <span>=</span> <span>Text</span></span>
<span id="cb7-5"><span>type</span> <span>SupervisorName</span> <span>=</span> <span>Text</span></span>
<span id="cb7-6"><span>type</span> <span>WorkerName</span> <span>=</span> <span>Text</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The library safety can be improved by replacing all these type aliases with <code>newtype</code>s, and it can even help to discover some bugs that happen due to passing arguments in the wrong order.</p>
<p>Moreover, the <code>newtype</code> approach is more flexible since you can provide your custom instances or restrict some instances allowing you to create values in an unsafe way.</p>
<p>The cost of using <code>newtype</code> is small — you only need to wrap and unwrap it when necessary. But the benefits hugely outweigh this small price.</p>

<p>Smart constructor</p>

<p>Providing idiomatic ways for constructing values.</p>

<div>
<ol type="1">
<li>When a data type restricts some values (e.g.&nbsp;not every <code>ByteString</code> is a valid <code>Password</code>).</li>
<li>When you want to make construction of big data types easier.</li>
<li>To avoid runtime errors.</li>
<li>To make illegal states unrepresentable.</li>

<ol type="1">
<li>Some extra code.</li>
<li>Decide on the approach details.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p>Once you have a <code>newtype</code>, first you need to create its value to work with it. And sometimes you want to validate a value before proceeding with it. Usually you would create a value of a data type by using its constructor. However, when programming in a modular way, you want to have boundaries in your interface and avoid providing unsafe ways of constructing values without validation.</p>
<p>This programming pattern in Haskell is called <strong>smart constructor</strong>. It can be understood better by looking at the implementation of such approach based on the <code>Password</code> data type:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><span>module</span> <span>Password</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2">    ( <span>Password</span> (unPassword)</span>

This means that US companies operating in the EU no longer enjoy the automatic right to transfer EU citizens’ data into the US. The fundamental reason is a conflict between the EU’s strong data protection rights (à la </span><a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/"><span>GDPR</span></a><span>) and the US’s strong national security needs. While Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) were still ruled valid, the Schrems II ruling sent cross-Atlantic cloud computing into long-term uncertainty: Will EU data eventually need to stay inside the EU’s border, perhaps even under EU judicial control?</span></p><p><span>These issues are not new to our customers. Even before Schrems II, national sentiments required some of our customers to keep data within a certain country. Others made it a Unique Selling Point (USP) to outperform required regulation and keep data geographically close to their users. Moreover, some healthcare companies need to run their application both on-premise and as a SaaS, depending on their evaluation of shared responsibility. </span><b>These use-cases highlight the need for a cloud-agnostic or even multi-cloud strategy.</b></p><h2>How can Kubernetes help?</h2><p><span>Kubernetes and Cloud Native technologies promise to decouple the underlying infrastructure from the application. Thus, it should be trivial to move a Cloud Native application between public clouds to private clouds or even bare-metal servers.</span></p><blockquote><p><i><span>“Cloud-native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds.” (Cloud Native Computing Foundation)</span></i></p></blockquote><p><span>However, this application-side simplicity pushes the complexity of dealing with the infrastructure onto Kubernetes in two ways. First, under the hood, Kubernetes needs to be packaged and configured with a specific </span><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/cloud-providers/"><span>cloud provider</span></a><span>, a component that abstracting away the underlying infrastructure, e.g., how to mount a Persistent Volume. Second, as the saying goes, “Kubernetes is a powerful engine, but you still need to build a car around it”. Each major cloud provider, such as AWS, Google or Azure, provides their own Kubernetes distribution. Said distribution is tightly integrated with the provider’s identity access management, container registry and logging solution. Other Kubernetes distributions are slightly less coupled to provider-specific services, but are still focused on major US cloud providers.</span></p><h2>So does staying in the EU mean no Kubernetes?</h2><p><span>Of course not! Kubernetes can be configured not only to run on private clouds built on top of OpenStack, CloudStack or VMware, but also on bare-metal servers. Provider-specific services can be replaced with open-source solutions, such as </span><a href="https://github.com/dexidp"><span>Dex</span></a><span> for identity management, </span><a href="https://www.elastic.co/"><span>Elasticsearch</span></a><span> for logging, </span><a href="https://prometheus.io/"><span>Prometheus</span></a><span> for metrics and alerting, and </span><a href="https://goharbor.io/"><span>Harbor</span></a><span> for container registry.</span></p><p><span>Carefully integrating all these components can lead to a Kubernetes setup that is truly cloud agnostic. The engineering team gets the same experience, no matter if the application runs on a big US cloud provider or on a quality EU cloud provider. Even if the current plan is to run in a single cloud, a cloud agnostic strategy reduces uncertainty, by facilitating a future migration to a different cloud provider or a future multi-cloud setup.</span></p><p><span>With even more care, the Kubernetes setup can pass stringent requirements of regulated industries, such as healthcare. For example, Harbor can be configured with integrated image vulnerability scanning. OpenPolicyAgent can be added to enforce policies, such as container images should only be downloaded from the local Harbor. Finally, Elasticsearch can run in a separate environment for tamper-proof logging.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Unfortunately, doing all these from scratch can become a time consuming and costly adventure.</span></p><h2>Compliant Kubernetes</h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Compliant-Kubernetes-stack-comparison.png" alt="" width="2584" height="1463" srcset="https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Compliant-Kubernetes-stack-comparison.png 2584w, https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Compliant-Kubernetes-stack-comparison-300x170.png 300w, https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Compliant-Kubernetes-stack-comparison-1024x580.png 1024w, https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Compliant-Kubernetes-stack-comparison-1536x870.png 1536w, https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Compliant-Kubernetes-stack-comparison-2048x1160.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2584px) 100vw, 2584px"></p><p><span>To help our customers run their application effortlessly across multiple clouds, Elastisys developed Compliant Kubernetes. The distribution supports multiple cloud providers, including AWS, GCP, OpenStack and CloudStack, with Azure and VMware to come. It also comes fully equipped with identity, tamper-proof logging, vulnerability scanning and backups. Together with many other features, it significantly reduces the compliance burden for regulations, such as GDPR and HIPAA.</span></p><p><span>Compliant Kubernetes is available as open source software, with Elastisys providing support. In addition, Elastisys partnered with many EU cloud providers, such as </span><a href="https://www.exoscale.com/"><span>Exoscale</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.safespring.com/"><span>SafeSpring</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://citycloud.com/"><span>CityCloud</span></a><span>, to offer Compliant Kubernetes as a managed service. A managed service is desirable for allowing in-house resources to focus on core business development.</span></p><p><span>In brief, Compliant Kubernetes is a single Kubernetes distribution that allows the same application to run in multiple clouds. A multi-cloud or cloud-agnostic strategy is an effective solution for uncertainty around the future implications of Schrems II, and the fall of PrivacyShield.</span></p><p><a href="https://elastisys.com/contact-form/">Contact us</a> to find out more!</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

</p><p>Prof.&nbsp;Akiyoshi Kitaoka makes images using the so-called “Popple illusion”. Using phase-shifted Gabor patches, these illusions cause your visual system to misinterpret concentric circles as non-concentric or even as spirals.</p><p>I love research papers that use illusions to reverse engineer our visual system. It’s cool to think that, as recently as the year 2000, we’re finding new and intriguing visual illusions that teach us something about our brain.

There will be some innovation and a few compromises, but this combination may pave the way for new and ingenious content.</p><hr><h2 id="cpu">CPU</h2><p>As with Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/game-boy-advance/">previous portable console</a>, the system revolves around a big chip named <strong>CPU NTR</strong>. ‘NTR’ is shorthand for ‘Nitro’, the codename of the original Nintendo DS.</p><p>Now, CPU NTR implements an interesting multi-processor architecture using two different ARM CPUs, this design was done before ARM Holdings officially released multi-processor solutions. So, their functioning may be considered a bit unorthodox taking into account the present technology available.</p><p>While this is not the first parallel system analysed for <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/">this series</a>, its design is very different from the rest. For instance, we are not talking about the ‘experimental’ master-slave configuration that the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/sega-saturn/">Saturn</a> debuted or the ‘co-processor’ approach found on the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/playstation/">PS1</a> or <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/nintendo-64/">N64</a>. The Nintendo DS includes two very independent computers that will perform exclusive operations, each one having a dedicated bus. This co-dependency will condition the overall performance of this console.</p><p>That being said, let’s take a look now at the two CPUs:</p><div><ul><li id="tab-1-1-arm7tdmi-link"><a href="#tab-1-1-arm7tdmi">ARM7TDMI</a></li><li id="tab-1-2-arm946e-s-link"><a href="#tab-1-2-arm946e-s">ARM946E-S</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-1-1-arm7tdmi"><h4>ARM7TDMI</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/nintendods/cpu/arm7_core.8a9851c20df1dda3c252ae75f544a8ce7a6749026fa4bc870027741cda1003b4.png"><picture>

It still includes all its original features (especially <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/game-boy-advance/#whats-new">Thumb</a>).</p><p>Now for the changes: Because Nintendo’s engineers placed the ARM7 next to most of the I/O ports, this CPU will be tasked with arbitrating and assisting I/O operations. In fact, no other processor can directly connect to the I/O. As you can see, this is not the ‘main’ processor that will be in charge of the system, but rather the ‘sub-processor’ offloading the main CPU by passing data around many components.</p></div><div id="tab-1-2-arm946e-s"><h4>ARM946E-S</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/nintendods/cpu/arm9_core.213329ca27287083c84d30b27fb9da63edd81998406a10b9ee7289089d0fe94d.png"><picture>

If you ignore the ill-fated ARM8 series, you could say the ARM946E-S is the ‘next-gen’ version of the ARM7. Part of the <strong>ARM9 series</strong>, this core in particular not only inherits all the features of the <strong>ARM7TDMI</strong> but also includes some additional bits:</p><ul><li>The <strong>ARMv5TE ISA</strong>: Compared to the previous v4, features some new instructions and a faster multiplier.<ul><li>If you take a look at the core name, the letter ‘E’ means <strong>Enhanced DSP</strong> which implies that lots of these new instructions have to do with applications for signal processing.</li></ul></li><li><strong>5-stage Pipeline</strong>: This is another increment from the previous 3-stage pipeline.</li><li><strong>12 KB of L1 Cache</strong>: The core now features cache, where 8 KB are allocated for instructions and 4 KB for data.</li><li><strong>48 KB of Tightly-Coupled Memory</strong> or ‘TCM’: Similar to <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/playstation/#cpu">Scratchpad memory</a>, however this one discriminates between instructions (32 KB) and data (16 KB).</li></ul><p>Nintendo also added the following components around it:</p><ul><li>A <strong>Divisor and Square root unit</strong> to speed up these type of operations (the ARM9 by itself is not capable of performing this type of math).</li><li>A <strong>Direct Memory Access Controller</strong>: Accelerates memory transfers without depending on the CPU. Combined with the use of cache, both CPU and DMA can potentially work concurrently.<ul><li>Cache and DMA can provide a lot of performance but also create new problems, such as data integrity. So programmers will have to manually maintain memory consistency by flushing the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/playstation-2/#preventing-past-mishaps">write-buffer</a> before triggering DMA, for instance.</li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div><p>I guess with hardware like this, it’s easy to figure out the <em>real</em> reason kids loved this console, eh?</p><h4 id="interconnection">Interconnection</h4><p>So far I’ve talked about how the two CPUs work individually. But to work as a whole, they require to co-operate constantly. To accomplish this, both CPUs directly ‘talk’ to each other using a dedicated <strong>FIFO unit</strong>, this block of data holds two 64-byte queues (up to 16 elements) for <strong>bi-directional communication</strong>.</p><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/nintendods/cpu/fifo.4c452b5f9236fb1e98454d2f90d2cab902ee4c561e165e8eaf8a8fc0cd7a05f4.png"><picture>

Alternatively, an <strong>interrupt unit</strong> can be activated to notify the receiver whenever there’s a new value in the queue.</p><h4 id="main-memory">Main memory</h4><p>Just like its predecessor, RAM is spread around many different locations, enabling to prioritise data placement by speed of access. In summary, we have the following general-purpose memory available:</p><div><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/nintendods/cpu/ram.99e9bd12e464182ef51ea4aa89a7fc60323a46a72550afbacd737957372cf190.png"><picture>

Therefore, behaving like SRAM (the faster, but more expensive alternative to DRAM). This design reminds me of <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/gamecube/#clever-memory-system">1T‑SRAM</a>.</li></ul></li></ul></div><h4 id="backwards-compatibility">Backwards compatibility</h4><p>Even though the architecture is significantly different from its predecessor, it still managed to maintain the critical bits that would grant it native compatibility with GameBoy Advance games.</p><p>But for the DS to revert to an ‘internal’ GBA, the former includes a set of software routines that set the console in <strong>AGB Compatibility Mode</strong>. In doing so, it effectively halts the ARM9, disables most of the ‘special’ hardware, redirects the buses, puts the ARM7 in charge and slows it down at 16.78 MHz. Finally, the ARM7 proceeds to boot the original AGB BIOS which bootstraps the GamePak cartridge (just like an original GameBoy Advance). This mode still exhibits some features not found in the original console, such as displaying the game with black margins (we’ll see in the next section that the new screen resolution happens to be bigger). Moreover, since the DS has two screens, users can set which screen will be used to display the GBA game.</p><p>Once in GBA mode <strong>there’s no going back</strong>, the console must be reset to re-activate the rest of the hardware.</p><h4 id="secrets-and-limitations">Secrets and limitations</h4><p>With so many sophisticated components fitted in a single and inexpensive chip, it’s no mystery that some issues emerged due to the way they were forced to work with each other.</p><div><ul><li id="tab-2-1-unused-power-link"><a href="#tab-2-1-unused-power">Unused Power</a></li><li id="tab-2-2-a-question-about-the-hardware-choice-link"><a href="#tab-2-2-a-question-about-the-hardware-choice">A question about the hardware choice</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-2-1-unused-power"><h4>Unused Power</h4><p>Sometimes I wonder how Nintendo planned the way the two CPU’s would be used, and if they already assumed some performance would be hit by the design they chose.</p><p>Let me start with the ARM9, this CPU runs at twice the speed of the ARM7, but most (if not all) of the I/O depends on the ARM7, so the ARM9 is vulnerable to excessive stalling until the ARM7 answers. If that wasn’t enough, <strong>ARM9’s external bus runs at half the speed</strong>, so there are a few bottlenecks identified.</p><p>Additionally, the Main Memory bus is only <strong>16-bit wide</strong>. Thus, whenever any CPU needs to fetch a word (32-bit wide) from memory, the interface <strong>stalls the CPU</strong> (up to 3 ‘wait’ cycles) until a full world is reconstructed. The worst impact happens when memory access is not sequential, which makes it stall for every single access. This issue will also arise when instructions are fetched (unfortunately, ARM didn’t support sequential opcode fetching back then) which, to my dismay, also affects Thumb code (since every 16-bit fetch is done as a 32-bit block). On the other hand, this penalty (as some sources call it) can be alleviated by making full use of cache and TCM.</p><p>All in all, this means that in the worst case, the ‘whooping’ ARM9’s 66 MHz horsepower is practically reduced to a mere ~8&nbsp;MHz. That is if the program makes an abysmal use of cache/TCM.</p></div><div id="tab-2-2-a-question-about-the-hardware-choice"><h4>A question about the hardware choice</h4><p>Back when I read about the CPU of the GameBoy Advance, I was really surprised by the potential of the ARM7: The CPU not only performed its designated tasks, but could also assist with others, such as providing audio sequencing or pseudo-3D graphics.</p><p>Now, during the commercialisation ARM7, ARM Holdings joined forces with DEC to design a high-end version of ARM’s chips. For this, DEC grabbed the datapath design of their processor, <strong>Alpha</strong>, and mixed it with ARM’s. The result was a new series of CPUs called <strong>StrongARM</strong> which was surprisingly <em>fast</em>. At the expense of removing certain features (Thumb and debug), DEC managed to cross the megahertz threshold by reaching speeds of up to 233 MHz. As a normal user prepared to buy a new ARM PC (let’s say a <em>RiscPC</em>), you could either choose one with the old ARM710 at 40 MHz or another one with a StrongARM running ~582% faster. The impact of StrongARM was so disruptive that ARM Holdings absorbed some of StrongARMs features to produce their next line of CPUs, starting with ARM9. And the rest is history.</p><p>But here’s where my question resides: Considering the new developments in the ARM world, why did Nintendo ultimately choose an awfully slow ARM9 combined by an even slower ARM7, instead of a faster ARM9 (or even a StrongARM)? To give you an idea, other companies like Apple just adopted the StrongARM with their Newton PDA line.</p><p>I don’t mean to criticise Nintendo’s choice, but I believe the amount of emerging technology was just too great for me to ignore. I guess their choice was done in an effort to preserve battery life and maintain production costs (by using the same CPU found in the GBA).</p></div></div></div><hr><h2 id="graphics">Graph…</h2></div></div></div>

</span></p><p>Push notifications are everywhere, from news and messenger apps to fitness and health applications. They are a great tool for increasing user
engagement, having a click rate that is <a href="https://blog.e-goi.com/infographic-push-notification">7 times higher than that of email marketing</a>.
But be careful not to send too many irrelevant notifications. As <a href="https://uplandsoftware.com/localytics/resources/blog/the-inside-view-how-consumers-really-feel-about-push-notifications/">this report shows</a>,
50% of app users find push notifications annoying.</p><p>With that being said, in this tutorial, I'll show you how to create your own web push notifications,
using <strong>your own backend with NodeJS and TypeScript</strong>, and vanilla <strong>JavaScript on the frontend</strong>.</p><p>I'll go through all the steps you need to take to set up the backend and frontend, but you can skip those parts of course if you're
interested in adding push notifications to an existing project.</p><blockquote><p>I uploaded the final code to this <a href="https://github.com/fgerschau/web-push-notification-example">GitHub repository</a>.</p></blockquote><h3 id="what-you-will-learn"><a href="#what-you-will-learn" aria-label="what you will learn permalink"></a>What you will learn</h3><p>I'll briefly explain what you need to know about web push notifications before diving into the tutorial, where we'll build a full-stack web application

</span></p><p>Web push notifications are notifications that the user receives through the browser. These notifications were previously exclusive to native
web and desktop applications, but can now be used by websites as well.</p><p>To receive a web push notification, the user doesn't need to have the browser or the website open, thanks to the

    <main role="main">

        
        
<p><img src="https://gpfault.net/assets/post-img/asm-tut-0/header.png">
</p>

<p>
The way I was taught x86 assembly at the university had been completely outdated for many years by the time I had my first class. It was around 2008 or 2009, and 64-bit processors had already started becoming a thing even in my neck of the woods. Meanwhile, we were doing DOS, real-mode, memory segmentation and all the other stuff from the bad old days.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, I picked up enough of it during the classes (and over the subsequent years) to be able to understand the stuff coming out of the other end of a compiler, and that has helped me a few times. However, I've never manually written any substantial amount of x86 assembly for something non-trivial. Due to being locked up inside (on account of a global pandemic), I decided to change that situation, to pass the time.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to focus on x86-64 specifically, and completely forget/skip any and all legacy crap that is no longer relevant for this architecture. After getting a bit deeper into it, I also decided to publish my notes in the form of tutorials on this blog since there seems to be a desire for this type of content.
</p>

<p>
Everything I write in these posts will be a normal, 64-bit, Windows program. We'll be using Windows because that is the OS I'm running on all of my non-work machines, and when you drop down to the level of writing assembly it starts becoming incresingly impossible to ignore the operating system you're running on. I will also try to go as "from scratch" as possible - no libraries, we're only allowed to call out to the operating system and that's it.
</p>

<p>
In this first, introductory part (yeah, I'm planning a series and I know I will regret this later), I will talk about the tools we will need, show how to use them, explain how I generally think about programming in assembly and show how to write what is perhaps the smallest viable Windows program.
</p>

<h2>Getting the Tools</h2>
<p>There are two main tools that we will use throughout this series.</p>

<h3>Assembler</h3>

<p>
CPUs execute machine code - an efficient representation of instructions for the processor that is almost completely impenetrable to humans. The assembly language is a human-readable representation of it. A program that converts this symbolic representation into machine code ready to be executed by a CPU is called an <b>assembler</b>.
</p>

<p>
There is no single, agreed-upon standard for x86-64 assembly language. There are many assemblers out there, and even though some of them share a great deal of similarities, each has its own set of features and quirks. It is therefore important which assembler you choose. In this series, we will be using 
<a href="http://flatassembler.net/">Flat Assembler</a> (or FASM for short). I like it because it's small, easy to obtain and use, has a nice macro system and comes with a handy little editor.</p>

<h3>Debugger</h3>

<p>
Another important tool is the debugger. We'll use it to examine the state of our programs. While I'm pretty sure it's possible to use Visual Studio's integrated debugger for this, I think a standalone debugger is better when all you want to do is look at the disassembly, memory and registers. I've always used <a href="http://ollydbg.de/">OllyDbg</a> for stuff like that, but unfortunately it does not have a 64-bit version. Therefore we will be using <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windbg-preview/9pgjgd53tn86?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">WinDbg</a>. The version linked here is a revamp of this venerable tool with a slightly nicer interface. Alternatively, you can get the non-Windows-store version <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/debugger-download-tools">here</a> as part of the Windows 10 SDK. Just make sure you deselect everything else besides WinDbg during installation. For our purposes, the two versions are mostly interchangeable.
</p>

<h2>Thinking in Assembly</h2>

<p>
Now that we have our tools, I want to spend a bit of time to discuss some basics. For the purpose of these tutorials I'm assuming some knowledge of languages like C or C++, but little or no previous exposure to assembly, therefore many readers will find this stuff familiar.
</p>
<h3>A 10000-foot view</h3>
<p>
CPUs only "know" how to do a fixed number of certain things. When you hear someone talk about an "instruction set", they're referring to the set of things a particular CPU has been designed to do, and the term "instruction" just means "one of the things a CPU can do". Most instructions are parameterized in one way or another, and they're generally really simple. Usually an instruction is somthing along the lines of "write a given 8-bit value to a given location in memory", or "interpreting the values from registers A and B as 16-bit signed integers, multiply them and record the result into register A".
</p>

<p>
Below is a simple mental model of the architecture that we'll start with.
</p>

<p><img src="https://gpfault.net/assets/post-img/asm-tut-0/diag0.png">
</p>

<p>
 This skips a <i>ton</i> of things (there can be more than one core executing instructions and reading/writing memory, there's different levels of cache, etc. etc.), but should serve as a good starting point.
</p>

<p>
 To be effective at low-level programming or debugging you need to understand that every high-level concept eventually maps to this low-level model, and learning how the mapping works will help you.
</p>

<h3>Registers</h3>
<p>
 You can think of <b>registers</b> as a special kind of memory built right into the CPU that is very small, but extremely fast to access. There are many different kinds of registers in x86-64, and for now we'll concern ourselves only with the so-called <i>general-purpose</i> registers, of which there are sixteen. Each of them is 64 bits wide, and for each of them the lower byte, word and double-word can be addressed individually (incidentally, 1 "word" = 2 bytes, 1 "double-word" = 4 bytes, in case you haven't heard this terminology before).

<p>Additionally, the higher 8 bits of <code>rax</code>, <code>rbx</code>, <code>rcx</code> and <code>rdx</code> can be referred to as <code>ah</code>, <code>bh</code>, <code>ch</code> and <code>dh</code>.</p>

<p>
Note that even though I said those were "general-purpose" registers, some instructions can only be used with certain registers, and some registers have special meaning for certain instructions. In particular, <code>rsp</code> holds the stack pointer (which is used by instructions like <code>push</code>, <code>pop</code>, <code>call</code> and <code>ret</code>), and <code>rsi</code> and <code>rdi</code> serve as source and destination index for "string manipulation" instructions. Another example where certain registers get "special treatment" are the multiplication instructions, which require one of the multiplier values to be in the register <code>rax</code>, and write the result into the pair of registers <code>rax</code> and <code>rdx</code>.
</p>

<p>
In addition to these registers, we will also consider the special registers <code>rip</code> and <code>rflags</code>. <code>rip</code> holds the address of the next instruction to execute. It is modified by control flow instructions like <code>call</code> or <code>jmp</code>. <code>rflags</code> holds a bunch of binary flags indicating various aspects of the program's state, such as whether the result of the last arithmetic operation was less, equal or greater than zero. The behavior of many instructions depends on those flags, and many instructions update certain flags as part of their execution. The flags register can also be read and written "wholesale" using special instructions.
</p>

<p>
There are a lot more registers on x86-64. Most of them are used for SIMD or floating-point instructions, and we'll not be considering them in this series.
</p>

<h3>Memory and Addresses</h3>

<p>
You can think of memory as a large array of byte-sized "cells", numbered starting at 0. We'll call these numbers "memory addresses". Simple, right?
</p>
<p>
Well... addressing memory used to be rather annoying back in the old days. You see, registers in old x86 processors used to be only 16-bit wide. Sixteen bits is enough to address 64 kilobytes worth of memory, but not more. The hardware was actually capable of using addresses as wide as 20 bits, but you had put a "base" address into a special segment register, and instructions that read or wrote memory would use a 16-bit offset into that segment to obtain the final 20-bit "linear" address. There were separate segment registers for code, data and stack portions (and a few more "extra" ones), and segments could overlap. 
</p>
<p>
In x86-64 these concerns are non-existant. The segment registers for code, data and stack are still present, and they're loaded with some special values, but as a user-space programmer you needn't concern yourself with them. For all intents and purposes you can assume that all segments start at 0 and extend for the entire addressable length of memory. So, as far as we're concerned, on x86-64 our programs see memory as a "flat" contiguous array of bytes, with sequential addresses, starting at 0, just like we said in the beginning of this section...
</p>
<p>
Okay, I may have distorted the truth a little bit. Things aren't quite as simple. While it is true that on 64-bit Windows your programs see memory as a flat contiguous array of bytes with addresses starting at 0, it is actually an elaborate illusion maintained by the OS and CPU working together.
</p>
<p>
The truth is, if you were really able to read and write any byte in memory willy-nilly, you'd stomp all over other programs' code and data (something that indeed could happen in the Bad Old Days). To prevent that, special protection mechanisms exist. I won't get too deep into their inner workings here because this stuff matters mostly for OS developers. Nevertheless, here's a very short overview:
</p>
<p>
Each process gets a "flat" address space as described above (we'll call it the "virtual address space"). For each process, the OS sets up a <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Paging">mapping</a> between its virtual addresses and actual physical addresses in memory. This mapping is respected by the hardware: the "virtual" addresses get translated to physical addresses dynamically at runtime. Thus, the same address (e.g. 0x410F119C) can map to two different locations in physical memory for two different processes. This, in a nutshell, is how the separation between processes in enforced.
</p>

<p>
The final thing I want to invite your attention to here is how the instructions and data which they operate on are held in the same …</p></main></div></div>

<p>It seems impossible, however, thanks to a particular initiative that is becoming more and more popular, this can become a reality.

<p>This unprecedented proposal has struggled initially, but it’s gaining popularity in recent times. This long-term strategy is attractive for those who are looking for low-cost real estate investments in Italy, and to simply restore prestige to Italian villages famous all over the world for their extraordinary beauty, and for that vintage spirit so cherished nowadays.</p>

<p>Last but not least, the repopulation of these small villages also promotes tourist activities, regenerating the economy of the entire area.

<p><span>Despite the buzz around GPT-3, it is, in and of itself, not AGI.</span> In many ways, this makes it similar to AlphaGo or Deep Blue; while approaching human ability in one domain (playing Chess/Go, or writing <em>really</em> impressively), it doesn’t really seem like it will do <span><a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Intelligence_explosion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scary AGI Things™</a></span> any more than AlphaGo is going to be turning the Earth into paperclips anytime soon. While its writings are impressive at emulating humans, GPT-3 (or any potential future GPT-x) has no memory of past interactions, nor is it able to follow goals or maximize utility. However, language modelling has one <em>crucial</em> difference from Chess or Go or image classification. Natural language essentially encodes information about the world—the <em>entire</em> world, not just the world of the Goban, in a much more expressive way than any other modality ever could.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> By harnessing the world model embedded in the language model, it may be possible to build a proto-AGI.</p>

<p>The explicit goal of a language model is only to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maximize likelihood</a> of the model on natural language data. In the <a href="https://leogao.dev/2019/10/27/The-Difficulties-of-Text-Generation-with-Autoregressive-Language-Models/">autoregressive formulation</a> that GPT-3 uses, this means being able to predict the next word as well as possible. However, this objective places much more weight on large, text-scale differences like grammar and spelling than fine, subtle differences in semantic meaning and logical coherency, which reflect as very subtle shifts in distribution. Once the former are near-perfect, though, the only place left to keep improving is the latter.</p>
<p>At the extreme, any model whose loss reaches the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shannon entropy</a> of <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/1999-00/information-theory/entropy_of_english_9.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">natural language</a>—the theoretical lowest loss a language model can possibly achieve, due to the inherent randomness of language—will be <em>completely indistinguishable</em> from writings by a real human in every way, and the closer we get to it, the more abstract the effect on quality of each bit of improvement in loss. Or, said differently, stringing words together using <a href="https://github.com/jsvine/markovify#markovify-in-the-wild" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Markov chain generators</a> gets you 50% of the way there, figuring out grammar gets you another 50% of the remaining distance, staying on topic across paragraphs gets you another 50% of the remaining distance, being logically consistent gets you another 50% of the remaining distance, and so on.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mtable><mtr><mtd><mrow><mi>H</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>X</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mo>−</mo><mi mathvariant="double-struck">E</mi><mo>[</mo><mi>log</mi><mi mathvariant="double-struck">P</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>X</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>]</mo><mo>=</mo><mo>−</mo><msub><mo>∑</mo><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>∈</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">Ω</mi></mrow></msub><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>X</mi></msub><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mi>log</mi><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>X</mi></msub><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mtd></mtr></mtable></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\begin{aligned}

\end{aligned}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p><p><span>Shannon Entropy: the number of bits necessary, on average to specify one piece of text.</span></p>
<p>Why? Because if you have a coherent-but-not-logically consistent model, becoming more logically consistent helps you predict language better. Having a model of human behavior helps you predict language better. Having a model of the world helps you predict language better. As the low-hanging fruits of grammar and basic logical coherence are taken, the only place left for the model to keep improving the loss is a world model. Predicting text is <a href="http://mattmahoney.net/dc/rationale.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">equivalent to AI</a>.</p>
<p>The thing about GPT-3 that <a href="https://leogao.dev/2020/05/29/GPT-3-A-Brief-Summary/">makes it so important</a> is that it provides evidence that as long as we keep increasing the model size, we can keep driving down the loss, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possibly right up until</a> it hits the Shannon entropy of text. No need for clever architectures or complex handcrafted heuristics. Just by scaling it up we can get a better language model, and a better language model entails a better world model.</p>
<p>But how do we use this language model if it’s buried implicitly-represented inside GPT-x, though? Well, we can literally just <em>ask</em> it, in natural language, what it thinks will happen next given a sequence of events, and its output distribution will approximate the distribution of what the average human thinks would happen next after those events. Great—we’ve got ourselves a usable world model.</p>
<p>“But wait!” you say, “<a href="https://aiweirdness.com/post/621186154843324416/all-your-questions-answered" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Various</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/eigenrobot/status/1284042570507542528" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experiments</a> have shown that GPT-3 often fails at world modelling, and just conjecturing that adding more parameters will fix the problem is a <em>massive</em> leap!” If you’re thinking this, you’re absolutely correct. The biggest and most likely to be wrong assumption that I’m making is that larger models will develop better world models. Since as loss approaches the Shannon entropy its world modelling ability has to become about as good than the average human on the internet<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>, this boils down to two questions: “Will we really make models whose loss gets close enough to the Shannon entropy?” and “How close is close enough, in order to have the world modelling capabilities to make all this practical?”</p>
<p><img src="https://leogao.dev/images/gpt3/perf_scaling_compute.png" alt="Loss keeps going down with more parameters and compute. (<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165'>Source</a>)"></p>
<p>The answer to the first question is “most likely”—that’s the <a href="https://leogao.dev/2020/05/29/GPT-3-A-Brief-Summary/">main takeaway of GPT-3</a>. The answer to the second question is… nobody knows. Some have demonstrated <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23990902" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ways of making GPT-3 better at world modelling</a>, but this alone is probably not sufficient. When models with 1 trillion, then 10 trillion, then 100 trillion parameters become available, we will have empirical evidence to see whether this assumption is correct. If GPT-x demonstrates uncanny ability to predict outcomes in the real world, then this just might work.</p>

<p>A world model alone does not an agent make, though.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> So what does it take to make a world model into an agent? Well, first off we need a goal, such as <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“maximize number of paperclips”</a>. Then, we just ask the world model “What action can I take to maximize the number of paperclips I have?” Simple, right? Actually, not quite. The problem is that our world model probably won’t be able to consider all the possible things that could happen next well enough to make a reasonable answer.</p>
<p><img src="https://leogao.dev/images/agi-lms/mesa.png" alt="GPT-3 considers mesa-optimization. (Source: OpenAI API)"></p>
<p>So what can we do instead? Well, asking the world model for a list of things you could do in a given world state would probably not be outside the capabilities of a sufficiently powerful language model (think: “I am in situation <span>xyz</span>. Here is a list of things I could do:”). Similarly, asking the world model how much reward you’d get in some hypothetical world where you took a sequence of actions would probably be possible too—imagine asking something along the lines of “I go to ebay. I look up paperclips, sorted by price ascending. I spend $100 on the first item on the list. How many paperclips will I have?”<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> This will let us figure out what actions the agent can take in any given step (policy function), as well as how much reward each sequence of steps will net the agent (value function).</p>
<p>So now, to estimate the state-action value of any action, we can simply do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monte Carlo Tree Search</a> to estimate the state-action values! Starting from a given agent state, we can roll out sequences of actions using the world model. By integrating over all rollouts, we can know how much future expected reward the agent can expect to get for each action it considers. Then, we can simply use, for example, a greedy policy with that state-action value function, to decide on actions to take.</p>
<p><img src="https://leogao.dev/images/agi-lms/mcts.png" alt="Monte Carlo Tree Search visualized (<a href='https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Phases-of-the-Monte-Carlo-tree-search-algorithm-A-search-tree-rooted-at-the-current_fig1_312172859'>Source</a>)"></p>
<p>Each of these actions is likely to be very high level, such as “figure out the cheapest way to buy paperclips”, but thanks to the flexibility of language we can describe very complex ideas with short sequences of tokens. To actually execute these abstract actions once the agent decides on an action, that action can be broken down using the language model into smaller sub-goals such as “figure out the cheapest paperclips on Amazon”, similar to <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6233-hierarchical-deep-reinforcement-learning-integrating-temporal-abstraction-and-intrinsic-motivation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning</a>. Possibly even just breaking actions down into a detailed list of instructions would be feasible, depending on the capabilities of the model and how abstract the actions are.</p>
<p>We can represent the agent state as natural language, too. Since the agent state is just a compressed representation of the observations, we can ask the language model to summarize the important information of any observations for its own internal world state. The language model could be used to periodically prune (i.e forget) the information inside its state, too, to make room for more observations.</p>
<p>Altogether, this gets us a system where we can pass observations from the outside world in, spend some time thinking about what to do, and output an action in natural language.</p>
<p>To handle input, you could have an input module that turns various modalities of observations into summarized text with respect to the current agent state. For instance, you could use something like <a href="https://openai.com/blog/image-gpt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iGPT</a> to input camera images or screenshots, or raw HTML from webpages that the agent requests. How exactly this is done is tangential to the point; all that matters is that somehow the inputs are all converted to text and added to the agent state. The examples I have provided are just to convince you that it’s absolutely not insurmountable.</p>
<p>Finally, to get the model to actually act in the world, you could again use the language model to translate natural language into <a href="https://www.pscp.tv/Microsoft/1OyKAYWPRrWKb?t=29m19s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">code that is then executed</a>, or <a href="https://vimeo.com/427943407/98fe5258a7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shell commands</a>, or sequences of keypresses, or any of a number of other possible ways. Like input, there are an infinitude of different ways to solve the output problem, and which one turns out to be the best is entirely irrelevant to our discussion; all that matters is that it’s possible to get various modalities in and out of the text-only agent.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p><img src="https://leogao.dev/images/agi-lms/paperclipsamzn.png" alt="An example of an input module taking a screenshot input combined with the current agent state to give an observation with the information needed by the agent."></p>

<p>This is more a thought experiment than something that’s actually going to happen tomorrow; GPT-3 today just isn’t good enough at world modelling. Also, this method depends heavily on at least one major assumption—that bigger future models will have much better world modelling capabilities—and a bunch of other smaller implicit assumptions. <strong><span>However</span></strong>, this might be the closest thing we ever get to a chance to <a href="https://intelligence.org/2017/10/13/fire-alarm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sound the fire alarm</a> for AGI: there’s now a concrete path to proto-AGI that has a non-negligible chance of working.</p>

<!--[^toolai]: One common line of argument is that such "tool AIs" are good enough and have desirable safety properties, and therefore agentistic AI need not ever be developed. One argument against this idea is that [agent AI will inevitably be more economically valuable than tool AI](https://www.gwern.net/Tool-AI), which would encourage their development.-->

Going from a model that just strings uniformly chosen words together to a simple [Markov chain generator](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify#markovify-in-the-wild) makes a *massive* difference, but the loss difference between a Markov chain generator and GPT-2 is much smaller despite GPT-2 being able to manage grammatically correct sentences nearly all of the time, and the loss difference between GPT-2 and GPT-3 is smaller still, despite massive subjective improvements in quality. 

The difference between "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" and "shxixpgozcvoomz jcxfgabsdcxfrevogjsqewdnmkj" is *massive*, but the difference between "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" and "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

Going from a model that just strings uniformly chosen words together to a model that uses words in the same [Zipf distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law) as regular text earns a large decrease in loss, because if you always pick common words like "the" you have a much better chance of being right than picking rare words. Another big decrease comes from considering n-gram frequencies rather than just single-word frequencies; this is the driving idea behind [Markov chain generators](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify#markovify-in-the-wild), which generate surprisingly good text considering how just how simple they are.

I would like to highlight projects that are widely used, even to the point of being part of critical infrastructure, but are nevertheless small projects with small (often unsponsored) development teams.

<p>dnsmasq is one of the unsung heroes of the Internet: a small piece of software used very widely, but with a <em>very</em> small development team, and no corporate backing. It is used as the <span>DHCP</span> and caching <span>DNS</span> server on a wide variety of home-market routers, as well as other devices, and is the default <span>DHCP</span> and <span>DNS</span> caching server for libvirt, and by extension, OpenStack. A couple years ago, I contacted Simon Kelley, the author of dnsmasq, and asked if he was up for an interview. He was, but my blog wasn’t in a maintainable position at that point, so it got pushed back. I contacted him again recently, and we managed to make it happen. This interview was conducted via e-mail on December 10,&nbsp;2017.</p>

<p>Simon, thank you for taking time out of your schedule (when you could be
programming) to answer my questions. This is quite an honor, and I hope you
enjoy the&nbsp;questions.</p>
<p>What itch were you scratching, that is, what was your original need and
intention for&nbsp;dnsmasq?</p>

got a second-hand 486 laptop, and discovered that I could connect
that to my <span>PC</span> and give it a net connection too, using this amazing thing
called ip-masquerading (what later became <span>NAT</span>.) But when the Netscape on the
laptop would send the <span>UDP</span> <span>DNS</span> query to the <span>ISP</span>, it would get to the
desktop, where it would evaporate, and Netscape would hang (it was
single-threaded, at least in the <span>DNS</span> code) for a long time-out. I wanted
to fix that annoying behaviour. The <span>IP</span>-masquerade use is where the
DNSmasq name came&nbsp;from.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did you intend to release it as open source from the&nbsp;beginning?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To the extent that I intended to release it,&nbsp;yes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How much did you know about <span>DNS</span> and <span>DHCP</span> when you&nbsp;started?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Almost nothing, about the internals anyway. I started with <span>RFC</span> 1035 and
went from&nbsp;there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is the most interesting bug you’ve run&nbsp;into?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not one of mine - I found a Linux kernel bug once, in the <span>API</span> to control
the <span>ARP</span> cache. The bug was long-ago fixed, but in a sense, the
work-around still persists in dnsmasq. It was difficult to find because
it was intermittent and hard to reproduce, and it took a long time to
consider that the problem may not have been mine, but in the&nbsp;Kernel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Related: when fixing a bug (found by you or reported), what has been your
most “What was I thinking when I wrote that”&nbsp;moment?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Plenty of those. I once found a “&amp;” versus “&amp;&amp;” confusion which nobody
had spotted as a functional error, by code&nbsp;inspection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have you ever found bugs in other <span>DHCP</span> and <span>DNS</span> products/libraries as a
result of your testing? What was the most interesting one? Feel free to share
others, if you&nbsp;wish.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are lots of <span>DHCP</span> clients in things like printers and scanners and
general IoT devices which behave badly and need workarounds. Intel
produced some awful bugs in <span>PXE</span> implementations which went into netboot
<span>ROMS</span> and never got&nbsp;updated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What was your most “you’ve got to be kidding me” moment when learning new
corners of <span>DHCP</span> and <span>DNS</span> and/or your biggest “I wish I had known that when I
started”&nbsp;moment?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s always amused me that the format of a <span>DNS</span> packet - which is very
size constrained to fit into <span>UDP</span> packets, wastes 16 bits for a count of
the number of questions in a query. This has been constrained to be
exactly one for all of the life of <span>DNS</span>, so the 16 bits are completely
wasted. <span>DNS</span> in general is an amazingly under-specified and obscure area.
It’s been around forever, and is developed by people who have been
around for a long time and grown up with it. They tend to vastly
underestimate how much implied knowledge they are assuming when writing
RFCs. As for what I wished I’d known: I wished I’d found the <span>RFC</span> which
is an errata  to the original three <span>DNSSEC</span> RFCs earlier; I found several
of the bugs the hard&nbsp;way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What was your reaction when you found out dnsmasq was used as the default
forwarder/<span>DHCP</span> server for OpenStack? What is it like having your project used
in one the most well known open source projects in the&nbsp;world?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That happened after dnsmasq was incorporated into Android, so it was
sort of an anti-climax after getting into the majority of smart phones on
the&nbsp;planet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[ed. note: point&nbsp;taken]</p>
<p>Besides OpenStack, what are some of the most interesting use cases you’ve
heard about for&nbsp;dnsmasq?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I took some patches from someone who was providing satellite Internet to
trans-oceanic sailors. Bandwidth costs were high enough that it made
sense to audit almost every byte sent and received, including for <span>DNS</span>&nbsp;resolution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have you ever gotten contributions (code or otherwise) back from router
manufacturers that have used&nbsp;dnsmasq?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Probably, but I don’t remember anything significant in terms of code.
Comcast paid for a year of my time to implement <span>DNSSEC</span>, which was pretty
good of&nbsp;them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What kind of contributions have you turned&nbsp;down?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That’s people who make a patch to solve their particular problem and
don’t give any thought to making it general, or generally&nbsp;useful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could you talk about one significant or difficult contribution you turned down
and why? - From my co-worker <a href="https://twitter.com/eduncan911">Eric Duncan&nbsp;@eduncan911</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The one that’s happened over and over again is to change the behaviour
on receiving a “no-such-domain” reply from an upstream nameserver.
People want to implement local <span>DNS</span> hacks by getting dnsmasq to keep
trying another upstream server when the first returns <span>NXDOMAIN</span>, but
that’s always seemed to me to be a really bad thing to do: <span>NXDOMAIN</span> is a
valid answer, and not a failure&nbsp;return.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you have a group of steady contributors, or is it pretty much just you
(and occasional&nbsp;contributions)?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are steady contributors, but long-term, it’s just&nbsp;me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are pretty active on the mailing list. For the second quarter of 2017,
nearly 80 messages of the 229 are from you. How much time do you spend on the
project (code and helping&nbsp;users)?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Very variable, and less than I used to. I used to have a job with a very
<span>FOSS</span>-friendly employer. I was sitting in front of computer most days,
and my boss was happy for me to spend time on dnsmasq. Nowadays, I’m
semi-retired, and I spend my days doing other stuff, so I have to make
time to sit down and work on&nbsp;dnsmasq.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is your motivation for self-hosting, vs. moving to something like
Github or&nbsp;Bitbucket?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The self-hosting setup existed before Github etc, or at least before
they were visible and known to be reliable. It works, so I’ve never had
the activation energy to move it. I’m a sysadmin and I like having a
host to do my stuff, my&nbsp;way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your <span>FAQ</span> says it will run on Linux, *<span>BSD</span>, and embedded systems. What is the
most interesting platform you’ve heard of using&nbsp;dnsmasq?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Somebody ran it on <span>QNX</span> once, I&nbsp;believe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Commit 1 in the dnsmasq git repository happened on January 22, 2004, and
says it is an “import of dnsmasq-2.0.tar.gz.”  When was your first public
release (version 0.4)? How long had you been working on it before&nbsp;then?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Around 2000. There were quite a few releases in the 1.x series, which
were before the <span>DHCP</span> server was added. It didn’t seem worth adding those
when I moved into&nbsp;git.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are your future plans, dreams, and hopes for&nbsp;dnsmasq?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like all code that’s 15 years old, there are deep design decisions and
trade-off that are hard to change but which don’t necessarily make sense
any more. I’d like to do a version 3.0 which addresses those, but I’m
not sure I have the commitment left in me to do&nbsp;it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In relation to the <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2017/10/behind-masq-yet-more-dns-and-dhcp.html">recent security fixes contributed by Google</a> did
you know they were working on dnsmasq, or did the fixes come as a&nbsp;suprise?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They didn’t tell me they were working on dnsmasq before they started,
but once they’d found holes, they let me know well before the public
disclosure. There’s a whole raft of stuff which happens in case like
this, and the Google security people were really good at helping to work
through it.  A lot is helping distributions to get patched packages ready in
advance: I spend a lot of effort helping people backport the fixes to
the older&nbsp;versions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have any steps been taken to do a full audit, or is that what Google&nbsp;did?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There have been quite a few audits over the years, before Google did its
stuff. <span>SUSE</span> did one, and the Mozilla foundation sponsored one. The
Google people used fuzzing to find the holes that had been missed by the
audits - it’s very&nbsp;impressive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Has the  recent security news changed the development process&nbsp;any?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I plan to use Google’s service to do ongoing fuzzing of new&nbsp;releases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anything significant on the dnsmasq road map? Are there additions that could
be done, or do you cover all of the <span>DNS</span>/<span>DHCP</span> spec&nbsp;now?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t cover the whole spec - the <span>USP</span> [ed. note: Unique Selling Point] is to cover the bits that my
users need, without carrying the bloat of everything else. I guess that
new stuff is still likely in the area of IPv6 address/name management.
IPv6 will take over the world one day, won’t&nbsp;it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[ed. note: We&nbsp;hope.]</p>
<p>Do you have a Patreon, Flattr, or other funding source to which people could&nbsp;contribute?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have a PayPal account at simon@thekelleys.org.uk. Contributions
happily&nbsp;accepted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks again! I hope our paths will cross some&nbsp;day!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I hope that’s useful. Please feel free to come back with more questions,
or for clarifications on the&nbsp;answers.</p>

    <p>In the book Winning, the legendary General Electric CEO Jack Welch defines his rules of leadership:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule 3: Leaders get into everyone’s skin, exuding positive energy and optimism…your job as a leader is to fight the gravitational pull of negativism. That doesn’t mean you sugarcoat the challenges your team faces. It means you display an energizing, can-do attitude about overcoming them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I couldn’t agree more. How many truly optimistic managers do you see on a day to day basis?  Not people that are so over-leveraged that fear pushes them to hope everything works out. Not people who ignore hard truths and escape into a good Spotify playlist.</p>

<p>Optimistic managers. Managers who see the world for what it is - a never-ending grind full of challenges, bad-breaks, luck, let-downs, inspirations, and everything in between - and approach it with a consistently positive energy and will to make things work.</p>

<p>The answer: not enough. Here are some ways you can uplevel your optimism.</p>

<p>To be optimistic, don’t:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Commiserate regularly with your reports. Commiseration is a little forfeit, every time. As a leader, you shouldn’t be signalling that the way to react to adversity is to lament. The film Saving Private Ryan calls this out beautifully: “Gripes only go up the chain of command, never down. Privates gripe to sergeants, sergeants gripe to captains, captains gripe to majors, majors gripe to colonels and colonels gripe to generals. Gripes always go up, never down.”</li>
  <li>Otherize other teams in the org. Or more bluntly: don’t talk shit about other teams. They might not be perfect, but neither are you. Otherizing only makes it harder to find the path forward.</li>
  <li>Pretend like everything is great. Again, optimism isn’t about pretending things are great. It’s a commitment to framing things as challenges to be solved, not problems to be lamented.</li>
</ul>

<p>To be optimistic, do:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Have a never-ending well of persistence. You might feel like Sisyphus pushing that boulder up the hill day in and day out. Optimistic people understand that most of one’s work life is pushing boulders up hills and have a good attitude about it.</li>
  <li>Get over things. If you can’t reset your opinion on people, problems, slights, and all other things to an absolute neutral, you’ll be saddled with a distracting and deteriorating buildup of resentment. Learn to get over things completely.</li>
  <li>Commit. If you’re second guessing yourself every step of the way you’ll never be able to sustain optimism. Set some timeframe for re-evaluation - maybe 6 months or a year - and then forget about anything that sounds like “maybe”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Optimism isn’t a feeling that puffs your lungs up with rejuvenating life and leads to transcendent moments of inspiration. It’s removing the friction that your ego and backbone want to instinctively introduce when faced with challenges. It’s a way to move forward.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>Lately, I’ve been playing around with inventing a visual writing system for lambda calculus.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">Lambda calculus</a> (λ-calculus) is a sort of proto-functional-programming, originally invented by Alonzo Church while he was trying to solve <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entscheidungsproblem">the same problem</a> that led Turing to invent Turing machines. It’s another way of reasoning about computation.</p>

<p>Python’s lambda is an idea that was borrowed from λ-calculus. In Python, you can use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html#lambda-expressions">lambda expression</a> like the following in order to define a function that returns the square of a number:</p>



<p>In λ-calculus, the idea is the same: we create a function by using <code>λ</code> to specify which arguments a function takes in, then we give an expression for the function’s return value. Pure lambda calculus doesn’t include operators of any sort –&nbsp;just functions being applied to other functions –&nbsp;so if we try to write a <code>square</code> function, we have to suppose that <code>multiply</code> is a function of two variables that has already been defined:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>square = λx. multiply x x
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>square</code> function, once defined, can be applied to arguments and evaluated into something simpler.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>square 4 = (λx. multiply x x) 4
         = multiply 4 4
         = 16
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One of the cool things about lambda calculus is that we can represent most common programming abstractions using λ-calculus, even though it’s nothing but functions: numbers, arithmetic, booleans, lists, if statements, loops, recursion… the list goes on. Before I introduce the visual writing system I’ve been using, let’s take a detour and discuss how we can represent numbers and arithmetic using lambda calculus.</p>

<h2 id="church-numerals-in-lambda-calculus">Church numerals, in lambda calculus</h2>
<p>Alonzo Church figured out how to represent numbers as lambda functions; these numbers are referred to as Church numerals.</p>

<p>We can represent any nonnegative integer as long as we have two things: (1) a value for <strong>zero</strong>, and (2) a <strong>successor</strong> function, which returns <code>n + 1</code> for any number <code>n</code>. To represent numbers as functions, then, we require that <code>z</code> (zero) and <code>s</code> (successor) be passed in as arguments, and go from there. Each number is actually secretly a function of those two inputs.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>zero = λs. λz. z
one = λs. λz. s z
two = λs. λz. s (s z)
three = λs. λz. s (s (s z))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The actual details of how to implement zero and successor should be implemented as are left as someone else’s problem — we can survive without them. All we care about is that our numbers do the right thing, given whatever zero and successor someone may provide.</p>

<p>What about <strong>addition</strong>? Addition is a function that takes in two numbers (let’s call them <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>), and produces a number representing their sum. To sum them together, we’ll want to produce a number that applies <code>s</code>, the successor function, a total of <code>x + y</code> times. For example, we could first apply it <code>y</code> times to the zero, then apply it <code>x</code> more times to that result.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>plus = λx. λy. (λs. λz. x s (y s z))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s try proving that one plus one equals two. In λ-calculus, this proof looks like the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>one = λs. λz. s z
two = λs. λz. s (s z)

plus = λx. λy. (λs. λz. x s (y s z))

plus one one = (λx. λy. (λs. λz. x s (y s z))) one one
             = λs. λz. one s (one s z)
             = λs. λz. (λs. λz. s z) s (one s z)
             = λs. λz. s (one s z)
             = λs. λz. s ((λs. λz. s z) s z)
             = λs. λz. s (s z)
             = two
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(Long, but at least conciser than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica">Bertrand Russell’s</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="lambda-circuitry">Lambda circuitry</h2>

<p>There are a lot of lambdas, parentheses, and arguments being pushed around in that proof. Mentally matching up parentheses is annoying. Scope is especially annoying: which <code>s</code> am I looking at again in <code>λs. λz. (λs. λz. s z) s (one s z)</code>, the inner one or the outer one?</p>

<p>A linear string of lambdas and parentheses is an ineffective way to provide intuition for the computations that are taking place. This problem isn’t unique to lambda calculus, either; consider trying to represent a binary tree using a linear string:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Node(2, Node(7, Leaf(2), Node(6, Leaf(5), Leaf(11))), Node(5, None, Node(9, Leaf(4), None)))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unambiguous, but not very intuitive. Contrast that representation with the diagram we use when we’re trying to explain that same binary tree at a chalkboard, a more visual notation:</p>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Binary_tree.svg/288px-Binary_tree.svg.png" alt="Binary tree diagram, from Wikipedia"></p>

<p><em>Image from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Binary_tree.svg">Wikipedia</a>.</em></p>

<p>I remember programming constructs better when I can reason about them visually like this: when I imagine cutting an array in half for binary search, when I imagine pointers in a linked list being shuffled around to insert a new element, and when I imagine traversing up and down the branches of a binary tree.</p>

<p>Why can’t lambda calculus get some visual intuitions, in the same way? Lambda calculus is a dance of variables flowing through and being manipulated by functions, and I want a writing system for lambda calculus that will visually display this dance. It shouldn’t look like strings of parentheses and symbols: it should create visual intuition.</p>

<p>After some trial and error, here is the system I came up with. I aimed for something that would resemble circuitry.</p>

<p><strong>Values</strong> flow along wires, where they may be passed in as arguments to functions or applied as functions themselves. Some are inputs, some are outputs.</p>

<p><strong>Functions</strong> are represented as boxes which are applied to their inputs on one side and produce a single output on the other. The notation must indicate which function is applied; this may either be drawn within the box itself, or wired in to the middle of the box from some other value.</p>

<p><strong>Arguments</strong> are represented as inputs, coming in from the right side of the diagram; these arguments might pass through functions, or they might be functions-to-apply themselves. If an argument has not been passed in yet, it’s an empty arrow beginning a wire; if an argument has been passed in, its value is attached to the wire. Arguments are always passed in from top to bottom, in order.</p>

<p>As an example, here’s a function which takes in two functions, <code>f</code> and <code>g</code>, then a value <code>x</code>, and returns <code>f (g x)</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-f-g-x.png" alt="lambda f. lambda g. lambda x. f (g x)"></p>

<p>As another example, here’s the M combinator <code>M = λx. x x</code> (the “mockingbird” in <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A1P096Y"><em>To Mock a Mockingbird</em></a>):</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/m-combinator.png" alt="lambda x. x x"></p>

<h2 id="church-numerals-in-lambda-circuitry">Church numerals, in lambda circuitry</h2>

<p>Here’s the Church numeral <code>four = λs. λz. s (s (s (s z)))</code>, drawn out in lambda circuitry:</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-four.png" alt="Four, in lambda circuitry"></p>

<p>Let’s take that proof from earlier that one plus one is two. What does it look like to draw that proof in lambda circuitry, instead?</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-oneplusoneistwo.png" alt="Proof that one plus one is two, in lambda circuitry"></p>

<p>∎</p>

<p>We could also consider <strong>multiplication</strong>. A multiply function would take in two numbers, m and n, and computes a new number which is their product. In lambda calculus, we’d write:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>multiply = λm. λn. λs. λz. m (n s) z
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the notation of lambda circuitry, this looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-multiply.png" alt="Multiplication function, in lambda circuitry"></p>

<p>Using this function, we can check that <code>multiply 2 3</code> evaluates to <code>6</code>:</p>

<h2 id="sidenote-de-bruijn-indices">Sidenote: De Bruijn indices</h2>
<p>One of the nice things about lambda circuitry is that it completely removes the need for variable names.</p>

<p>There’s another notation for lambda calculus that does this too: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_index"><em>De Bruijn indices</em></a>. A lambda expression written with De Bruijn indices indicates which variables are used where with a positive integer; the smaller the integer, the more recently the argument it refers to was passed in.</p>

<p>For example, the identity function <code>λx. x</code> may be written with De Bruijn indices like so:</p>



<p>The Church numeral for two, <code>λs. λz. s (s z)</code>, may be written like so:</p>



<p>The addition function, <code>λx. λy. (λs. λz. x s (y s z))</code>, may be written like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>plus = λ λ (λ λ 4 2 (3 2 1))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An evaluation of <code>plus one one</code> looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>plus one one = (λ λ (λ λ 4 2 (3 2 1))) (λ λ 2 1) (λ λ 2 1)
             = (λ (λ λ (λ λ 2 1) 2 (3 2 1))) (λ λ 2 1)
             = λ λ (λ λ 2 1) 2 ((λ λ 2 1) 2 1)
             = λ λ (λ λ 2 1) 2 (2 1)
             = λ λ 2 (2 1)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One of the tricky things about writing a lambda calculus interpreter is getting the renaming rules right; De Bruijn indices are convenient because they remove the need for this. Lambda circuitry is similar in spirit to De Bruijn indices in that it doesn’t require variable names at all, but instead indicates which variables are passed where by connecting values directly to an arrow indicating when they were passed in.</p>

<h2 id="argument-switching-function-in-lambda-circuitry">Argument-switching function, in lambda circuitry</h2>

<p>I’ll provide more examples just to further demonstrate how the notation works in different situations. Let’s consider the “argument-switching” function <code>C</code>, where <code>C f x y</code> returns <code>f y x</code>. (This is actually the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B,C,K,W_system">C combinator</a>.)</p>



<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator.png" alt="C combinator"></p>

<p>Suppose we try applying this to a silly function <code>f</code> where <code>f x y</code> discards <code>y</code> and just returns <code>x</code>. Then, <code>C f</code> should switch around <code>f</code>‘s arguments and create a function which returns <code>y</code> instead. Let’s check:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>f = λx. λy. x

C f = λf. λx. λy. (f y x) f
    = λx. λy. f y x
    = λx. λy. (λx. λy. x) y x
    = λx. λy. y
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-f.png" alt="f = lambda x. lambda y. x"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-f-1.png" alt="C(f), step 1"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-f-2.png" alt="C(f), step 2"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-f-3.png" alt="C(f), step 3"></p>

<p>∎</p>

<p>We could also try a function <code>g</code> where <code>g x y</code> returns <code>x y</code>. Then <code>C g x y</code> should return <code>y x</code>. Let’s check:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>g = λx. λy. x y

C g x y = λf. λx. λy. (f y x) g x y
        = g y x
        = (λx. λy. x y) y x
        = y x
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-g.png" alt="g = lambda x. lambda y. x(y)"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-g-1.png" alt="C(g), step 1"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-g-2.png" alt="C(g), step 2"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-g-3.png" alt="C(g), step 3"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-g-4.png" alt="C(g), step 4"></p>

<p>∎</p>

<p><em>Exercise</em>: Show that applying <code>C</code> twice reverses it. That is, show that <code>C (C f)</code> returns <code>f</code>, for any <code>f</code>.
(Note that <code>C f</code> is a function which takes in two arguments, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, and returns <code>f y x</code>. Applying <code>C</code> only to <code>f</code> like this is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_application">partial application</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="prior-work">Prior work</h2>
<p>There are some other systems that give visual intuition to lambda calculus.</p>

<p><a href="http://dkeenan.com/Lambda/"><em>To Dissect a Mockingbird</em></a> describes a notation that is actually very similar to the one I’ve described, and demonstrates it on various problems from <em>To Mock a Mockingbird</em>. I like the way this looks, especially how every function is enclosed by two halves of a circle which make it obvious how that function might be applied. My notation doesn’t have this feature, but requires drawing fewer enclosing boxes as a result.</p>

<p>Visual Lambda (<a href="https://code.google.com/p/visual-lambda/">code</a>, <a href="http://bntr.planet.ee/lambda/visual_lambda_bubble_notation.gif">basics</a>, <a href="http://bntr.planet.ee/lambda/work/visual_lambda.pdf">paper</a>) represents lambda expressions as colored bubbles, and provides an interface for manipulating them.</p>

<p><a href="http://worrydream.com/AlligatorEggs/">Alligator Eggs</a> is a description of a puzzle game based on lambda calculus, which also happens to provide a visual way of working with and evaluating lambda expressions.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>
  Everybody loves remote work until it’s time to get promoted.
  </p>
  <p>
  In 2015, Stanford economist Nicholas Bloom conducted a <a href="https://nbloom.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj4746/f/wfh.pdf">work from home experiment</a> in China with Ctrip, a 16,000-employee, NASDAQ-listed Chinese travel agency.
  </p>
  <p>
  The study found that remote workers had a 13 percent performance increase over onsite employees as well as better work satisfaction and lower turnover. 
  </p>
  <p>
  But the study also found that remote workers were still about <em>50 percent less likely</em> to get a performance-based promotion than the onsite employees. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Focus group interviews reveal how supervisors did not notice home-based employees’ performance as much and were less likely to promote them. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Another reason behind reduced promotion rates might be that WFH employees lack opportunities to develop the interpersonal skills to succeed in managerial jobs. 
  </p>
  <p>
  If you’re not taking the opportunity to communicate <a href="https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/howtobragatwork">your progress</a>, then people may equate your lack of presence with a lack of skill. 
  </p>
  <p>
  A substantial amount of the remote workers in the study returned to the office once given the choice. This was done to avoid what they perceived as a WFH promotion ‘discrimination’ penalty. 
  </p>
  <h2>Out Of Sight, Out Of Mind</h2>
  
  
  <p>
  The above highlights the important difference between <em>remote first </em>companies and <em>remote friendly </em>companies. 
  </p>
  <p>
  At remote first companies like Gitlab and Buffer, everyone works remotely. These companies have specific communication protocols in place and the appropriate documentation needed to succeed in such an environment. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The promotion worries, though, tend to arise when you work at a remote friendly company. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Remote friendly companies treat remote as a <em>perk</em>. It’s not the status quo and is still treated as a privilege. 
  </p>
  <center>
    <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_promotionremote/friendly_first.png" alt="">
  </center>
  <p>
  Sure, moving home to Florida to be closer to your aging parents sounds wonderful, but what happens when your coworkers don’t decide to relocate and continue going into the office?
  </p>
  <p>
  Turns out there’s some more research that looks at exactly this. 
  </p>
  <h2>Passive Face Time</h2>
  
  
  <p>
  A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0018726709353139">study</a> by researchers at UC Davis from 10 years ago coins the term <em>passive face time</em>. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The term doesn’t refer to active interactions with coworkers, but rather to just being seen in the workplace.
  </p>
  <p>
  As long as you’re observed at work, you accumulate passive face time. No one actually needs to know what you’re working on or how well of a job you’re doing. It’s entirely independent of actual performance.
  </p>
  <p>
  The study notes that even when onsite and remote employees are equally productive, supervisors might evaluate them differently because of differences in their passive face time.
  </p>
  <p>
  One of the more interesting findings of the study is that managers seem to interpret passive face time as an indicator of specific traits. So individuals that are credited with more passive face time may be viewed as more responsible, dependable, and committed. Traits that you’d directly correlate with promotion. 
  </p>
  <center>
    <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_promotionremote/graph.png" alt="">
  </center>
  <p>
  The context of passive face time (i.e during regular hours versus outside-of-normal work hours) also appears important to the particular traits that managers assigned to those displaying passive face time. 
  </p>
  <p>
  For example, coming in early to work and leaving 30min before most people leave may help you beat traffic, but from your manager’s perspective that passive face time may be discounted. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Finally, these trait inferences appear to be made subconsciously, without intent or knowledge of the process by the managers. 
  </p>
  <p>
  In an ideal world, yes, you’d be judged purely on performance. But the real world is messy and subject to biases like the above. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The ongoing transition to remote work is still in the honeymoon stage. It’s easy to only look at the tremendous freedom it offers. And also most likely a mistake.  
  </p>
  <h2>Credit</h2>

    <p>Hello and welcome to my Coronavirus Genome Walkthrough.</p>

<p>(Hoping someone comes out with that Vaccine Speedrun soon. This boss battle is really shaping up to be an intense one and we’ll need all the artifacts we can get.)</p>

<p>Here, I aim to provide a <em>mechanistic explanation</em> of the SARS-CoV-2 genome’s syntax and semantics. Let’s investigate what the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome actually does as if reading through code like a compiler, from nucleotides to amino acids all the way to proteins. From the four base pairs all the way up to the completed protein-coated virus, what is a virus like this is actually made of on the concrete, physical level?</p>

<h3 id="understanding-a-full-system">Understanding a Full System</h3>

<p>The underlying purpose of this essay is less about the coronavirus <em>per se</em> and more about how having a small—but functionally complete—piece of viral RNA to analyze gives me a unique opportunity to try to understand a complete self-replicating machine from scratch. This is not a feat that I would have the fortitude to manually replicate with the full human genome, for example—but the coronavirus genome, like the <a href="http://openworm.org/">nematode genome</a>, is small enough that we stand a chance at building a complete understanding. The task is perhaps akin to <a href="https://distill.pub/2018/building-blocks/">interpretability</a>, but for biological systems instead of artificial neural networks.</p>

<p>As a consequence, this essay is not intended to produce epidemiological conclusions; there are plenty of other sources for that! This essay is about fully understanding a biological system at the chemical and physical level.</p>

<h3 id="play-curiosity-and-mechanical-understanding">Play, Curiosity, and Mechanical Understanding</h3>

<p>Throughout this essay, I follow my curiosity in the style of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_play">serious play</a>: if I <a href="https://www.readthesequences.com/Noticing-Confusion-Sequence">notice I’m confused</a> about something, I look into it and explore it until I’m satisfied that I now understand, and that my understanding is <em>a <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/science-mechanisms/#ConMec">mechanical</a> understanding</em>. Things are made of stuff! It turns out that we can understand that stuff!</p>

<p>I may skip over some details that were not confusing to me during my own research, but your journey need not be the same as mine. If you’re confused about something while reading this essay, I encourage you to go and look it up! <a href="http://agentyduck.blogspot.com/2015/06/the-art-of-noticing.html">Notice</a> when your curiosity arises; that’s the meditation. Together, we can <a href="http://samoburja.com/how-to-find-the-frontier-of-knowledge/">learn new things</a>.</p>

<p>This all, at least, has been my intention as I set out to create this piece! As Ken Liu said of his philosophy while translating The Three-Body Problem, “I may not have succeeded, but these were the standards I had in mind as I set about my task.”</p>

<p>Part 1, here, covers just the genome and its translation to proteins. I hope to also write a Part 2 which would cover the structure and function of those proteins, their protein-protein interactions, and the full viral life cycle.</p>

<!--Finally, as you may already be able to tell, this essay also serves as a philosophical manifesto-by-example of how to think concretely about problems in biology. Along the way, I give some of my thoughts about the role of thermodynamics in molecular biology, legibility in complex systems, pedagogy, and the future of computational modeling.-->

<p>Let’s get started.</p>



<p>As a reminder, SARS-CoV-2 is a <em>positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus</em>.</p>



<p>What does this mean we can expect?</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Single-stranded</em>: Its genome is a single strand of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA">RNA</a> (ssRNA).</li>
  <li><em>Positive-sense</em>: That single strand of RNA can be immediately translated into protein by the ribosomes of the cell it infects.</li>
</ol>

<p>From this we can also infer that one of the proteins the virus encodes for must be <em>RNA-dependent RNA polymerase</em> (RdRP), a protein which synthesizes new RNA given an RNA template. That’s right: RNA → RNA. However, according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology">central dogma of molecular biology</a>, isn’t RNA → RNA an unconscionable heresy? Correspondingly, RdRP is not naturally found in cells! All known positive-sense ssRNA viruses therefore <em>must encode</em> RdRP in order to successfully commit this heresy.</p>



<p>…Wait a minute, the phrase “positive-sense ssRNA virus” implies the existence of <em>negative-sense</em> viruses. If those don’t encode their proteins directly, how can they possibly work?</p>

<h2 id="positive-sense-and-negative-sense">Positive sense and negative sense</h2>

<p>Negative-sense ssRNA viruses also exist! Influenza, Ebola, and measles are examples.</p>



<p>The inner contents of <em>negative-sense</em> ssRNA viruses consist not of an RNA genome but of a <em>ribonucleoprotein</em>, which incorporates both an RNA genome as well as a cohort of viral proteins capable of replicating RNA. Unlike positive-sense ssRNA viruses, negative-sense ssRNA viruses must travel with a working copy of their RNA-replicating proteins. This ribonucleoprotein has enzymatic activity!</p>

<h2 id="rdrp-as-drug-target">RdRP as drug target</h2>

<p>Since RdRP has (as far as I know) no legitimate purpose in human cells and is not naturally coded by them, might it offer a potential target for novel antiviral drugs?</p>

<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24102407/">Velkov et al. 2014</a> explores RdRP as a drug target for antivirals against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henipavirus">Hendra virus</a>, a negative-sense ssRNA virus, though I am unable to find the full text.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This review examines the current knowledge based on the multi-domain architecture of the Hendra RdRP and highlights which essential domain functions represent tangible targets for drug development against this deadly disease.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There must be some reason that developing antivirals against this protein is technically (or socially) complicated, or I’d have expected us to do it by now – there are a lot of RNA viruses that this drug target could theoretically hit. Flagging this discrepancy for further research.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup></p>



<p>Back to SARS-CoV-2! First, let’s get us a genome. Obviously this virus has seen some mutations as it’s spread around, as you can explore at <a href="https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global">NextStrain</a>, so we’ve technically got choices as to which one to analyze. For this thread I’ll just stick to analyzing <em>one</em> version of the genome: Wuhan-Hu-1.</p>

<p>As a reminder, each <code>A</code>, <code>G</code>, <code>C</code>, and <code>T</code> in a genome is one of the four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide">nucleotides</a>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenine">adenine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine">guanine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosine">cytosine</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymine">thymine</a>. There are actually <a href="https://www.scripps.edu/romesberg/publications.html">plenty of ways to engineer</a> different <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22850726/">unnatural base pair systems</a> by adding <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6429/884">artificial nucleotides</a>, and these can even be integrated into <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/98/9/4922">transcription</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24659">translation</a>, but <a href="https://carlbrannen.wordpress.com/2007/06/13/why-does-dna-only-use-4-nucleotides/">for</a> <a href="https://dreamerbiologist.wordpress.com/2013/02/16/why-did-nature-settle-on-just-four-nucleotides/">whatever</a> <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/32/E6476">reason</a>, these four <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07389-2">and not others</a> are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3331698/">what life ultimately ended up with</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/nucleotides.png"></p>
<p><small>The four nucleotides in DNA.</small></p>

<p>The genome of Wuhan-Hu-1 is available from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.3">NCBI GenBank</a>. Since SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, each <code>T</code> in this string technically represents a <code>U</code>, for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uracil">uracil</a>, RNA’s information-equivalent of thymine. The genome sequence is therefore:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>1     AUUAAAGGUU UAUACCUUCC CAGGUAACAA ACCAACCAAC UUUCGAUCUC UUGUAGAUCU
61    GUUCUCUAAA CGAACUUUAA AAUCUGUGUG GCUGUCACUC GGCUGCAUGC UUAGUGCACU
121   CACGCAGUAU AAUUAAUAAC UAAUUACUGU CGUUGACAGG ACACGAGUAA CUCGUCUAUC

</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a target="blank" href="https://benchling.com/s/seq-28k9llmwnY475iv7ogwF/edit">Follow along with the genome »</a></p>

<p>That’s 29,903 nucleotides. Since there are only four possible nucleotides, we can estimate the information compression value of each nucleotide at approximately 2 bits; the virus’s genome therefore requires only 7.5 kilobytes to store. That’s roughly as much data, byte for byte, as there are characters in this essay up to this point!</p>

29881 AAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAA AAA
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><a target="blank" href="https://benchling.com/s/seq-28k9llmwnY475iv7ogwF/edit">Follow along with the genome »</a></p>

<p>It’s… yelling at us? Is it… suffering? Should we <a href="https://reducing-suffering.org/is-there-suffering-in-fundamental-physics/">help</a>?</p>

<p>Simple: It’s a <a href="https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/questions/11227/why-does-the-sars-cov2-coronavirus-genome-end-in-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa">3’ poly-A tail</a>! This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyadenylation">long tail of adenosine monomers</a> is extremely common in both our own cells and in RNA viruses.</p>

<p>Our own messenger RNA (mRNA) has a poly-A tail when it’s freshly produced in the nucleus so as to slow its degradation by the cell, allowing it to last long enough to be transcribed into protein. Naturally, if you’re a positive-strand RNA virus, you’re also going to want to last long enough to be transcribed into protein – so, you need the same feature, yourself.</p>

<p>Genome 0.11% explained. So far so good!</p>

<h2 id="5-cap">5’ cap</h2>

<p>While we’re discussing chemical features of mRNA, note that the viral genome presumably must also have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-prime_cap">5’ cap</a> – an extra <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7-Methylguanosine">7-methylguanosine</a> at the 5’ end of its RNA strand – just like mRNAs do.</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/5primecap.png"></p>
<p><small>A 5' cap, consisting of a 7-methylguanosine as well as methylation of the first two ribose sugars.</small></p>

<p>The cap is not directly shown in the viral genome sequence or mentioned in NCBI GenBank, but it is referenced in multiple papers discussing coronaviral genomes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since 2003, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus has drawn increased attention and stimulated numerous studies on the molecular virology of coronaviruses. Here, we review the current understanding of the mechanisms adopted by coronaviruses to produce the 5′-cap structure and methylation modification of viral genomic RNAs.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p>Coronaviruses possess a cap structure at the 5′ ends of viral genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs, which is generated through consecutive methylations by virally encoded guanine-N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) and 2′-O-methyltransferase (2′-O-MTase). The coronaviral N7-MTase is unique for its physical linkage with an exoribonuclease (ExoN) harbored in nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) of coronaviruses.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p>Here, we have reconstituted complete SARS-CoV mRNA cap methylation <em>in vitro</em>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Like the poly-A tail, the 5’ cap helps the genome to be recognized and translated by ribosomes rather than destroyed by the cell’s immune response.</p>

<p>How does the virus even ensure that it receives a 5’ cap and a poly-A tail, not to mention its outer coat? Hopefully these questions will be resolved by our review of its genes and proteins… let’s move on to look at those!</p>



<p>Per the “Features” section of the genome, again from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.3">NCBI GenBank</a>, here are the identifiable genes in this genome, in order:</p>

<p><strong>AWS KMS</strong> is a <strong>K</strong>ey <strong>M</strong>anagement <strong>S</strong>ervice that let you create Cryptographic keys that you can use to encrypt and decrypt data and also other keys. You can read more about it <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/overview.html">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="important-points-about-keys">Important points about Keys</h3>
<p>Please note that the CMK generated can only be used to encrypt small amount of data like passwords, RSA key. You can use AWS KMS customer master keys (CMKs) to generate, encrypt, and decrypt data keys. However, AWS KMS does not store, manage, or track your data keys, or perform cryptographic operations with data keys. You must use and manage data keys outside of AWS KMS. KMS API uses AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) in the encryption operations and they cannot accept more than 4 KB (4096 bytes) of data. To encrypt application data, use the server-side encryption features of an AWS service, or a client-side encryption library, such as the AWS Encryption SDK or the Amazon S3 encryption client.</p>
<h3 id="scenario">Scenario</h3>
<p>We want to create signup and login forms for a website.Passwords should be encrypted and stored in dynamobDB database. </p>
<h3 id="what-do-we-need-">What do we need?</h3>
<ol>
<li>KMS key to encrypt and decrypt data</li>
<li>DynamoDB table to store password.</li>
<li>Lamdba functions &amp; APIs to process Login and Sign up forms.

</ol>
<h3 id="lets-implement-it-as-serverless-appication-model-sam-">Lets Implement it as Serverless Appication Model (SAM)!</h3>
<p>Lets first create the Key that we will use to encrypt and decrypt password.</p>
<pre><code>KmsKey:
    Type: AWS::KMS::Key
    Properties: 
      Description: CMK for encrypting and decrypting
      KeyPolicy:
        Version: '2012-10-17'
        Id: key-default-1
        Statement:

<p>The important thing in above snippet is the KeyPolicy. KMS requires a Key Administrator and Key User. As a best practice your Key Administrator and Key User should be 2 separate user in your Organisation. We are allowing all permissions to the root users.  So if your key Administrator leaves the organisation, the root user will be able to delete this key. As you can see KeyAdmin can manage the key but not use it and KeyUser can only use the key. <em>${KeyAdmin}</em> and <em>${KeyUser}</em> are parameters in the SAM template. You would be asked to provide values for these parameters during SAM Deploy. </p>
<pre><code>Parameters:
  KeyAdmin:
    Type: String
  KeyUser:
    Type: String
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images-rajanpanchal.net/kms/parameters.jpg" alt="SAM parameters">
Next, we will create DynamoDB table. The partition key will be user id. This is enough. You can additional attributes as required.</p>
<pre><code>myDynamoDBTable: 
    Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table
    Properties: 
      BillingMode: PAY_PER_REQUEST 
      AttributeDefinitions: 
        - 
          AttributeName: "userid"
          AttributeType: "S"

      KeySchema: 
        - 
          AttributeName: "userid"
          KeyType: "HASH"
</code></pre>
<p>Now, lets create the API and Lamdba handler that will process the Signup and Login requests.</p>
<pre><code>ApiGatewaySignupApi:
    Type: AWS::Serverless::Api
    Properties:
      StageName: Prod
    Auth:
     UsagePlan:
      CreateUsagePlan: PER_API
      Description: Usage plan for this API

          keyid: !Ref KmsKey
      CodeUri: Lambda/
      Handler: signup.lambda_handler
      Runtime: python3.8
      Policies:

      Events:
        getCounter:
          Type: Api
          Properties:
            Path: /login
            Method: POST
            RestApiId: !Ref ApiGatewayLoginApi
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we are creating 2 Lamdba handlers, one that handles singup and other handles the login. We are limiting the usage of API under <em>Auth</em> property. This is to prevent abuse of our API. We are setting two environment variables, one for database table name and another for KMS key name. We are not hard-coding the table/key names instead we let cloud formation to name it and we set it as environment variables with auto generated values. This will prevent name conflicts of resources and you can run multiple versions of your whole cloud environment. Then we set policy that allow Lamdba to access dynamoDB and the key.  You can find 'out of box' SAM policy templates <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-policy-templates.html">here</a>.With <em>Events</em>, we create the API Gateway resources.
The final part of SAM template is Output section.</p>
<pre><code>Outputs:
  ApiGatewaySignupApi:
    Description: "API Gateway endpoint URL for Prod stage for Hello World function"
    Value: !Sub "https://${ApiGatewaySignupApi}.execute-api.${AWS::Region}.amazonaws.com/Prod/signup/"
  SignupFunction:
    Description: "Sign Up Lambda Function ARN"
    Value: !GetAtt SignupFunction.Arn
  ApiGatewayLoginApi:
    Description: "API Gateway endpoint URL for Prod stage for Hello World function"
    Value: !Sub "https://${ApiGatewayLoginApi}.execute-api.${AWS::Region}.amazonaws.com/Prod/login/"
  LoginFunction:
    Description: "Login Lambda Function ARN"
    Value: !GetAtt LoginFunction.Arn
</code></pre>
<p>We output 2 important urls in above section, <em>ApiGatewayLoginApi</em> and <em>ApiGatewaySignupApi</em>,  We use these Urls in the frontend HTML form's <em>action</em> attribute. See below:</p>

<p>The first two statements are logging statements, this is useful in debugging and the log statements will be logged in CloudWatch logs. The <em>parse_qs</em> module is used to read the form data from <em>event</em> object. Data are returned as a dictionary. The dictionary keys are the unique query variable names and the values are lists of values for each name. …</p></div></div>

            <!-- content --><p>Despite the “death of the mainframe” being a headline for many years, IBM is still making new generations of mainframes. Large customers running mission-critical workloads still want this level of technology, and pay top dollar for it. The latest IBM Z15 mainframe shows just how awesome the design of these systems gets. We get to cover this at Hot Chips 32 (2020.) We are going to update this piece as new details emerge over the talk. <span id="more-46268"></span></p>
<h2>IBM Z15 Mainframe Overview</h2>
<p>A mainframe is designed differently than we see typical commodity x86 servers in many aspects. One of them is simply the way the processor complexes are constructed and delivered. A great example of this is how there is a system control chip shared between processors with a massive L4 cache. Abstracting this a bit, it is somewhat analogous to how AMD EPYC 7002 “Rome” is constructed with a chip that has a shared last-level cache. Then again, IBM z15 is bigger.</p>

<p>One of the cooler features here is that the processor chip runs at 5.2GHz on 14nm process. These are not like mainstream processors so IBM has a lot more leeway in terms of higher TDP levels and cooling methodology. The IBM z15 is the company’s second 14nm part like the z14. As one can see, IBM is following Intel in sticking on 14nm longer than other nodes.</p>

<p>We are going to note, that we covered <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ibm-power10-searching-for-the-holy-grail-of-compute/">IBM POWER10</a> earlier today.</p>
<h2>IBM z15 Drawer Level Design Overview</h2>
<p>Within the IBM Z15, processors are not designed to operate alone. Instead, there are up to four processor chips per drawer. Each drawer also has a system control chip with the L4 last level cache and to handle an interconnect. One can get up to five drawers.</p>
<figure id="attachment_46271" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-46271"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ibm-z15-mainframe-processor-design/hot-chips-32-ibm-z15-drawer-and-system-topology/" rel="attachment wp-att-46271"><img src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Drawer-and-System-Topology.jpg" alt="Hot Chips 32 IBM Z15 Drawer And System Topology" width="940" height="591" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Drawer-and-System-Topology.jpg 940w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Drawer-and-System-Topology-400x251.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Drawer-and-System-Topology-800x503.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Drawer-and-System-Topology-696x438.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Drawer-and-System-Topology-668x420.jpg 668w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-46271">Hot Chips 32 IBM Z15 Drawer And System Topology</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is a view of what the chipset and drawer look like:</p>

<p>On the top we have I/O above that system controller chip. Overall, this allows for up to 240 cores, 40TB of memory, and 60x PCIe x16 cards in the complete system.</p>
<h2>IBM z15 Processor Design Overview</h2>
<p>Each IBM z15 processor chip can have up to 12 cores. These cores have 4MB L2 cache and 256MB of shared L3 cache. IBM increasing a lot of the microarchitectural features versus the previous 14nm z14 design.</p>

<p>As one may imagine, IBM has a deep pipeline that is designed to operate at very high frequencies. Compared to Intel that is using much lower frequencies on its <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/intel-ice-lake-sp-next-gen-xeon-architecture-at-hc32/">Intel Ice Lake-SP Next-Gen Xeon Architecture</a>, IBM is using fewer cores that run at higher frequencies yet that still do a lot of work per core.</p>

<p>Another feature of the design is the new accelerators. One is the integrated deflate accelerator:</p>
<figure id="attachment_46275" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-46275"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ibm-z15-mainframe-processor-design/hot-chips-32-ibm-z15-integrated-deflate-accelerator/" rel="attachment wp-att-46275"><img src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Integrated-Deflate-Accelerator.jpg" alt="Hot Chips 32 IBM Z15 Integrated Deflate Accelerator" width="1487" height="902" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Integrated-Deflate-Accelerator.jpg 1487w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Integrated-Deflate-Accelerator-400x243.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Integrated-Deflate-Accelerator-800x485.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Integrated-Deflate-Accelerator-696x422.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Integrated-Deflate-Accelerator-1068x648.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Integrated-Deflate-Accelerator-692x420.jpg 692w" sizes="(max-width: 1487px) 100vw, 1487px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-46275">Hot Chips 32 IBM Z15 Integrated Deflate Accelerator</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is a hybrid LZ encoder and compressor. Compressing data helps the systems various memory and storage hierarchies be used more efficiently. With hardware-acceleration, these features can be added with less overhead. That hardware accelerator was previously a FPGA. That means the clock speed has gone from a few hundred megahertz to 5GHz+.</p>

<p>Since many of these systems are used at banks and other financial institutions, cryptography is another key feature of the z15.</p>

<p>IBM z15 has modulo arithmetic (ECC) acceleration built-in. This increases performance which means that this encryption can be used with minimal overhead.</p>
<figure id="attachment_46277" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-46277"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ibm-z15-mainframe-processor-design/hot-chips-32-ibm-z15-processor-modulo-arithmetic-ecc-acceleration-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-46277"><img src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Processor-Modulo-Arithmetic-ECC-Acceleration-2.jpg" alt="Hot Chips 32 IBM Z15 Processor Modulo Arithmetic ECC Acceleration 2" width="1498" height="956" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Processor-Modulo-Arithmetic-ECC-Acceleration-2.jpg 1498w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Processor-Modulo-Arithmetic-ECC-Acceleration-2-400x255.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Processor-Modulo-Arithmetic-ECC-Acceleration-2-800x511.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Processor-Modulo-Arithmetic-ECC-Acceleration-2-696x444.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Processor-Modulo-Arithmetic-ECC-Acceleration-2-1068x682.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Processor-Modulo-Arithmetic-ECC-Acceleration-2-658x420.jpg 658w" sizes="(max-width: 1498px) 100vw, 1498px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-46277">Hot Chips 32 IBM Z15 Processor Modulo Arithmetic ECC Acceleration 2</figcaption></figure>
<p>Something we wanted to highlight on this slide is that the 11.4x-21.8x speedup is for the on-chip z15 accelerator versus the “z14 using a Crypto Express6 PCI accelerator.” That frees up expansion slots for other uses while also increasing performance.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>We are unlikely to review a z15 at STH. Still, seeing this awesome hardware is always interesting. Hopefully, our readers will enjoy the quick look at the IBM z15.</p>

Although lay audiences like to <em>guess</em> at methods (more on that later), magicians <em>analyse</em> tricks to reverse engineer them, and this is part of the fun magicians experience.</li></ol><p>A magician to magician trick therefore succeeds best when it is a “magician fooler”.  It does so in two ways.</p><p>First, the audience magicians enjoy exhausting their magical knowledge.  They feel smart, but challenged applying their expertise to reverse engineer another’s efforts at creating something new and cutting edge.  The fact they failed, can be invigorating, affirming that there is more to learn!</p><p>Second, because the audience magicians understand method they are no longer able to experience <em>effect</em>; doing something that allows them to be fooled again creates a very rare experience, and huge value.  It satiates a need.</p><p>Tech is no different.  Engineer to engineer presentations / applications of technology are designed to wow on the basis of their technical complexity and ingenuity’ to create a FOMO that one engineer has mastered or discovered something another has not, and sometimes push debate and enquiry.</p><h4>Magician to muggle tricks</h4><p>For lay audience tricks, everything is effect. But wait, don’t audiences love guessing the methods of a magician’s tricks?</p><p>Of course they do, but don’t confuse audience enjoyment <em>guessing</em> secrets vs. having them revealed.</p><blockquote><p>Audiences <em>want</em> the secret, but <em>need</em> the effect.  <br></p><p>If you give them the secret, there is <em>no</em> effect.</p></blockquote><figure><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="603" src="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prestige-secret.jpg" alt="The Prestige - They'll beg you and they'll flatter you for the secret - Alfred Borden

The greatest magicians seek out, voraciously study and obsessively practice methods.  They also test, test, test them on audiences, improving them or changing them over time.</p><p>But they do so, guided by effect.</p><p>They are seeking the best method, or combination of methods, that produce the best effect.  In many cases, this will be the method or methods that allow most room for <em>presentation</em> and <em>execution</em>.</p><p>These two factors – presentation and execution – are what separate dull from good and good from incredible, even if the underlying trick, plot or method is identical between two magicians.</p><p>In other words, attention on the audience’s needs and experience.

But not easy</h4><p>In the 2006 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Nolan">Christopher Nolan</a> film, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482571/">The Prestige</a>, chronicling two rival magicians there is a central magic trick.  Not only is this a real trick, but it also doubles up as the central plot twist.</p><p>Without spoiling the film, this conceit is – as the magician Borden puts it – incredibly simple, but not easy.</p><p>Indeed, a central plot point is the failure of the rival magician to comprehend that the first magician’s effect (i.e. product) could be achieved so simply, instead obsessing over unnecesary, dangerous and overly complex technological innovations to achieve the same effect.</p><p>And this is a key lesson.</p><p>Too often, magicians and technologists obsess over the complex, and disregard simpler alternatives.  The allure of the complex is also a risk for users and innovators in their organisations.  If you’ve ever heard someone say “we should get an AI” or “can we use some AI” when what they need is a simple Word macro you know what we mean.</p><p>But this isn’t to say simple is easy.</p><p>Often simple done well is just as hard as clever, but for different reasons.</p><p>Simple enables thinking space to focus on execution against needs.</p><p>In magic this is mostly presentation. In technology this is the product-market fit, UX, whether or not your solution solves a real and significant problem for your users and so on.</p><h4>Check your geek</h4><p>As a result, the best technologists and start-ups keep abreast of new ideas, experiment with them but importantly <strong>check their geek</strong>.  They weigh up, often with others (product specialists, users and so on), what <em>best</em> solves the user’s problem.</p><p>In most cases, best isn’t cleverest or the most cutting edge shiny new thing.  It might be, but it often isn’t or if it is, it is one variable in a much larger equation that must not distract from solving the problem.</p><p>Which leads nicely into…</p><h4>Don’t forget what you have / know</h4><p>Magicians are famously greedy, gobbling up new tricks as they launch.  The best magicians keep this in check, often preferring to perfect existing techniques rather than chase the latest shiny object.</p><p>Technology is no different.</p><p>During the Space Race, Nasa invested millions designing an over engineered pen that could write in zero gravity where, it was assumed, ink would not flow toward the nib.  Russia simply gave its Cosmonauts standard pencils, which work on earth as they do in zero G.  Same result: hugely different costs.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="863" height="1024" src="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/spacepen-863x1024.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/spacepen-863x1024.jpg 863w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/spacepen-253x300.jpg 253w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/spacepen-768x911.jpg 768w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/spacepen-585x694.jpg 585w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/spacepen.jpg 910w" sizes="(max-width: 863px) 100vw, 863px" data-src="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/spacepen-863x1024.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption>© <a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/saga-writing-space">Smithsonian National Air &amp; Space Museum</a></figcaption></figure><p>It’s a great story, but it’s <strong>not</strong> true (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_in_space">here</a> for the real story, or the link under the above photo).</p><p>Nevertheless, it’s an instructive parable.</p><p>Don’t rush to the most cutting edge solution if all the user needs is something simple, and in the above example, something you might already have but not think to use.</p><h4>Shiny objects are often sharp</h4><p>Not all magic tricks are harmless card tricks.  For instance, the infamous Russian Roulette trick.</p><p>The plot goes something like this:</p><blockquote><p>The magician presents a sharp nail on a wooden base, which is placed point up under a polystyrene cup.</p><p>Next, the magician introduces additional upside down polystyrene cups and then asks a spectator to shuffle the cups until it is no longer possible for anyone to identify which cup conceals the nail.</p><p>Afterwards, the magician then has the spectator eliminate cups one by one, often reshuffling the cups after each selection to increase the “randomness” and make it even harder to identify the dangerous cup from the safe one(s).</p><p>Eventually, two cups remain. The magician asks the spectator to choose one of the remaining cups.</p><p>This time the magician does not remove the chosen cup.</p><p>Instead, the magician slams either their palm, or the spectator’s, onto the final remaining cup.</p></blockquote><p>There is either a shared outtake of breath from the audience followed by a cheer… or gasps of horror.</p><p>The former is when this trick goes well… the magician magically avoids the nail, knowing all along via “psychic” skills where the dangerous nail hid.</p><p>The latter is what happens when the trick goes wrong, i.e. nail through hand = hospital visit.  No more show bookings.  Potential lawsuits.  And so on!</p><p>This trick has, and continues, to go wrong from time to time, injuring magicians and spectators, including on live TV.   See below if you aren’t squeamish.  The UK”s most famous magician, Derren Brown, has even gotten this badly wrong during rehearsals (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIqzfsfpMv0">here</a>).</p><figure><div><div data-mode="normal" data-provider="youtube" id="arve-RIqzfsfpMv0" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/VideoObject"><p><meta itemprop="embedURL" content="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RIqzfsfpMv0?iv_load_policy=3&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0&amp;autohide=1&amp;playsinline=1&amp;autoplay=0"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" name="" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox" scrolling="no" width="480" height="270" data-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RIqzfsfpMv0?iv_load_policy=3&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0&amp;autohide=1&amp;playsinline=1&amp;autoplay=0" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p></div></div></figure><p>So what’s this got to do with technology?</p><p>Well this is a reminder of why mastery of method is critical, even if the focus is on its relationship to effect.</p><p>If the method isn’t clear, safe, and bug-free, for end-users to rely upon in different settings it can harm.</p><p>The same is true of technology.</p><p>It is often more true for new and “high tech” solutions that aren’t yet well understood by end-users… and sometimes by the technologists themselves, who’ve simply copied and pasted some code, or installed a code library.</p><p>AI is a good example.</p><p>Today’s AI relies heavily on data, statistics, probability, linear algebra and calculus.  Most of these components are poorly understood by users in isolation, let alone in combination when used to deliver AI solutions.  Some software engineers building such systems don’t really understand the underlying math, and in some scenarios this doesn’t matter in order to build good products, but in others it absolutely does.</p><p>For instance, simple misunderstandings regarding the <a href="https://lawtomated.com/accuracy-precision-recall-and-f1-scores-for-lawyers/">accuracy …</a></p></div></div>

<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-json.html">jsonb</a> is, undeniably, <em>king</em>. It is a very flexible data
type, that allows for unstructured/schema-less storage. It has very powerful
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-json.html#JSON-INDEXING">indexing mechanisms</a>, and its internal
representation is reasonably compact and efficient. It comes with advanced operators and expressions to query/extract
parts of it, and has
<a href="http://www.sai.msu.su/~megera/postgres/talks/jsonb-roadmap-pgcon-2020.pdf">recently seen the addition of SQL/JSON path</a>
functionality to extend that to comply with the SQL Standard.</p>
<p>There are countless posts and resources explaining the virtues of this data type and what you can accomplish with it. So
nothing else to add, except to reiterate my appreciation for all those who have worked on creating and contributing to
it<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>But there’s a catch. <code>jsonb</code> supports… just JSON! That’s great, but is it enough?</p>
<h2 id="json-data-types">JSON data types</h2>
<p>JSON is a container data type, which means it can store other data types contained within. And which data types it does
support? From the <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSON Spec</a>, it supports the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number, which is a quite flexible “numeric” data type.</li>
<li>String.</li>
<li>Boolean.</li>
<li>Null.</li>
<li>Array, or probably better called a “bag” or “container”, a sequence of elements of, possibly, mixed types.</li>
<li>Object, a collection of key-value pairs, where the value may be any other JSON data type.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>jsonb</code> maps these JSON data types, internally, to Postgres types. It is easy to see the resolved (JSON) data types:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>select</span> <span>key</span>, value, jsonb_typeof(value) <span>from</span> jsonb_each(
<span>'{"a": 42, "b": true, "c": "hi", "d": null, "e": [42, "hi"], "f": {"a": 1}}'</span>
);
<span>┌─────┬────────────┬──────────────┐</span>
<span>│</span> <span>key</span> <span>│</span>   value    <span>│</span> jsonb_typeof <span>│</span>
<span>├─────┼────────────┼──────────────┤</span>
<span>│</span> a   <span>│</span> <span>42</span>         <span>│</span> <span>number</span>       <span>│</span>
<span>│</span> b   <span>│</span> <span>true</span>       <span>│</span> <span>boolean</span>      <span>│</span>
<span>│</span> <span>c</span>   <span>│</span> <span>"hi"</span>       <span>│</span> string       <span>│</span>
<span>│</span> d   <span>│</span> <span>null</span>       <span>│</span> <span>null</span>         <span>│</span>
<span>│</span> e   <span>│</span> [<span>42</span>, <span>"hi"</span>] <span>│</span> <span>array</span>        <span>│</span>
<span>│</span> f   <span>│</span> <span>{</span><span>"a"</span>: <span>1</span><span>}</span>   <span>│</span> <span>object</span>       <span>│</span>
<span>└─────┴────────────┴──────────────┘</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Scalar types are mapped to boolean, text and numeric. Essentially, three different data types. Now check
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html">all the data types available in Postgres</a>. There are dozens. And
obviously you can extend with your own. Isn’t it a bit limiting that, in essence, you need to conflate any existing data
type to either a <code>numeric</code> or a <code>text</code>? What if you want to represent a timestamp? Convert it to text (well, Postgres
<a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/3ed2005ff595d349276e5b2edeca1a8100b08c87/src/backend/utils/adt/jsonb.c#L45">does it for
you</a>,
but you get the point). What about a <code>inet</code>, or a <code>point</code>? What about my <code>custom-amazing-data-type</code>?</p>
<p>According to the JSON spec, this is correct and there’s nothing else to do. So the question is not about whether <code>jsonb</code>
has any implementation flaws, but if Postgres users are enough with “just JSON”.</p>
<p>I find it particularly frustrating having to store binary data (<code>bytea</code>) in a JSON. Since there’s no <code>bytea</code> data type in
JSON (nor <code>jsonb</code>, consequently) you need to convert it to a text representation. There are several solutions, none of
them a good enough one:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Convert it to a string, byte by byte. Probably a very bad option, as it suffers two main problems: one is that
Postgres strings, not being strictly UTF-8 comformant (and this is a topic for another blog post…), cannot store the
UTF-8 null (<code>\0</code>) character. As such, if one of those bytes had the 0 value (likely), it could not be stored. Second,
a sequence of bytes interpreted as a string does not have the same ordering as the original byte sequence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encode in <code>base64</code>. Other than the extra space, ordering is not preserved (i.e., an index on the original byte
sequence would yield a different order than an index on the base64-encoded text). The solution is to use expression
indexes on the decoded value, if order needs to be preserved. This adds overhead anyway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encode in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base32#base32hex">base32hex</a>, an even more verbose encoding but that
preserves order. There are no functions in Postgres for this encoding.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="looking-beyond-json">Looking beyond JSON</h2>
<p>So how would you store other specific, more compact, or benefit from existing functions from additional datatypes, with
current JSON and <code>jsonb</code>? The only option to avoid data type information erasure is to encode the data type as part of
the JSON string. Something like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
	<span>"key1"</span>: {<span>"type"</span>: <span>"inet"</span>, <span>"value"</span>: <span>"10.0.0.0/8"</span>},
	<span>"array"</span>: [<span>3</span>, {<span>"key2"</span>: {<span>"type"</span>: <span>"point"</span>, <span>"value"</span>: <span>"(42, -42)"</span>}<span>]</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>It is easy to see the several drawbacks of this approach: much more verbose and storage needs; need to continuously
cast; and need to do conditional casts depending on the data type.</p>
<p>I’m not alone in the pursue of a more generic, supporting more data type JSON-like language, like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/bson-types/">MongoDB’s BSON</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_(serialization_format)">Amazon’s ION</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBJSON">Universal Binary JSON</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Programming.LowLevelAPI.html">DynamoDB’s Item HTTP
API</a>.
This is a very interesting case, as it is a JSON-compliant input/output interface, with type definition following an
approach similar to the one outlined above (where the value is an object which includes both the type and the value
itself), but which is claimed to be stored internally in an optimized form (not as-is). It has interesting composite
types like “homogeneus arrays”, where are elements must be of the same time or sets, which forbid duplicated values.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.ongres.com/img/blog/post_jsonb.jpg" alt="Beyond jsonb: a generalized jsonb supertype for Postgres?"></p>
<p>So how would such a generalized unstructured data type work in Postgres? I’d say it could leverage all the existing
jsonb infrastructure. After all, jsonb already knows each element’s data type, so this just needs to be extended to
many, potentially arbitrary data types (to support custom data types too). As such, new data types should be easy to
add. Other features (like ensuring homogeneus-ness across array elements for supporting sets; or ensuring uniqueness
within an element) may require some differentiation. Being a superset, I’d expect the same codebase could accommodate
well both data types (a similar retrofit was performed in the past from <code>hstore</code> to use <code>jsonb</code>'s codebase).</p>
<p>One of the main requisites is that this generalized unstructured data type would be a super set of the actual JSON, so
that any JSON string (and consequently <code>json</code> and <code>jsonb</code> values) can be converted to it implicitly. I envision the
hardest parts, or at least the ones that may trigger more discussion, to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyze existing JSON-superset data types and deciding on the set of features to implement.</li>
<li>Selecting the data types to support, if not <em>all</em>.</li>
<li>Input syntax? Some ideas:
<ul>
<li>Use different value enclosing depending on the data type. E.g. <code>key: {{ dmFsdWU= }}</code> (Amazon Ion).</li>
<li>Wrap the value in constructor-like syntax, like MongoDB shell: <code>key: NumberLong(42)</code>.</li>
<li>Turn values into a nested JSON object with type (document’s key) and value, similar to DynamoDB’s HTTP API:
<code>"key": { "N": "42" }</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And the hardest one: pick the name of the new datatype!</li>
</ul>
<p>So what do you think? <strong>Should Postgres get a JSON-superset data type, a generalized unstructured data type</strong>?  Leave

<p><em>Personal note</em>: I find it hard to understand why Oleg Bartunov, one of the most significant contributors to JSON in
Postgres, among many other features,

Not only I believe major contributions cannot be taken back; but in this particular case it feels even harder to understand. Let

              <p>Navigating in the ocean of Haskell possibilities is challenging even though Haskell is a powerful language that helps to implement robust and maintainable programs. The language supplies you with tons of awesome approaches, but it is not always trivial to see how and where to use them properly.</p>
<p>Fortunately, like any other mainstream programming language, Haskell also has its best-practices and recommended ways for producing high-quality code. Knowing Haskell programming patterns helps you create better libraries and applications and make their users more pleased. And, yes, Haskell actually has FP-oriented programming patterns in addition to the best-practices shared with other languages.</p>
<p>If you are aware of the best ways to solve common problems, you can become a better Haskell developer by using more efficient programming techniques specific to the language. Likewise, you can apply Haskell-specific patterns successfully outside of Haskell.</p>
<p>This blog post contains a structured collection of some programming mini-patterns in Haskell with the detailed description and examples, some small “quality of life” improvements that would help everyone on their developer journey.</p>
<p>📚 In this article, each pattern contains at least one task with the hidden solution, so you can test your understanding of a pattern by solving the proposed task.</p>

<p>Newtype</p>

<p>Lightweight data wrapper.</p>

</div>

<div>
<ol type="1">
<li>Additional wrapping and unwrapping.</li>
<li>Deriving boilerplate is required to duplicate existing behaviour of the underlying type.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p>One of the most common and useful Haskell features is <code>newtype</code>. <code>newtype</code> is an ordinary data type with the name and a constructor. However, you can define a data type as <code>newtype</code> instead of <code>data</code> only if it has <strong>exactly</strong> one constructor with <strong>exactly</strong> one field.</p>
<p>It is extremely easy to define a <code>newtype</code> in Haskell as no extra effort is required from the user compared to the data type declaration. For example, the following are the valid <code>newtype</code> definitions:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>-- + Valid definition of a wrapper around Double</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span>newtype</span> <span>Volume</span> <span>=</span> <span>Volume</span> <span>Double</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><span>-- + Also valid newtype definition with the record field</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><span>newtype</span> <span>Size</span> <span>=</span> <span>Size</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6">    {<span> unSize ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb1-7">    }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But you can’t declare the following data types as a <code>newtype</code>:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>-- - Invalid newtype definition: more than 1 field</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><span>newtype</span> <span>Point</span> <span>=</span> <span>Point</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3">    {<span> pointX ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4">    ,<span> pointY ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5">    }</span>
<span id="cb2-6"></span>
<span id="cb2-7"><span>-- - Ivalid newtype definition: more than 1 constructor</span></span>
<span id="cb2-8"><span>newtype</span> <span>Shape</span></span>
<span id="cb2-9">    <span>=</span> <span>Circle</span> <span>Double</span></span>
<span id="cb2-10">    <span>|</span> <span>Square</span> <span>Double</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>newtype</code>s have a lot of great benefits but I’m going to focus only on the <em>code maintainability</em> in this section.</p>
<p>You can think of a <code>newtype</code> as a lightweight data type. Newtype has the same representation in memory as the wrapped type. Wrapping and unwrapping are also free operations in runtime. So, <code>newtype</code> is a <strong>zero-cost</strong> abstraction.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding from the compiler point of view, different <code>newtype</code>s are different data types. And since they don’t have any runtime overhead compared to the ordinary data types, you can provide a safer interface to your API without sacrificing performance.</p>
<p>Shall we look at the example now. Consider, that you have a function which takes a password, a hash and verifies whether the given hash is the hash of the given password. Since both password and hash are merely textual data, we could write the following function:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>validateHash ::</span> <span>ByteString</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>ByteString</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The problem with this function is that you can easily pass arguments in a different order and get faulty results. And you need to think about proper order of arguments each time you are calling this function. Should it be <code>validateHash password hash</code> or <code>validateHash hash password</code>? This approach is error-prone.</p>
<p>But if you define the following <code>newtype</code>s instead:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>newtype</span> <span>Password</span> <span>=</span> <span>Password</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2">    {<span> unPassword ::</span> <span>ByteString</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3">    }</span>
<span id="cb4-4"></span>
<span id="cb4-5"><span>newtype</span> <span>PasswordHash</span> <span>=</span> <span>PasswordHash</span></span>
<span id="cb4-6">    {<span> unPasswordHash ::</span> <span>ByteString</span></span>
<span id="cb4-7">    }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can implement a more type-safe version of the <code>validateHash</code> function, and additionally this improves the code readability:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>validateHash ::</span> <span>Password</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>PasswordHash</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now, <code>validateHash hash password</code> is a compile-time error, and it makes it impossible to confuse the order of arguments.</p>
<hr>
<p>Another popular way of increasing code readability without sacrificing performance is introducing a new alias (which is simply another name for a data type) by using the <code>type</code> keyword. Unfortunately, this approach is only a partial solution since it helps only a developer, not the compiler as the compiler doesn’t see the difference between type alias and type itself. And if you don’t help your compiler, the compiler won’t be there for you when you need it.</p>
<p>For example, the following code is flawed:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>type</span> <span>Attack</span>  <span>=</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><span>type</span> <span>Defense</span> <span>=</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3"></span>
<span id="cb6-4"><span>calculateDamage ::</span> <span>Attack</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Defense</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Attack</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Of course, the above type signature is better than <code>Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int</code>, but the compiler sees it exactly like this. So, you still can write <code>calculateDamage monsterDefense playerAttack</code> and get a runtime bug.</p>
<p>The approach of using <code>type</code>s instead of <code>newtype</code> can bring even more damage when you have a lot of similar data types. The more types you have the harder to maintain them without external help. Below you can see a code sample from one of the Haskell libraries:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>type</span> <span>WorkerId</span> <span>=</span> <span>UUID</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><span>type</span> <span>SupervisorId</span> <span>=</span> <span>UUID</span></span>
<span id="cb7-3"><span>type</span> <span>ProcessId</span> <span>=</span> <span>UUID</span></span>
<span id="cb7-4"><span>type</span> <span>ProcessName</span> <span>=</span> <span>Text</span></span>
<span id="cb7-5"><span>type</span> <span>SupervisorName</span> <span>=</span> <span>Text</span></span>
<span id="cb7-6"><span>type</span> <span>WorkerName</span> <span>=</span> <span>Text</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The library safety can be improved by replacing all these type aliases with <code>newtype</code>s, and it can even help to discover some bugs that happen due to passing arguments in the wrong order.</p>
<p>Moreover, the <code>newtype</code> approach is more flexible since you can provide your custom instances or restrict some instances allowing you to create values in an unsafe way.</p>
<p>The cost of using <code>newtype</code> is small — you only need to wrap and unwrap it when necessary. But the benefits hugely outweigh this small price.</p>

<p>Smart constructor</p>

<p>Providing idiomatic ways for constructing values.</p>

<div>
<ol type="1">
<li>When a data type restricts some values (e.g.&nbsp;not every <code>ByteString</code> is a valid <code>Password</code>).</li>
<li>When you want to make construction of big data types easier.</li>
<li>To avoid runtime errors.</li>
<li>To make illegal states unrepresentable.</li>

<li>Some extra code.</li>
<li>Decide on the approach details.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p>Once you have a <code>newtype</code>, first you need to create its value to work with it. And sometimes you want to validate a value before proceeding with it. Usually you would create a value of a data type by using its constructor. However, when programming in a modular way, you want to have boundaries in your interface and avoid providing unsafe ways of constructing values without validation.</p>
<p>This programming pattern in Haskell is called <strong>smart constructor</strong>. It can be understood better by looking at the implementation of such approach based on the <code>Password</code> data type:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><span>module</span> <span>Password</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2">    ( <span>Password</span> (unPassword)</span>

<p>When a user posts a new comment or reviews a PR, the action is triggered. If there is a high probability that the content would be classified as toxic, the bot creates a comment tagging the author and advising to update the content.</p>
<p>Here's a quick demo:</p>
<p><img src="https://charliegerard.dev/demo.gif"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/charliegerard/safe-space">repo</a></p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>Before we dive into the code, it is probably important to note that this is a <strong>JavaScript action</strong>. I read that actions could also be in Docker containers but for simplicity, I stuck with JS.</p>
<p>First, I created a action.yml file at the root of my project folder.</p>
<p>Inside this file, I wrote the following code:</p>
<pre><code>name: "Safe space"
description: "Detect the potential toxicity of PR comments"
inputs:
  GITHUB_TOKEN:
    required: true
  message:
    required: false
  toxicity_threshold:
    required: false
runs:
  using: "node12"
  main: "dist/index.js"
</code></pre>
<p>The first couple of lines are self-explanatory. Then, the <code>inputs</code> property contains 3 different elements.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> is a secret token required to authenticate in your workflow run and is automatically generated.</li>
<li>The <code>message</code> property is optional and can be used by people if they want to customise the content of the comment posted by the bot if the action detects toxic comments.</li>
<li>The <code>toxicity_threshold</code> property is also optional and allows people to set a custom threshold that will be used by the machine learning model when making predictions about a comment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the settings under <code>runs</code> indicate the version of Node.js we want our action to run with, as well as the file the action code lives in.</p>
<h2>Action code</h2>
<p>To create a JavaScript action, you need to install and require at least 2 Node.js modules: <code>@actions/core</code> and <code>@actions/github</code>. As this particular action uses a TensorFlow.js model, I also installed and required <code>@tensorflow-models/toxicity</code> and <code>@tensorflow/tfjs</code>.</p>
<p>Then, in my <code>dist/index.js</code> file, I started writing my action code.</p>
<p>The core setup could look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>async function run() {
  const tf = require("@tensorflow/tfjs");
  const toxicity = require("@tensorflow-models/toxicity");
  await tf.setBackend("cpu");

  try {
    const githubToken = core.getInput("GITHUB_TOKEN");
    const customMessage = core.getInput("message");
    const toxicityThreshold = core.getInput("toxicity_threshold");
    const { context } = github;
  } catch (error) {
    core.setFailed(error.message);
  }
}

run();
</code></pre>
<p>There is a main <code>run</code> function that requires the packages needed and sets the backend for TensorFlow.js. Then in a <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code> statement, the code gets the 3 parameters mentioned a bit earlier that we'll be using soon.
Finally, we get the context of the event when the action is triggered.</p>
<h3>Creating a bot comment when a user posts a comment on an issue or PR</h3>
<p>A few different events can trigger a Github action. As this action is interested in getting the comments posted on an issue or PR, we need to start by looking at the payload of the event and see if the property <code>comment</code> is defined. Then we can also look at the type of action (here <code>created</code> and <code>edited</code>), to run the predictions only when a new comment is added or one is edited, but not deleted for example.</p>
<p>More details are available on the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions">official Github documentation</a>.</p>
<p>I then access a few parameters needed to request the comments for the right issue or PR, load the machine learning model, and if the property <code>match</code> is true on one of the results coming back from the predictions, it means the comment has been classified as toxic and I generate a new comment with the warning message.</p>
<pre><code>if (context.payload.comment) {
  if (
    context.payload.action === "created" ||
    context.payoad.action === "edited"
  ) {
    const issueNumber = context.payload.issue.number;
    const repository = context.payload.repository;
    const octokit = new github.GitHub(githubToken);
    const threshold = toxicityThreshold ? toxicityThreshold : 0.9;
    const model = await toxicity.load(threshold);
    const comments = [];
    const commentsObjects = [];
    const latestComment = [context.payload.comment.body];
    const latestCommentObject = context.payload.comment;
    let toxicComment = undefined;

    model.classify(latestComment).then((predictions) =&gt; {
      predictions.forEach((prediction) =&gt; {
        if (toxicComment) {
          return;
        }
        prediction.results.forEach((result, index) =&gt; {
          if (toxicComment) {
            return;
          }
          if (result.match) {
            const commentAuthor = latestCommentObject.user.login;
            toxicComment = latestComment;
            const message = customMessage
              ? customMessage
              : `&lt;img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohzdQ1IynzclJldUQ/giphy.gif" width="400"/&gt; &lt;/br&gt;
                                      Hey @${commentAuthor}! 👋 &lt;br/&gt; PRs and issues should be safe environments but your comment: &lt;strong&gt;"${toxicComment}"&lt;/strong&gt; was classified as potentially toxic! 😔&lt;/br&gt;
                                      Please consider spending a few seconds editing it and feel free to delete me afterwards! 🙂`;

            return octokit.issues.createComment({
              owner: repository.owner.login,
              repo: repository.name,
              issue_number: issueNumber,
              body: message,
            });
          }
        });
      });
    });
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Creating a bot comment when a user submits a PR review</h3>
<p>The code to run checks on PR reviews is very similar, the main difference is in the first couple of lines. Instead of looking for the <code>comment</code> property on the payload, we look for <code>review</code>, and the action I am interested in is <code>submitted</code>.</p>
<pre><code>if (context.payload.review) {
  if (context.payload.action === "submitted") {
    const issueNumber = context.payload.pull_request.number;
    const repository = context.payload.repository;
    const octokit = new github.GitHub(githubToken);
    const threshold = toxicityThreshold ? toxicityThreshold : 0.9;
    const model = await toxicity.load(threshold);
    const reviewComment = [context.payload.review.body];
    const reviewObject = context.payload.review;
    let toxicComment = undefined;
    model.classify(reviewComment).then((predictions) =&gt; {
      predictions.forEach((prediction) =&gt; {
        if (toxicComment) {
          return;
        }
        prediction.results.forEach((result, index) =&gt; {
          if (toxicComment) {
            return;
          }
          if (result.match) {
            const commentAuthor = reviewObject.user.login;
            toxicComment = reviewComment[0];
            const message = customMessage
              ? customMessage
              : `&lt;img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohzdQ1IynzclJldUQ/giphy.gif" width="400"/&gt; &lt;/br&gt;
                                      Hey @${commentAuthor}! 👋 &lt;br/&gt; PRs and issues should be safe environments but your comment: &lt;strong&gt;"${toxicComment}"&lt;/strong&gt; was classified as potentially toxic! 😔&lt;/br&gt;
                                      Please consider spending a few seconds editing it and feel free to delete me afterwards! 🙂`;

            return octokit.issues.createComment({
              owner: repository.owner.login,
              repo: repository.name,
              issue_number: issueNumber,
              body: message,
            });
          }
        });
      });
    });
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Using the action</h2>
<p>To use an action in a repository, we need to create a workflow file.</p>
<p>First, the repository needs to have a <code>.github</code> folder with a <code>workflows</code> folder inside. Then, we can add a new <code>.yml</code> file with the details for the action we want to run.</p>
<pre><code>on: [issue_comment, pull_request_review]

jobs:
  toxic_check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Safe space
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Safe space - action step
        uses: charliegerard/safe-space@master
        with:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
</code></pre>
<p>In this code sample, we indicate that we want to trigger this action when events happen around comments in an issue and when a pull request review event happens.
Then, we add that we need to start by using the default <code>actions/checkout@v2</code> action and finally, add this toxicity classification action, with some additional parameters, including the required <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> one.</p>
<p>If you wanted to use the optional properties <code>message</code> and <code>toxicity_threshold</code>, you could do so like this:</p>
<pre><code>on: [issue_comment, pull_request_review]

jobs:
  toxic_check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Safe space
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Safe space - action step
        uses: charliegerard/safe-space@master
        with:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          message: "Hello"
          toxicity_threshold: 0.7
</code></pre>
<p>If you are developing your own action, you can test it by changing the line</p>
<pre><code>uses: charliegerard/safe-space@master
</code></pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre><code>uses: ./
</code></pre>
<p>One important thing to note, if you want to build your own Github action, is that when using the action type <code>issue_comment</code> and <code>pull_request_review</code>, you need to push your code to your main (often called "master") branch before being able to test that your code is working in another branch. If you develop everything in a separate branch, the action will not be triggered when writing a comment or reviewing a PR.</p>
<p>And that's it! 🎉</p>
<h2>Potential improvements</h2>
<p>At the moment, I invite the user to delete manually the note from the bot once they've updated the content of their toxic comment, however, I think this could be done automatically on edit. When the user edits a comment, I could run the check again and if it is predicted as safe, remove automatically the bot comment so users don't have to do it.</p></div></div>]]>

		<p>by Jonathan Latham, PhD and Allison Wilson, PhD</p>
<p>In all the discussions of the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic, enormous scientific attention has been paid to the molecular character of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including its novel genome sequence in comparison with its near relatives. In stark contrast, virtually no attention has been paid to the physical provenance of those nearest genetic relatives, its presumptive ancestors, which are two viral sequences named BtCoV/4991 and RaTG13.<span id="more-4485"></span></p>
<p>This neglect is surprising because their provenance is more than interesting. BtCoV/4991 and RaTG13 were collected from a mineshaft in Yunnan province, China, in 2012/2013 by researchers from the lab of Zheng-li Shi at the <a href="http://english.whiov.cas.cn/">Wuhan Institute of Virology</a> (WIV). Very shortly before, in the spring of 2012, six miners working in the mine had contracted a mysterious illness and three of them had died (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4036791/">Wu et al., 2014</a>). The specifics of this mystery disease have been virtually forgotten; however, they are described in a Chinese Master’s thesis written in 2013 by a doctor who supervised their treatment.</p>
<p>We arranged to have this Master’s thesis translated into English. The evidence it contains has led us to reconsider everything we thought we knew about the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic. It has also led us to theorise a plausible route by which an apparently isolated disease outbreak in a mine in 2012 led to a global pandemic in 2019.</p>
<p>The origin of SARS-CoV-2 that we propose below is based on the case histories of these miners and their hospital treatment. This simple theory accounts for all the key features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, including ones that have puzzled virologists since the outbreak began.</p>
<p>The theory can account for the origin of the polybasic furin cleavage site, which is a region of the viral spike protein that makes it susceptible to cleavage by the host enzyme furin and which greatly enhances viral spread in the body. This furin site is novel to SARS-CoV-2 compared to its near relatives (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7114094/">Coutard, et al., 2020</a>). The theory also explains the exceptional affinity of the virus spike protein for human receptors, which has also surprised virologists (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0688-y?report=reader">Letko et al., 2020</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06199.pdf">Piplani et al, 2020</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abb2507">Wrapp et al., 2020</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.19.956581">Walls et al., 2020</a>). The theory further explains why the virus has barely evolved since the pandemic began, which is also a deeply puzzling aspect of a virus supposedly new to humans (<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.073262v1">Zhan et al., 2020</a>; <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/06/22/2020.05.21.108506.full.pdf">van Dorp et al., 2020</a>; <a href="https://jbiomedsci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12929-020-00665-8">Chaw et al., 2020</a>). Lastly, the theory neatly explains why SARS-CoV-2 targets the lungs, which is unusual for a coronavirus (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159299/">Huang et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p>We do not propose a specifically genetically engineered or biowarfare origin for the virus but the theory does propose an essential causative role in the pandemic for scientific research carried out by the laboratory of Zheng-li Shi at the WIV; thus also explaining Wuhan as the location of the epicentre.</p>
<h4>Why has the provenance of RaTG13 and BtCoV/4991 been ignored?</h4>
<p>The apparent origin of the COVID-19 pandemic is the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, China. Wuhan is also home to the world’s leading research centre for bat coronaviruses. There are two virology labs in the city, <a href="https://project-evidence.github.io/">both have either collected bat coronaviruses or researched them</a> in the recent past. The Shi lab, which collected BtCoV/4991 and RaTG13, <a href="https://grantome.com/grant/NIH/R01-AI110964-06">recently received grants</a> to evaluate <em>by experiment</em> the potential for pandemic pathogenicity of the novel bat coronaviruses they collected from the wild.</p>
<p>To add to these suggestive data points, there is a long history of accidents, disease outbreaks, and even pandemics resulting from lab accidents with viruses (<a href="https://armscontrolcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Escaped-Viruses-final-2-17-14-copy.pdf">Furmanski, 2014</a>; <a href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/26137650">Weiss et al., 2015</a>). For these and other reasons, summarised in our article <a href="https://www.independentsciencenews.org/health/the-case-is-building-that-covid-19-had-a-lab-origin/"><em>The Case is Building that COVID-19 Had a Lab Origin</em></a>, we (a virologist and a geneticist) <a href="https://thebulletin.org/2020/06/did-the-sars-cov-2-virus-arise-from-a-bat-coronavirus-research-program-in-a-chinese-laboratory-very-possibly/">and others</a> have concluded that a lab outbreak is a credible thesis. Certainly, a lab origin has at least as much circumstantial evidence to support it as does any natural zoonotic origin theory (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06199.pdf">Piplani et al., 2020</a>; <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rossana_Segreto/publication/340924249_Is_considering_a_genetic-manipulation_origin_for_SARS-CoV-2_a_conspiracy_theory_that_must_be_censored/links/5ed7c17992851c9c5e74f7dc/Is-considering-a-genetic-manipulation-origin-for-SARS-CoV-2-a-conspiracy-theory-that-must-be-censored.pdf">Segreto and Deigin, 2020</a>; <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.073262v1">Zhan et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p>The media, normally so enamoured of controversy, has largely declined even to debate the possibility of a laboratory escape. Many news sites have simply labelled it a conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>The principal reason for media dismissals of the lab origin possibility is a review paper in <em>Nature Medicine</em> (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/S41591-020-0820-9">Andersen et al., 2020</a>). Although by Jun 29 2020 this review had almost 700 citations it also has major scientific shortcomings. These flaws are worth understanding in their own right but they are also useful background for understanding the implications of the Master’s thesis.</p>
<h4>Andersen et al., a critique</h4>
<p>The question of the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic is, in outline, simple. There are two incontrovertible facts. One, the disease is caused by a human viral pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, first identified in Wuhan in December 2019 and whose RNA genome sequence is known. Second, all of its nearest known relatives come from bats. Beyond any reasonable doubt SARS-CoV-2 evolved from an ancestral bat virus. The task the <em>Nature Medicine</em> authors set for themselves was to establish the relative merits of each of the various possible routes (lab vs natural) by which a bat coronavirus might have jumped to humans and in the same process have acquired an unusual furin site and a spike protein having very high affinity for the human ACE2 receptor.</p>
<p>When Andersen et al. outline a natural zoonotic pathway they speculate extensively about how the leap might have occurred. In particular they elaborate on a proposed residence in intermediate animals, likely pangolins. For example, “The presence in pangolins of an RBD [Receptor Binding Domain] very similar to that of SARS-CoV-2 means that we can infer that this was probably in the virus that jumped to humans. This leaves the insertion of [a] polybasic cleavage site to occur during human-to-human transmission.” This viral evolution occurred in “Malayan pangolins illegally imported into Guangdong province”. Even with these speculations there are major gaps in this theory. For example, why is the virus so well adapted to humans? Why Wuhan, which is 1,000 Km from Guangdong? (See map).</p>
<figure id="attachment_3105" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3105"><img src="https://www.independentsciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/china-province-guide-600x503.jpg" alt="china province guide" width="600" height="503"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3105">china province guide</figcaption></figure>
<p>The authors provide no such speculations in favour of the lab accident thesis, only speculation <em>against</em> it:</p>
<p>“Finally, the generation of the <em>predicted</em> O-linked glycans is also <em>unlikely</em> to have occurred due to cell-culture passage, as such features suggest the involvement of an immune system.” (italics added).</p>
<p>[Passaging is the deliberate placing of live viruses into cells or organisms to which they are NOT adapted for the purpose of making them adapted, i.e. speeding up their evolution.]</p>
<p>It is also noteworthy that the Andersen authors set a higher hurdle for the lab thesis than the zoonotic thesis. In their account, the lab thesis is required to explain <em>all </em>of the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 from its presumed bat viral ancestor, whereas under their telling of the zoonotic thesis the key step of the addition of the furin site is allowed to happen in humans and is thus effectively unexplained.</p>
<p>A further imbalance is that key information needed to judge the merits of a lab origin theory is missing from their account. As we detailed in our previous article, in their search for SARS-like viruses with zoonotic spillover potential, researchers at the WIV have passaged live bat viruses in monkey and human cells (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/11/4/379/htm">Wang et al., 2019</a>). They have also performed many recombinant experiments with diverse bat coronaviruses (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12711">Ge et al., 2013</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4797993/">Menachery et al., 2015</a>; <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006698">Hu et al., 2017</a>). Such experiments have generated international concern over the possible creation of potential pandemic viruses (<a href="https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-8678-1_29">Lipsitch, 2018</a>). As we showed too, the Shi lab had also won a grant to extend that work to whole live animals. They planned “virus infection experiments across a range of cell cultures from different species and humanized mice” with recombinant bat coronaviruses. Yet Andersen et al did not discuss this research at all, except to say:</p>
<p>“Basic research involving passage of bat SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses in cell culture and/or animal models has been ongoing for many years in biosafety level 2 laboratories across the world”</p>
<p>This statement is fundamentally misleading about the kind of research performed at the Shi lab.</p>
<p>A further important oversight by the Andersen authors concerns the history of lab outbreaks of viral pathogens. They write: “there are documented instances of laboratory escapes of SARS-CoV”. This is a rather matter-of-fact allusion to the fact that since 2003 there have been six documented outbreaks of SARS from labs, not all in China, with some leading to fatalities (<a href="https://armscontrolcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Escaped-Viruses-final-2-17-14-copy.pdf">Furmanski, 2014</a>).</p>
<p>Andersen et al might have also have noted that two major human pandemics are widely accepted to have been caused by lab outbreaks of viral pathogens, H1N1 in 1977 and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (summarised in <a href="https://armscontrolcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Escaped-Viruses-final-2-17-14-copy.pdf">Furmanski, 2014</a>). Andersen could even have noted that literally hundreds of lab accidents with viruses have resulted in near-misses or very localised outbreaks (<a href="https://thebulletin.org/2019/02/human-error-in-high-biocontainment-labs-a-likely-pandemic-threat/">summarised by Lynn Klotz</a> and <a href="https://www.independentsciencenews.org/health/the-long-history-of-accidental-laboratory-releases-of-potential-pandemic-pathogens/">Sam Husseini</a> and also <a href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/26137650">Weiss et al., 2015</a>).</p>
<p>Also unmentioned were instances where a lab outbreak of an experimental or engineered virus has been plausibly theorised but remains uninvestigated. For example, the most coherent explanation for the H1N1 variant ‘swine flu’ pandemic of 2009/10 that resulted in a death toll estimated by some as high as 200,000 (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4865181/">Duggal et al., 2016</a>; <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001558">Simonsen et al. 2013</a>), is that a vaccine was improperly inactivated by its maker (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1743-422X-6-207">Gibbs et al., 2009</a>).

<p>I'm a science fiction writer, so I quite enjoy thinking about self-driving cars. They make for really interesting analogies about data, liability, self-determination, information security and openness.</p>
<p>Sometimes I write fiction about this! Deakin University commissioned "Car Wars," a short story about the sociotechnological issues raised by autonomous vehicle thought-experiments.</p>
<p><a href="https://this.deakin.edu.au/self-improvement/car-wars">https://this.deakin.edu.au/self-improvement/car-wars</a></p>
<p>(they also got a faculty member to write a quiz for it whose correct answers take a 180' different view to my own!)</p>
<p>And without any spoilers here, I'll say that subverted, lethal autonomous vehicles are a key plot point in Attack Surface, the third Little Brother book, coming out in Oct.</p>
<p><a href="https://read.macmillan.com/promo/attacksurfacepreordercampaign/">https://read.macmillan.com/promo/attacksurfacepreordercampaign/</a></p>
<p>But I'm a science fiction writer and that means I can tell the difference between "thought experiments" and "real things." Alas, the same cannot be said of corporate America.</p>
<p>For example, according to its own IPO filings, Uber can only be profitable if it invents fully autonomous vehicles and replaces every public transit ride in the world with them.</p>
<p>Elon Musk – a man whose "green electric car company" is only profitable thanks to the carbon credits it sells to manufacturers of the dirtiest SUVs in America, without which those planet-killing SUVs would not exist – makes the same mistake.</p>
<p>Musk wants to abolish public transit and replace it with EVs (he says that public transit makes you sit next to strangers who might be serial killers, which tells you a lot about his view of humanity).</p>
<p>Now, both Uber and Musk are both wrong as a matter of simple geometry. Multiply the space occupied by all those AVs by the journeys people in cities need to make by the additional distances of those journeys if we need road for all those cars, and you run out of space.</p>
<p>It's a trivially modelable Red Queen's Race, in which the more cars you add, the more road you need, the more spaced out everything gets, the more cars you need, the more road you need, the more spaced out everything gets, the more cars you need…</p>
<p>Indeed, these fairy tales require so much credulity to be taken seriously that they strain even the car-addled imaginations of American automotive culture, and also rely on the irrational exuberance inspired by imaginary self-driving cars to propagate and persist.</p>
<p>But that exuberance is sorely misplaced. Machine learning systems have brittle and unpredictable failure modes that can be triggered by accident or deliberately. The unconstrained problem of navigating busy cities with unquantifiable human activities is insoluble with ML.</p>
<p>Or, at least, it's insoluble if you care about whether cars kill even more people in even less predictable ways than they do now.</p>
<p>This is a lesson that Ford CEO Jim Hackett just learned the hard way.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-10-ford-ceo-says-the-company-overestimated-self-driving-cars.html">https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-10-ford-ceo-says-the-company-overestimated-self-driving-cars.html</a></p>
<p>After investing heavily in the technology and boasting about how Ford's future was a bet on the imminent arrival of AVs, Hackett has had to admit that "We overestimated the arrival of autonomous vehicles."</p>
<p>The company has sunk $4b into the technology. But there's gotta be a pony under there somewhere:</p>
<p>"When we bring this thing to market, it's going to be really powerful." -Hackett</p>

<p>Genomist Adam Rutherford is a gifted science communicator; the podcast he co-hosts, "The Curious Cases of Rutherford and Fry" is one of the best popular science programs I've ever heard: charming and informative at the same time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07dx75g/episodes/downloads">https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07dx75g/episodes/downloads</a></p>
<p>His 2017 book "A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived" used a survey of the state of the art in genomics to present an account of what we knew about human relatedness.</p>
<p><a href="https://boingboing.net/2017/07/03/the-human-race-without-races.html">https://boingboing.net/2017/07/03/the-human-race-without-races.html</a></p>
<p>The most compelling part of "Brief History" was Rutherford's skewering of junk DNA sciecne, especially the home ancestry/genetic testing industry, with its claims of being able to tell you if you're 32% viking and if so, which red wine you're genetically programmed to enjoy.</p>
<p>These sections are written with Rutherford's characteristic empathy – as someone who'd dedicated his life to genomics, he understands the impulse to connect your DNA with your life story – but they also warn about the harms arising from these false beliefs.</p>
<p>These harms are the subject of his new book, HOW TO ARGUE WITH A RACIST, a bestseller in the UK, just published in the US with new forematter updated in light of both the pandemic and the BLM uprising.</p>
<p><a href="https://theexperimentpublishing.com/catalogs/spring-2020/how-to-argue-with-a-racist/">https://theexperimentpublishing.com/catalogs/spring-2020/how-to-argue-with-a-racist/</a></p>
<p>Superficially, the "race science" promulgated by white supremacists – often repeated by people who should know better, sometimes internalized by racialized people who are harmed by this pseudoscience – has the ring of plausibility.</p>
<p>Whether that's the fairy tales about "race" and ability ("Jews are smart because of medieval money-lending laws" or "Black people perform well in sports because of the slave trade's selective breeding") or the studies grouping humanity into races based on genetic divergence.</p>
<p>Chances are you've encountered this stuff and not known what to make of it but thought it benign or at least neutral. But sociologists have scraped white nationalist message-boards to document the centrality of this stuff to the rise of a new movement of would-be genociders.</p>
<p>"How to Argue" is a point-by-point rebuttal to these race realists. Despite the title, Rutherford doesn't really expect that you'll convince someone who's obsessed with whether they have "Jewish genes" or who worships their ability to break down lactose with his arguments.</p>
<p>Those people, after all, are motivated reasoners. They've started from the end-point – "appearances and life circumstances notwithstanding, I am superior and deserve better" – and worked their way backwards to justify that story to themselves.</p>
<p>As Jonathan Swift wrote (and as Rutherford quotes): "It is useless to attempt to reason a man out of a thing he was never reasoned into."</p>
<p>But it's not just motivated reasoners who absorb this garbage. There's a whole business model built on selling people junk DNA science that makes "race science" regrettably spreadable.</p>
<p>That's where Rutherford is aiming: people who've assumed that 23andme and its rivals wouldn't be able to make millions selling you diagnoses of the precise quantity of viking DNA in your blood if there wasn't something to it.</p>
<p>And here Rutherford shines. He is, after all, a gifted science communicator. This is one seriously <em>charming</em> book, funny and witty and just flat-out fascinating.</p>
<p>Rutherford doesn't merely want to disabuse you of the fantastical claims of Junk DNA Science – he wants to excite you about the incredible NEW things we're learning thanks to the rapid advances in genomics.</p>
<p>Like the fact that Africa is the most genetically diverse place on Earth, with two members of the Sen tribe from different regions being more genetically divergent than a Swede and an Australian Aboriginal person.</p>
<p>And the fact that you only need to go back 11 generations before you reach an ancestor whose DNA is likely completely missing from your own genome. Or the small number of centuries you have to look back before you find the first common ancestor of every European.</p>
<p>And the amount of genetic outflow and backflow between seemingly isolated places – Bronze Age Africa and Europe, say – and the waves of migration we can trace through genomes that eliminate any claim to national genetic commonality in any land.</p>
<p>If you've ever wondered what role genomics plays in the dominance of people from east Africa in footraces, or the number of Jewish Nobelists, Rutherford's here for you, unpicking what we know about the role of genes in these attainments (spoiler: they're not that important).</p>
<p>All leavened with gentle and devastating dunks on "race science" believers and the wit of Douglas Adams in his prime.</p>
<p>It may not help you win arguments with racists – they cannot be reasoned out of what they weren't reasoned into.</p>
<p>But it a powerful innoculant against the ideas drifting out of their foetid pits and into the rest of the world.</p>

<p>The Heroes Without Limits project was created by disability advocate Sara Thompson, "producing and streaming real play tabletop games with an all-disabled/chronically ill/neurodivergent cast and crew."</p>
<p>Thompson's work also includes creating homebrew RPG add-ons "roleplay and address disability" in your own games.</p>
<p>A recent addition is the Combat Wheelchair, rules for integrating wheelchair using adventurers into your Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition games:</p>

<p>The chair comes with its own attacks and added capabilities – like being able to fix a weapon in place on it and ramming/tyre striking your adversaries, or high-speed descents on sloped terrain.</p>
<p>The docs also come with a new character class, "The Paralympian."</p>

<p>Combat Wheelchairs' obvious, manifest coolness has not prevented gatekeeping yum-yukkers from raising spurious objections to them, and these are addressed in the homebrew rules.</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/1593927412.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/1593927412.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>But far more interesting than Combat Wheelchairs' detractors are its boosters, who have unleashed a torrent of delightful and creative new media building on Thompson's work.</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/1593927202.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/1593927202.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>

</p>
<p><em> <strong>Content warning:</strong> Discussion of social justice, discussion of violence, spoilers for Jacqueline Carey books.</em>
</p>
<hr>
<p><em> <strong>Edit 10/25:</strong> This post was inspired by a debate with a friend of a friend on Facebook who has since become somewhat famous. I’ve renamed him here to “Andrew Cord” to protect his identity.</em>
</p>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>Andrew Cord <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/hallq/2014/02/on-some-criticism-of-lesswrong/" rel="nofollow">criticizes me</a> for my bold and controversial suggestion that maybe people should try to tell slightly fewer blatant hurtful lies:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just find it kind of darkly amusing and sad that the “rationalist community” loves “rationality is winning” so much as a tagline and yet are clearly not winning. And then complain about losing rather than changing their tactics to match those of people who are winning.
</p>
<p>Which is probably because if you *really* want to be the kind of person who wins you have to actually care about winning something, which means you have to have politics, which means you have to embrace “politics the mindkiller” and “politics is war and arguments are soldiers”, and Scott would clearly rather spend the rest of his life losing than do this.
</p>
<p>That post [ <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/17/lies-damned-lies-and-social-media-part-5-of-%e2%88%9e/" rel="nofollow">the one debunking false rape statistics</a> ] is exactly my problem with Scott. He seems to honestly think that it’s a worthwhile use of his time, energy and mental effort to download evil people’s evil worldviews into his mind and try to analytically debate them with statistics and cost-benefit analyses.
</p>
<p>He gets *mad* at people whom he detachedly intellectually agrees with but who are willing to back up their beliefs with war and fire rather than pussyfooting around with debate-team nonsense.
</p>
<p>It honestly makes me kind of sick. It is exactly the kind of thing that “social justice” activists like me *intend* to attack and “trigger” when we use “triggery” catchphrases about the mewling pusillanimity of privileged white allies.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, if a fight is important to you, fight nasty. If that means lying, lie. If that means insults, insult. If that means silencing people, silence.
</p>
<p>It always makes me happy when my ideological opponents come out and say eloquently and openly what I’ve always secretly suspected them of believing.
</p>
<p>My natural instinct is to give some of the reasons why I think Andrew is wrong, starting with the history of the “noble lie” concept and moving on to some examples of why it didn’t work very well, and why it might not be expected to work so well in the future.
</p>
<p>But in a way, that would be assuming the conclusion. I wouldn’t be showing respect for Andrew’s arguments. I wouldn’t be going halfway to meet them on their own terms.
</p>
<p>The respectful way to rebut Andrew’s argument would be to spread malicious lies about Andrew to a couple of media outlets, fan the flames, and wait for them to destroy his reputation. Then if the stress ends up bursting an aneurysm in his brain, I can dance on his grave, singing:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>♪ ♬ I won this debate in a very effective manner. Now you can’t argue in favor of nasty debate tactics any more ♬ ♪
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not going to do that, but if I <em>did</em> it’s unclear to me how Andrew could object. I mean, he thinks that sexism is detrimental to society, so spreading lies and destroying people is justified in order to stop it. I think that discourse based on mud-slinging and falsehoods is detrimental to society. Therefore…
</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>But really, all this talk of lying and spreading rumors about people is – what was Andrew’s terminology – “pussyfooting around with debate-team nonsense”. You know who got things done? The IRA. They didn’t agree with the British occupation of Northern Ireland and they weren’t afraid to let people know in that very special way only a nail-bomb shoved through your window at night can.
</p>
<p>Why not assassinate prominent racist and sexist politicians and intellectuals? I won’t name names since that would be crossing a line, but I’m sure you can generate several of them who are sufficiently successful and charismatic that, if knocked off, there would not be an equally competent racist or sexist immediately available to replace them, and it would thus be a serious setback for the racism/sexism movement.
</p>
<p>Other people can appeal to “the social contract” or “the general civilizational rule not to use violence”, but not Andrew:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think that whether or not I use certain weapons has zero impact on whether or not those weapons are used against me, and people who think they do are either appealing to a kind of vague Kantian morality that I think is invalid or a specific kind of “honor among foes” that I think does not exist.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And don’t give me that nonsense about the police. I’m sure a smart person like you can think of clever exciting new ways to commit the perfect murder. Unless you do not believe there will <em>ever</em> be an opportunity to defect unpunished, you need this sort of social contract to take you at least some of the way.
</p>
<p>He continues:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Scott calls rhetorical tactics he dislikes “bullets” and denigrates them it actually hilariously plays right into this point…to be “pro-bullet” or “anti-bullet” is ridiculous. Bullets, as you say, are neutral. I am in favor of my side using bullets as best they can to destroy the enemy’s ability to use bullets.
</p>
<p>In a war, a real war, a war for survival, you use all the weapons in your arsenal because you assume the enemy will use all the weapons in theirs. Because you understand that it IS a war.
</p></blockquote>
<p>There are a lot of things I am tempted to say to this.
</p>
<p>Like “And that is why the United States immediately nukes every country it goes to war with.”
</p>
<p>Or “And that is why the Geneva Convention was so obviously impossible that no one even bothered to attend the conference”.
</p>
<p>Or “And that is why, <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/22/apart-from-better-sanitation-and-medicine-and-education-and-irrigation-and-public-health-and-roads-and-public-order-what-has-modernity-done-for-us/" rel="nofollow">to this very day</a>, we solve every international disagreement through total war.”
</p>
<p>Or “And that is why Martin Luther King was immediately reduced to a nonentity, and we remember the Weathermen as the sole people responsible for the success of the civil rights movement”
</p>
<p>But I think what I am <em>actually</em> going to say is that, for the love of God, if you like bullets so much, stop using them as a metaphor for ‘spreading false statistics’ and go buy a gun.
</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>So let’s derive why violence is not in fact The One True Best Way To Solve All Our Problems. You can get most of this from <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/1619491702/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1619491702&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=slastacod-20&amp;linkId=AYGYZKSORVSJ52VW" rel="nofollow">Hobbes</a>, but this blog post will be shorter.
</p>
<p>Suppose I am a radical Catholic who believes all Protestants deserve to die, and therefore go around killing Protestants. So far, so good.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there might be some radical Protestants around who believe all Catholics deserve to die. If there weren’t before, there probably are now. So they go around killing Catholics, we’re both unhappy and/or dead, our economy tanks, hundreds of innocent people end up as collateral damage, and our country goes down the toilet.
</p>
<p>So we make an agreement: I won’t kill any more Catholics, you don’t kill any more Protestants. The specific Irish example was called the Good Friday Agreement and the general case is called “civilization”.
</p>
<p>So then I try to destroy the hated Protestants using the government. I go around trying to pass laws banning Protestant worship and preventing people from condemning Catholicism.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, maybe the next government in power is a Protestant government, and they pass laws banning Catholic worship and preventing people from condemning Protestantism. No one can securely practice their own religion, no one can learn about other religions, people are constantly plotting civil war, academic freedom is severely curtailed, and once again the country goes down the toilet.
</p>
<p>So again we make an agreement. I won’t use the apparatus of government against Protestantism, you don’t use the apparatus of government against Catholicism. The specific American example is the First Amendment and the general case is called “liberalism”, or to be dramatic about it, “civilization 2.0”.
</p>
<p>Every case in which both sides agree to lay down their weapons and be nice to each other has corresponded to spectacular gains by both sides and a new era of human flourishing.
</p>
<p>“Wait a second, no!” someone yells. “I see where you’re going with this. You’re going to say that agreeing not to spread malicious lies about each other would also be a civilized and beneficial system. Like maybe the Protestants could stop saying that the Catholics worshipped the Devil, and the Catholics could stop saying the Protestants hate the Virgin Mary, and they could both relax the whole thing about the Jews baking the blood of Christian children into their matzah.
</p>
<p>“But your two examples were about contracts written on paper and enforced by the government. So maybe a ‘no malicious lies’ amendment to the Constitution would work if it were enforceable, <em>which it isn’t</em>, but just <em>asking</em> people to stop spreading malicious lies is doomed from the start. The Jews will no doubt spread lies against <em>us</em>, so if we stop spreading lies about them, all we’re doing is abandoning an effective weapon against a religion I personally know to be heathenish! Rationalists should win, so put the blood libel on the front page of every newspaper!”
</p>
<p>Or, as Andrew puts it:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether or not I use certain weapons has zero impact on whether or not those weapons are used against me, and people who think they do are either appealing to a kind of vague Kantian morality that I think is invalid or a specific kind of “honor among foes” that I think does not exist.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So let’s talk about how beneficial game-theoretic equilibria can come to exist even in the absence of centralized enforcers. I know of two main ways: reciprocal communitarianism, and divine grace.
</p>
<p>Reciprocal communitarianism is probably how altruism evolved. Some mammal started running <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat" rel="nofollow">TIT-FOR-TAT</a>, the program where you cooperate with anyone whom you expect to cooperate with you. Gradually you form a successful community of cooperators. The defectors either join your community and agree to play by your rules or get outcompeted.
</p>
<p>Divine grace is more complicated. I was tempted to call it “spontaneous …</p></div></div>

August 17, 2020 | https://www.embly.run/star/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.embly.run/star/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p><em><strong>tl:dr</strong> <a href="https://github.com/embly/star"><strong>star</strong></a> is a python(ish) programming environment that lets you call Go library functions. <a href="https://www.embly.run/star/#repl">click down to the repl</a> if you'd just like to play around</em></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark">Starlark</a> is Google's custom subset of Python that it uses as a configuration language with Bazel. I started looking into it a little because it has some interesting characteristics. It's not turing complete (no unbounded loops), it doesn't have classes or higher level abstractions, it's also deterministic and is somewhat safe to run untrusted user input.</p>
<p>Although somewhat limited it felt like it might make a good candidate for a serverless function runtime that could be added to <a href="https://embly.run/">embly</a>. Easier to sandbox, could mock out pieces of the python standard library, maybe provide just enough functionality for it to be useful. I also thought you might be able to identify the deterministic blocks of code and replace them with the static result on subsequent runs. Potentially exciting stuff!</p>
<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/google/starlark-go">starlark-go</a> to get started and pretty quickly had this demo up and running:</p>
<pre><span>def </span><span>hello</span><span>(</span><span>w</span><span>, </span><span>req</span><span>):
    w.</span><span>write</span><span>(req.content_type)
    w.</span><span>write</span><span>(req.path)
    w.</span><span>write</span><span>("</span><span>\n</span><span>Hello World</span><span>\n</span><span>" + </span><span>str</span><span>([x </span><span>for </span><span>x </span><span>in </span><span>range</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>)]) + "</span><span>\n</span><span>")

    </span><span>return
</span></pre>
<p>The server parses the file, starts a web server, takes the <code>hello</code> function and passes the <code>http.ResponseWriter</code> and <code>http.Request</code> over to the <strike>python</strike> starlark side of things on every http request. From there I could add attributes to pass over things like the <code>path</code> and <code>content_type</code>.</p>
<p>Starlark doesn't have exception handling, so I add a Go error type and passed that over as well. This ends up being almost as verbose as Go, but without typed functions it does allow for a little more flexibility:</p>
<pre><span>def </span><span>handle_err</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>):
    </span><span>for </span><span>a </span><span>in </span><span>args:
        </span><span>if </span><span>type</span><span>(a) == "</span><span>error</span><span>" and a:
            </span><span>print</span><span>(a, a.</span><span>stacktrace</span><span>())
    </span><span>return </span><span>args

foo, err = </span><span>handle_err</span><span>(</span><span>function_call</span><span>())
</span></pre>
<p>At this point I got a little more interested in continuing to cram Go functionality into this scripting language. The <a href="https://github.com/google/starlark-go">starlark-go</a> implementation is really wonderful and it was quite easy to extend.</p>
<p>In talking to my coworker I wondered if you could pull in lots of Go functionality, we sketched up something like this:</p>
<pre><span>import </span><span>time
</span><span>from </span><span>net </span><span>import </span><span>http
</span><span>from </span><span>star </span><span>import </span><span>chan, go

</span><span>def </span><span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>):
    time.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)
    c.</span><span>push</span><span>("</span><span>hello</span><span>")

</span><span>def </span><span>main</span><span>():
    resp, err = http.</span><span>get</span><span>("</span><span>https://www.embly.run/hello/</span><span>")
    </span><span>if </span><span>err:
        </span><span>return </span><span>print</span><span>(err)

    c = </span><span>chan</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)
    </span><span>go</span><span>(foo, c)
    c.</span><span>next</span><span>()
</span></pre>
<p>From a syntax standpoint it seems like this would be possible. Starlark also has first-class support for running separate chunks of code in parallel (globals are immutable, which helps), so leveraging Go's concurrency model didn't seem too difficult either.</p>
<p>After a little more messing around, most of that sketch has been implemented: <a href="https://github.com/embly/star">https://github.com/embly/star</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/embly/star"><strong>star</strong></a> is a python(ish) programming environment that lets you call Go library functions. It is very fragile and shouldn't be taken seriously, but it's very fun to play with.</p>
<p>Here's what that sketch ended up looking like:</p>
<pre><span>http = </span><span>require</span><span>("</span><span>net/http</span><span>")
ioutil = </span><span>require</span><span>("</span><span>io/ioutil</span><span>")
sync = </span><span>require</span><span>("</span><span>sync</span><span>")
star = </span><span>require</span><span>("</span><span>star</span><span>")
time = </span><span>require</span><span>("</span><span>time</span><span>")

</span><span>def </span><span>get_url</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>, </span><span>wg</span><span>):
    resp, err = http.</span><span>Get</span><span>(url)
    </span><span>if </span><span>err:
        </span><span>return </span><span>print</span><span>(err)
    b, err = ioutil.</span><span>ReadAll</span><span>(resp.Body)
    </span><span>if </span><span>err:
        </span><span>return </span><span>print</span><span>(err)
    body, err = star.</span><span>bytes_to_string</span><span>(b)
    </span><span>if </span><span>err:
        </span><span>return </span><span>print</span><span>(err)
    time.</span><span>Sleep</span><span>(time.Second * </span><span>2</span><span>)
    wg.</span><span>Done</span><span>()


</span><span>def </span><span>main</span><span>():
    wg = sync.</span><span>WaitGroup</span><span>()
    wg.</span><span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)
    urls = [
        "</span><span>https://www.embly.run/hello/</span><span>",
        "</span><span>https://www.embly.run/hello/</span><span>",
        "</span><span>https://www.embly.run/hello/</span><span>",
    ]
    </span><span>for </span><span>url </span><span>in </span><span>urls:
        star.</span><span>go</span><span>(get_url, url, wg)
    wg.</span><span>Wait</span><span>()
</span></pre>
<p>Really trippy to look at if you've written python and Go. A few notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>starlark doesn't support python's import syntax, so I went with a <code>require</code> function</li>
<li><code>star.go</code> spawns a goroutine and it works! adding channels wouldn't be too hard either</li>
<li><code>star.bytes_to_string</code> shows some of the cracks, I wasn't too sure how to add type conversion</li>
</ul>
<p>I've only converted a small subset of the Go stdlib, you can see the list of available components here: <a href="https://github.com/embly/star/blob/master/src/packages.go">https://github.com/embly/star/blob/master/src/packages.go</a></p>
<p>I also got a callback function working so that go/python servers work as well:</p>
<pre><span>http = </span><span>require</span><span>("</span><span>net/http</span><span>")

</span><span>def </span><span>hello</span><span>(</span><span>w</span><span>, </span><span>req</span><span>):
    w.</span><span>WriteHeader</span><span>(</span><span>201</span><span>)
    w.</span><span>Write</span><span>("</span><span>hello world</span><span>\n</span><span>")

http.</span><span>HandleFunc</span><span>("</span><span>/hello</span><span>", hello)

http.</span><span>ListenAndServe</span><span>("</span><span>:8080</span><span>", http.Handler)
</span></pre>
<p>The coolest part is that this is all pure Go, so we can also run all of it in webassembly. Here's <a href="https://embly.github.io/star/">a repl</a>, script away:</p>

<p>Or install with <code>go get github.com/embly/star/cmd/star</code></p>
<h4 id="closing-notes">Closing notes</h4>
<p>I originally though I could generate wrappers for the entire standard library. There has been a <a href="https://github.com/embly/star/tree/master/cmd/nebula">very small amount of work</a> made toward this effort and the wrapper functions have been written with generation in mind. In an <a href="https://github.com/embly/star/blob/3fe42d285d804cd90c97758a9b616b95c8ce25a6/src/io/lib.go">optimistic case</a> you can see how you could crawl the stdlib AST and generate the necessary code. From there you just populate <a href="https://github.com/embly/star/blob/3fe42d285d804cd90c97758a9b616b95c8ce25a6/src/packages.go">the mappings</a> and you're off. I thought it would be cool if you could chose what libraries and functions to include with star and generate your own binary so that you don't have to compile things you don't need.</p>
<p>Sadly, the current implementation is <a href="https://github.com/embly/star/blob/3fe42d285d804cd90c97758a9b616b95c8ce25a6/src/net/http/lib.go#L85-L105">full of edge cases</a>, so either the wrappers need a rewrite (probably true), or the generation code would need to be quite complex (maybe also true).</p>
<p>I've also left out a lot of important things, the idea of a pointer isn't really tracked, some values are pointers and some are not, this would need to be surfaced in star on some level.</p>
<p>No work has been done to soften the edge cases of passing things into Go, but conceivably this could be very nice. Star could make the best effort to convert any starlark/python type into the correct input type for a function. For the moment it will just crash.</p>
<p>I'd love to hear your thoughts, please open an issue: <a href="https://github.com/embly/star/issues">https://github.com/embly/star/issues</a></p>

        <blockquote><p>Just because your state or city allows you to bring staff back to the office doesn’t mean that the facilities are ready for them to work safely. Here’s what you need to consider before employees return – assuming you can convince them to do so. Don’t count on that.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a now-common tale: The developers and the rest of the company staff have been working at home since March. For the most part, things have gone well enough. After <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/software-qa-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/">some initial glitches</a>, the team is productive, reasonably happy (given the additional stress), and their goals are met.</p>
<p>However, the day is coming when you no longer have to keep everyone out of the office. You can bring them back. Or can you?</p>
<h3>Decorating the petri dish</h3>
<p>Before you bring staff back to a shared space, you have to comply with a new bunch of rules about office work to meet post-covid-19 guidelines. While the specific details may differ where you are, all of the new workplace rules include social distancing requirements. Almost certainly, your pre-covid-19 workplace doesn’t allow for six feet of space between workers.</p>
<p>The changes aren’t trivial. You need <a href="https://theconversation.com/goodbye-to-the-crowded-office-how-coronavirus-will-change-the-way-we-work-together-137382" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">physical reconfiguration of work areas</a>. Desks need to be farther apart, possibly with barriers between work stations. (So much for <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/01/sgc-research-when-moving-to-an-open-office-plan-pay-attention-to-how-your-employees-feel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the alleged benefits of collaboration</a> in an open office.) Because you probably don’t have space to move everyone apart, you need to decide whether you need everyone in the office at the same time – which means cultural impacts that are as important to think about as building airflow.</p>
<p>Let’s assume for the moment that you <em>do</em> want to bring people back into the corporate headquarters – or that you need to, for reasons of security. Here are the adjustments to make now, before people return to their commutes.</p>
<h3>Beyond office space</h3>
<p>According to Marina Vaamonde, CEO of real estate investment firm <a href="https://propertycashin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PropertyCashin.com</a>, companies have to arrange for more parking than they had pre-Covid. The reason, she explains, is that <a href="https://time.com/5869375/public-transit-coronavirus-covid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fewer workers are willing to share space on public transportation</a>. “People want to drive their own cars into work, so you need more parking,” she points out.</p>
<p>The office itself needs <a href="https://vicuspartners.com/articles/6-office-design-trends-post-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a significant redesign</a>. “You need to have airflow and outdoor space,” Vaamonde explains. “Now that all of the communal indoor spaces are closed or used for offices, people want to have an outdoor area where they can meet and breathe fresh air.”</p>
<p>In fact, says Giridhara Raam M, product evangelist at <a href="https://www.zohocorp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoho Corporation</a>, protecting employees requires a complete rethinking of the office itself. “Considering most of the work spaces operate with a centralized air conditioning system, it is better to avoid it. Work spaces need to be redefined; cubicle systems and socially distanced seating spots with free air flow should be adopted at least for a year. Open offices are even more satisfying than closed spaces, due to droplets.”</p>
<p>The physical configuration of the office has to change. “Cubicles are coming to an end,” Vaamonde says, because they don’t allow for social distancing.</p>
<p>But while barriers can be built around the cubicles, Vaamonde believes they won’t be necessary. The employees won’t be there to use them.</p>
<p>Expect big central offices, such as the ones in downtown Houston where Vaamonde works, to remain mostly empty. Employers may move to smaller offices in the suburbs, she predicts. “They will be more like coworking spaces where you have spaces for a day.” The newly-envisioned office will have more open space, providing larger areas where social distancing can be maintained.</p>
<p>All that assumes your employees are ready to come into the office, however. Don’t count on that.</p>
<h3>You might <em>want</em> employees to return to the office. Good luck with that plan</h3>
<p>Your staff has been <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/the-human-backup-establishing-the-teams-unlikely-successors/">working at home for nearly six months</a>. Many of those people are disinterested in coming back to an office for work. Others may feel that they only need to come into the physical plant occasionally, when they need access to services that are only available in the office, such as a specific test platform that can’t be reached via a cloud connection. And with so many cloud services nowadays, those are rare.</p>
<p>Sarah Riegelhuth, CEO and founder of <a href="https://www.growmyteam.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grow My Team</a>, which specializes in hiring and engaging remote professionals, thinks that the ultimate resolution is for workforces to be mostly remote. “This allows people to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/5/15/21258793/bay-area-exodus-silicon-valley-san-francisco-facebook-google-apple-twitter-housing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">live where they want to be</a>,” she says. It also permits flexible schedules, and other practices that enable staff to be more productive. (One reason: less time lost in social interactions.)</p>
<h3>Still: Some jobs do require on-site participation</h3>
<p>Businesses were forced to accept telework due to the pandemic. But that doesn’t mean everyone in every company can work from home in the long term. Manufacturing jobs, field support, and many service jobs must be done where the work actually is. Employees who deal with intellectual property and personally identifiable information may need to schedule their work so they address sensitive data on their few days in the office.</p>
<p>And there are other factors. This includes choosing which job functions should return to work first.</p>
<p>“Only the data critical roles should return back to corporate premises first, due to security concerns,” says Raam. “Others can stay back and facilitate remote work.” The critical resources can work in shifts assuring there are limited people inside a defined area.</p>
<p>In many cases, the end result is likely to be a mix of in-office workers and people continuing to work from their couches.</p>
<p>Ready or not, you have to change operations to deal with employees who will work at home permanently. Your management, HR, and IT systems need to adjust to a higher percentage of full-time telecommuters, for whom working from home is a better option. It’s your job to find a way to make that work.</p>
<p>That has a significant impact on office IT systems. For example, redefined work spaces mean that workstation locations will change, which affects how office computers connect to the network even if everything is wireless.</p>
<p>Likewise, the business needs to bring communication and security requirements for remote workers up to corporate standards. This may mean providing dedicated lines for employees who don’t have home internet service. Or the company may need to pay for a level of service beyond what the employee might otherwise need. Or a better chair.</p>
<p>Once you admit that the work-at-home phase isn’t temporary, the company may need to provide computers and software if employees are currently using personal computers or laptops. One reason is physical security. When employees use their own computers for work, it’s hard to prevent them from using the same devices for everything from their family’s homework to grocery shopping. The business computer needs client security and communications security products, such as corporate-grade VPNs, firewalls, or network security equipment.</p>
<h3>Split culture</h3>
<p>Finally, there’s the question about how corporate culture affects workers when they’re at home. Office politics will change, if only because it’s hard to get people involved in back-stabbing when their backs are back at home. “The reality is that there’s still a culture,” Riegelhuth says. “In my experience, the culture evolves.”</p>
<p>In many cases, some parts of the corporate culture, notably office politics, are diminished, which helps productivity. In others, such as the informal back channels that help decision making, the impact on the culture may be problematic. But Riegelhuth notes that there are ways to keep back channels and brain storming alive.</p>
<p>“We have a vision, we have a purpose and we have our values. We have a weekly team meeting where everybody comes on to Zoom,” Riegelhuth says. “We get an hour of face time every week.”</p>
<p>“One of the advantages that we’ve seen is looking at our health and wellbeing,” Riegelhuth adds. “Taking sick days used to be frowned on. It used to be a badge of honor not to take sick days.” Now, she says, the company culture has changed to make health and wellbeing important parts of her company’s culture.</p>
<p>There’s a general agreement among both managers and experts that remote working is here to stay. While some employees will always need to be in the building, most won’t. And in many cases, the company will organize itself so that it functions solely online. Some employees need to come to the office occasionally, some on a regular basis and a few most of the time.</p>
<p>But for office workers, the daily 9 – 5 in the building is a thing of the past. It may take some organizations a while to figure that out, but home will be where the heart, and the job, is.</p>
<blockquote><p>While you’re making changes, contemplate the who-does-what questions. For example, have you considered creating a Chief Quality Officer? <a href="https://www.functionize.com/project/why-your-enterprise-needs-a-cqo-chief-quality-officer/">Our white paper</a> goes into the details.</p></blockquote>

In this series, I will be going through a step-by-step tutorial on how you can plan, design and build your very own REST API using Node.js!</p>
<h3 id="before-we-start-">Before we start...</h3>
<p>Some prerequisites you need to follow along:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beginner to intermediate knowledge in JavaScript</li>
<li>Basic understanding of what REST APIs are</li>
<li>Basic understanding of back-end programming and Node.js</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="heads-up-some-tools-we-will-use-">Heads up! Some tools we will use:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio Code or any text editor</li>
<li>POSTman</li>
<li>Node.js and express</li>
<li>MongoDB Atlas</li>
</ul>
<p>For now, you<strong> just need to have a text editor installed</strong> in your computer. I'll explain how to install the rest in this series.</p>
<h2 id="step-1-planning-our-t-api">Step 1: Planning our T-API</h2>
<p>For this tutorial, we will be making a simple API for tea (so random I know). I call it <strong>T-API</strong> because it sounds like "Tea API".</p>
<p>To plan an API, we must first understand what we want it to do. We can write down <strong>user stories</strong> to help us determine what we need in our API design.</p>
<h3 id="our-t-api-user-stories">Our T-API User Stories</h3>
<ol>
<li>I can create a new tea object and add it to the database</li>
<li>I can get all the tea from the database</li>
<li>I can delete all the tea in the database</li>
<li>I can get a single tea by querying its name</li>
<li>I can post a comment to a single tea</li>
<li>I can delete a single tea from the database</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="our-tea-object">Our Tea Object</h3>
<p>Based on our user stories and how we want to use the API, we can draft a sample tea object that the API can return. This helps us to decide what properties to include in the object early in the stage of making this API. So, for T-API, a tea object might look like:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "<span>name</span>": <span>"Jasmine Tea"</span>,
    "<span>image</span>": <span>"an image file url"</span>,
    "<span>description</span>": <span>"Jasmine tea (茉莉花茶) is tea scented with the aroma of jasmine blossoms."</span>,
    "<span>keywords</span>": <span>"aromatic, china, sweet"</span>,
    "<span>origin</span>":<span>"China"</span>,
    "<span>brew time</span>": <span>2</span>,
    "<span>temperature</span>": <span>80</span>,
    "<span>comments</span>": []
}
</code></pre><h2 id="step-2-designing-structure-for-t-api">Step 2: Designing Structure for T-API</h2>
<p>The way to design an API is to visualize its <strong>routes</strong> and <strong>request methods</strong>.</p>
<p>Now that we have understood what we want T-API to do for us, we can come up with a design like so:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>Routes</td><td>HTTP Methods</td><td>Description</td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>/tea</td><td>GET</td><td>Displays all tea</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>/tea</td><td>POST</td><td>Creates a new tea</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>/tea</td><td>DELETE</td><td>Deletes all tea</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>/tea/:name</td><td>GET</td><td>Displays a specific tea, given its name</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>/tea/:name</td><td>POST</td><td>Adds a comment to a specific tea, given its name</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>/tea/:name</td><td>DELETE</td><td>Deletes a specific tea, given its name</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Okay, we have planned and designed our T-API, let's get started with setting up the project!</p>
<h2 id="step-3-install-node-js-and-npm">Step 3: Install Node.js and npm</h2>
<p>Download Node.js (with npm) at: <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" target="_blank">nodejs.org/en/download</a></p>
<p>After it is installed, to check if it is there, go to your command prompt:</p>
<pre><code>node -v
<span>npm</span> -v
</code></pre><h2 id="step-4-initialize-project">Step 4: Initialize project</h2>
<p>Create a new project file and in the root directory, initialize npm by running the following code in the command line:</p>
<pre><code>npm <span>init</span>
</code></pre><p>Answer the questions that follow and a <code>package.json</code> file will be created.</p>
<h2 id="step-5-install-express">Step 5: Install express</h2>
<p>Let's install <strong>express</strong> and save it to our <code>package.json</code> by running:</p>
<pre><code>npm <span>install</span> 
</code></pre><h2 id="step-6-create-server">Step 6: Create server</h2>
<p>Now, we create a <code>server.js</code> file in our project's root directory to take care of the back-end. First, we have to create an Express app with:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> express = <span>require</span>(<span>"express"</span>);
<span>const</span> app = express();
</code></pre><p>Now we can add the code after:</p>
<pre><code>app.<span>use</span>(express.json()); 
</code></pre><p>Then, below it, our listener to ask our server to listen for a request. </p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> listener = app.listen(process.env.PORT || <span>3000</span>, <span><span>()</span> =&gt;</span> {
    <span>console</span>.log(<span>'App is listening on port '</span> + listener.address().port)
})
</code></pre><p>By default, we want to listen on port 3000. However, in cases where the port number is designated from an environment variable, the app will listen on <code>process.env.PORT</code>.</p>
<h2 id="try-a-test-run-">Try a test run!</h2>
<p>So now that we have our server.js set up, let's try running the server by entering </p>
<pre><code><span>node</span> <span>server</span><span>.js</span>
</code></pre><p>into the command line. If it works, you should see the console outputs a message telling you which port it is listening to.</p>

<h3 id="before-we-wrap-up-i-have-a-question-">Before we wrap up, I have a question...</h3>
<p>In order to make this series as beginner-friendly as possible, I added a "Glossary" right below a potentially unfamiliar word to explain it (i.e. express, middleware, etc). Do you like this structure or do you prefer all Glossary terms to be at the end of an article? Please let me know in the comments. Thanks!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Edit: A kind reader told me to put all the glossary at the end, so please find it at the end of this article.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="that-s-all-for-now-">That's all for now!</h2>
<p>Thanks for reading the first article of the series. Technically, I can write about building a REST API into 1 article but it will be too long and I will have to leave out a lot of important details which may confuse code newbies. </p>
<p>I hope this has been a helpful read for you. Be sure to <strong>like, share this article and stay tuned</strong> for the next part where we will start creating our routes and setting up our database in Mongo Atlas! In the meantime, please <strong>ask any questions</strong> in the comments below and read up on the frameworks/concepts/technologies in this article to accelerate your learning. Till next time, cheers!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="glossary">Glossary</h2>
<p>Here are some potentially unfamiliar words I have used in this article. Feel free to read slowly and read the suggested articles for further details.</p>
<h3 id="user-stories">user stories</h3>
<p>According to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story">Wikipedia</a>, a user story is an informal, natural language description of one or more features of a software system. User stories are often written from the perspective of an end user or user of a system.</p>
<h3 id="routes">routes</h3>
<p>Routes are represented as URIs in REST APIs. For example, the index route for an API is '/'. Other routes will be built on it such as '/names' for a route that returns all names or '/pages' for one that returns all pages. 
Read up on basic routing <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://expressjs.com/en/starter/basic-routing.html">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="request-methods">request methods</h3>
<p>Request methods refer to the HTTP methods which specifies the desired action the browser wants to do with the server. Read my article on the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://lo-victoria.com/the-basics-of-http-request-methods-ckb1noib903iel6s1582lccg9">Basics of HTTP Requests</a> for more details. </p>
<h3 id="express">express</h3>
<p>Express is web framework for Node.js to allow easy and robust routing for back-end development. It will be used to create our routes and handle our HTTP requests and any <strong>middleware</strong> for our API. You can read more in its documentation <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://expressjs.com/">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="middleware">middleware</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1594942772687/f1tkx-LGQ.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="middleware.png"></p>
<p>A middleware essentially refers to the software that sits between the client-side requests and the server-side resource. It handles data, provide API management, messaging services as well as authentication. For more information, read up <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware">here</a>.</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered why an increasing number of programs are configured by placing small files in <code>.d</code> directories instead of by just editing a single file?</p>

<p>… while a fresh installation of the more traditional NetBSD barely shows any:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">netbsd:/etc&gt; ls -ld *.d */*.d
drwxr-xr-x  <span>2</span> root  wheel   <span>512</span> Aug  <span>9</span> <span>07</span>:43 fonts/conf.d

netbsd:/etc&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>What’s up with that? The reason is simple:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Supporting configuration updates as part of first-class package management.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But why do <code>.d</code> directories help? Let’s first look at a couple of examples to understand how these directories work and then we’ll get into the why.</p>



<p>To understand how configuration directories work, let’s look at a particular example that exists across the two systems we are looking at. That is the mechanism to apply <code>sysctl</code> configuration changes.</p>

<p>For those not familiar with it, <code>sysctl</code> is a tool <em>and</em> an interface to tune kernel-level settings. On Linux, the <a href="https://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?sysctl+8"><code>sysctl(8)</code> tool</a> is a simple wrapper over the contents of <code>/proc/sys/</code>, but on NetBSD it’s a direct client to the kernel’s <a href="https://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?sysctl+3"><code>sysctl(3)</code> API</a>. For a sneak peek of what these kernel settings involve, type <code>sysctl -a</code> to get a list of all available knobs and their current values.</p>

<p>Because <code>sysctl</code> offers access to tuning kernel-level knobs for the whole system, it seems natural to have a mechanism to configure those at system boot time. After all, if you want to modify how e.g. the virtual memory subsystem works, you will want do that during the early stages of the system’s boot process.</p>

<p>Looking at a NetBSD system, here is what we have:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">netbsd:/etc&gt; ls -l sysctl*
-rw-r--r--  <span>1</span> root  wheel  <span>797</span> Oct <span>12</span>  <span>2018</span> sysctl.conf
netbsd:/etc&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>In this scenario, all kernel settings must be put in the single <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> text file, which is then trivially read at boot time by the <a href="http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/etc/rc.d/sysctl?rev=1.13&amp;content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup&amp;only_with_tag=MAIN"><code>/etc/rc.d/sysctl</code> script</a>. Both human administrators and automated processes have to update this single file if they want to effect change on <code>sysctl</code> settings at boot time.</p>

<p>Let’s compare this to a what Debian system has:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">debian:/etc&gt; ls -l sysctl*
-rw-r--r-- <span>1</span> root root <span>2351</span> May <span>31</span>  <span>2018</span> sysctl.conf

sysctl.d:
total 4K
lrwxrwxrwx <span>1</span> root root  <span>14</span> Apr <span>27</span> <span>13</span>:02 <span>99</span>-sysctl.conf -&gt; ../sysctl.conf
-rw-r--r-- <span>1</span> root root <span>639</span> May <span>31</span>  <span>2018</span> README.sysctl
-rw-r--r-- <span>1</span> root root <span>324</span> May <span>31</span>  <span>2018</span> protect-links.conf
debian:/etc&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>We still have the traditional <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> file but we <em>also</em> have an <code>/etc/sysctl.d/</code> subdirectory. In this case, the <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-sysctl.service.html"><code>systemd-sysctl</code> boot service</a>—because it <em>had</em> to be systemd, of course—iterates over all files under <code>/etc/sysctl.d/</code> <em>in lexicographical order</em> and applies their settings.</p>

<p>Note that I did <em>not</em> mention <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> and that’s because <code>systemd-sysctl</code> couldn’t care less about it. That file location exists for the administrator’s convenience as the traditional place to perform manual edits. But the way <code>systemd-sysctl</code> finds this file is thanks to its <code>/etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf</code> symlink. The <code>99</code> prefix is important, as this causes the administrator-controlled file to sort after all others. In this way, its contents override any other settings that might have been put under the <code>sysctl.d</code> directory by automated tools.</p>

<p>But that’s not the only way configuration directories interact with their corresponding legacy file.</p>



<p>In our previous example, we saw that the <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> file on a Debian system exists purely for the convenience of the administrator. The system does not care about this file directly so its existence in this specific location might as well be removed.</p>

<p>The alternative is to go the complete opposite route: keep the configuration file as the primary location for the configuration, but then make this file explicitly include all contents of a subdirectory.</p>

<p>An obvious example of this behavior is the configuration for the dynamic linker: the <code>ldconfig</code> tool reads the <code>/etc/ld.so.conf</code> file to discover which directories contain dynamic libraries, but is otherwise unaware of the existence of the <code>/etc/ld.so.conf.d/</code> directory. So how is the latter read then? Easy:</p>

<pre><code>debian:/etc&gt; cat ld.so.conf
include /etc/ld.so.conf.d/*.conf
debian:/etc&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As we can see, <code>/etc/ld.so.conf</code> continues to be the primary file, but it then includes all individual files from the configuration directory. This requires native support in the tool to allow file inclusions and also makes the semantics of glob expansion tool-specific (are they in lexicographic order?).</p>

<p>Note that, in this case, the administrator has the freedom to append custom configuration directly to <code>/etc/ld.so.conf</code> or to create a new <em>unmanaged</em> file under <code>/etc/ld.so.conf.d/</code> (say, <code>99-zzz.conf</code>).</p>



<p>Once you start looking, as we did in the first listing, you’ll notice that this pattern repeats everywhere: for any given configuration that <em>needs edits from multiple independent sources</em>, you will likely find a traditional configuration file accompanied by a configuration subdirectory.</p>

<p>So now that we have all necessary knowledge, we are ready to tackle the questions: What are configuration directories for? Why have these configuration directories proliferated? What benefit do they bring? And the answer to them all is the same: <strong>they make automated edits straightforward</strong>, which is important when you want a package manager to perform and <em>own</em> such edits.</p>

<p>You see: if you have a plain text file and you want to edit it programmatically, you have two options. You can have a parser that understands the format of the file and is able to modify it, but then preserving comments and formatting (both of which are important for configuration!) is difficult. Or you can add comment-like markers to the file and perform unstructured edits, but then those edits break if the user happens to modify the file in an unexpected manner.</p>

<p>Contrariwise, if you have a directory where you can put individual files in, and the whole configuration is determined to be the logical concatenation of all these files, all of a sudden automated edits become trivial. A package wanting to add new settings to the system will only need to add a new file in that directory, and the package manager will be able to track the provenance of that file. And if you uninstall the package, the package manager will be able to remove its configuration without issues (possibly leaving behind the files if they were manually modified).</p>



<p>So, are configuration directories better than files?</p>

<p>Well… they are <em>different</em>. With directories, we trade the ability to read and modify a single plain text file <em>by hand</em> with a scheme that is maybe-trickier to hand-tune but that is amenable to …</p></article></div></div></div>

    <h3>Impersonating web browsers with fake error pages</h3>
    <p>December 22, 2019</p>
    <p>If you’ve read my last post on <a href="https://zainamro.com/hacks/analytics-injection-phishing/">client-side injection</a> via an analytics javascript snippet, you probably already know that lately I’ve been thinking about simple methods of deception via unique and unexpected framing. After all, social engineering and other forms of deception usually begin by carefully staging a convincing scene. The perfect scene leaves the potential victim with very little doubt about its authenticity (or at least curious). It’s for this reason that attackers are constantly trying to come up with unique ideas for email phishing. If an attacker can impersonate a credible entity when the person least expects it, they can profit greatly.</p>

    <p>About 9 months ago, I came up with an idea — impersonating a web browser by posing as a fake “native” browser error page (<a href="https://zainamro.com/fake-browser-errors/1/">see example</a>). I created a simple prototype that looks at your user agent and displays the right error page for your browser. For demonstration purposes, only the top 3 desktop browsers are supported: Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. While the idea is quite simple in practice, I believe it has some interesting qualities, namely that there is no obvious way to distinguish it from a real browser error page. With phishing emails, for example, there are often rudimentary methods which can expose an attacker like looking closely at the email address, domain, or language of the email itself. With a fake browser error page, there is nothing that is visibly obvious — the url address bar and the contents of the page are as you’d expect.</p>

    <p>Once you’ve established an anchor of authenticity via a browser error, you’ve now opened up the door to more interesting possibilities. One idea would be to show a popup upon leaving the page and ask for the person’s information as a means of browser error reporting in the same way that operating systems sometimes ask you to report an unexpected crash (<a href="https://zainamro.com/fake-browser-errors/2/">see example</a>). Using a prompt with the native browser GUI, this could potentially trick less sophisticated users. An even scarier and less obvious strategy would be to subtly notify the person that their browser is outdated and prompt them to download a newer version, thereby tricking them to install your malware (<a href="https://zainamro.com/fake-browser-errors/3/">see example</a>). Because browsers don’t show any indication of error in their native GUI when a website error occurs, this gives fake browser error pages the ability to speak on the behalf of the browser to some extent. I believe with the right audience, these types of attacks can be frighteningly effective.</p>

Automating deployment, scaling, and management of his containerized applications.</li></ol><h3 id="some-other-things-chuka-thinks-about-in-regards-to-lean-devops-and-selecting-new-tools-while-refining-his-strengths-are-">Some other things Chuka thinks about in regards to Lean DevOps and selecting new tools while refining his strengths are:</h3><ol><li><a href="https://helm.sh/"><strong>Helm</strong></a> — Dead simple package manager for Kubernetes.</li><li><a href="https://www.terraform.io/"><strong>Terraform</strong></a> — Safely and predictably create, change, and improve your infrastructure.</li><li><strong>CICD</strong> — “You don’t need the full CI/CD pipeline using the same provider (for example, CircleCI) if you have a VM that can run Skaffold which can create and package a Docker container,” says Chuka, “In 15 minutes you can be up and running.”</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower/status/953638870888849408"><strong>GitOps</strong></a> — “With the new GitOps paradigm, engineers don’t need to know what the Ops are doing. You can have a single person Ops team.”</li></ol><p>We hope you learned something new that will increase your productivity in your daily dev workflows.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Imagine the worst cafe rush-hour line you’ve ever had to wade through to get your latte. Now, instead of coffee, imagine that at the end of this hellish line was the data you needed about your products, pipeline, or customer behavior. Each time you need your data fix, you have to get up from your desk, walk down the hall, out of your house or office, and then wait in a queue behind hundreds of other people.</p><p>At the end of that line, instead of baristas, sit your data analysts, handing out the data that each individual person asks for. If anyone ends up needing more context, they have to get back in line and wait all over again.</p><p>If this sounds like a nightmare, that’s because it is. But it reflects a real constraint for many companies who haven’t democratized their data.</p><p>The future isn’t a data dictatorship—it’s self-service data democracy. One where, instead of waiting in line at a cafe for coffee, you can walk up to your own kitted-out setup in your office and get exactly what you need yourself.</p><p>Amplitude is the perfect example of this data-like-home-cafe approach to modern business. So I sat down with Justin Bauer, Amplitude executive vice president of product, to get some insight into how the company created a self-service data democracy that bridges the art and science of product development.</p><p><em>“Just like anything, [building a self-service data democracy is about] people, processes, and tools—in that order.” — Amplitude Executive Vice President of Product Justin Bauer</em></p><p>Sounds simple enough. But, below, we’ll take a closer look at what went into building the self-service data democracy that underpins one of the best data products around.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>1. Amplitude’s culture is built around a North Star.</strong></h2><p>A<a href="https://amplitude.com/blog/2018/03/21/product-north-star-metric"> North Star metric</a> is a single bar that everyone on every team at your company can use to measure whether or not your product is living up to the hype. It's the main support pillar that holds up your self-service data democracy.</p><p>The idea isn’t new, but it’s one that Amplitude has taken to heart and made their own.</p><p>For Bauer and the Amplitude team, their North Star is<a href="https://amplitude.com/blog/2018/03/21/product-north-star-metric"> weekly learning users</a> (WLUs). A WLU is an active Amplitude user who shares a resource they created with at least two other people within a week. Basically, it measures both initial user engagement, and whether or not users find the product worth sharing.</p><p>“It really ended up being the perfect metric for us to really reflect on what we were working on,” Bauer said.</p><p>But setting their sights on this guiding light wasn’t enough to align with it. Amplitude needed to create a culture and a system of habits that chased WLUs at every level of the company. To do this, Bauer and his team did three things:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Put into words the most basic promise of their product</strong> to understand what all other work should be in service to.</li><li><strong>Identified what <em>one </em>metric most signifies whether or not their product is useful to users.</strong> The performance of this metric was a binary tell of whether or not they’re following through on their promise to customers.</li><li><strong>Created a constellation of metrics that surrounded their North Star</strong> to build out the net of a self-service data democracy and give each team a way to make progress toward their North Star.</li></ol><p>Anyone who has heard of Amplitude knows that their main promise is to make it easier to build good products through data and collaboration. This mission clearly pointed in the direction of the company’s North Star, but the Amplitude team needed to come up with a constellation of metrics that would align work at every level with this guiding goal.</p><p>These supporting metrics were in direct service to boosting WLUs and gave each contributor a way to measure their performance and impact, without the need for data analysts or engineers. No more waiting in a long line to find out how products and features were performing.</p><p>“We really think of it not just as necessarily a single metric but also a constellation of metrics that all help guide you towards your product strategy,” Bauer said.</p><p>By filling their proverbial skies with metrics that all supported the one common goal of driving up WLUs—and, therefore, improving how worthwhile users found the platform—they built a culture that was wholly aligned with their main promise.</p><p>As a result, each team’s daily work furthers their progress toward their North Star metric and fits the transparent data-driven product strategy that supports it.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>2. They make sure everyone understands the data.</strong></h2><p>It’s all well and good if your employees have access to the data they—and others—produce, but they can’t make strong business decisions if they don’t understand what that data means. Without informed citizens, your self-service data democracy will shrivel up.</p><p>Back before the days of companies like Amplitude, the only people who understood data were the ones who created it, mainly the aforementioned engineers and data analysts. This created our nightmarish cafe scenario from the beginning.</p><p>Thankfully, Bauer and his team, like many industry leaders, took the secondhand gold of why data dictatorships suck and did the opposite. They intentionally and consistently educated their teams to ensure that they knew where to go for data, how to read its insights, and how to integrate those insights into practice.</p><p>The way that Amplitude began to foster this understanding is the same process for how they maintain the knowledge today:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Give each team and contributor a micro metric</strong> <strong>to focus on</strong> that lines up with daily work and supports the overall North Star metric.</li><li><strong>Educate team members on the tools</strong> available to them to pull and read data insights.</li><li><strong>Encourage team members to look closely at data</strong> to answer everyday tasks and experiment with new ideas.</li><li><strong>Anchor all product decisions to data</strong>, and clearly communicate how the work of each team affects higher-level goals.</li></ul><p>By making sure everyone from sales to engineering understands the data they’re creating—and knows how to create high-quality data through data governance (as we’ll discuss below)—Bauer and the Amplitude team empowered their democratic citizens to make the best decisions possible.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>3. Amplitude empowers engineers to use data themselves.</strong></h2><p>The truth is, while engineers are an integral part of building a great product, they’re traditionally seen as the last part of the implementation waterfall. This cuts off at the knees the decision-making power and insights of developers, and it’s time that changed.</p><p>In a self-service data democracy, Bauer said, engineers need to be empowered to use data themselves. Doing so lets them see the direct impact of their work and helps them make better cases for features they think would make the product stronger.</p><p>“Engineers can actually even use metrics to try to fight for the areas they want to invest behind,” Bauer said. “It's a great way to actually democratize who's even making product decisions.”</p><p>So, to make both engineers better and the product stronger, Amplitude handed engineers the key to their data democracy. This not only made their engineers happier but also helped them be more engaged in the work they were doing, Bauer said.</p><p><em>“Now they are highly incentivized to actually do the instrumentation because they want to see if the work they're doing is actually helping improve those metrics and helping the business grow.”</em></p><p>But this wasn’t simply a matter of granting engineers access to data tools. The process, like that of educating the company as a whole about data, had to be done intentionally through the following steps:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Bring engineers into the strategy and goal setting</strong> early on so everyone is on the same page.</li><li><strong>Educate engineers on how Amplitude measured success</strong> so they can measure their work in relation to the North Star metric.</li><li><strong>Develop a</strong><a href="https://www.avo.app/blog/our-definitive-guide-to-tracking-plans"><strong> well-thought-out tracking plan</strong></a> to ensure analytics implementation is done consistently from the beginning.</li><li><strong>Empower engineers to use data tools</strong> to see how their product decisions affect performance and experiment with new features.</li></ul><p>When Amplitude’s engineers were given a seat at the table and empowered to make the case for new features and improvements through data, the whole organization was able better fulfill its promise to customers.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>4. They focus on creating great governance.</strong></h2><p>Good governance is at the heart of all successful democracies and ensures that people have access to high-quality data and that processes are in place to continue this in the future.</p><p>“Leading companies are starting to realize that, in a world of data democracy, governance is important,” Bauer said. “If you invest behind that, then you get the dividends of self-service data democracy ... [But] it actually takes a lot of work to govern data well, to ensure that the people have the right levels of access and what they’re accessing is high quality.”</p><p>Rather than restrict contributors and only give them access to the data directly related to their jobs via analysts, Amplitude created a detailed governance strategy that ensured the free flow of consistent, correct information.</p><p>But this didn’t happen overnight. Good data takes hard work and<a href="https://www.avo.app/blog/data-governance-maturity-model-how-mature-is-your-approach-to-data"> mature governance</a>.</p><p><em>“You can’t just get democracy for free.”</em></p><p>Amplitude “paid” for good governance by investing in and enforcing data best practices, standardization documents, and tracking plans. These efforts helped them create a clean, single source of data truth that evolves with the company as time goes on.</p><p>“There’s a lot more focus on data quality, and people are starting to really treat it the same way you might treat something like code quality,” Bauer said. “You actually have to have even higher data quality to ensure that people make the right decisions.”</p><p>To create governance to guide every team within the company, while granting access to data at every level, Amplitude worked through the following steps:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Audited the current state of tracking and governance</strong> to understand what was already in place.</li><li><strong>Created a map of their customer life cycle and the metrics that support it</strong> to ensure that their customer life cycle complemented their North Star metric.</li><li><strong>Assigned a point person</strong>…</li></ul></div></div>

I'm talking about <strong>researching analogous problems in other fields</strong> that have already been solved (or have failed to be solved) by companies in those markets.</p><p>In my experience, these analogies are hugely beneficial for two primary purposes: storytelling and solution design.</p><h2>Storytelling</h2><p>Analogies should always take a back seat to a clear, compelling, empathy-inducing problem statement, but as a product manager pitching or explaining the problem you're solving, analogies can be powerful frames of reference for others. This can be true in a wide variety of situations such as:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Pitching your work to executives, investors, managers.</p></li><li><p>Getting buy-in from non-product groups who may be necessary to fully solve your problem statement or are impacted by the solution.</p></li><li><p>Building excitement in the product, engineering, design teams who will be working on this problem. </p></li></ul><h2>Solution Design</h2><p>Analogies have the potential to be either beneficial or detrimental to solution design. It’s important to make it clear to your product team that the analogy is not the solution but a jump-start for the solution design process. Without calling that out up front, analogies can stifle creativity and put the team in a copying mindset. When used correctly, analogies will provide the product team with a launching point for conversation and permission to think outside the box.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Today I will argue why <em>silent rules</em> are a useful feature of good build systems.</p>

<hr>

<p>Build systems <em>build stuff</em>, mainly by invoking other tools, like compilers, linkers, code generators and file system manipulation tools. Build tools were traditionally printing some indication of progress. Make displays the commands as they are executed. CMake displays a quasi progress bar, including the name of the compiled file and a counter. </p>

<p>Interestingly, it seems the more <em>vertically</em> oriented, the <em>less</em> output shows up by default. If you need to hand-craft a solution out of parts, like with make, debugging the parts is important to the program you are building. Compare the verbosity of a autotools build system with a <code>go build ./...</code> invocation, that can build many thousands of programs and libraries. The former prints walls of text, the latter prints, nothing, unless there's an error.</p>

<p>As an extreme case, this is taken from the build log of Firefox 79. This is the command used to compile a single file. Note that the command is not really verbatim, as the <code>&lt;&lt;PKGBUILDDIR&gt;&gt;</code> parts hide long directory names used internally in the real log (this part is coming from the Debian build system). Also note that despite the length, this is a single line.</p>

<p>This particular build log is 299738 lines long. That's about 40MB of text output, for a <em>single build</em>.</p>

<p>Obvously, not all builds are alike. There is value in an overly verbose log, like this one, because when something fails the log may be all you get. It is useful to be able to repeat the exact steps taken to see the failure in order to fix it.</p>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum you can look at incremental builds, performed locally while editing the source. There some things are notable:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The initial build is much like the one quoted above, except that the log file will not be looked at by hand. An IDE may parse it to pick up warnings or errors. Many developers don't use IDEs and just run the build and ignore the wall of text it produces, as long as it doesn't fail entirely.</p></li>
<li><p>As code is changed, the build system will re-compile the parts that became invalidated by the changes. This can be as little as one .c file or as many as all the .c files, that include a common header that was changed. Interestingly computing the number of files that need changes may take a while and it may be faster to fire start compiling even before the whole set is known. Having a precise progress bar may be detrimental to the performance.</p></li>
<li><p>The output of the compiler may be more important than the invocation of the compiler. After all, it's very easy to invoke the build system again. Reading a page-long argument list to <code>gcc</code> is less relevant than the printed error or warning.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That last point is what I want to focus on. The whole idea is to <em>hide or simplify</em> some information, in order to present other kind of information <em>more prominently</em>. We <em>attenunate</em> the build command to <em>amplify</em> the compiler output.</p>

<p>Compare those two <code>make check</code> output logs from my toy library. I'm working on a few new manual pages and I have a rule which uses <code>man</code> to verify syntax. Note that I specifically used markup that wraps long lines, as this is also something you'd see in a terminal window.</p>

<p>This is what you get out of the box:</p>

<p>Advancement in computer vision technology can not only empower self-driving cars but also assist developers in building unbiased facial recognition solutions. However, the dearth of 3D images is impeding the development of computer vision technology. Today, most of the existing image data are in 2D, but 3D data are equally essential for researchers as well as developers to understand the real-world effectively. 3D images of varied objects can allow them to create superior computer vision solutions that can revolutionize the way we live. But, gathering 3D images is not as straightforward as collecting 2D images. It is near impossible to manually collect 3D images of every object in the world. Consequently, to mitigate one of the longest standing predicaments around 3D images, researchers from the University of Oxford proposed a novel approach of creating 3D images from 2D raw single-view images.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The effectiveness of the approach was recognized by one of the largest computer vision conferences —&nbsp;<a href="http://cvpr2020.thecvf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</a>&nbsp;— as the&nbsp;<a href="http://cvpr2020.thecvf.com/node/817#best-paper-award" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best paper</a>&nbsp;of the year award.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let us understand how researchers blazed a trail to accomplish this strenuous task of generating 3D images using single-view 2D images.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Creating 3D Images&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>The researchers of the Visual Geometry Group, University of Oxford —&nbsp;Shangzhe&nbsp;Wu, Christian Rupprecht, and Andrea&nbsp;Vedaldi&nbsp;— introduced unsupervised learning of probably symmetric deformable 3D objects from images in the wild. The idea behind the technique is to create 3D images of symmetric objects from single-view 2D images without supervising the process. The method is based on an autoencoder — a machine learning technique to encode input images and then provide output by reconstructing it with decoders. In this work, an autoencoder factors each input image into depth, albedo, viewpoint, and illumination. While the depth is to identify the information related to the distance of surfaces of objects from a viewpoint, albedo is the reflectivity of a surface. Along with depth and albedo, viewpoint and illumination are crucial for creating 3D images as well; the variation in light and shadow is obtained from the illumination with the changing angle/viewpoint of the observer. All the aforementioned concepts play an important role in image processing to obtain 3D images. These factors will be used to generate 3D images by further processing and clubbing it back together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To create 3D images with depth, albedo, viewpoint, and illumination, the researchers leveraged the fact that numerous objects in the world have a symmetric structure. Therefore, the research was mostly limited to symmetric objects such as human faces, cat faces, and cars from single-view images.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Challenges&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Motivated to understand images more naturally for 3D image modelling, the researchers worked under two challenging conditions. Firstly, they ensured that no 2D or 3D ground truth information such as key points, segmentation, depth maps, or prior knowledge of a 3D model was utilized while training the model. Being unaware of every detail of images while generating 3D images is essential as this would eliminate the bottleneck of gathering image annotations for computer vision solutions. Secondly, the researchers had to create 3D images using only single-view images. In other words, it eliminates the need to collect multiple views of the same object. Considering these two problems was vital for the researchers because it would expedite working with fewer images while making computer vision-based applications.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Approach&nbsp;</h3>



<p>In this work, the internal decomposition of images into albedo, depth, viewpoint, and illumination was carried out without supervision. Following this, the researchers used symmetry as a geometric cue to construct 3D images with the generated four factors of input images. Although objects might never be completely symmetric, neither in shape nor appearance, the researchers compensated for their consideration later in their work. For instance, one cannot always take the left part of a face to construct the other half of the face considering symmetry, as hairstyle or expression of humans may vary. Similarly, albedo can be non-symmetric since the texture of a cat’s both sides of the face may differ. And to make the matter worse, even if both shape and albedo are symmetric, the appearance may still be different due to illumination. To mitigate these challenges, the researchers devised two approaches. They explicitly modelled illumination to recover the shape of the input objects’ images. In addition, they augmented the model to reason the absence of symmetry in objects while generating 3D images.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By combining the two methods, the researchers built an end-to-end learning formulation that delivered exceptional results compared to previous research that used an unsupervised approach for morphing 3D images. Besides, the researchers were able to outperform a recent state-of-the-art<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09202" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">method</a>&nbsp;that leveraged supervision for creating 3D images from 2D images.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Techniques Of Creating 3D Images from 2D Images</h3>



<p>The four factors — albedo, depth, viewpoint, and illumination — that are decomposed from the input images are supposed to regenerate the image on their combination. But, due to the asymmetric nature of objects, even for the faces of humans and cats, clubbing the albedo, depth, viewpoint, and illumination, might not be able to replicate the input image in 3D. To compensate<strong>&nbsp;</strong>for their earlier consideration of symmetricity of objects, even though objects were not really symmetric, the researchers devised two measures. According to researchers, asymmetries arise from shape deformation, asymmetric albedo, and illumination. Therefore, they explicitly&nbsp;modelled&nbsp;asymmetric illumination. They then ensured that the model estimates a confidence score for each pixel in the input image that explains the probability of the pixel having a symmetric counterpart in the image.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The technique can be explained broadly in two different steps as follows: –&nbsp;</p>



<p>1. Photo-geometric autoencoder for image formation&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. How symmetries are modelled&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="419" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.analyticsdrift.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2.png?resize=640%2C419&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.analyticsdrift.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2.png?w=722&amp;ssl=1 722w, https://i1.wp.com/www.analyticsdrift.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2.png?resize=300%2C197&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Creating 3D images from 2D images</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Photo-geometric&nbsp;autonecoder:&nbsp;</strong>After deforming the input images into albedo, depth, viewpoint, and illumination, the reconstruction takes place in two steps: lighting and reprojection. While the lightning function creates<strong>&nbsp;</strong>a version of the object based on the depth map, light direction, albedo, as seen from a canonical viewpoint, the reprojection function simulates the effect of a viewpoint change and generates images given the canonical depth and shaded canonical image.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Probably symmetric objects:&nbsp;</strong>Creating 3D image from 2D images requires determining the object points in images that are symmetric. By combining depth and albedo, the researchers were able to get a canonical frame.&nbsp;But,&nbsp;this process was also carried out by flipping the depth and albedo along a horizontal axis. This was embraced to get another image that was reconstructed with the flipped depth and albedo. Following this, they used the reconstruction losses of both the images that were leveraged for reasoning the symmetry probabilistically while generating the 3D images. The imperfections in created images caused blurry reconstruction. However, it was addressed by adding perceptual loss — a function to compare discrepancies among images.</p>



<h3>Benchmarking&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The model created by the researchers was put to the test on three human face datasets —&nbsp;CelebA, 3DFAW, and BFM. While&nbsp;CelebA&nbsp;consists of images of real human faces in the wild annotated with bounding boxes, the 3DFAW contains 23k images with 66 3D&nbsp;keypoint&nbsp;annotations, which was used for assessing the resulting 3D images. The BFM (Basel Face Model) is a synthetic face model considered for evaluating the quality of 3D reconstructions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers implemented the protocol&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01261" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of this paper</a>&nbsp;to obtain a dataset, sampling shapes, poses, textures, and illumination randomly. They also used SUN Database for background and saved ground truth depth maps to evaluate their generated 3D images.</p>



<p>“Since the scale of 3D reconstruction from projective cameras is inherently ambiguous, we discount it in the evaluation. Specifically, given the depth map predicted by our model in the canonical view, we wrap it to a depth map in the actual view using the predicted viewpoint and compare the latter to the ground-truth depth map using the scale-invariant depth error (SIDE),” noted the authors in the preprint paper.</p>



<p>Besides, the researchers reported the mean angle deviation (MAD), which can estimate how well the surface of generated images are captured.</p>



<p>This comparison is carried out by a function that evaluates the depth, albedo, viewpoint, lighting, and confidence maps using individual neural networks. While encoder-decoder networks generate the depth and albedo, viewpoint and lighting are regressed using simple encoder networks.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="229" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.analyticsdrift.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1.png?resize=640%2C229&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.analyticsdrift.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1.png?w=723&amp;ssl=1 723w, https://i2.wp.com/www.analyticsdrift.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1.png?resize=300%2C107&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.analyticsdrift.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1.png?resize=720%2C259&amp;ssl=1 720w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>



<p>The above table compares the depth reconstruction quality achieved by leveraging photo-geometric autoencoders with other baselines: fully-supervised baseline, const. null depth, and average g.t depth (BFM dataset was used to create all the models). The unsupervised model outperforms the other models by a wider margin; a lower MAD means the deviation of generated and original images were bare minimal.</p>



<p>To understand how significant every step of the model construction was, the researchers evaluated the individual parts of the model by making several modifications.</p>



<p>Following approaches were tweaked:&nbsp;</p>



<p>1. Assessment by avoiding the albedo flip</p>



<p>2. Evaluation by ignoring the depth flip</p>



<p>3. Predicting shading map instead of computing it from depth and light direction</p>



<p>4. Avoiding the implementation of …</p></div></div></div>

                What's flying above us?
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm working to make it easy to find out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's how:
            </p>

            
            <p>
                My <a href="https://twitter.com/lemonodor/status/1294002338215034880">Advisory Circular network of
                    twitter bots</a> post in real-time whenever they detect aircraft
                flying in circles over cities around the world, including Los Angeles, Baltimore, Portland, Minneapolis,
                and London. The bots often tweet about news and fire aircraft, and because they use an uncensored source
                of data they also tweet police, FBI, DHS, DEA, CBP, and military
                aircraft. They look for circles because it means an aircraft is <i>doing something</i> instead of
                <i>going somewhere</i>. If you've ever asked “what is that helicopter/plane?” there’s a good chance my
                bots can answer your question—even if it's an advanced military surveillance plane:

            <p>
                A few years ago I <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sowJrQQfgxnLCErb-CvUV8VGXdtca6SWYWWLRPZgaHI/edit?usp=sharing">discovered
                    a secret FBI aerial surveillance program</a>, involving more than 100 aircraft
                registered to front companies. I was one of the first people to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9508812">post online</a> about the program.
            </p>
            <p>From a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150605064602/http://fusion.net/story/143739/how-you-can-track-the-fbis-spy-planes/">Fusion
                    Media
                    article</a>:</p>
            <blockquote>
                This week, the Associated Press reported that the FBI is regularly flying “spy planes” over American
                cities.

                The report, which revealed the front companies the FBI uses to fly the planes, wasn’t a surprise to John
                Wiseman, a technologist in Los Angeles. Based on public records, he had already figured out some of the
                planes the FBI was flying and, using a
                device he programmed to intercept airplane transmissions, had identified over the last month the ones
                flying overhead in L.A. in real time.
                Wiseman wrote in a Hacker News comment in May about his findings, revealing a month ago what the AP
                reported today.
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                I continue to help journalists with stories related to government aerial surveillance.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I created a <a href="https://twitter.com/lemonodor/status/1238149529469202433">Siri shortcut</a> that
                lets you ask what's overhead at any time, and it will tell you what
                the nearest aircraft is and who it's registered to. It uses the same uncensored data source as
                the Advisory Circular bots.
            </p>

                I've always funded this work myself, but now I'm in the situation of having been furloughed without pay
                since April.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ve spent hundreds of hours in development work trying to bring the public this essential
                information for free. I'd like to continue this work, both supporting existing projects and implementing
                new ideas (I'd also like to replace my broken laptop).
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>Oddly, I don't remember when or how I got my hands on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.toshiba-memory.com/products/toshiba-wireless-sd-cards-flashair-w-04/">Toshiba <em>FlashAir</em></a> card. These WiFi-enabled SD cards are made to transfer photos from a digital camera to a computer.</p>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/flashair.png">
              <p><img data-src="assets/img/wartor/flashair.png" src="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/flashair.png">
              </p>
            </a>

            <div>
              <p>Imaginging that someone would use a 4MBps wireless connection to transfer photos when the hardware transfer is closer to 70MBps seems ridiculous.</p>
              <p>However, it could come in handy if you're in a situation where you don't have access to an SD card reader, or want to easily preview photos on a phone or tablet.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
              <h3>Digging into the <em>FlashAir</em></h3>
            </p>
            <div>
              <p>What's far more interesting about these Toshiba cards is the fact that they are essentially programmed to act as a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_access_point">wireless access point (WAP)</a>. You can setup a custom SSID and password— connecting directly to the card over 2.4GHz.</p>
              <p>After peeking at the filesystem, I realized that the main photo gallery application hosted on the card is essentially a static website— served as basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
            </div>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/flashair-filesystem.png">
              <p><img data-src="assets/img/wartor/flashair-filesystem.png" src="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/flashair-filesystem.png">
              </p>
            </a>

            <p>My excitement with this bit of tech was the possibility of building a totally discrete microserver that would be capable of hosting a few pages and services.</p>

            <p>
              <h3>Project Inspiration</h3>
            </p>
            <div>
              <p>My fourth-year undergraduate architecture studio, entitled <em>Dark Rooms</em>, was taught by <a target="_blank" href="https://m-a-u-s-e-r.net/">Mona Mahall</a>. The studio was split into three exhibitions: <em>Pyramid, Server and Backstage</em>. These exhibitions were meant to explore the "spaces between visibility and invisibility".</p>
              <p>In the second exhibition, <em>Server</em>, we were asked to consider the design of an anti-human space— a dark, cold, electronic archive built exclusively for machines. In my preliminary research, I was particularly interested in artists like <a target="_target" href="https://arambartholl.com/dead-drops/">Adam Bartholl</a>.</p>
              <p>His project, a USB "<a target="_blank" href="http://deaddrops.com/">dead drop</a>", drew inspiration from an information-sharing tactic used by spies. A predetermined secret location— such as a hollowed-out rock, brick, log or other object— would be used to discreetly stash an important item.</p>
            </div>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/USB-dead-drop.png">
              <p><img data-src="assets/img/wartor/USB-dead-drop.png" src="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/USB-dead-drop.png">
              </p>
            </a>

            <p>Once the item— perhaps a slip of paper or a key— is "dropped", a second party could then retrieve it without interacting directly with the other person or being detected in the exchange.</p>

            <p>
              <h3>Wireless Anonymous Repository</h3>
            </p>
            <div>
              <p>While a USB is already a much more "invisible" way of storing and exchanging information, I wanted to take this concept a step further. Using the <em>FlashAir</em> cards, I proposed a new wireless dead drop that could be just as affordable and simple as the USB, but with a myriad of superior qualities.</p>
              <p>Writing directly to the card requires an SD card slot; however, the wireless functionality can be powered without a desktop or laptop. A typical SD card takes 2.4-3.6V at about 30mA. I found that by using an SD-to-USB adapter, one could power the wireless module from a standard 5V USB outlet.</p>
            </div>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/wartor-AC.png">
              <p><img data-src="assets/img/wartor/wartor-AC.png" src="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/wartor-AC.png">
              </p>
            </a>

            <p>Depending on the location of the dead drop, this could be concealed within a false junction box that would be plugged in over the top of a standard 2-outlet 120V AC. If— in the spirit of the original USB dead drop— you wanted to embed the card in a brick wall, then the device could be powered from a USB powerbank.</p>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/wartor-outlet.png">
              <p><img data-src="assets/img/wartor/wartor-outlet.png" src="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/wartor-outlet.png">
              </p>
            </a>

            <p>I named the project <em>warTOR</em> for "wireless anonymous repo" + <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)">TOR</a>. Though it's not connected to the Tor network in any way, I thought this title captured the spirit of anonymity (plus I wanted to use some Pokémon sprites). If someone would like to try it, the Toshiba cards <em>can</em> be setup as a wireless bridge... from a Tor gateway?</p>

            <p>
              <h3>Future Plans</h3>
            </p>
            <div>
              <p>Something else that I'd like to try is powering the card via a small solar cell, but I haven't gotten there yet... The greatest benefit of the wireless dead drop is that one could log into the WAP from their cellphone, upload or download a file, and no one could discern that any sort of exchange was happening. However, I'm also working on a clientside chat application that could be hosted on the cards.</p>
              <p>With this implemented, then two people could sit down in a café and send messages back and forth over the private network; or, someone could login to the network and type out a message for the other person to see at a later date.</p>
            </div>

              </p>
            </a>

            <div>
              <p>Here are some screenshots from the application 👆. I'll be doing a follow-up post with a GitHub link to the <em>FlashAir</em> CONFIG file that I'm using on my card. I'll also upload the source code for the original <em>warTOR</em> server with instructions on how you can deploy your own <em>warTOR</em> in the wild!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      <p>
        <b>TLDR:</b> Create a super simple minimalist blog with little to no coding
        experience. Get <a href="https://bear.app/" target="_blank">Bear</a> (only available on
        Apple devices), export notes as HTML files, upload to GitHub, then link
        to host/domain. Profit!
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I love things that are stripped down to the bare essentials, but still
        do their job well. I try to replicate this in both my personal and work
        life. Here’s why:
      </p>
      
      <p>Big chunky things = Scary</p>
      <p>Scary = Never gets done</p>
      <p>Small and super simple = Gets done</p>
      
      <p>
        To get stuff done, I break down and simplify tasks to a degree that some
        might consider excessive. This forcing function also helps me consider
        and address core issues versus symptoms. This post is about how I used
        this approach to quickly create a blog.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Having used Bear for years to keep a daily journal, I decided to start writing online. With Bear as the inspiration, I listed what I needed
        <b>now</b>, ignoring what I might one day use. The first approach leads to a simple but finished project, the momentum of a win, and the option for future
        improvements. The latter invites indecision, complexity, delays, and usually doesn’t get me very far.
      </p>
      
      <p>My ideal blog needed to be:</p>
      <ol start="1">
        <li>Self hosted on a custom domain.</li>
        <li>Exceedingly easy to set up and update.</li>
        <li>Text based. Images were not an immediate priority.</li>
        <li>Styled for readability.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>
        By listing problems <b>before</b> looking for solutions, I can quickly
        filter results that don’t match. I’m then less likely to fall prey to
        premature optimisation, marketing or <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/aesthetic-usability-effect/" target="_blank">aesthetic usability bias</a>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Most solutions (including Wordpress) simply did too much. Paradox of
        choice was another issue. Having so many off-the-shelf options, each
        with a microcosm of near infinite themes and widgets, was just too overwhemling. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I took a step back and considered if my time would instead be better spent building a blog from scratch. A quick Google once again
        presented a paradox of choice; an endless number of ways or frameworks to choose from. I’m not a programmer and didn’t know where to start, so
        I took another step back. I drew up a simple plan, filled in some blanks, and decided to ask a friend about the rest.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I realised that Bear could export notes in HTML, including all the CSS styling at the bottom. This was a huge win as I could use Bear to create a simple home               
        page with a title, a paragraph, and an unordered list of links to individual posts. As for the posts themselves, I just needed to write them up in Bear 
        and export them.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Enter <a href="https://kasun.io/" target="_blank">Kasun</a>, a friend, indie-hacker and
        freelance programmer (who’s currently working remotely while travelling
        across Sri Lanka). He was kind enough to teach me some basics about
        HTML, hosting, and linking domains. Here’s what we did:
      </p>
      <br>
      <ol start="1">
        <li>Create and export notes from Bear.</li>
        <li>Create a <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> account and paste the
          exported code into a project.
        </li>
        <li>Use <a href="https://vercel.com/" target="_blank">Vercel’s</a> free tier for hosting
          and link to Github.
        </li>
        <li>Link domain to Vercel.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>
        That’s pretty much it really. For someone familiar with the basics, it
        would have taken under 15 mins to have a minimalist, well styled, and
        self-hosted blog, all without writing a single line of code.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In the end, not only did I get my blog, but I also learned some basic
        web development! It’s a big win in my book and I wanted to share this
        post in case others (especially other Bear fans) want to do something
        similar.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3 id="Postscript notes:">Postscript notes:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Considering the number of available options, it’s likely that I missed something that would have been a good fit. If so, feel free to tweet me a link.
        </li>
        <li>This blog is the first website I’ve built and has helped me realise that code isn’t as “scary” as I once thought 😊.
        </li>
        <li>Images aren’t included by default in Bear HTML exports. To include them, you have to manually upload the picture to your GitHub project and then include a link in the relevant HTML file as part of an image tag.
        </li>
        <li>Developer friends have mentioned that the formatting of the exported html file isn’t great. While not a huge problem for me, I will use it as a way to learn more about formatting best practices.
        </li>
        <li>Big thanks to the talented <a href="https://kasun.io/" target="_blank">Kasun</a> for
          the help! I can’t recommend him enough if you’re on the lookout for a
          freelance developer. If you’re a designer, be sure to check out

          to hear from you!

    <p>Over the past few years, Python has exploded in popularity for data science,
machine learning, deep learning and numerical computing. New frameworks
pushing forward the state of the art in these fields are appearing every
year. One unintended consequence of all this activity and creativity has been
fragmentation in the fundamental building blocks - multidimensional array
(tensor) and dataframe libraries - that underpin the whole Python data
ecosystem. For example, arrays are fragmented between Tensorflow, PyTorch,
NumPy, CuPy, MXNet, Xarray, Dask, and others. Dataframes are fragmented
between Pandas, PySpark, cuDF, Vaex, Modin, Dask, Ibis, Apache Arrow, and
more. This fragmentation comes with significant costs, from whole libraries
being reimplemented for a different array or dataframe library to end users
having to re-learn APIs and best practices when they move from one framework
to another.</p>
<p><img src="https://data-apis.org/images/ecosystem_fragmentation.png" alt="Ecosystem growing up in silos"></p>
<p>Today, we are announcing the Consortium for Python Data API Standards, which
aims to tackle this fragmentation by developing API standards for arrays
(a.k.a. tensors) and dataframes. We aim to grow this Consortium into an
organization where cross-project and cross-ecosystem alignment on APIs, data
exchange mechanisms and other such topics happens. These topics require
coordination and communication to a much larger extent than they require
technical innovation. We aim to facilitate the former, while leaving the
innovating to current and future individual libraries.</p>
<p><em>Want to get started right away? Collect data on your own API usage with</em>
<em><a href="https://github.com/data-apis/python-record-api">python-record-api</a>.</em>
<em>And for array or dataframe maintainers: we want to</em>
<em>hear what you think – see the end of this post.</em></p>
<h2 id="bootstrapping-an-organization-and-involving-the-wider-community">Bootstrapping an organization and involving the wider community</h2>
<p>The goal is ambitious, and there are obvious hurdles, such as answering
questions like “what is the impact of a technical decision on each library?”.
There’s a significant amount of engineering and technical writing to do to
create overviews and data that can be used to answer such questions. This
requires dedicated time, and hence funding, in addition to bringing
maintainers of libraries together to provide input and assess those overviews
and data. These factors motivated the following approach to bootstrapping the
Consortium:</p>
<ol>
<li>Assemble a consortium of people from interested companies (who help fund
the required engineering and technical writing time) and key community
contributors.</li>
<li>Form a working group which meets weekly for an hour, sets the high-level
goals, requirements, and user stories, and makes initial decisions.</li>
<li>Several engineers with enough bandwidth will do the heavy lifting on
building the required tooling, and preparing the data and draft docs
needed by the working group. Iterate as needed based on feedback from the
working group.</li>
<li>Once drafts of an API standard have a concrete outline, request input from
a broader group of array and dataframe library maintainers.
<em><span>This is where we are today.</span></em></li>
<li>Once tooling or drafts of the API standards get mature enough for wider review,
release them as Request for Comments (RFC) and have a public review
process. Iterate again as needed.</li>
<li>Once there’s enough buy-in for the RFCs, and it’s clear projects are able
and willing to adopt the proposed APIs, publish a 1.0 version of the
standard.</li>
</ol>
<p>Such a gradual RFC process is a bit of an experiment. Community projects
like NumPy and Pandas aren’t used to this; however, it’s similar to successful
models in other communities (e.g. the Open Geospatial Consortium, or C++
standardization) and we think the breadth of projects involved and complexity
of the challenge makes this the most promising and likely to succeed approach.
The approach will certainly evolve over time though, based on experience and
feedback from the many stakeholders.</p>
<p><img src="https://data-apis.org/images/API_standard_RFC_review_diagram.png" alt="API standard RFC development and community review"></p>
<p>There are other, synergistic activities happening in the ecosystem that are
relevant for this Consortium, that individual members are contributing to,
such as the work on
<a href="https://github.com/numpy/archive/blob/master/other_meetings/2020-04-21-array-protocols_discussion_and_notes.md">developing NumPy array protocols</a>,
and the  <code>__dataframe__</code>
<a href="https://github.com/wesm/dataframe-protocol">data interchange protocol design</a>.
The section in the <code>__array_module__</code> NEP on <a href="https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0037-array-module.html#requesting-restricted-subsets-of-numpy-s-api">“restricted subsets of NumPy’s API”</a>
gives an outline for how the API standard we’re developing can be adopted.
The <code>__dataframe__</code> protocol attempts to solve a small, well-defined problem
that is a sub-problem of the one a full dataframe API standard would solve.</p>
<h2 id="an-api-standard---what-do-we-mean-by-that">An API standard - what do we mean by that?</h2>
<p>When we start talking about an “API standard” or a formal specification, it’s
important to start by explaining both why we need it and what “API standard”
means. “Standard” is a loaded word, and “standardization” is a process that,
when done right, can have a large impact but may also evoke past experiences
that weren’t always productive.</p>
<p>We can look at an API in multiple levels of detail:</p>
<ol>
<li>Which functions, classes, class methods and other objects are in it.</li>
<li>What is the signature of each object.</li>
<li>What are the semantics of each object.</li>
</ol>
<p>When talking about <em>compatibility</em> between libraries, e.g. “the Pandas, Dask
and Vaex <code>groupby</code> methods are compatible”, we imply that the respective
dataframe objects all have a <code>groupby</code> method with the same signature and the
same semantics, so they can be used interchangeably.</p>
<p>Currently, array and dataframe libraries all have similar APIs, but with
enough differences that using them interchangeably isn’t really possible.
Here is a concrete example for a relatively simple function, <code>mean</code>, for
arrays:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>We see that:</p>
<ul>
<li>All libraries provide this functionality in a function called <code>mean</code>,
except (1) Tensorflow calls it <code>reduce_mean</code> and (2) PyData Sparse has a
<code>mean</code> method instead of a function (it does work with <code>np.mean</code> though via
<a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/arrays.classes.html#special-attributes-and-methods">array protocols</a>).</li>
<li>NumPy, Dask, CuPy, JAX and MXNet have compatible signatures (except the
<code>&lt;no_value&gt;</code> default for <code>keepdims</code>, which really means <code>False</code> but with
different behavior for array subclasses).</li>
<li>The semantics are harder to inspect, but will also have differences. For
example, MXNet documents: <em>This function differs from the original <code>numpy.mean</code>
in the following way(s): - only ndarray is accepted as valid input, python
iterables or scalar is not supported - default data type for integer input is
<code>float32</code></em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>An API standard will specify function presence with signature, and semantics, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>mean(a, axis=None, dtype=None, out=None, keepdims=False)</code></li>
<li>Computes the arithmetic mean along the specified axis.</li>
<li>Meaning and detailed behavior of each keyword is explained.</li>
<li>Semantics, including for corner cases (e.g. <code>nan</code>, <code>inf</code>, empty arrays, and
more) are given by a reference test suite.</li>
</ul>
<p>The semantics of a function is a large topic, so the <em>scope</em> of what is
specified must be very clear. For example (this may be specified separately,
as it will be common between many functions):</p>
<ul>
<li>Only array input is in scope, functions may or may not accept lists, tuples
or other object.</li>
<li>Dtypes covered are <code>int32</code>, <code>int64</code>, <code>float16</code>, <code>float32</code>, <code>float64</code>;
extended precision floating point and complex dtypes, datetime and custom
dtypes are out of scope.</li>
<li>Default dtype may be either <code>float32</code> or <code>float64</code>; this is a consistent
library-wide choice (rationale: for deep learning <code>float32</code> is the typical
default, for general numerical computing <code>float64</code> is the default).</li>
<li>Expected results when the input contains <code>nan</code> or <code>inf</code> is in scope,
behavior may vary slightly (e.g. warnings are produced) depending on
implementation details.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Please note: all the above is meant to sketch what an “API standard” means, the concrete signatures, semantics and scope may and likely will change</em>.</p>
<h2 id="approach-to-building-up-the-api-standards">Approach to building up the API standards</h2>
<p>The approach we’re taking includes a combination of design discussions,
requirements engineering and data-driven decision making.</p>
<h3 id="start-from-use-cases-and-requirements">Start from use cases and requirements</h3>
<p>Something that’s often missing when an API of a library grows organically
when many people add features and solve their own issues over a time span of
years is <em>requirements engineering</em>. Meaning: start with a well-defined scope
and use cases, derive requirements from those use cases, and then refer to
those use cases and requirements when making individual technical design
decisions. We aim to take such an approach, to end up with a consistent
design and with good, documented rationales for decisions.</p>
<p>We need to carefully define scope, including both goals and non-goals. For
example, while we aim to make array and dataframe libraries compatible so
consumers of those data structures will be able to support multiple of those
libraries, <em>runtime switching</em> without testing or any changes in the
consuming library is not a goal. A concrete example: we aim to make it
possible for scikit-learn to consume CuPy arrays and JAX and PyTorch tensors
from pure Python code (as a first goal; C/C++/Cython is a harder nut to crack),
but we expect that to require some amount of changes and possibly
special-casing in scikit-learn - because specifying every last implementation
detail scikit-learn may be relying on isn’t feasible.</p>
<h3 id="be-conservative-in-choices-made">Be conservative in choices made</h3>
<p>A standard only has value if it’s adhered to widely. So it has to be both
easy to adopt a standard and sensible/uncontroversial to do so.
This implies that we should only attempt to standardize functionality with which
there is already wide experience, and that all libraries either already have
in some form or can implement with a reasonable amount of effort. Therefore,
there …</p></div></div>

While the hopes for the introduction of on-device training for recurrent neural networks (RNNs) this year were dashed, there were still some pretty interesting announcements.</p><p id="fc02">The Core ML model viewer in Xcode 12 has now been revamped with more information:</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2014/1*I_c2IKYfCCoQnNadq8_QpA.gif" width="1007" height="458" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*I_c2IKYfCCoQnNadq8_QpA.gif 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*I_c2IKYfCCoQnNadq8_QpA.gif 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*I_c2IKYfCCoQnNadq8_QpA.gif 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*I_c2IKYfCCoQnNadq8_QpA.gif 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*I_c2IKYfCCoQnNadq8_QpA.gif?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="09d7">As you can see, we have a new metadata tab that shows the layer distribution for the Core ML model. Most notably, the utility section consists of two new features — Model Encryption and Model Deployment.</p><h2 id="1dfe">Core ML Model Deployment</h2><p id="02a3">Until now, updating models in production apps has been a headache. Developers would have to either push new app updates or use on-device training, which is limited to a few neural network layer types only.</p><p id="b985">Luckily, Apple has introduced a new Deployment API that lets us update Core ML models on the fly, independent of app updates. To enable Model Deployment, we need to opt-in to Core ML model archiving (from the utility pane shown above) and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/evolving-your-apps-intelligence-with-core-ml-model-deployment-165579ba0546">perform a few steps in Apple’s model deployment dashboard.</a></p><p id="fc1f">There’s also a new class <code><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml/mlmodelcollection?changes=latest_minor&amp;language=objc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MLModelCollection</a></code> that lets you access a group of models from Core ML Model Deployment. You can use this class for accessing a Core ML collection for a specific feature set in your app.</p><h2 id="7ef8">Core ML Model Encryption</h2><p id="872a">Previously, <code>.mlmodelc</code> Core ML model files embedded in our apps weren’t encrypted, meaning sensitive IP could fairly easily be extracted and exploited. To help address this issue, Apple has introduced an optional model encryption feature that lets you secure the model. It works in pretty much the same way as you’d sign applications (using your particular Apple Team ID).</p><p id="fe85">Now you can safely encrypt and bundle your model files, and Core ML will automatically decrypt and load them in your app’s memory.</p><p id="a6b8">The first time you load the model in-app, the decryption key is automatically fetched from the Apple server.</p><h2 id="bf93">A new async load function for Core ML models</h2><p id="6dd3">iOS 14 now brings a new asynchronous <code>load</code> function for initializing Core ML models. This is handy for loading models from <code>MLModelCollection</code> and for handling encrypted Core ML models.</p><pre><span id="d13e">MyStylizedModel.apply{<p>    switch result {</p><p>      case .success(let model):<br>        currentModel = model</p><p>            case .failure(let error):<br>        handleFailure(for: error)</p></span><span id="c4d6">  }<br>}</span></pre><p id="6c5a">Do note that the old <code>init()</code> function for loading Core ML models will be deprecated in the future.</p><p id="eb4f">Besides security and deployment, a bunch of new layer types have been introduced as well. <code>coremltools</code> now provides out-of-the-box support for converting trained TensorFlow and PyTorch models to Core ML while taking advantage of the CPU, GPU, or Neural Engine.</p></div></div></section><hr><section></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="5404">Create ML is a model-building framework that lets us train custom machine learning models on macOS with “no-code” by providing drag-and-drop and visual design tools.</p><p id="4776">It became an independent macOS app last year, and provides a variety of model types for training Image, Object, Sound, Text Classifiers, and Recommender Systems.</p><p id="fd1e">Apple announced a number of improvements to Create ML at WWDC2020. Support for <a href="https://www.fritz.ai/style-transfer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video and image style transfer</a> model training was perhaps the biggest update this year. Coming from Apple, we can safely assume that it’s highly-optimized. Style transfer models would be extremely useful when used with ARKit to build immersive augmented reality experiences.</p><p id="6aee">Also, we now have support for training activity classification models that’ll find use cases in tracking body movements.</p><p id="ace8">Aside from new model training support, Create ML now offers more degrees of customization:</p><ul><li id="af79">You can now pause and resume training.</li><li id="e476">Create ML allows you to set checkpoints that you can leverage to build intermediate snapshot models at various stages of training. Using these snapshots, you can compare model results from various stages of training.</li></ul></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="ccfe">While Core ML is the most sought after machine learning framework by Apple today, it isn’t (and wasn’t) the only one available.</p><p id="4df6">Interestingly, there’s a low-level primitive framework <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Accelerate</a>, which is used to build neural networks to run on the CPU. At the same time, Apple also provides MPS (Metal Performance Shaders), designed to run on the GPU. Core ML is simply an abstraction built on top of these frameworks to run inference with an easier-to-use API.</p><p id="3ca7">Alongside the introduction of Core ML in iOS 11, a new MPS graph API (which is used underneath Core ML) was also released. The MPS graph API offered more precision during model training by letting us specify the exact layers and inputs.</p><p id="5142">Now, with iOS 14, we have another new machine learning framework: ML Compute. This one is specifically used for accelerating the training and validation of neural networks by using high-performance BNNs for the <code>Accelerate</code> framework on the CPU, and Metal Performance Shader for the GPU.</p><p id="13f1">It’s important to note that the ML Compute framework’s API isn’t used for building Core ML models and is only introduced for boosting low-level machine learning frameworks.</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="5699">The Natural Language and Vision frameworks are built on top of Core ML. The Natural Language framework helps, broadly speaking, in the semantic meaning and understanding of texts.</p><p id="9217">Last year, the framework received a host of new features, such as sentiment analysis, word tagging and embedding, language identification, tokenization, and entity recognition.</p><p id="e452">iOS 14 now introduces sentence embedding. Building accurate on-device FAQs and chatbots would get a whole lot easier with this new technology.</p><p id="b0ee">Analyzing sentences through word embeddings had its own limitations. Simply put, taking the average of vectors of every word could easily lead to loss of the compositional information of the sentence. Also, word embeddings work with only a finite vocabulary set and cannot accurately process semantic meaning when the word in a sentence isn’t present in the lookup table.</p><p id="1cfb">The new Sentence Embedding API helps overcome these shortcomings by letting you analyze an entire sentence. You can encode a complete sentence’s information into a finite-dimensional vector, which can then be compared with other sentences in the vector space to determine similarities and differences.</p><p id="e980">The Natural Language framework is also closely linked with the Create ML framework. This year, Apple has introduced transfer learning for word tagging models by using dynamic embedding. You can specify model parameters in the following way:</p><pre><span id="13fd">let modelParameters = MLWordTagger.ModelParameters(algorithm: .transferLearning(.dynamicEmbedding, revision: 1))</span></pre><p id="d8cc">iOS 14 also provides a new <code>tagHypotheses</code> function that lets you find multiple possible tags for a given word or substring in the text. In doing so, you can now find the confidence threshold of each of the predicted tags.</p></div></div></section><hr><section></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="c4a4">Apple once again showed its computer vision ambitions during WWDC2020. The Core Image framework was greeted with the addition of a few more built-in filters. <code>CIColorThreshold</code> lets us quickly convert an image to black and white. The new <code>CIColorAbsoluteDifference</code> filter lets us compare color across two images.</p><p id="06fd"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/whats-new-in-the-vision-framework-in-ios-14-73d22a942ba5">Apple’s Vision framework</a>, on the other hand, stole the show from the other AI-based frameworks this year. It received about half a dozen new updates, including support for:</p><ul><li id="c825">Hand and Body Pose Estimation</li><li id="2c7a"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/new-in-ios-14-vision-contour-detection-68fd5849816e">Contour Detection</a></li><li id="6fb6">Optical Flow</li><li id="74a2">Trajectory Detection</li><li id="78ed">Offline Video Processing</li></ul><p id="27de">There’s also a new stateful vision request, which takes into account the previous <code>VNObservation</code> results and is useful in trajectory detection and optical flow requests.</p><p id="976d">For a detailed look at what’s new in Vision framework with iOS 14, check out the article below:</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="c0fb">PencilKit made its debut in iOS 13 and was perceived as a mere drawing framework.</p><p id="8b55">This year, Apple has introduced Scribble for iPadOS — a new built-in, machine learning-powered text field. It automatically detects text written using Apple Pencil and can transcribe it as a string on the fly.</p><p id="ccf9">To enable or disable transcription of handwritten text, we can toggle the <code>UIScribbleInteraction.isHandlingWriting</code> boolean property.</p><p id="e317">With iOS 14, the PencilKit framework does a lot more than just set up the canvas for drawing and painting.</p><p id="22e2">It now provides us with access to the stroke properties of the <code>PKDrawing</code> object. This means we can inspect the current point, path, and speed of a user’s drawing.</p><p id="d24a">In doing so, we can analyze attributes such as force and the time it takes the PencilKit framework to perform gesture recognition and pattern matching from the user’s touch input.</p><p id="44f7">Signature verification, anomaly detection, and shape auto-correction are a few things that you can do in iOS 14 to build AI-powered drawing applications. Additionally, the PencilKit framework can be used in conjunction with ARKit to move objects around in an augmented reality scene.</p><p id="68fc">It’s worth noting that the <code>allowsFingerDrawing</code> property has been deprecated in favor of <code>PKCanvasViewDrawingPolicy</code> — which is an enum of types <code>anyInput</code> and <code>pencilInput</code>.</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="3a41">We explored the enhancements introduced across the different AI-based frameworks this year. Strangely, there weren’t any updates in Apple’s speech analysis frameworks this year.</p><p id="3d21">Training models with Create ML requires macOS Big Sur and above, but you can play around with the other frameworks in Xcode 12 itself on macOS Catalina.</p><p id="5003">That’s it for this one.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>Employee handbooks are a crucial part of human resources. They show new hires the information they need, can be the go-to place to store new policies in and when made public, are an excellent way to give people a glimpse into your culture. These are our top picks of public employee handbooks.</p>

<h2>GitLab's Collaborative All-Remote Handbook</h2>
<p>Obviously, we have to mention the incredible work that GitLab has been doing on making their <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/">employee handbook</a> open and collaborative. With over <a href="https://nohq.co/sid-sijbrandij-people-dont-want-to-commute-they-ju/">3,000</a> pages and growing, it's the most extensive remote work handbook in the world. The investment into the handbook didn't only pay off in terms of transparency in the human resources department – it's also a marketing feat that promotes GitLab and its work ethic on millions of Google search terms related to remote working. The handbook alone nets the GitLab domain <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/backlinks">millions of backlinks</a>, impressive!</p>

<p><img src="https://nohq.co/media/Screenshot_2020-08-17_at_12.05.58.png" alt="GitLab Employee Handbook" width="800" height="398"></p>

<p>Marketing aside, the All-Remote Handbook by GitLab has become a remote work encyclopedia. Be it in interviews about GitLab or in any kind of coverage about the remote work movement, there's probably an article or quote in the handbook that can be used as a reference. As a prospective applicant or employee, it's calming to know that all information is stored somewhere in that big compendium.</p>
<p>Not only that, but GitLab's handbook runs on Git through GitLab. That means that any collaborator can take a page out of the handbook, edit it or add a section, open a <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html">Merge Request</a> and get it approved. A big issue with handbooks is that they fall out of date often. If you give moderated access to your over 1,000 employees and keep the handbook as the primary record for information, it's much less likely for that to happen.</p>

<h2>Basecamp's straight-to-the-point handbook on GitHub</h2>
<p>Basecamp's strategy for their <a href="https://basecamp.com/handbook">employee handbook</a> is much more straight to the point. As part of their refreshed handbook experience, they have created a small slideshow that goes over 15 main chapters from their history to their travel guides and moonlighting policy.</p>

<p><img src="https://nohq.co/media/Screenshot_2020-08-17_at_12.58.16.png" alt="Basecamp Employee Handbook" width="800" height="415"></p>

<p>Until a few months ago, this information has also lived primarily on a <a href="https://github.com/basecamp/handbook">Git-powered medium through GitHub</a>. As you can see on the repository, Basecamp's handbook isn't quite as informative and extensive as GitLab's, which also leads to a lot less collaboration. That's fine though – pull requests on Basecamp's handbook usually reflect over-arching changes to a certain policy, such as changes to the profit-sharing program or a change in the requirements for a certain position.</p>
<p>Even if there is a little less content, it makes the utility of Basecamp's handbook no less. It captures the main policies and internal quirks of their culture without filling the handbook up with unnecessary clutter. Also: Basecamp's team is around 20x smaller than GitLab's, so it's no surprise that the handbook is a little lighter too.</p>

<h2>Clef's handbook for inclusion and value-driven culture</h2>
<p>Clef may not exist in its current form anymore, but their universally useful and available <a href="https://github.com/clef/handbook">handbook</a> has sparked interest either way. It reads like a blueprint for future value-driven and people-first companies and therefore is a great starting point for remote companies as well.</p>
<p>The handbook repository of Clef is fully packed with goodies. From their bias-aware compensation structure to and end-to-end onboarding example, it includes countless files that have lived through hundreds of iterations by over 30 contributors, amazing!</p>
<p>Today, almost 3,000 people have marked this repository with a Github star and as companies realize that being "value-driven" is more than just smart marketing, it's probably growing to grow a lot further.</p>
<p>Especially for small companies that may not have too much power to stand out from the crowd, a handbook like this can be your number one funnel to receive interesting and diverse applications.</p>

<h2>Glitch's interactive handbook</h2>
<p>Glitch has a long history and has built their own little nook on the internet since they started in 2000. It's very on-brand therefore that <a href="https://handbook.glitch.me/">their handbook</a> is built entirely on Glitch as well. With that, they are the only handbook in this list that does not rely on the Git protocol. Instead, changes are done through the Glitch editor directly. The handbook can be "remixed" in order to be used for your own company and just like we've seen before, there are multiple chapters that make up the handbook.</p>

<p><img src="https://nohq.co/media/Screenshot_2020-08-17_at_14.27.02.png" alt="Glitch Employee Handbook" width="800" height="418"></p>
<p>Content-wise, the Glitch handbook is similar to the Basecamp one. Policies are strict and to the point and there is not much content to be read about the ins-and-outs of their working structure. That's not a bad thing. A new hire could get through the handbook on their first onboarding day or during a few off-hours throughout their first week.</p>

<h2>Creating a public handbook can help you</h2>
<p>We already mentioned it, but a public employee handbook can be a great window for prospective applicants to get an initial view of how you work. It's clearer what benefits applicants can expect and whether a company will suit them.</p>
<p>With the large pool of hiring companies and the small differences that divide them, making those things available publicly can make you stand out a lot. If you require a specialized expert team, that can be a life-saver, especially if you can't compete on the budgets of FAANG &amp; co.</p>
<p>A public handbook is also a lot of work. Things become inherently easier if the public handbook is the go-to source of your information. That means being more transparent than what you would have hoped for, but also comes with a wide range of amazing benefits, as discussed.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Another week, another SciML release! Yes, this has been a crazy productive summer so thanks to everyone who has been involved. Let's dive in.</p> <h2 id="neuralpdejl_physics-informed_neural_networks_for_automated_pde_solving_and_high_dimensional_pdes"><a href="#neuralpdejl_physics-informed_neural_networks_for_automated_pde_solving_and_high_dimensional_pdes">NeuralPDE.jl: Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Automated PDE Solving and High Dimensional PDEs</a></h2> <p>We have officially released <a href="https://neuralpde.sciml.ai/dev/">NeuralPDE.jl</a>. This is a domain-specific library for gathering all of the neural network based PDE solver methods. Its main focus are on the two big branches of scientific machine learning:</p> <ol> <li><p>Physics-informed neural networsk (PINNs)</p> </li><li><p>Forward-Backwards Stochastic Differential Equations for high dimensional PDEs</p> </li></ol> <p>On the PINN front, the library is all about <strong>automated solution of PDEs</strong> we want users who have no experience in partial differential equations to be able to slap down a symbolic description of the partial differential equation and get a reasonable result without having to know about details like discretization. To see this in action, let's look at solving the 2-dimensional Poisson equation with this library. We start by describing the PDE:</p> <pre><code><span>@parameters</span> x y θ
<span>@variables</span> u(..)
<span>@derivatives</span> Dxx''~x
<span>@derivatives</span> Dyy''~y


eq  = Dxx(u(x,y,θ)) + Dyy(u(x,y,θ)) ~ -sin(<span>pi</span>*x)*sin(<span>pi</span>*y)


bcs = [u(<span>0</span>,y,θ) ~ <span>0.f0</span>, u(<span>1</span>,y,θ) ~ -sin(<span>pi</span>*<span>1</span>)*sin(<span>pi</span>*y),
       u(x,<span>0</span>,θ) ~ <span>0.f0</span>, u(x,<span>1</span>,θ) ~ -sin(<span>pi</span>*x)*sin(<span>pi</span>*<span>1</span>)]

domains = [x ∈ IntervalDomain(<span>0.0</span>,<span>1.0</span>),
           y ∈ IntervalDomain(<span>0.0</span>,<span>1.0</span>)]</code></pre> <p>Here we described the PDE by its Julia code because, why not: it's as informative and refined as mathematical notation itself! Now let's tell the system to discretize and solve this PDE with a neural network:</p> <pre><code>dx = <span>0.1</span> 
discretization = PhysicsInformedNN(dx)


opt = Flux.ADAM(<span>0.02</span>)
dim = <span>2</span> 
chain = FastChain(FastDense(dim,<span>16</span>,Flux.σ),FastDense(<span>16</span>,<span>16</span>,Flux.σ),FastDense(<span>16</span>,<span>1</span>))

pde_system = PDESystem(eq,bcs,domains,[x,y],[u])
prob = discretize(pde_system,discretization)
alg = NNDE(chain,opt,autodiff=<span>false</span>)</code></pre> <p>and then we solve it:</p> <pre><code>phi,res  = solve(prob,alg,verbose=<span>true</span>, maxiters=<span>5000</span>)</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12683885/88482882-cbc00c80-cf6c-11ea-91bb-47a477f38af6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And boom, that's the solution to the PDE. We are continuing to improve this framework, and refactor some of the pieces so that it better connects to more ML and scientific computing library ecosystems, but it's achieving its general goal today so we've decided to release it. Major thanks to @KirillZubov for these developments.</p>
<p>Along with this symbolic form, there are FBSDE methods specifically written for parabolic equations and Kolmogorov backwards equations. This means that high dimensional PDEs that show up in finance, biology, and beyond can now quickly be solved with a neural network. Here's the code to solve a 100 dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for LQG optimal control:</p>
<pre><code><span>using</span> NeuralPDE

                Dense(hls, hls, relu),
                Dense(hls, <span>1</span>))

σᵀ∇u = Flux.Chain(Dense(d + <span>1</span>, hls, relu),
                  Dense(hls, hls, relu),
                  Dense(hls, hls, relu),
                  Dense(hls, d))
pdealg = NNPDENS(u0, σᵀ∇u, opt=opt)
<span>@time</span> ans = solve(prob, pdealg, verbose=<span>true</span>, maxiters=<span>100</span>, trajectories=<span>100</span>,
                            alg=EM(), dt=<span>1.2</span>, pabstol=<span>1f-2</span>)</code></pre>
<p>Boom: that's all there is to it. <a href="https://neuralpde.sciml.ai/dev/">Check out the documentation for more details</a>. There's still a lot of active development here so if you're a student who's interested in this topic, please get in touch.</p>
<h2 id="lie_group_integrators_magnus_rungekuttamunthe-kaas_and_crouchgrossman_methods"><a href="#lie_group_integrators_magnus_rungekuttamunthe-kaas_and_crouchgrossman_methods">Lie Group Integrators: Magnus, Runge–Kutta–Munthe-Kaas, and Crouch–Grossman Methods</a></h2>
<p>There are many differential equations which specifically fall under the form of <code>u' = A(t)u</code>, or <code>u' = A(u)u</code>. In these cases, you have geometric properties, like Lie groups, that you can exploit in the solution of the ODE. These Lie group methods are commonly embedded in domain-specific software, usually in robotics, so they are not generally seen except by practitioners of specific scientific areas trying to get the most robust and performant methods in these cases.</p>
<p>Well, SciML wants the most robust and performant methods, so we have now included these methods as part of the standard DifferentialEquations.jl suite thanks to Biswajit Ghosh (@Biswajitghosh98) and <a href="https://mlh.io/">Major League Hacking (MLH)</a>. To use these methods, you have to define your ODE via a DiffEqOperator. For example:</p>
<pre><code><span>function</span> update_func(A,u,p,t)
    A[<span>1</span>,<span>1</span>] = cos(t)
    A[<span>2</span>,<span>1</span>] = sin(t)
    A[<span>1</span>,<span>2</span>] = -sin(t)
    A[<span>2</span>,<span>2</span>] = cos(t)
<span>end</span>
A = DiffEqArrayOperator(ones(<span>2</span>,<span>2</span>),update_func=update_func)
prob = ODEProblem(A, ones(<span>2</span>), (<span>1.0</span>, <span>6.0</span>))
sol = solve(prob,MagnusGL6(),dt=<span>1</span>/<span>10</span>)</code></pre>
<p>that is a quick and easy way to utilize a 6th order Magnus integrator for the <code>u' = A(t)u</code> equation. We have high order methods and adaptive methods, and these all utilize as much mutation as possible to try and be efficient. There's still some optimization that can be done, but the methods are well-tested for correctness and ready to be used where you see fit!</p>
<h2 id="stochastic_delay_differential_equations_and_stochastic_differential-algebraic_equations"><a href="#stochastic_delay_differential_equations_and_stochastic_differential-algebraic_equations">Stochastic Delay Differential Equations and Stochastic Differential-Algebraic Equations</a></h2>
<p>It's finally here! A lot of people had found <a href="http://real.mtak.hu/106039/1/ENOC_StochasticDelayDIffEq.pdf">our ENOC 2020 paper on StochasticDelayDiffEq.jl</a>, but we had to spend some time getting the library to our continuous integration testing and documentation standard before releasing. Well, now it's finally here. StochasticDelayDiffEq.jl allows for solving stochastic differential equations with delayed components and includes higher order and adaptive integrators. It's built on StochasticDiffEq.jl so the methods that you know and love have been transferred to this new domain. It uses all of the development from DelayDiffEq.jl to give robust SDDE solving. SDDEs are very difficult equations to solve, but we try to make it as efficient as possible. Thanks to everyone who was involved, including Henrik Sykora (@HTSykora), for making this possible. For the reveal, here's an SDDE solved with a Milstein method with adaptive time stepping:</p>
<pre><code><span>function</span> hayes_modelf(du,u,h,p,t)
    τ,a,b,c,α,β,<span>γ</span> = p
    du .= a.*u .+ b .* h(p,t-τ) .+ c
<span>end</span>
<span>function</span> hayes_modelg(du,u,h,p,t)
    τ,a,b,c,α,β,<span>γ</span> = p
    du .= α.*u .+ <span>γ</span>
<span>end</span>
h(p,t) = (ones(<span>1</span>) .+ t);
tspan = (<span>0.</span>,<span>10.</span>)

pmul = [<span>1.0</span>,-<span>4.</span>,-<span>2.</span>,<span>10.</span>,-<span>1.3</span>,-<span>1.2</span>, <span>1.1</span>]
padd = [<span>1.0</span>,-<span>4.</span>,-<span>2.</span>,<span>10.</span>,-<span>0.0</span>,-<span>0.0</span>, <span>0.1</span>]

prob = SDDEProblem(hayes_modelf, hayes_modelg, [<span>1.</span>], h, tspan, pmul; constant_lags = (pmul[<span>1</span>],));
sol = solve(prob,RKMil())</code></pre>
<p>In this same vein, SDAEs are possible via singular mass matrices. These have proper testing and now have the official release along with documentation in the latest docs.</p>
<p>With these two announcements, note that because the SciML software composes, you can solve SDDAEs. And yes, these are compatible with neural networks and DiffEqFlux. Go have fun.</p>
<h2 id="automated_ensemble_parallelism_and_multiple_gpus_in_diffeqflux"><a href="#automated_ensemble_parallelism_and_multiple_gpus_in_diffeqflux">Automated Ensemble Parallelism and Multiple GPUs in DiffEqFlux</a></h2>
<p>You can now mix ensemble parallelism, and thus multi-GPU computation, with DiffEqFlux and reverse-mode automatic differentiation. An example of the multithreaded computation of an ensemble which is then trained is as follows:</p>
<pre><code><span>using</span> OrdinaryDiffEq, DiffEqSensitivity, Flux, Test
pa = [<span>1.0</span>]
u0 = [<span>3.0</span>]

<span>function</span> model2()
  prob = ODEProblem((u, p, t) -&gt; <span>1.01</span>u .* p, u0, (<span>0.0</span>, <span>1.0</span>), pa)

  <span>function</span> prob_func(prob, i, repeat)
    remake(prob, u0 = <span>0.5</span> .+ i/<span>100</span> .* prob.u0)
  <span>end</span>

  ensemble_prob = EnsembleProblem(prob, prob_func = prob_func)
  sim = solve(ensemble_prob, Tsit5(), EnsembleThreads(), saveat = <span>0.1</span>, trajectories = <span>100</span>).u
<span>end</span>
loss() = sum(abs2,[sum(abs2,<span>1.0</span>.-u) <span>for</span> u <span>in</span> model2()])

pa = [<span>1.0</span>]
u0 = [<span>3.0</span>]
opt = ADAM(<span>0.1</span>)
println(<span>"Starting to train"</span>)
l1 = loss()
Flux.<span>@epochs</span> <span>10</span> Flux.train!(loss, params([pa,u0]), data, opt; cb = cb)
l2 = loss()
<span>@test</span> <span>10</span>l2 &lt; l1</code></pre>

<p>Thanks to Utkarsh (@utkarsh530), we now have fast parallelized implicit extrapolation in OrdinaryDiffEq.jl. You'll find these <a href="https://diffeq.sciml.ai/dev/solvers/ode_solve/#Parallelized-Implicit-Extrapolation-Methods">in the documentation</a> as <code>ImplicitEulerExtrapolation</code>, <code>ImplicitDeuflhardExtrapolation</code>, and <code>ImplicitHairerWannerExtrapolation</code>. For those ODE-inclined, these are pure Julia implementations of SEULEX and SODEX which include automated multithreaded parallelization of the <code>f</code> calls.</p>
<h2 id="new_surrogates_gradient-enhanced_kriging"><a href="#new_surrogates_gradient-enhanced_kriging">New surrogates: Gradient-Enhanced Kriging</a></h2>
<p>Surrogates.jl continues to march forward. If you have not seen the documentation recently, do <a href="https://surrogates.sciml.ai/latest">check it out</a> as it has undergone many major improvements, including showing differences between surrogates on many benchmark problems. One of the latest enhancements is Gradient-Enhanced Kriging, which is an extension to Kriging that can utilize derivative information (from automatic differentiation) to improve the convergence of the surrogate with less samples. Thank Ludovico Bessi (@ludoro) for driving this surrogate project.</p>

<p>The next directions are going to be highly tied to the directions that we are going with the latest Google Summer of Code, so here are a few things to look forward to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Higher efficiency low-storage Runge-Kutta methods with a demonstration of optimality in a large-scale climate model (!!!).</p>

</li><li><p>Continued improvements to parallel and sparse automatic differentiation.</p>

</li><li><p>More SDE solvers and adjoints</p>

</li><li><p>More performance</p>

</li></ul>

<blockquote><p>“He’s perhaps one of two dozen people who knows the name of Iron.”</p><cite>Kvothe, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/2Y6Te0T" target="_blank">Name of the Wind</a>, The Kingkiller Chronicles</cite></blockquote>



<p>Names have power. Patrick Rothfuss adeptly harnesses this truth in his excellent novel series The Kingkiller Chronicles. In the word of Temerant, knowing the true name of an element such an Iron or Wind gives someone supernatural control of it.</p>



<p>The power of names is demonstrated through a simple photograph of place signs. Each of the words on the wall above conjures a feeling of excitement, or curiosity, or perhaps a distant memory, fleeting and poignant.</p>



<p>What we choose to call events, concepts and people measurably changes our view of them. The names we given ourselves quietly in our hearts have enormous influence over our mental state.</p>



<p>Astonishingly, recent research has discovered that we even <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-pspa0000076.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">look like our given names</a>. Researchers have shown that people and computers can infer our name by looking at our face, an effect demonstrable beyond socioeconomic cues. Therefore, our facial appearance represents social expectations of how a person with a specific name should look.</p>



<h2>The importance of naming for clean code</h2>



<p>This a significant realisation for our mental health and well-being, but how does it fit with delivering clean code faster?</p>



<p>Names communicate. They have the power to tell others what a thing is and does. That reduces friction in our development teams, and allows us to understand code faster and deliver more quickly.</p>



<p>Why should we expend so much effort to get them right? Because the name of a concept gives us insight into how it fits into the system we are designing. Conversely, if we’re not careful with naming, we’ll be producing <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/W/write-only-code.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">write-only code</a> which drifts apart from the whole, lost and destined for eventual deletion.</p>



<p>Here are some principles you can use to help you choose the best names and produce clean code with less effort. We’ll start with the nuts and bolt of naming code, then move to how to determine meaningful names in conjunction with our customers.</p>



<h2>Intentionally move through the four stages of naming</h2>



<blockquote><p><em>There are two hard problems in computer science: Cache invalidation, naming things, and off by one errors.”</em></p><cite><a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Martin Fowler</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>How should we pay attention to names as we get started with coding something new? J.B. Rainsberger&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.jbrains.ca/permalink/the-four-elements-of-simple-design" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talks about</a>&nbsp;names of classes, methods and variables going through four stages towards clean code:</p>



<ul><li><em>Nonsense:</em>&nbsp;For example, we might extract a method from a larger one and quickly rename it&nbsp;<code>somethingWhatever()</code>&nbsp;to get the refactor done and the tests passing.</li><li><em>Accurate:</em>&nbsp;We rename the nonsense method to what it actually does, such as&nbsp;<code>processPayroll()</code>.</li><li><em>Precise:</em>&nbsp;Once we realise what the method really does, we might refine the accurate name and give it more precision, such as&nbsp;<code>loopThroughEmployeesAndPayThem()</code>.</li><li><em>Meaningful:</em>&nbsp;At this point, we’ve revealed the complexity of the method, and can look to split it up into two methods:&nbsp;<code>forEachEmployee()</code>&nbsp;and perhaps a&nbsp;<code>payWages()</code>&nbsp;method on a separate interface.</li></ul>



<h2>Don’t be afraid of nonsense or longer names</h2>



<p>We shouldn’t shy away from the early stages of naming. If we’re not sure what something is yet, give it a nonsense name. The name&nbsp;<code>foo()</code>&nbsp;is fine, as long as it’s only going to last fifteen minutes.</p>



<p>It doesn’t belong in a commit, and it’s not clean code, but it’s a start. It gets our code moving so we can begin to see how our concepts fit together.</p>



<p>As you progress, some concepts or ideas will outgrow your abstractions. They become ripe for future refactoring. If in doubt as to what or where something fits, use a long name: the longer and more precise the better. I will call a variable something like <code>computed_unsorted_project_task_matrix</code>&nbsp;if I don’t like it and want to refactor it at some point.</p>



<p>This is much more intention revealing than&nbsp;<code>result</code>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<code>res</code>,&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>r</code>). I reveal the complexity of the object through the name, which helps reveal complexity in the code.</p>



<h2>Characters are cheap</h2>



<p>Let’s not make things harder for the programmers who come after us. Remember, this is just as likely to be ourselves in a few months. Let’s avoid using a name like&nbsp;<code>p</code>&nbsp;when&nbsp;<code>project</code>&nbsp;is only a few characters more.</p>



<p>Anything that reduces reading friction in our code is a good thing.</p>



<p>This isn’t fashionable amongst developers in certain languages communities like Clojure or Haskell. They prefer brevity in variable names, relying on convention for understanding. For example, <code>k</code> and <code>v</code> often refer to <code>key</code> and <code>value</code> in a Clojure Map.</p>



<p>The important thing is to reduce friction in the team. If your team are used to these variables, it’ll be quick to understand: for them, it’ll be clean code. However, this will increase the barrier to other team members. In general I prefer longer more meaningful names to this. I don’t think it’s worth sacrificing the team’s understanding for the sake of a few characters. If names are becoming so cumbersome their length is reducing clarity, this shows the need for a refactor.</p>



<h2>Name concepts for your customer, not yourself</h2>



<p>Along the steps we take through to making names more precise and meaningful, how do we choose what words to use for the concepts we’re dealing with? We name these concepts through continual conversations with customers.</p>



<p>Ubiquitous language is an excellent concept and tool that Eric Evans introduced years ago in the book <a href="https://amzn.to/3ftKZBF">Domain Driven Design</a>. Every coder would do well to read at least the first half of this book. The idea is often taught within a Behaviour Driven Development context, but it is logically independent. Any agile team can work towards a Ubiquitous Language.</p>



<p>The central idea is that there are two languages that we can use to talk about a concept: the “problem” language or the “solution” language. The problem language is the language of the customer. For example, a payroll system might use concepts like <em>wages, salary, PAYE, tax, paying.</em> The solution language is the language of developmers. For example we might use the following names for the code that runs the payroll system: <em>button, element, value, collection, style, parent-child, container, object.</em></p>



<p>The solution language is where many programmers naturally live, think and speak. It’s easy for us to operate with these kinds of concepts. The trouble is, they’re often alien for our customer. Instead of lazily reaching for <code>parent</code>–<code>child</code> (or the more problematic <code>master</code>–<code>slave</code> vernacular) when describing a concept, let’s instead collaborate with our customers on a shared language that works well for everyone. Perhaps we <em>add an employee to a tax band</em> rather than <em>insert a user into a collection</em>, both <a href="https://deliverydoubled.com/deliver-faster-boost-teamwork-a-simple-guide-to-development-focus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when discussing the next feature</a>, and when we’re writing the code itself.</p>



<h2>Intentional conversations reduce confusion and produce clean code</h2>



<p>It’s common for teams to have to deal with concepts and words that overlap and interact with each other. Single concepts are called different things by different people on the team. Different groups of people within an organisation use the same word for wholly different ideas.</p>



<p>It’s such a universal problem people often don’t pay attention to it. However confusion and cognitive load will build up and cause communication problems over time.</p>



<p>It’s also fairly easy to solve this problem through having quick, regular, intentional conversations.</p>



<p>Next time you’re discussing a concept with your team that’s poorly named, speak up. Ask whether there’s another name for the concept that could reduce confusion. Try a few different words or phrases out with the team until you settle on the right thing. This might mean inventing entirely new words or concepts that fit well with everyone in the team. That’s ok, as long as it makes our language more precise.</p>



<p>Once a word has been decided on, commit to using it everywhere from now on. Deliberately take the time to update the names in the code to match.</p>



<p>Perhaps you could volunteer to maintain a glossary of words so that everyone feels the benefit. Newer team members are often great people to keep an eye on these documents, and update them whenever they encounter errors.</p>



<p>There’s always going to be a barrier for incoming team members new to our code and our concepts. If we’re having these intentional conversations, we’re helping newer people by creating a smaller set of names for them to learn.</p>



<hr>



<p>Names have power. They can drive insight and influence communication. Let’s intentionally practice our naming as a team, so that everyone has a say about the language and terminology we use. Let’s build those names right into our codebases, moving through the stages towards the team’s language as the code becomes clearer. This will harmonise the team’s work, make for cleaner code, and puts the team on the right track to improving their delivery times.</p>

<p>While COVID has negatively impacted many sectors, bringing the global economy to its knees, one sector has not only survived but thrived: Data Science. If anything, the current pandemic has only scaled up demand for data scientists, as the world’s leaders scramble to make sense of the exponentially expanding data streams generated by the pandemic.&nbsp; </p>



<blockquote><p><em>“These days the data scientist is king. But  extracting true business value from data requires a unique combination  of technical skills, mathematical know-how, storytelling, and intuition.” </em><sup>1</sup> </p><cite>Geoff Hinton</cite></blockquote>



<p>According to Gartner’s 2020 report on AI, 63% of the United States labor force has either (i) already transitioned; or (ii) is actively transitioning; towards a career in data science. However, the same report shows that only 5% of this cohort eventually lands their <strong>dream job</strong> in Data Science.</p>



<p>We interviewed top executives in Big Data, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Artificial General Intelligence; and distilled these 5 tips to guarantee success in Data Science.<sup>2</sup></p>



<h4><strong>BUILD YOUR BRAND</strong></h4>



<p>On the internet you are your brand, you are the sum and average of your Twitter, GitHub and other social profiles.</p>



<p>If a tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it, was the tree really ever really there? If you {learn&nbsp; something, think something, build something, eat something} and don’t share, all that value goes down the drain.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/cNSKn0XmXQjKFdKJS4LPQo05UKGgAb2FeWg9LO2u494Hbe4Sm22N3OrrKsUQiTFE0ePMr5cjNTMzDRBGCSTMxvJM-3rX2LxAxVcJWf906KVg1-s87AZcLJVrTheFjHpCjMUxWNUY" alt="" width="598" height="336"><figcaption>Image Source:  <a href="https://www.franchiseindia.com/wellness/Bringing-in-a-New-Player--7-Ways-to-Build-your-Own-Brand-in-the-Wellness-Industry.9964">https://www.franchiseindia.com/wellness/Bringing-in-a-New-Player–7-Ways-to-Build-your-Own-Brand-in-the-Wellness-Industry.9964]</a></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Anything you do—or pretend to do—has the potential to build your brand:</strong></p>



<div><div>
<ul><li>Screenshot your favorite equations and share them on Twitter. </li><li>Take your favorite ML tutorial, redraw the graphics by hand, and post to Medium, finding a maximal audience with minimal effort.</li><li>Whether in Homer, Shakespeare, or the Kardashians, any engaging story has conflict. Don’t like your boss? Post it to Twitter. Waiting for an hour on the Tarmac, subtweet @AmericanAir. Identify a nemesis? <strong>Launch a flame war and see both of your brands grow.</strong></li></ul>




</div></div>



<p>After you reach 1000 followers, haters are going to start to question why you have so much influence. Some people might say you’re not a “real researcher”. This is why you need to <strong>publish papers</strong>. Worried that your ideas aren’t original enough? Rest assured. Science proceeds by standing on the shoulders of giants. Search and replace on a technical term. <strong>A thesaurus can help here.</strong> For instance, convert “quantum gate” to “quantum door”. Or substitute “complicated Hilbert space” for “complex Hilbert space”. Post to arXiv. Rinse and repeat.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>KNOW YOUR DATA</h4>



<p>Do the rows in your dataset correspond to real people? Yes? How do you know? Have you met these people? Get off your butt and work the phones. Find out who these people are. Cross reference usernames against other datasets. Hire a private investigator. Whatever it takes, find out who they are. Call them on the phone. The primary metric you should be optimizing is customer delight, not predictive accuracy.<sup>3</sup></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/UTZo_RhCCiQYqETpvsLjbH53-0VYb7Y4yXKP_5lA3yhjzKEUncaWN_dZRKfpv4IB8kG5ZaLWFs_6SAZsT-wIsWiohWeUal1EesKgP6CkufNgO2hzUKC25G3DtUO7OaIPCDOonqN4" alt="" width="610" height="227"><figcaption>Image Source: <a href="https://blogs.prio.org/2016/11/get-to-know-your-data-double/">https://blogs.prio.org/2016/11/get-to-know-your-data-double/</a> </figcaption></figure>



<h4><strong>EXECUTE WITH RADICAL TRANSPARENCY </strong></h4>



<p>Machine learning is in the throes of a reproducibility crisis. According to a Bloomberg industry report in June 2020, over 83% of machine learning results are entirely fabricated or artifacts due to multiple hypothesis testing, excessive hyperparameter optimization, or bugs in the code. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/kLXy591Tm4J1urypBtexq-tfewDUczHhuWDBDlptEUUhj58sgZ_c2GXG309iWhNnOPXbvNGj21yPpqWicJ3IpJPB_m65ZlGoESGk2J4ip4Oakflz_Qxz3n-CHjMMs9Mav0rrdFoF" alt="" width="593" height="329"><figcaption>Image Source: <a href="https://liberationist.org/how-to-move-from-secrecy-to-radical-transparency/">https://liberationist.org/how-to-move-from-secrecy-to-radical-transparency/</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>The only way to build trust with the scientific community is to commit to radical transparency. Post all of your code to GitHub, use human-readable variable names, post all of your training runs to a public dashboard via <a href="https://www.wandb.com/">Weights and Biases</a>.</p>



<p>But that’s not enough. Even with public code, you’re still hiding all of the domain knowledge that goes into creating it in the first place. Why was a particular type of layer chosen? Which other ideas were tried but failed to make the cut for a publication? Which podcasts were in heavy rotation when inspiration struck?</p>



<p>Real commitment to transparency requires 24h livestreams of your entire life. Real science happens in real time. </p>

<h4><strong>GIVE BACK TO THE COMMUNITY</strong></h4>



<p>You might be the best data scientist in the world, but how is your next employer supposed to know that? They don’t see the code that you write for yourself or for your boss.&nbsp; The best way to make your work known in the real world is to make an impact in open source.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/lVPR_Dx5KeCsPB1x6tYwZ67bb1UFZ6IdWTDN8TsxIVjx99C6GIDsdClLkR4jeaIXj91HVz3MlQklPfeyvhfK5gw6b7t4dE635lULH54OB-oq2FQKUQV89KKmRn_FkmB2ehymCWoS" alt="" width="596" height="322"><figcaption>Image Source: <a href="https://www.advanceddentistry.org/a-dental-practice-focusing-on-community/"><strong>https://www.advanceddentistry.org/a-dental-practice-focusing-on-community</strong></a></figcaption></figure>



<p>With so many commits on so many repositories, nobody has time to actually see what you contributed. Therefore, the best strategy is to single out high impact projects and make a large number of fixes, such as removing whitespace or fixing typos – make sure that each fix gets its own commit to maximize the visibility your work gets.<br></p>

<h4><strong>ADOPT A GROWTH MENTALITY</strong></h4>



<p>Data science has been around far longer than the phrase “data science”. But the field moves so fast that the Data Science of your forebears would hardly be recognizable to our generation. To keep up with this rapidly evolving field, you must evolve your skill set.</p>

<p>Centuries ago,&nbsp; being a great data scientist required mastery of the abacus. In the 20th century, classical statistics took over, demanding command of calculus and measure theory. Today, conquering data science requires virtuosity with package management.<sup>4</sup> Top data scientists can work the full stack of package installation. From apt-get to pip to conda to CRAN, today’s data heroes can install any package on any machine at any time.</p>



<p>And tomorrow?&nbsp;To be a data scientist is to constantly challenge yourself to become a better thinker, writer, mathematician, illuminator and programmer. A data scientist never settles. A data scientist strives to learn every framework that makes it to the front page of Hacker News. A data scientist rejects dogma, goes from first principles in a singular quest towards truth.</p>

<p>Be honest with yourself: after your last standup ended, if you were asked to repeat back what each person did in the last 24 hours and was planning to do in the next 24 hours, how would you do? I think most people would be lucky to get a 25% on that test.</p>



<p>Standup meetings are supposed to be for the team to move the sprint forward, but they’re often just a status update for the PM or Scrum Master, because everyone else recites their status and then zones out the rest of the time. </p>



<p>If that sounds painfully familiar, then I have a suggestion. Walk the board. Instead of going person by person, go ticket by ticket. Make sure to start on the right side of the board, because the work that is closest to done should be the focus in order to limit work in progress. For each ticket, ask the current assignee what’s next, and if there are any blockers.</p>



<p>It’s that simple, but it works like magic for creating engaged, valuable standups. Here’s why:</p>



<ol><li><em>Walking the board</em> <em>makes it impossible for people to just say their part and then zone out</em>, since each person has to talk multiple times because they’re involved in multiple tickets (one in progress, a couple in QA, one in code review, etc.). People are more likely to hear and understand what others are working on since they’re actually paying attention.</li><li><em>Walking the board</em> <em>focuses the conversation on what will move the sprint forward</em>, which is the whole point of the daily standup. You only talk about what’s on the board. In a traditional standup, when people are saying what they worked on yesterday, they often start talking about stuff they did that isn’t related to the current sprint at all, like planning the next sprint, or going to a doctor’s appointment, or getting pulled into a different project for support. None of that stuff is relevant to the point of standup.</li><li><em>Walking the board</em> <em>makes it impossible for tickets to linger in a status</em> for days or weeks. Traditional standups make that too easy, because a ticket doesn’t get brought up at all unless it got worked on yesterday or someone is already planning to work on it today. Walking the board makes it painfully obvious when a ticket isn’t moving.</li></ol>



<p>I also suggest rotating the facilitator regularly, perhaps weekly, to ensure that people aren’t just falling into to the habit of reporting to the leader instead of having a conversation.</p>



<p><em>But what about general announcements the team needs to hear?</em> After you walk the board, ask “any general things we need to discuss?” and let people speak up.</p>



<p><em>But what if the work I’m doing to move the sprint forward isn’t on the board? </em>Then either put it on the board or quit pretending that it’s moving the sprint forward.</p>

<div>
<p>In the last decade, Microsoft has introduced and subsequently scaled back a number of iterations of their Windows operating mobile phone with little success in the consumer market. Most recently they have announced the release of the Surface Duo, an Android-powered mobile device, as part of the Surface series. The phone is a hinged, foldable device with two distinct screens for the user to interface with – each 5.6 inches large. Microsoft primarily focuses on the value of the dual-screen as the ability to easily multitask and expand the field of vision within an application. Microsoft has long held that users multi-task differently when they can organize their workspace across two screens. As with all its previous models, Microsoft once again leans into the capacity of the phone to function as a productive space. The question is whether the Surface Duo and its foldable function will succeed where its predecessors have failed to provide Microsoft with meaningful reach into the consumer mobile market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two elements that primarily define our smartphone experience:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Function:</strong> Smartphones introduced <em>mobile</em> access to the internet and provided a portal for the browser-like experience on the mobile. This made the transition from the prior models of phones to the smartphone an easy leap – access to the internet enhanced connectivity, the core function of mobile phones.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Form:</strong> The form of smartphones followed the dictates of its functionality, that of a more compact portal for the browser-like experience. This meant while the screen had to be maximized (introducing touchscreens, removing bezels etc.), the phone remained compact enough to be portable.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Since the introduction of the smartphone, phone manufacturers like Apple and Samsung have been competing on improving the form and function to provide users with a better experience and capture market share. Form side developments have largely been limited to incremental changes like the removal of bezels for larger screen size or slimmer designs as a result of battery innovations. The Microsoft Surface Duo and Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold introduce a double, merge-able screen, perhaps the most dramatic shift of form (within one iteration) over the last decade.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a way to analyse this deviation in form, the foldable aspect, in a model comparing the motivation for consumers to adopt such a design and the convenience afforded to consumers by such a design.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this context:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Motivation</strong> can be defined as the consumer’s drive to make a purchase decision based on a specific form/function feature of the mobile&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Convenience</strong> can be defined as the enhancement of the ubiquitous mobile experience, where the product taps into the already ingrained consumer habits in both function and form</li></ul>



<p>When design is motivation driven, it is better able to target smaller, more niche groups who desire a certain form or function feature. On the other hand, convenience driven design is able to effectively cater to the masses who share a mutual desire for a convenient, ubiquitous experience. Microsoft’s Surface Duo appears more motivation driven in design – the motivation here being productivity and functional two screen use. </p>



<p>The Surface Duo is a hinged, full rotation device that can be dual-screen or single screen use, depending on the user’s preference. The hurdle, however, is much like the flip phones of the past, the device needs to be “opened” in order to be accessed – with no front-facing screen for interfacing. Despite the trivial nature of an additional opening action, this step represents a greater inconvenience in the flow of the user’s experience. This is especially true when compared to the forms and functions of today, wherein the screen is immediately available and always accessible (e.g. simply lifting the phone towards yourself activates the screen). This is not to mention that the dual screens are in fact distinct screens, separated by a break line down the center – this caters more to a dual-screen experience rather than the single screen experience we are used to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Comparatively, the latest Samsung foldable device – the Galaxy Z Fold 2 – maintains a single-screen experience. This applies both to its front-facing interface, as well as its fold out, seamless screen (no break line). Where the optimal form of current mobile devices is a maximised screen size that does not compromise compact portability, the Galaxy Z Fold 2’s smaller front screen and larger merged screens do not compromise the experience available in the current models. In fact, the fold out single screen enhances certain functions that might have comparatively been compromised when moving from larger devices to mobile, such as video playback or gaming. Ideally, Samsung has attempted to maintain the convenience of single screen models (the front-facing screen), with the fold out further enhancing certain functionalities.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://4thquadrant.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Diagram_SurfaceDuo.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://4thquadrant.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Diagram_SurfaceDuo.jpg 680w, https://4thquadrant.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Diagram_SurfaceDuo-300x132.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px"><figcaption>The ‘form’ of the Surface Duo fold out screen experience – as a comparison to its contemporaries. Image not to scale.</figcaption></figure>



<p>So then why is Microsoft deviating from the ubiquitous form of current devices to distinct dual-screen experience? This is because Microsoft is driven by the theme of its Surface series, one that is focused on productivity and effective workspaces. Where Samsung has created an iteration of its mobile phone products, preserving the experience, simply with a larger screen, Microsoft has adapted its tablet model into a mobile phone. This is where a distinction forms in the ability of Samsung and Microsoft to service convenience, Microsoft aligning more heavily with motivation as mentioned earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In previous iterations of Microsoft’s mobile products, the point of differentiation was the Windows Mobile OS. Microsoft deployed its native operating system rather than leaning into the open source Android OS that was more accessible, familiar and convenient (Play Store) to mass consumers at the time. Surface Duo, while having switched to the Android OS, has been deliberately designed for productive functionality – dual screens being the derivative form. Here Microsoft deviates from what is the ubiquitous and most accessible form for a more general consumer base, likely leading the Surface Duo along a similar trajectory to its previous iterations – capturing a niche rather than converting the masses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the introduction of the foldable phone screen has had a rocky start with several models dismissed as being gimmicky or irrelevant to the mobile experience, it appears that the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 may find a degree of adoption. It may not be too long before the fold-out larger screen format becomes the ubiquitous mobile experience. It then becomes likely that the ‘form’ of the larger screen could usher in an evolution of the ‘function’ of mobile phones – adapting to productivity/workspace use cases with greater ease. At that point, Microsoft’s productivity focused mobile might find success with a mass consumer base more easily.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span>Down the Rabbit Hole</span></h3>
</p>



<h3>1. Our addiction to our mobile phones dictates ‘form’</h3>



<p>“If you’ve ever misplaced your phone, you may have experienced a mild state of panic until it’s been found. About 73% of people claim to experience this unique flavor of anxiety, which makes sense when you consider that adults in the US spend an average of 2-4 hours per day tapping, typing, and swiping on their devices—that adds up to over 2,600 daily touches. …</p>



<p>…While there is nothing inherently addictive about smartphones themselves, the true drivers of our attachments to these devices are the hyper-social environments they provide. Thanks to the likes of Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, and others, smartphones allow us to carry immense social environments in our pockets through every waking moment of our lives. “</p>



<p>Mobile phones are in a way, a method of chasing dopamine triggers if we look at what the most widely used applications are throughout the world, social media and their notifications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How do social media apps take advantage of this dopamine-driven learning strategy? Similar to slot machines, many apps implement a reward pattern optimized to keep you engaged as much as possible.”</p>



<p>If we simplify the use of the mobile phone for the vast majority, we can simplify the function of the phone as dopamine triggers. The form then follows the function, a direct and accessible screen that is immediately available to us and a blinking light indicating awaiting notifications. In this sense, the Microsoft Surface Duo which leans into productivity for its design, neglects to address dopamine triggers as a core use case. To a user, the requirement to open the device which lacks a front-facing screen, is moments of delay to achieve a necessary task. Further, a foldable device isn’t as convenient as a flip phone, the action of a flip being far smoother a transition than having to put some level of care into the opening of the Surface Duo. Then, adding an inconvenience, whilst seconds long, would appear unbearable in comparison to alternatives available.</p>

<h3>2. Consumer behaviour in a world of limitless online and offline options</h3>



<p>A Think Google study assessed consumer behaviour and decisions in a world enabled by smartphones to better understand how consumers make choices both online and offline.</p>



<p>“By examining all of these needs, we learned how consumers choose – both online and offline – to navigate their I-want-to-know, I-want-to-go, I-want-to-do and I-want-to-buy moments.”</p>



<p>The study discovered three primary consumer behaviours across the spectrum of “I-want” needs and these results are strongly indicative of the holistic …</p></div></div></div>

			<p><a href="https://musically.com/2017/06/29/pandora-interim-ceo-primary-listening-experience-passive/">Naveen Chopra</a>, former interim CEO and CFO of Pandora as reported by MusicAlly:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We believe that the primary listening experience is passive, for most people, meaning 90 percent of the time you just want to listen to music you like,” said Chopra. “It’s not about picking songs you like and building playlists.”</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://musically.com/2018/03/15/talking-points-spotify-investor-day/">Gustav Söderström</a>, Chief R&amp;D Officer of Spotify, also by MusicAlly:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Today we have over 200 petabytes of music data,” said Soderstrom. “We believe that with our larger user base and our higher user engagement, the distance to the competition is actually only increasing… Already today, we have more than five times the amount of music data that our nearest competitor does.”</p>
<p>He even compared music-streaming to the world of self-driving cars, where the more vehicles a company (like Google, or Uber) has out on the roads generating data, the better its chances of success in the long-term.</p>
<p>“We have by far the most cars on the road in terms of users, but importantly they’re also driving more hours a day than anyone else, so more miles. And we’re putting more cars on the road every day, because of our free tier… This is self-driving music!”</p></blockquote>
<p>For all the success that streaming services have been having in making algorithmic, editorial and algotorial recommendations, I personally believe that they are neglecting the development of tools better suited to more advanced users.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>To use concrete <a href="https://streamingmachinery.com/2020/07/12/the-9000-song-long-playlist-there-must-be-a-better-way/">examples</a>, these tools could serve to allow the user to easily listen through the content of a book like “1001 Albums to Listen Before you Die”. Or to explore one or more lists of the best albums of any given year. Or<span>&nbsp; </span>offer some slightly more robust “queue” tools to plan for an upcoming party or car trip. Or a better way to collect, group and go thru all songs that are recommended to them on social networks and newsletters.</p>
<p>As I detailed in the previous link about “1001 Albums”, on a most basic level one tool could be a “bookmark” to let you know where you stopped on a playlist. Or tick marks to know which songs from it you have listened. But on a larger sense this tool is about embracing new concepts, like<span>&nbsp; </span>‘anthologies’<span>&nbsp; </span>and integrating them on the service in a practical way.</p>
<p>I sense an opportunity here. The number of “power users” who would value these kind of features maybe small, but 1% of a few hundred million people is still a few million people. They may even be more valuable than average users.</p>
<p>Platforms mature and so the users. Perhaps after a few years of using the app, perhaps an increasing number of average users will be increasingly ready to use such tools.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>And then there are second order effects. Who knows how these tools will look like a few years down the R&amp;D road?<span>&nbsp; </span>What new use cases and possibilites will they allow? How much of the tools will trickle-down to new features that every grandma will depend on daily?<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Finally, I suspect that the real number of active listeners are being severely undercounted. What if a majority of the very average users are in fact power users some part of the time?</p>
<p>Maybe the need for such tools of music exploration and organisation would arise only once a month or a year, but that would be a huge amount of use too.</p>
<p>Because the truth is that many people <a href="https://streamingmachinery.com/2020/06/23/the-sound-of-music/">care</a> a lot about music, even if they don’t admit so. How common are such habits as reading album reviews and popstar profiles, attending music shows, wearing band t-shirts, even watching two hour music documentaries?<span>&nbsp; </span>These are all ways of actively engaging with music. Heck, how many copies of “1001 Albums to Hear Before You Die” have been sold and read over the decades?<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Maybe the demand for the tools is there, widespread but latent.</p>

<h2>The Guide to Social Media APIs</h2>



<p>Here is the scenario: you’ve been tasked with sending event-driven posts to various social media networks like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, or even newer ones like Telegram, Discord, or Reddit. Developing the front-end functionality to share to these networks is easy, and there are a dozen packages/plugins for <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-add-social-share-buttons-in-wordpress/">WordPress</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-share">React</a>, or <a href="http://js-socials.com/">Javascript</a>. However, if you need to dynamically share content from your back-end system, well, that means you need to register, be approved, and integrate with each social network.</p>



<p>Building <a href="https://www.ayrshare.com/">Ayrshare</a> wasn’t easy and we found it took a lot of leg-work to find details on the various social media network APIs, so we decided to share what we found. Here are the top networks, links to their API, guides, and process. The APIs can be called directly as RESTful services or search for a well-regarded wrapper for the API in the language of your choice. Most of the APIs use OAuth2 for authentication.</p>







<h2>Top 10 Social Media Network APIs</h2>



<h3>Facebook</h3>



<ul><li><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/video-api/overview">API</a></li><li>Requires registration: Yes</li><li>Requires app approval: Yes</li></ul>



<h4>Thoughts</h4>



<ul><li>You need to register your app, and if for commercial purposes, register your business. This includes verifying your legal entity and address. A lot of the Facebook process and requirements are similar to releasing an app to the Apple store.</li><li><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions/reference/">Scope</a> permissions are extremely important and don’t be surprised if you get them wrong during the first few builds.</li><li>The API documentation is large and confusing at times, but if you spend the time learning it you’ll find the information you need.</li><li>We didn’t find any good packages that wrap the API calls, so we used direct RESTful calls.</li><li>You can get a permanent access token. However, it requires a few extra calls.</li><li>The Facebook approval process for scope permissions is the most rigorous of any network. You need to write up testing steps, submit a video, and detail your reasoning for needing the permissions. We were rejected once because our video missed a step in our instructions.</li></ul>



<h4>Other guides or packages</h4>



<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/node-formidable/formidable">https://github.com/node-formidable/formidable</a></li><li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/python-facebook-api/">https://pypi.org/project/python-facebook-api/</a></li></ul>







<hr>







<h3>Twitter</h3>



<ul><li><a href="https://developer.twitter.com/">API</a></li><li>Requires registration: Yes</li><li>Requires app approval: Yes</li></ul>



<h4>Thoughts</h4>



<ul><li>Twitter requires registering your app as a new project (using their new Developer interface). Approval takes a few days, and although we were supposed to get an approval email we never did.</li><li>The API’s examples could be a bit more detailed. Fortunately the Twitter API is not complex. We found some great Twitter API wrappers, so we suggest using one of those. See packages below.</li><li>You can get a permanent access token. This greatly simplifies your token management.</li><li>The new Twitter developer site no longer allows localhost in their approved callback URLs, so you’ll need to use <a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok</a> or an equivalent tunnel to test locally.</li></ul>



<h4>Other guides or packages&nbsp;</h4>



<ul><li><a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/developer-utilities/twitter-libraries">https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/developer-utilities/twitter-libraries</a></li><li><a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/getting-started">https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/getting-started</a></li></ul>







<hr>







<h3>LinkedIn</h3>



<ul><li><a href="https://developer.linkedin.com/docs/guide/v2">API</a></li><li>Requires registration: Yes</li><li>Requires app approval: Yes</li></ul>



<h4>Thoughts</h4>







<h4>Other guides or packages&nbsp;</h4>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-linkedin">https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-linkedin</a></li><li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/python-linkedin-v2/">https://pypi.org/project/python-linkedin-v2/</a></li></ul>







<hr>







<h3>Reddit</h3>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/">API</a></li><li>Requires registration: Yes</li><li>Requires app approval: Yes, only if for commercial use.</li></ul>



<h4>Thoughts</h4>



<ul><li>Reddit’s API docs are auto-generated and a mess. The information is there, but it will take you a while to get a handle on them. We suggest checking out the subreddit on development (see other guides section).</li><li>Reddit requires you register your app to get the API keys and to complete a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/api">Google form</a> for approval if your app is commercial. Don’t forget to do this.</li><li>Subreddit’s have different rules, so don’t blindly post to them or you/your user will be banned. To test your implementation post to the /test subreddit.</li><li>The other networks allow you to get long-lived or permanent access tokens. Reddit’s access token only lasts 1 hours. You can refresh the token even after expiration and some of the wrappers help manage this.</li><li>There are some really great looking wrapper packages. Go to the /redditdev subreddit and see the drop down for packages. However, we still preferred to go directly with the API calls.</li></ul>

<h3>Discord</h3>



<ul><li><a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro">API</a></li><li>Requires registration: Yes</li><li>Requires app approval: Yes</li></ul>



<h4>Thoughts</h4>



<ul><li>You must register an app to get your client id and secret key, but the process is quick and easy.</li><li>You then need to register a Bot. Please see the <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#bots">guide</a> for scope permissions and <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#authorization-code-grant">authorization code</a>.</li><li>More to come…</li></ul>

<h3>Pinterest</h3>



<ul><li><a href="https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/api/overview/">API</a></li><li>Requires registration: Yes</li><li>Requires app approval: Yes and new applications are slow to process.</li></ul>



<h4>Thoughts</h4>



<ul><li>Pinterest has a new API and you must apply for access. If you don’t hear back after a week, write them a <a href="https://developers.pinterest.com/support/contact/">note</a> asking if you can provide more information.</li><li>More to come…</li></ul>



<h4>Other guides or packages&nbsp;</h4>

<hr>







<h3>Instagram</h3>



<ul><li><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/">API</a></li><li>Requires registration: Yes</li><li>Requires app approval: Yes, but need to be in the Partner program (closed for new partners) to post via the API.</li></ul>



<h4>Thoughts</h4>



<ul><li>Instagram has switched to the Facebook Open Graph API format, so if you’ve already built for FB you’ll be familiar with the format. You’ll need to manage scopes as you do for FB.</li><li>The API allows you to pull data, but you can not post via the API unless you’re a “Partner”. The partner program started in 2018 and isn’t open to new partners unless Instagram asks you to join.</li><li>If you want to <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram/sharing-to-feed">post to Instagram</a> you’ll need to have a mobile app that does the post, requiring a manual step from your users.</li></ul>

<ul><li>You must register your bot with <a href="https://t.me/botfather">BotFather</a> via Telegram. All the setup is via Telegram, such as setting your image, description, and registering.</li><li>We found the documentation and API endpoints the easiest to use of any network. It was our quickest integration.</li><li>Unlike other networks that offer an front-end user authorization workflow, such as Facebook, Telegram requires the user to authorize your bot in their group or channel. A few extra steps for the user, but with proper <a href="https://docs.ayrshare.com/web-interface/using-the-web-interface/telegram-integration">instructions</a>, very manageable.</li><li>Telegram offers a nice set of <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#setwebhook">Webhooks</a> that update you whenever a new chat comes in.</li></ul>

<p>Spending on depreciating assets can wreck your finances.  Many people associate being wealthy with owning luxury cars, jewelry, designer jeans and high end watches.  This is the image of wealth portrayed in the media and popularized in movies. </p>



<p>The material goods you purchase are really depreciating assets and they are very bad for your financial health.  Every time you choose to make a purchase of a depreciating asset it comes at the opportunity cost of other assets that could be used to increase your net worth.  </p>



<p>Over time compounding interest kicks in to turn modest spending into massive opportunity loss.  This is how depreciating assets can wreck your finances.  </p>



<h2>What Are Depreciating Assets?</h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/burningmoney.jpg?resize=332%2C497&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/burningmoney.jpg?resize=332%2C497&amp;ssl=1" alt="burning money" width="332" height="497" title="depreciating assets" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Depreciating Assets burn your wealth</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Depreciating assets are assets that drop in value over time.  Examples include cars, boats, motorcycles, computers. As soon as you buy a depreciating asset your net worth starts going down!</p>



<p>Assets can also appreciate or go up in value over time.  These types of assets are referred to as investments.  Investment work to increase your <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/net-worth-explained/">net worth</a> over time.</p>







<h2>What is the Opportunity Cost of Buying Depreciating Assets</h2>



<p>With every dollar you have comes the choice of what to do with it.  You can choose to invest it or to spend it.  If you choose to spend it, you exchange it for a good or service and it’s gone.  The <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/what-is-opportunity-cost/">opportunity cost</a> of the consumption was the investment that you didn’t get to make.</p>



<p>You have to spend some money to get through life.  The problems arise when you spend much more than you need to for the good or service you want.  This extra money spent adds up and compounds over your lifetime reaching dramatically large amounts in the future.</p>



<h2>The Effect of Compounding Over Your Lifetime</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="408" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/growth.jpg?resize=640%2C408&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/growth.jpg?resize=640%2C408&amp;ssl=1" alt="Compounding Interest grows wealth over time if you invest rather than buy depreciating assets" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Compounding Interest Grows Wealth Over Time</figcaption></figure>



<p>The most powerful force in all of finance is <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.inc.com/jim-schleckser/why-einstein-considered-compound-interest-most-powerful-force-in-universe.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">compounding interest</a>, or at least that is what Albert Einstein thought.  I agree with him, and you know they say that great minds think alike.  </p>



<p>So the reason Einstein was so fond of compounding interest is because it can turn small amounts of money into extremely large amounts of money over time.  This means that seemingly inconsequential decisions can have a HUGE impact on your finances over time.</p>



<h2>Examples of Opportunity Cost of Depreciating Assets</h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="280" height="210" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/red-pill-blue-pill.jpg?resize=280%2C210&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/red-pill-blue-pill.jpg?resize=280%2C210&amp;ssl=1" alt="Opportunity cost means the choice to spend or invest" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Life is full of choices</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>It can be difficult to really understand how much of an impact opportunity cost can have on your eventual nest egg.  It can be helpful to look at an example.  Let’s look at the impact of three choices to spend rather than invest on your long term net worth.</p>



<h3>The Choices Made to Spend</h3>



<ol><li>When you are 20 you decide that you need a new laptop.  Your dad offered you his old one for free, but you decided to buy a $3,000 Macbook Pro instead.  <strong>Opportunity Cost is $3,000 at age 20</strong>.</li><li>Your finally graduate from college, and get your first real job.  You could buy a $30,000 Honda Accord, however you instead decide on a $50,000 BMW.  <strong>Opportunity Cost is $20,000 at age 25.</strong></li><li>At 30 you decide to rack up $10,000 in credit card debt on designer clothes and handbags.  <strong>Opportunity Cost is $10,000 at age 30.</strong></li></ol>



<h3>How Much Does All That Really Cost</h3>



<p>You might look at this and say it all costs $33,000, but this ignores the compounding interest had you invested it instead!  Let’s assume your alternative use for the money was to invest in a low cost index ETF that tracks the US stock market.  Historically you could <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/sec-guide-to-savings-and-investing.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expect a 10% return</a> over a long period of time when investing in stocks.   <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.investor.gov/financial-tools-calculators/calculators/compound-interest-calculator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Calculating it out</a> it looks more like:</p>

<p>So these three decisions to spend $33,000 that you made between 20 and 30 might have cost you over $1 million by the time you turn 61 years old. If you plan on working to closer to 70 these choices would have cost you over $2 million!  The <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/time-value-of-money/">time value of money</a> can really have a major impact.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<p>You must choose whether to invest or spend every dollar you make.  Do so wisely because the cost of your choices can compound over time to mind bogglingly large amounts of money.  </p>



<p>Learn to consider the opportunity cost of any item you want to buy today, not just it’s purchase price.  Think of all your spending decisions this way and you can learn to make better financial decisions.</p>

<p>The aerospace industry has a reputation for being conservative. A new generation of aerospace companies have built a reputation on flouting the status quo, but is this willingness to challenge norms reflected in the politics of their employees? </p>



<h3><strong>WHERE’S THE DATA FROM?</strong></h3>



<p>The data used in these charts was gathered from the Federal Election Commission, which requires individuals who make political contributions of $200 or more to register the name of their company. The data covers contributions made to the Biden, Trump, and Sanders campaigns since January 1, 2019.  It is based on the most current available data, which was last updated <strong>6/30/2020</strong>. </p>



<h3><strong>ABOUT THE CHARTS</strong></h3>



<p>The companies are grouped into two categories: <strong>AEROSPACE &amp; DEFENSE</strong> (Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, L3Harris, and Raytheon) and <strong>SPACEFLIGHT &amp; LAUNCH</strong>  (SpaceX, Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada Corporation, ULA, and the Virgin group*). The median age of the Aerospace &amp; Defense parent companies is 98 years old, while the median age of the Spaceflight and Launch companies is 16 years old. </p>



<p>There is some overlap between these groups. For instance, the United Launch Alliance (ULA) is a partnership between Boeing and Lockheed Martin that is exclusively a space launch provider. ULA employees were counted as a separate group and their campaign contributions were not included in the totals for Lockheed Martin and Boeing employees. </p>



<p>Note that L3Harris was formed from a merger between L3 Technologies and the Harris Corporation in June 2019. Employees at the individual companies who contributed money to these presidential campaigns from January 1, 2019 until the merger are included in the L3Harris total. Likewise, Raytheon merged with United Technologies Corporation in April 2020. The campaign contributions from United Technologies employees are included in the Raytheon total.  </p>



<p><em>*The Virgin group includes employee contributions from Virgin Orbit, Virgin Galactic, and the Spaceship Company.</em></p>















<p><strong>Of all the Aerospace &amp; Defense companies, Boeing had the most employees contribute to political campaigns (N=792) and they contributed the most money ($441,380). </strong> Nearly half of Boeing employees’ contributions went to the Bernie campaign ($196,219). It’s worth noting that Boeing has far and away the most employees (~160,000) of the Aerospace &amp; Defense Group. The next largest company is Lockheed Martin (~110,000 employees).  </p>











<p><strong>Among the aerospace/defense employees there is a remarkable consistency in which campaigns the employees contributed to if they made a campaign contribution of $200 or more. </strong>Roughly half of the employees contributed to Trump, one-third to Sanders, and one-sixth to Biden.   </p>











<p><strong>The median employee contribution for either Democratic candidate was higher than the median contribution to the Trump campaign at every Aerospace &amp; Defense company.</strong> In terms of total employee contributions, however, employees contributed more to Trump than Biden at every Aerospace &amp; Defense company. </p>















<p><strong>SpaceX employees contributed the most money to presidential campaigns overall. </strong>In fact, SpaceX employees contributed more money ($47,761) to presidential campaigns than the other four Spaceflight and Launch companies combined ($44,402). </p>











<p><strong>Blue Origin employees had the highest median political contribution to each campaign except the Biden campaign. </strong>The Virgin group’s unusually high median campaign contribution to the Biden campaign is due to the small number of contributors (2), each of whom made a relatively large contribution ($2800 and $638). </p>











<p><strong>Sierra Nevada Corporation was the only Spaceflight &amp; Launch company where the majority of employees who made campaign contributions of $200 or more didn’t contribute to the Sanders campaign.</strong> The Virgin group (Virgin Orbit, Virgin Galactic, and the Spaceship Company) is the only Spaceflight &amp; Launch company that didn’t have any contributions to the Trump campaign. </p>







<h3><strong>WHAT DOES THIS TELL ME ABOUT THE COMPANY?</strong></h3>



<p>It tells you that a certain number of employees at the company felt strongly enough about a political candidate to give them some portion of their earnings. This doesn’t necessarily reflect the political orientation of the company or even most of its employees. FEC data only contains people who contributed $200 or more. For each of the companies below, the number of unique contributors represents less than one half of one percent (&lt;0.005) of all the employees at the company. This is not a representative sample; it is an observational exercise. </p>



<h3>METHOD </h3>



<p>All data was sourced from the Federal Election Commission’s <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/individual-contributions">individual contributor portal</a>. The time range was set to 1/1/2019 to the most recent available data. The relevant campaigns were selected: Donald Trump for President, Inc.; Make American Great Again Committee; Joe Biden for President; Bernie Sanders 2020. Company names and their derivatives (e.g., SpaceX, Space Exploration Technologies Corp., etc.) were selected for search. The datasets for the companies were cleaned and combined. Individual contributors were identified based on unique addresses.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>NOTE: I’ll be updating this post with each monthly data dump from the FEC. I’ll also be expanding it to include more data, such as how employees at these companies contributed to campaigns during the 2016 election. I’ll post updates on <a href="https://twitter.com/DMOberhaus">Twitter</a>.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-c243a880=""><div data-v-c243a880=""><h2><strong>What is Flutter?</strong></h2>
<p><span>Flutter is a Google-developed framework that allows developers to share code between iOS and Android. It’s available through mobile app software development kits (SDKs) and completely open-source.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This allows developers to ensure consistent design and interactivity across operating systems, develop apps at greater speeds and share code from a single base, without having to create duplicate apps in two programming languages.</span></p>
<p><span>You can find out more about the advantages of Flutter and comparisons with other cross-platform frameworks </span><span><a href="https://netsells.co.uk/blog/is-flutter-the-future-of-cross-platform-app-development-in-2020">in our article on the future of Flutter Development in 2020</a>.</span></p>
<h2><strong>What is Flutter for Desktop?</strong></h2>
<p><span>Having successfully created a middle ground for native Swift and Java languages, Google have focused their attention on extending functionality across multiple platforms. As of update 1.5, you are now able to build progressive web applications and desktop applications using Flutter, which can also be embedded in new smart home devices such as Google Home Hub.</span></p>
<p><span>This opens up a huge range of devices to applications written using Flutter, meaning that organisations can swiftly build and deploy across an entire ecosystem using a single codebase.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This has drastic ramifications of speed of development and reducing the costs associated with delivering new features/platforms across mobile, web and embedded applications.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Can You Convert Existing Flutter Code to Desktop?</strong></h2>
<p><span>You are now able to use Flutter to create web content using W3 standard web technologies. This means that you absolutely do have the ability to compile existing Flutter applications into fully compliant web experiences.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Preliminary support now also exists for developing standalone applications on Windows, MacOS, ChromeOS and Linux operating systems.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This allows you to take advantage of each respective platform's app store and build robust offline solutions for users, alongside still providing web access.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This means that Flutter is an excellent solution for start-ups and scale-ups who are looking to reach a larger customer base through providing multi-platform support.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://netsells-site.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/ba9ef762e968e581006a176d57c2d7fc.png" alt="Flutter Desktop Process Diagram" width="480" height="196">&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Creating Smart Home Applications in Flutter</strong></h2>
<p><span>Alongside the new support for web and desktop, developers can also integrate Flutter applications with new smart home technologies such as Google Home, Amazon Alexa and Facebook Portal, giving you the ability to leverage new voice-assisted technologies ahead of the competition.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>What Can We Expect From Flutter in the Future?</strong></h2>
<p><span>Despite the major improvements Flutter 1.5 has provided, it isn’t going to be perfect from day one. Google Product Manager Kevin Moore detailed some of the <a href="https://medium.com/flutter/bringing-flutter-to-the-web-904de05f0df0" target="_blank">future plans for the platform in a&nbsp;2019 Medium post</a>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Support for plugins, location features, camera use and file access will be added to allow better user personalisation.</span></li>
<li><span>Support for text features such as copy and paste, allowing for better integration with existing web infrastructure.</span></li>
<li><span>Easier debugging, so apps can get to market quicker.</span></li>
<li><span>Improved performance, browser support and accessibility, boosting your user experience.</span>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What Does Flutter Mean for the Future of App Development?</strong></h2>
<p><span>With backing from internationally recognisable brands, such as eBay, Sonos and the New York times, as well as 1000s of SMEs, Flutter is quickly becoming the go-to choice of global businesses large and small.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>With convenient and reliable cross-platform capabilities which are now even more powerful post the 1.5 update, the expansiveness of Flutter’s offering is growing exponentially. Google’s Flutter Development Team continues to add performance fixes in line with current infrastructure developments, meaning you are able to produce robust and valuable digital products across multiple platforms that will be supported for years to come.</span></p>
<p><span>Whether you’re a large organisation or an SME, creating applications in Flutter may get you top market quicker and reduce your development costs.</span></p>

<p>In the late ’90s, when Sameer Maskey was a college student, artificial intelligence was an esoteric field. Yet Maskey, who “fell in love with computers” during his freshman year at Bates College, took an immediate interest in AI, particularly the idea of speech-to-speech translation. In 2000, after research stints at Carnegie Mellon and the California Institute of Technology, he built the first Nepali speech synthesizer and released it open source at a conference in Nepal.</p>



<p>Back then, “nobody took any interest,” says Maskey. “Not many people were talking about AI in Nepal.”</p>



<p>Today, Maskey is the founder and CEO of Fusemachines, a company that <a href="https://fusemachines.com/">creates AI tools and provides teams of engineers</a> to businesses in the US that want to build their own. Quiet and driven, he has converted his years of research and teaching — as a PhD from Columbia University, a speech-to-speech-translation research scientist at IBM Watson, and an assistant adjunct professor at Columbia —&nbsp;into the foundation for a 250-person company.</p>



<p>Fusemachines began with the aim of producing customer service products, like automated dialogue systems (the first of which Maskey developed after locking himself in a room and writing 20,000 lines of code). The New York City government was its first client. But as the shortage of AI engineers became a prominent issue in the US, where talent is swiftly snapped up by Silicon Valley giants, Fusemachines’ brand has shifted toward teaching AI in developing countries, where, as Maskey puts it, the company is “democratizing AI.”</p>



<p><em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>



<h4><strong>Why teach AI and machine learning? Why start in Nepal?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>In the past five years, the demand for AI engineers in the US has gone through the roof. They are being sought after by all the big tech companies, but there aren’t enough of them, which has created a huge gap in the market. Newspapers were talking about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/technology/artificial-intelligence-experts-salaries.html">how getting AI engineers was becoming a lot like sports hiring</a>. Companies in the US that aren’t at the scale of Google and Facebook <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/small-businesses-arent-rushing-into-ai-11560078000">can’t afford AI talent</a>. Colleges and universities are increasing their capacity, but they can’t keep up: the demand for engineers is in the hundreds of thousands.</p>



<p>After starting Fusemachines, I realized the market size is quite big, and that the technology would be useful for companies not just in the US. <em>We need engineers: where do I find them?</em> When I was in Nepal on one of my yearly trips, I thought, <em>Let’s see what happens when I teach students here.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>There was a cost advantage to building a team in Nepal, of course. It gives us more runway with the same amount of money. But from an impact perspective, it was more interesting to train engineers from Nepal. A lot of the AI technology today gets built by large companies and is geared toward the US: if you put a self-driving Tesla on a road in Nepal, it’s not going to work that well. High-quality AI education in other countries means graduates will build tech adapted to their local issues and contexts.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>A lot of the AI technology gets built by large companies and is geared toward the US: if you put a self-driving Tesla on a road in Nepal, it’s not going to work that well.</p></blockquote></figure>



<h4><strong>Is teaching AI abroad any different than teaching the subject in the U.S.?</strong></h4>



<p>At the beginning, I didn’t really have many expectations. But I started to see sparks of quality talent. I taught the same course as the one I taught at Columbia University. I soon realized my students in Nepal were equally good.</p>



<p>Going into it, I knew there would be some issues with rote learning, but not at the level I saw. Students have read about topics — from a syllabus perspective they have done all the math — but they don’t understand it well enough conceptually to do the coding. A lot of students weren’t ready to take the first course, so our only option was to come up with our own set of foundation courses and teach those beforehand. Our students in Rwanda and the Dominican Republic are similar. And other than the students from the top schools, it’s the same in India too.</p>



<h4><strong>How does the AI training industry compare in the U.S.?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>The bootcamps are expensive — $24,000 or so for a typical course —&nbsp;but bootcamps have a lot of infrastructure costs, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/15/new-yorks-programming-ed-tech-startup-general-assembly-sells-to-adecco-for-413-million/">so margins are narrower </a>than for a typical tech company. In traditional coding bootcamps, the students are not computer science students. They’re not making much money yet. In AI bootcamps, students are already software engineers; they already have good jobs. They don’t want to stop making money and enroll in a bootcamp. This might be another reason there aren’t as many AI bootcamps in the U.S.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Do you think, then, that the talent shortage in the U.S. will continue?</strong></h4>



<p>There are a couple of things that might reduce it. There are the bootcamps, and also, AI tools <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2017/04/10/the-commoditization-of-ai-and-the-long-term-value-of-data/">are being commoditized</a> —&nbsp;you can build basic versions of a system. But if you want to make any improvement, then it’s a black box. Probably there will be some point in the future where the shortage will start to taper, but it hasn’t happened yet.</p>

<h4><strong>Could online courses teaching AI — such as those offered by fast.ai or deeplearning.ai —&nbsp;help satisfy the demand?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Those are mostly taken by computer science students, but the problem with <a href="https://www.fast.ai/">purely online</a>, <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/">self-paced courses</a> is that the completion rate is less than 10%. We have online classes now too, but they’re live classes, which makes a huge difference. Most students need more hand-holding, and there’s a lack of faculty. The foundation of AI, unlike programming in general, is all math. You can learn Python programming in six months, but you can’t learn all the foundations of math in the same amount of time. It just takes more time and more effort, from students and from teachers. There’s no shortcut.</p>



<p>We want to contribute to that by democratizing quality AI education, which will speed up the adoption and production of AI engineers. We are thinking of scaling up beyond our current reach by rolling out a program called Teach AI for the World. Like Teach for America, talented AI engineers would travel to different countries and teach for one or two years. We want to see thousands of teachers teaching thousands of AI programs around the world.</p>



<h4><strong>You mention </strong><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/04/16/heres-why-we-need-to-democratize-artificial-intelligence/#32cf4ee4f2c2"><strong>“democratizing AI”</strong></a><strong> often. What does it really mean?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>There are three core things. The first is bringing AI technology to underserved communities, such as Nepal. Our most successful product has been a platform for AI-assisted learning called <a href="https://www.fuseclassroom.com/">Fuse Classrooms</a>, which was adapted from the platform we created to teach fellows. It can inform teachers how students in their classes are doing, what material they’re struggling with, and what they should study to improve. It’s being sold in some markets for as cheap as a dollar, and it hasn’t been long, but altogether, we already have students logging half a million minutes a day.</p>



<p>The second is bringing high-quality AI-education programs as well, so that people in these communities can learn how to build AI themselves. People who live in underserved markets understand how and why AI can make a big impact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The third thing is enabling the skilled engineers we train to either find jobs or build their own AI technologies. When we accept fellows, our big focus is on training engineers further so they can impact their community. They will eventually become managers and create more demand for AI solutions and engineers.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>In the long run, we want to make AI education — really good AI education — available to everyone, getting to the bottom of the pyramid.</p></blockquote></figure>



<h4><strong>How do you ensure your students aren’t just the elites in the developing countries where you work?</strong></h4>



<p>In Nepal, we’re already starting to partner with schools outside of Kathmandu, and we’re planning to pilot larger live online classes. In the long run, we want to make AI education — really good AI education — available to everyone, getting to the bottom of the pyramid. But we’re not there right now, because we don’t have enough resources. For example, there are students without access to a mobile device, and we can’t afford to buy them these devices. Right now, we mostly train people who studied computer science, most of whom are from Kathmandu. They’re elite in the sense that they can afford a phone and a laptop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re creating offline platforms, so that if students don’t have internet access but the school does, they can come to the school and download what they need for two or three weeks at a time and continue studying through the app. We also want to go downstream. In Nepal, there are 8 million students in school but only 400,000 in undergraduate programs. More than 7 million students just disappear, so we want to start teaching students in high school or earlier.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>But you’re also a for-profit company. Where is the trade-off between that and the goal of truly democratizing AI?</strong></h4>



<p>The way we look at it is that we have two bottom lines. We have a for-profit company, so we need to make money and grow. We have investors who seek returns on their investment. But our other bottom line is democratizing AI such that it makes lives better for a lot of people. I think there are ways to achieve both; you have to find a balance. For example, our <a href="https://www.fusemachines.com/press/press-release/?id=fuse.ai-global-launch">Fusemachines fellowships</a> were open to anyone who wanted to learn, and half of the students from several cohorts were already employees at other companies. That didn’t make sense from a business perspective, but it did from a democratization perspective. We will probably seek grant funding to democratize beyond what we are able to do as a company.</p>



<h4><strong>Where do you think tomorrow’s AI talent will come from?</strong></h4>



<p>There will be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/5/16737224/global-ai-talent-shortfall-tencent-report">a huge uptick in AI engineers</a> coming from developing countries, the way India became <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/india-engineering-degree/">a big center for software development</a> in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The trend will probably be similar, if not even more accelerated with AI, …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><em>Hello everyone. I want to bring back one of my old articles. Wrote it in 2012. Long time ago. I found it while searching something on web archive site. 
I'll copy the content as it is, my thoughts on this topic haven't changed so much. This republishing is me paying tribute to that article.
</em></p>
<p>Test driven development is a very powerful thing. Although I don’t use it on every day basis, I’m a big admirer of the whole TDD concept. When I first heard of it, it made me laugh. It sounded impossible to me (especially for my poor skills). It was something like looking into the future. How the hell I can possibly know what and how will I implement something. Sounds familiar?</p>
<p>From my point of view, it’s not easy at all to cross the border and step into the TDD world. You have to think differently. And you probably won’t change your mind over night. Or maybe you will, like in my case when the TDD was the only way out of the problem.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-don-t-use-it-">Why I don’t use it?</h2>
<p>Well, let me present you one more scenario you are, I’m sure, familiar with. New requirements are there and, of course, deadline is near. If you step back and take a look at the whole picture, you’ll see that TDD can save you in general a lot of time. But when the deadline is near we are looking only the small piece of that picture. We just want to finish something before our next deployment, write some test after the implementation and forget about it (until our next meeting with Mr Debugger).</p>
<p>Another thing, I still think you need to be very experienced developer in order to perform truly test driven development all the time.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-do-use-it-">Why I do use it?</h2>
<p>As I wrote before, I didn’t “believe” in TDD until it provided me an exit from a very tricky situation with lots of conditions, loops and complicated logic. I started to write code in a usual way, finished few blocks of code, but soon it became so big I didn’t know where to change, what to change, and if I change something will it work as before. My brain was just over capacity. A colleague of mine told me I was ready for one “TDD session”. He started with really simple tests and forced me to write the rest. Of course, he helped me to finish it later, also with some refactoring. That was the point where I started to look differently at TDD.</p>
<p>I don’t always TDD… But when I do it, it’s because I’m working on something very very complicated, or it’s something I wan’t to be 300% sure it’s working as I want (some financial stuff for example). It doesn’t need to be complicated or serious all the time. I tend to do TDD when I feel I could easily make mistakes and spend more time in debug mode than in developing. Those are situations when I use TDD.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.</p>
<p>-- Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="short-example">Short example</h2>
<p>I hope this simple Java example will be enough to present you a basics of TDD. Imagine you have a simple ajax call and as a result you want your Java object presented as JSON. Ok, I know, you already have many ways to convert the Java object to JSON, but for this purpose lets convert it manually. As you can see in example below, there are a lot of double quotes. In Java, you have to escape them if you want to have them in your string, so there is a possibility that you will forget to escape all the double quotes. That’s one of the reasons I found this example interesting for TDD.</p>
<pre><code>
{<span>"menu"</span>: {
  <span>"id"</span>: <span>"file"</span>,
  <span>"value"</span>: <span>"File"</span>,
  <span>"popup"</span>: {
    <span>"menuitem"</span>: [
      {<span>"value"</span>: <span>"New"</span>, <span>"onclick"</span>: <span>"CreateNewDoc()"</span>},
      {<span>"value"</span>: <span>"Open"</span>, <span>"onclick"</span>: <span>"OpenDoc()"</span>},
      {<span>"value"</span>: <span>"Close"</span>, <span>"onclick"</span>: <span>"CloseDoc()"</span>}
    ]
  }
}}
</code></pre><p>Now, let’s say you have list of <code>User</code> objects, and you want to create JSON from it, but you don’t want to include all user fields, just few of them, for example first and last name.</p>
<p>We will start from the beginning. First we will write a test for a case when the list of users is <code>null</code>. For this case we will throw a <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>. I will use this example to show you how to properly test an exceptions.</p>
<pre><code><span>@Test</span>(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
<span><span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>testExtractUserNullAsList</span><span>()</span> </span>{
    
    List&lt;User&gt; users = <span>null</span>;

    <span>try</span> {
        
        ModelMapper.extractUsers(users);
    } <span>catch</span> (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        assertEquals(<span>"user list is null"</span>, e.getMessage());
        <span>throw</span> e;
    }
</code></pre><p>After that, you’ll write an implementation to make your test pass. Notice the line138, which is telling that it is OK for this test to throw the exception. Another thing, I put the method into the try-catch block. You can make this test pass without putting the method into the try-catch block. The thing is, when you have more complicated tests where you expect some method calls, only way to verify all of them is to verify them in the catch block and then re-throw the exception. So, if you omit the try-catch block, your test will pass (as you expect the exception) but many of your mocks won’t be verified. Below is simple implementation that will make the first test pass.</p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>String</span> extractUsers(List&lt;User&gt; users) {
   <span>if</span> (users == <span>null</span>) {
       <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> IllegalArgumentException(<span>"user list is null"</span>);
   }

   <span>return</span> <span>null</span>;
}
</code></pre><p>Now, let’s make another test. This time, we will pass the empty list. We are taking care of the small things first. Later we will do the complicated things. That’s how you should write your tests. For now, we want the empty JSON object to be returned.</p>
<pre><code><span>@Test</span>
<span>public</span> <span>void</span> testExtractUsersEmptyList() {
    
    List&lt;User&gt; users = <span>new</span> ArrayList&lt;User&gt;();

    
    <span>String</span> result = ModelMapper.extractUsers(users);

    
    assertEquals(<span>"{}"</span>, result);

}
</code></pre><p>After adding some code, our method now looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>String</span> extractUsers(List&lt;User&gt; users) {
    <span>if</span> (users == <span>null</span>) {
        <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> IllegalArgumentException(<span>"user list is null"</span>);
    }

    <span>if</span> (users.isEmpty()) {
        <span>return</span> <span>"{}"</span>;
    }

    <span>return</span> <span>null</span>;
 }
</code></pre><p>The next thing, we want to write tests for case we have few users in that list. First, we will write a test, of course, where we will define what we want as a result of the method. That test will look something like this</p>
<pre><code><span>@Test</span>
 <span>public</span> <span>void</span> testExtractUsers() {
    
    User john = createDummyUser(<span>1</span>, <span>"John"</span>, <span>"Doe"</span>);
    User jane = createDummyUser(<span>2</span>, <span>"Jane"</span>, <span>"Doe"</span>);
    List&lt;User&gt; users = <span>new</span> ArrayList&lt;User&gt;();
    users.add(john);
    users.add(jane);

    
    <span>String</span> result = ModelMapper.extractUsers(users);

    
    assertEquals(<span>"{\"users\":[{\"id\":\"1\",\"name\":\"John Doe\"},{\"id\":\"2\",\"name\":\"Jane Doe\"}]}"</span>, result);

 }
</code></pre><p>Of course, if we run this test now, it will fail. Now, we’ll extend our implementation. After finishing the implementation and successfully escaping all of the double quotes, my method now looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>public static String extractUsers(List&lt;User&gt; users) {
    <span>if</span> (users == null) {
        throw <span>new</span> IllegalArgumentException(<span>"user list is null"</span>);
    }

    <span>if</span> (users.isEmpty()) {
        <span>return</span> <span>"{}"</span>;
    } <span>else</span> {
        StringBuilder sb = <span>new</span> StringBuilder();
        sb.<span>append</span>(<span>"{\"users\":["</span>);
        <span>for</span> (User u : users) {
            sb.<span>append</span>(<span>"{\"id\":\""</span>)
            .<span>append</span>(u.getId())
            .<span>append</span>(<span>"\","</span>)
            .<span>append</span>(<span>"\"name\":\""</span>)
            .<span>append</span>(u.getFirstName())
            .<span>append</span>(<span>" "</span>)
            .<span>append</span>(u.getLastName())
            .<span>append</span>(<span>"\"}"</span>);
    }

    sb.<span>append</span>(<span>"]}"</span>);

    <span>return</span> sb.toString();

    }
 }
</code></pre><p>But, after running test, I realize I missed something. Test failed because I didn’t separate users by comma. This is where tests are also helpful. If I didn’t covered this with tests, I could continue to develop without noticing that I’m missing this comma and (maybe) I could have long debug time in Javascript in order to find why I can’t parse the response properly.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1597593139559/fRJ9Fiphv.jpeg?auto=format&amp;q=60"></p>
<p>Here’s my method after small modifications:</p>
<pre><code>public static String extractUsers(List&lt;User&gt; users) {
    <span>if</span> (users == null) {
        throw <span>new</span> IllegalArgumentException(<span>"user list is null"</span>);
    }

    <span>if</span> (users.isEmpty()) {
        <span>return</span> <span>"{}"</span>;
    } <span>else</span> {
        StringBuilder sb = <span>new</span> StringBuilder();
        sb.<span>append</span>(<span>"{\"users\":["</span>);
        <span>for</span> (User u : users) {
        sb.<span>append</span>(<span>"{\"id\":\""</span>)
        .<span>append</span>(u.getId())
        .<span>append</span>(<span>"\","</span>)
        .<span>append</span>(<span>"\"name\":\""</span>)
        .<span>append</span>(u.getFirstName())
        .<span>append</span>(<span>" "</span>)
        .<span>append</span>(u.getLastName())
        .<span>append</span>(<span>"\"}"</span>);

        <span>if</span> (users.indexOf(u) &lt; users.size() - <span>1</span>) {
            sb.<span>append</span>(<span>","</span>);
        }
    }
    sb.<span>append</span>(<span>"]}"</span>);

    <span>return</span> sb.toString();

    }
}
</code></pre><p>OK, now I can continue. But, let’s say I don’t like that <code>indexOf(u)</code> mumbo jumbo magic. It doesn’t look nice. I have an idea and with all these tests, it won’t be a problem to do the refactoring. After all, refactoring is one of the steps in the TDD.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fail, pass, refactor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One question for you. Imagine you have some complicated Javascript component that do a lot of work and hardly relies on your JSON response and you don’t have unit tests. Would you dare to do the refactoring if you have a deadline? Would you dare to do the refactoring at all? In this case, we have encountered with the double quotes escaping and adding commas. If we had few more things like that, every one of them will be a valid argument against the refactoring.</p>
<p>Let’s get back to the refactoring. In this example I’ll use <code>Iterator</code> because the <code>hasNext()</code> method will be perfect replacement in the <code>if</code> statement. Next step is to refactor until the tests are green again. After introducing <code>Iterator</code>, my method looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>public static String extractUsers(List users) {
    <span>if</span> (users == null) {
        throw <span>new</span> IllegalArgumentException(<span>"user list is null"</span>);
    }

    <span>if</span> (users.isEmpty()) {
        <span>return</span> <span>"{}"</span>;
    } <span>else</span> {
        StringBuilder sb = <span>new</span> StringBuilder();

        sb.<span>append</span>(<span>"{\"users\":["</span>);

        Iterator&lt;User&gt; userIterator = users.iterator();

        while (userIterator.hasNext()) {
            User u = userIterator.next();
           …</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Dear new developer,</p>



<p>I hope you enjoyed reading these letters. I’ve certain enjoyed writing them. When I chat with new developers, at meetups, on slack, or via email, they let me know when letters are helpful or unclear. They suggest topics. They give me feedback, which, when you’re writing into the howling abyss of the internet, is very helpful both for calibrating your message and improving your motivation. </p>



<p>I’ve also posted these letters to <a href="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2019/02/11/join-an-online-tech-community/">some online communities</a>. I’ve received plenty of feedback from those folks as well. Some kind, some caustic. That’s not unexpected.</p>



<p> After writing a hundred or so posts, I thought, there’s a book here. </p>



<p>And so I wrote one.</p>



<p>You can buy it from any of the usual suspects:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781484260739">Indiebound</a></li><li><a href="https://bookshop.org/books/letters-to-a-new-developer-what-i-wish-i-had-known-when-starting-my-development-career/9781484260739">Bookshop</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Letters-New-Developer-Starting-Development/dp/1484260732/">Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/letters-to-a-new-developer-dan-moore/1137054764">Barnes and Noble</a></li><li><a href="https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484260739">Apress US website</a> / <a href="https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484260739">Apress international website</a></li></ul>



<p>You can also check out a preview of the chapters on <a href="https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484260739">the publisher’s website</a>. I’d love if you’d do so. </p>



<p>Here’s who I wrote it for:</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>For new developers</strong><br>You are new to the software development job market. Perhaps you have completed a bootcamp or college degree. You may refer to yourself as an entry level or junior engineer.</p><p>While everyone’s background and skills growth happens at different speeds, new developers generally have less than five years of professional experience. Many new developers are worried about their abilities, don’t feel welcome, and have a difficult time finding that first job.</p><p>But as an industry, we need more new developers. There are so many problems with which software can help. Companies want experienced engineers, but all the senior developers I know started out as new developers. A senior engineer is just a new engineer seasoned with gaffes, education, and time.</p><p>For new developers, this book will help you avoid missteps I’ve made. It also introduces you to disciplines beyond coding critical to success. While programming is crucial for any software product or service, there is much more required to deliver an application.</p><p><strong>For anyone considering software development<br></strong>If you’re not sure if software engineering is right for you, this book offers perspectives on how to succeed.</p><p>I’ve intentionally kept the barriers to the layperson low with limited technical jargon. Only a few technologies are discussed, and those sections can be skipped. If you are thinking about becoming a developer, I’d recommend buying this book and a book about programming.</p><p>Giving a computer commands that it can execute is an important skill for any software developer. But software engineering is so much more. You must know what to build, how to work with your team, and how to maintain your systems.</p><p><strong>For mentors<br></strong>If you are mentoring a new developer, this book can serve as a discussion guide. Because each chapter has letters approaching a theme from different angles, you and your mentee will find it useful for focused mentoring sessions.</p><p>As an experienced developer, you’ll of course bring your own insights and experience to each topic, from your debugging process to the value of an online community for continuous learning.</p><p>And, of course, you may have had a different experience than what I share. Such contrasts are a jumping-off point to discuss the diversity available in a software development career.</p><cite>Introduction, “Letters To a New Developer”</cite></blockquote>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Dan</p>



<p>PS If you <a href="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/contact/">shoot me an email</a>, I’ll give you a discount code.</p>

  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EkDVKthufAM" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</p>


<p>
I recently gave a talk at work to help introduce OpenBSD to my
colleagues. It's a broad introduction to the fundamentals of security
in OpenBSD, as well as some basic system administration tips and
suggestions anyone coming from a Linux background might find useful.
</p>
<p>
It's roughly split up into four sections; the history of OpenBSD,
what sets it apart from other operating systems, a guided
installation, and the system administration introduction.
</p>
<p>
In the original presentation the guided installation was done
interactively with the participants installing OpenBSD in a VM on
their machines to follow along with the slides.
</p>
<p>
I've tried my best to make it as accessible as possible while still
covering the most important beats. If you find any errors please let
me know so I can correct them, my contact info is on the <a href="https://blog.lambda.cx/about/">about</a> page.
</p>
<p>
I've corrected several small issues with the slides since the
recording. I've replaced the file name <code>/etc/mygateway</code> with <code>/etc/mygate</code>,
replaced the smartquotes with regular quotes, and removed the rebound
program, to name the biggest fixes. These corrections are available at
the slides linked below.

<date>Published: 2020-08-15 | Categories: <b><a href="http://www.thepulsar.be/archives/engineering"><span>[»]</span> Engineering</a></b>, <b><a href="http://www.thepulsar.be/archives/optics"><span>[»]</span> Optics</a></b>and<b><a href="http://www.thepulsar.be/archives/programming"><span>[»]</span> Programming</a></b>.</date>
<p>4 Months and 400 hours were necessary to bring life to the Spectrum Analyzer software that I am glad to announce to you today.</p>

<p>The software, which was initially modest, has grown into a fully functional program suite that covers most of the features traditionally implemented in commercial spectroscopy software. It includes single and live acquisition of spectra, loading/saving and export to clipboard, filtering, baseline removal and an automated calibration algorithm that I specially designed for the occasion. A screenshot of the software performing a calibration is shown in Figure 1.</p>

<figure><img src="http://www.thepulsar.be/images/spectrum-analyzer-software-for-openraman/screenshot.png"><figcaption>Figure 1 – Spectrum Analyzer software screenshot</figcaption></figure>

<p>A <a href="http://www.open-raman.org/build/software/" target="_blank"><span>[∞]</span> specific page</a> was created on the companion website to host the latest version of the software for download. As the rest of the project, the software is distributed under the open-source CERN OHL-W v2 license.</p>

<p>Although the software was designed to interface to the OpenRAMAN spectrometers, it will actually work with any dispersion-based spectrometers using PointGrey camera. It may even work with different camera manufacturers or with CCD linear array as long as you provide a DLL to interface to the hardware. The source code is given with a the DLL necessary to interface to PointGrey cameras, which can be used as an example on how to implement other camera types. The program even support multiple spectrometers connected to the same computer using each a different hardware! I don’t know if that will actually be useful but I made it as flexible as possible to avoid restrictions that would later block some users.</p>

<p>The software will work with either .CSV files or with a custom file format that I implemented using an upgraded version of the technique I presented <a href="http://www.thepulsar.be/article/implementing-object-persistence-in-c--"><span>[»]</span> here</a>. One of the most challenging difficulty I had to face was to allow 32 bits version of the software to load the files saved with the 64 bits version. This seems easy at glance but the original technique I developed do not cope well with that. One advantage of the custom file format is that the files contains the data, the blank and all the program settings (filtering, calibration etc.) so that you can tweak them later.</p>

<p>As explained above, the software also features an automated calibration procedure. You simply measured the spectra of a Neon or Argon-Mercury lamp, give the number of peaks that appears on screen and click on the “calibrate!” button. The algorithm is extremely robust to missing peaks and converge to a solution within a few seconds (4 seconds on my super-old laptop). By default, the algorithm will look on a very broad range of parameters, which basically cover the whole visible region of the spectrum, but advanced user can also tune the settings when necessary.</p>

<p>The software also implements many other features like time-lapsed acquisitions to monitor reactions, automatic saving of spectra, baseline removal algorithm and Savitzky-Golay filtering. The user can also freely choose between wavelength and Raman shifts axis, save and import calibration data etc. Also, the calibration will be saved inside the camera so if you connect the spectrometer to a different computer it will remain calibrated!</p>

<p>I invite you to test the software to discover all the possibilities. You don’t have to possess a spectrometer to run the software as you can import any .CSV file where the first column represents the x-axis and the second column the y-axis.</p>

<p>During the next weeks/months, I will post detailed articles on how the major features were implemented. The first article will be about the automated calibration procedure.</p>

Let's start with an important question...</p><p id="viewer-vcge"><span><em>How much do employees really accomplish in a 40+ hour work weeks? <strong>On avg. 15 hours... </strong></em></span></p><p id="viewer-a7ej"><strong>Wasted Time</strong></p><p id="viewer-8pnvh"><span><strong>-10 Hours/Week</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-fg1q7">Americans typically waste about five to ten hours each week, in their commute to work. That means they may be clocked in for 40 hours each week, but really they invest closer to 50 hours each week. </p><p id="viewer-4bphf"><strong>-10 Hours/Week</strong>
While at work corporate employees must foster and nurture their relationships with their coworkers. That's at least an hour or two of water cooler talk and gossip. </p><p id="viewer-95vrl"><span><strong>-15 Hours/Week</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-4352n">Then there are constraints of managing our existing relationships in our lives through social media and cellular devices that take two or three more hours of our time. </p><p id="viewer-fgpg6">That leaves about three hours of work that actually gets done each day, equalling on average 15 hours of productive work per week. I<span>t is next to impossible to expect employees to work productively for such long periods. You will not get their best work since science explains mental and physical fatigue will set in, no matter the amount of caffeine consumption.</span></p><p id="viewer-4nsh9"><span>Here's the tough part of the sell for the companies to digest. <strong>Pay your employee the same salary that you've paid them for the 40+ hours they currently work.</strong> Now wash that down with some cold hard facts. </span></p><p id="viewer-7kn60"><strong>Cold Hard Fact #1: </strong></p><p id="viewer-d6gkv">Most employees have been more productive since working from home.</p><p id="viewer-8lqkg"><strong>Cold Hard Fact #2:</strong></p><p id="viewer-bismg">Fatigue limits productive work.</p><p id="viewer-ep8oa"><strong>Cold Hard Fact #3:</strong></p><p id="viewer-e6bbk">Happy employees are more productive and perform significantly better.</p><p id="viewer-3k395"><strong>Monday - Work From Home 6 Hours</strong></p><p id="viewer-kf6g">Monday is work from home for six hours. This eliminates the 'Monday Blues' that most employees go through. Imagine after a relaxing Sunday, attending church and finishing errands to prepare for the week ahead, you get to work from home. Your employees become elated, generating more endorphins, which ultimately peaks productivity during this work period (and the rest of the week).</p><p id="viewer-b3cgk"><strong>Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday - Work In Office 6 Hours</strong></p><p id="viewer-2g9sq">Doing this eliminates fatigue of your employees. Ultimately, maximizing peak performance periods. Less time, equals more attention to detail and more focus, which maximizes this 18 hour period. This also increases revenue for coffee in the morning, and happy hours after work because more time is available. And let's face it, going to work creates a different moral and team chemistry that is ultimately necessary to benefit the company.</p><p id="viewer-bdooq"><strong>Friday, Saturday, Sunday - Off</strong></p><p id="viewer-4sqa4">What do most people do on a three day weekend?

	<p>I host Google fonts locally not only to load them faster but also to take advantage of font loading strategies which goes directly to the heart of creating the ultimate user experience.</p>
<p>Hosting Google fonts locally to boost speed is one thing. Knowing how to load them with an effective strategy that strikes a perfect balance between performance and user perception is another.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, browsers are not quite where we'd like them to be in terms how they handle custom fonts which leaves us to our own devices when deciding on a suitable font loading strategy.</p>
<p>While some of these strategies are still nowhere near perfect, one thing remains certain. You'll need to host Google fonts locally if you want to retain maximum control.</p>

	<div>
		<div>
	<p>Without intervention font loading is primarily handled by the browser.</p>
<p>If your preferred font fails to load due to a slow download, the browser will mitigate this by loading a fallback (system) font.</p>
<p>A system font is a font used by your operating system to display text. Common system fonts include Arial, Times New Roman and Georgia.</p>
<p>A fallback font is basically a preferred system font that you specify.</p>
<p><picture><source data-swift-image-lazyload="true" data-srcset="https://www.wpmediamastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/specifying-fonts-and-fallbacks.png.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="specifying preferred google font plus fallback fonts" data-src="https://www.wpmediamastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/specifying-fonts-and-fallbacks.png" data-srcset="" data-sizes="" data-swift-image-lazyload="true" data-style="" data-l="" src="https://www.wpmediamastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/specifying-fonts-and-fallbacks.png"></picture></p>
<p>Here is a table illustrating the behavior adopted by some of the popular browsers.</p>
<p><picture><source data-swift-image-lazyload="true" data-srcset="https://www.wpmediamastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/browser-specific-timeout-to-load-fallback-font.png.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="times that browsers wait before loading fallback fonts" data-src="https://www.wpmediamastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/browser-specific-timeout-to-load-fallback-font.png" data-srcset="" data-sizes="" data-swift-image-lazyload="true" data-style="" data-l="" src="https://www.wpmediamastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/browser-specific-timeout-to-load-fallback-font.png"></picture></p>
<ul>
<li>Chrome, Opera and Firefox timeout after 3 seconds. At this point, text will be displayed using the fallback font. As soon as the primary font is available, the text will be re-rendered. Herein lies the problem of FOUT and reflows. Text rendered using the fallback font is referred to as a flash of unformatted text (FOUT). A reflow occurs when the primary font becomes available and the text is re-rendered. Not sure about you but I've experienced this often and found it to be disruptive.</li>
<li>Internet Explorer renders text immediately due to a zero second timeout. A fallback font is used if the primary font is unavailable and re-rendering takes place once the primary font is ready. The benefit of FOUT is that, at very least, the user is faced with text immediately. However, this comes at the expense of a perfect user experience.</li>
<li>Safari has no timeout leaving users without text until such time that the primary font is downloaded and ready for use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prior to the 3 second timeout with Chrome, Opera and Firefox (or no timeout in the case with Safari), a slow connection or a delay in the Google font download will likely leave users with a flash of invisible text (FOIT).</p>
<p>To add fuel to the fire, our font loading strategy is limited.</p>
<p>The relatively new <code>font-display: block | swap | fallback | optional | auto</code> descriptor allows you to control how your font renders <strong>before</strong> it is fully loaded but is by no means a perfect solution.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>block</strong> - FOIT + infinite swap period. The invisible fallback text is replaced as soon as the designated font is available.</li>
<li><strong>swap</strong> - FOUT + infinite swap period. The fallback font is replaced as soon as the primary font is ready for us.</li>
<li><strong>fallback</strong> - Almost imperceptible block period (&lt;= 100ms) + small swap period (FOUT + swap).</li>
<li><strong>optional</strong> - Almost imperceptible block period (&lt;= 100ms) + no swap. Great for best user experience where content is preferential to aesthetics.</li>
<li><strong>auto</strong> - based on user agent (browser) strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: Prior to May 2019 the use of the font-display descriptor could only be achieved when hosting Google fonts locally due to the CSS being hosted on your own server.</p>
<p>OK, with a very basic understanding of font loading, let's forge on.</p>
</div>

<div data-node="5f325c72c8b3c">

</div>
<div data-node="5f325c828a6c8">
	<div>
		<div>
	<p>What I've learned from experience is that FOIT is not always FOIT.</p>
<p>Sound cryptic?</p>
<p>Consider a scenario where a site uses white text over a dark image.</p>
<p>Where the internet connection is fast the text may load concurrently with, or just before, the image. No problems here.</p>
<p>But if the connection happens to slow down temporarily or even sometimes on first load of a site in a browser with a clean cache and/or where one's PC is also busy with some background process/es, it can appear as if&nbsp; the header and navigation loads before the text and image, leaving a mostly blank screen.</p>
<p>That said, the text may, in fact have loaded but in the absence of an image the white text is invisible on a white background. So what one may think is FOIT, may in fact have been white text on a white background.</p>
<p>The solution is to use a solid color overlay that will allow text to show while waiting for the image to load. The image may load after milliseconds but it's still preferable to an almost blank screen. The other option is to change the text color.</p>
</div>
	</div>
</div>
<div data-node="5f325cf3cc198">

	</span></h2>
	</p>
</div>
<div data-node="5f325d07e4f4a">
	<div>
		<div>
	<p>For starters, the more HTTP requests to external sites needed to render your page/s, the slower your site will load. To exacerbate this, scripts and CSS are render blocking so poor optimization coupled with a slow server and a bloated theme could prove disastrous to user experience.</p>
<p>Additionally, being called by CSS, Google fonts are no exception to the render blocking conundrum.</p>
<p>Render blocking occurs when the parsing of HTML needed to render the page is paused (blocked) temporarily until all scripts and CSS complete their processes.</p>
<p>Besides a number of granular optimizations, <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/optimization/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the most important factors affecting page speed</a> (in this order) are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hosting</li>
<li>Theme Choice</li>
<li>Caching</li>
</ul>
</div>
	</div>
</div>

<div data-node="5f325db632936">
	<div>
		<div>
	<p>A fast site is crucial for optimal font loading and this starts with hosting.</p>
<p>No amount of optimizing can compensate for a lack of speed.</p>
<p>And because the whole objective of hosting Google fonts locally is to improve user experience, it would be counterproductive to consider unless you can outperform font delivery provided by Google's cloud servers and CDN.</p>
<p>A shared server is highly unlikely to outperform Google's servers.</p>
<p>I used to host with Siteground but because I wasn't seeing the type of speed I wanted, I switched to Cloudways. This site is served from a Digital Ocean server in New York and it's blazing fast.</p>
<p>On top of that, Siteground's renewal fees are crazy.</p>
<p>With Cloudways you can get a <a title="Cloudways" href="https://www.wpmediamastery.com/go/cloudways/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">hosting plan for as little as $10 per month</a> which will allow at least as many site visits as Siteground's best shared hosting plan at $35 per month.</p>
<p>And that gives you fully dedicated resources and the benefit of Pay-As-You-Go pricing, i.e. No Contracts.</p>

	<p>A lightweight, well coded and optimized theme with a good caching plugin like WP Rocket is the next most important speed factor.</p>
<p>I don't venture past anything but a <a title="Studiopress" href="https://www.wpmediamastery.com/go/studiopress/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">StudioPress theme</a> (Genesis Framework) because there's just nothing that comes close in terms of optimization, i.e. clean coding, zero bloat plus the ability to create any type of site. And while you may expect a theme of such caliber to be pricey, they're actually cheaper.</p>
<p>The licence provides you with <strong>unlimited everything</strong>. So for a <strong>once off cost</strong> you get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lifetime updates</li>
<li>Lifetime support and ...</li>
<li>You can use the theme on as many sites as you like.</li>

	<p>Caching is absolutely crucial when it comes to font loading. While there's certainly no shortage of caching plugins, there are only two contenders in my view:</p>
<ul>
<li>WP Rocket.</li>
<li>Swift Performance Pro.</li>
</ul>
<p><a title="WPRocket" href="https://www.wpmediamastery.com/go/wprocket/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">WP Rocket</a> is rock solid and has been around for way longer than Swift Performance Pro.</p>
<p>As a result, they've long since ironed out all the small bugs and it's also really simple to setup and works out of the box.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wpmediamastery.com/wp-rocket-review-plus-ideal-settings/">WP Rocket Review And Setup Guide.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Swift Performance Pro offers more granular control. However, it's better suited to those who have a bit of knowledge and experience when it comes to caching.</p>
<p>If you really want to harness it's full features you'll need to know what you're doing and be prepared to <a href="https://www.wpmediamastery.com/swift-performance-review-and-settings/">experiment until you find the settings that give you the best results</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Savings accounts allow you to save money with a regulated financial institution and earn some interest. There are several types of savings accounts, but they mostly revolve around three themes - easy access, notice and fixed savings. Easy access accounts allow you to withdraw your money whenever you want. Notice accounts require you to give your provider a few days' notice before making a withdrawal. Fixed accounts allow you to save your money for a fixed period at a guaranteed interest rate. This rate is usually slightly higher than notice or easy access accounts.<br>‍<br><strong>Your money is protected up to £85,000:</strong><br>When you save money in an authorised financial institution, your savings are protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). This means if the financial institution goes bust, you can claim your money back up to £85,000 per financial institution (£170,000 for joint accounts). So, if you have a lot of money to save, it might be wise to spread it across different financial institutions. We recommend you save at most £83,000 in one institution, leaving some room for interest.<br>‍<br>Some of these financial institutions have a shared licence, which means they share their licence with another institution. If you put your money in two institutions that share a licence and both go bust, you'll only be entitled to a maximum of £85,000 from the FSCS. Examples of financial institutions that share a licence are Halifax, Bank of Scotland and BM Savings (all three share the same licence).<br>‍<br><strong>Most people won't pay taxes on savings' income:</strong><br>Depending on your income tax band, you may not have to pay taxes on interest earned on savings. For example, basic-rate taxpayers can earn up to £1,000 in interest tax-free every year. Higher-rate taxpayers can earn up to £500. Additional-rate taxpayers have no tax-free allowance. If you are interested in tax-free accounts, have a look at <a href="https://www.koody.co/saving/isa">ISAs</a>.<br>‍<br>Below, you'll find the easy access, notice and fixed-rate savings accounts which pay the highest interest at the moment. These are not recommendations. They are simply the savings accounts with highest interest rates. All financial institutions we list are regulated by the FCA, and their savings accounts are protected by the FSCS up to £85,000.<br></p><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea8e1014488c25d7742640f/5f227e4d58bbc37bc1507dec_savings-accounts-sign-500x500px.png" alt="Savings accounts are almost tax free" height="300"></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>I want to show you some ways to represent puzzles with four spatial dimensions. Even though the fourth dimension is used to make the puzzles more exciting, 4D puzzles can show the simplicity of adding one dimension. Playing these puzzles helps visualizing more dimensions than the three we notice in day-to-day life.</p>
<h2>Dimensions</h2>
<p>If you don't look too closely, a grain of sand is a 0D object, a thread 1D, a piece of paper 2D, and a block of wood 3D.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NTQ5NjEucG5n/original/gLK56i.png"></p>
<p>In a 1D world you can only move forward and backward, in 2D you can also move left and right. Moving diagonally is a combination of the others, so doesn't count as a new direction. In 3D you can also go up and down, and for 4D we add two more directions.</p>
<p>To check the number of dimensions of space, get as many sticks as possible perpendicular to each other (as seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KC32Vymo0Q#t=4m50" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>). You get to three in this universe, if your sticks aren't too fancy.</p>
<h2>Projections</h2>
<p>What's the use of talking about four dimensions in a 3D world? The same as talking about 3D games or any other seemingly 3D thing on your 2D computer screen, TV, canvas or paper. Things can feel 3D or 4D, even though the final product is 2D. Squashing an object to lower dimensions, like taking a picture or making a shadow on a wall, is called projection. You can always project, project, project, all the way down to zero dimensions. Here is a projection of a ball:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NTU2MDEucG5n/original/qq3UFp.png"></p>
<p>and here's the projection from the top of that projection:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NjAzNDkucG5n/original/Q3XkUN.png"></p>
<h2>Slices</h2>
<p>Our human eyes use projections, but wouldn't it be nicer to be more alien and look at things like an MRI-scanner? Instead of having your vision blocked by the surface of objects, let's slice them up so you can look inside them. You have to choose how thinly you want to slice things. More slices means there is less space per slice in your field of vision, but less slices means you might miss things in between your slices. Here is the sliced up ball, which turns out to have an orange inside:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NTU2MDIucG5n/original/mFaZ9u.png"></p>
<h2>Pre-chopped space</h2>
<p>Games are easier to slice up if the playing field is made of separate squares, like chess or checkers, where you jump between places. (These are technically 1D, but the 2D description is simpler.) You can then give each square a name or number:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NjAxMjcucG5n/original/GSC5NU.png">,<br>which can be sliced up like this:<br><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NjAxNDIucG5n/original/RrCPkZ.png">.<br>The left square in the left slice is next to the left square in the right slice, so 1 is still next to 2 and 3; 2 is still next to 1 and 4, etc. This doesn't accomplish much, but now we have room for a third dimension on our 2D screen:<br><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NjAxNTYucG5n/original/IH8VTb.png">,<br>where 1 is now next to 2, 3 and 5. 7 is next to 5, 8 and 3. To get to 4D, we can also put slices vertically:<br><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NjAxNzkucG5n/original/J5%2FNYB.png">.<br>Now 1 has four neighbors: 2, 3, 5 and 9, because 5 and 9 are in the same position in adjacent slices. This is like putting two cubes next to each other, and acting like the same positions inside the two cubes are adjacent. </p>
<h2>Mazes</h2>
<p>The most basic way to explore a 4D space is to just walk around. To make the walking around a little bit more interesting, people make mazes.</p>
<h2>Some examples</h2>
<p>Going on a quest to find examples of 4D mazes and puzzles leads you through some great old-school web pages like <a href="http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth.htm</a>. There are multiple people who seemingly made it their life's work to collect information about 4D things and mazes. A handy start is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_four-dimensional_games" rel="nofollow noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_four-dimensional_games</a>.<br>Different types of representations are in that list. First, there's the projection of higher dimensional things on a 2D screen seen in <a href="http://superliminal.com/cube/cube.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">http://superliminal.com/cube/cube.htm</a>. </p>
<p>Then there's the option of taking a 3D slice of a 4D world: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t4aKJuKP0Q" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t4aKJuKP0Q</a>. The maker of that video, Marc ten Bosch, has done a lot of work in this field, and is now working on <a href="https://miegakure.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Miegakure</a>. Miegakure stands out because it's more polished than other 4D games, and you can smoothly walk around, instead of step by step. </p>
<p>Finally, instead of slicing just once, you can use the 2D grid of 2D slices we've seen before. This 4D crossword puzzle is a simple example: <a href="http://www.ing.iac.es/~crb/misc/xwd65.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.ing.iac.es/~crb/misc/xwd65.html</a>, and there's more to be found here: <a href="http://old.nklein.com/products/54321/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://old.nklein.com/products/54321/</a>. Here's a 2x2x2x2 solved crossword:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NTUzNTgucG5n/original/%2F0qVeK.png">.<br>Notice words&nbsp;like&nbsp;ai&nbsp;(a&nbsp;type&nbsp;of&nbsp;sloth),&nbsp;ti&nbsp;and&nbsp;no.&nbsp;(aa&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=aa+lava&amp;t=ffab&amp;iar=images&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images" rel="nofollow noopener">rough lava</a>. <a href="https://www.thefreedictionary.com/2-letter-words.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">This list of 2-letter words</a> was helpful.)
</p>
<h2>Triangles and big wally squares</h2>
<p>If you want to have a clear overview of a 4D maze, this 2D grid of 2D slices is often used. There are two ways these mazes are represented: Spaces with lines in between, or having walls and open squares take up the same amount of space. The first one seems more natural for drawing mazes: you take a blank piece of paper and draw walls on it using your pen lines. The second one is like using graph paper and coloring in squares for walls. <br><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NTUwNzMucG5n/original/xdpYOa.png"></p>
<p>To walk around in 4D, the thin wall system needs to show possible moves between slices. Usually triangles point in the direction of the square to jump to (like <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/mazes/comments/71syq5/10x10x10x10_4d_maze/" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>). In the next picture, the way from 1 to 3 is blocked, but 2 has a triangle pointing to the right, so you can reach 4 from there. The triangle to the left in 4 also allows to go back to 2 from 4. (Everybody colors these triangles, so I do too.)</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzQwNDExNDgucG5n/original/aBTxbK.png"></p>
<p>The thick wall maze expands more naturally to four dimensions when using 2D slices. With square walls, you can move to the same position on adjacent squares. To show a passage, you can show an absent wall on the next slice. This is the system used in <a href="https://trudieprod.itch.io/boxpusher-4d">Boxpusher 4D</a>. </p>
<p> In these examples you can follow the same route from the top left all the way through the maze:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzQwNDExNTAucG5n/original/kMAvRk.png">.</p>
<p>Here is the route:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NTU0NjAucG5n/original/z6RPSJ.png">.</p>
<p>With thin walls, you need a lot of triangles for a big empty room. Thick walls are thus better for games which have more open spaces:
</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzQwNDExNTIucG5n/original/lu7xCn.png"></p>
<p>Thick wall games also feel less like you're teleporting, although that still is an issue in getting that 4D feeling.</p>
<h2>Making it feel 4D</h2>
<p>Letting things feel 4D instead of some weird thing where you teleport around is quite challenging. One thing that helps is switching dimensions around to show that you get the same puzzle in a different view. Here is the same maze as before to the left, and on the right a version with the dimensions switched:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzQwNTA3MTYucG5n/original/IKuKDY.png">.</p>
<p>On the right, the first six steps are still in a U-shape, but now you jump between slices. Next, where in the left maze you jump two slices to the right, in the right maze there are two little steps. The same steps in both mazes are shown in green.</p>
<p>Something else that works well is when you can't see everything on your screen at once, like with a 10x10x10x10 map on a 4x4x4x4 grid, and you scroll in different directions.</p>
<h2>6D? 20D?</h2>
<p>Yes, you can expand this approach to n dimensions. You do need enough screen space. And it probably gets confusing.</p></section></div>]]>

<p> Modern computer hardware is amazing. Manufacturers have orchestrated billions of pieces of silicon into terrifyingly complex and efficient structures that sweep electrons through innumerable tangled paths, branchings, and reunions with the sole purpose of performing computations at more than a billion times per second. This awe-inspiring piece of computational wizardry has at its disposal multiple billions of uniquely addressible silicon plates where it can store the results of millions of computations in an array of several vanishingly small chips. All of this hardware, though each component often sits no further than 7 or 8 centimeters away from the others, cycles so fast that the speed of light, a physical law of the universe, limits the rate at which they communicate with each other.

</p><p>Why does it take your operating system 10 seconds, 30 seconds, a minute to boot up? Why does your word processor freeze when you save a document on the cloud?

But we, the software development community, made it slow by ignoring the fundamental reality of our occupation. We write code, code that runs on computers. Real computers, with central processing units and random access memory and hard disk drives and display buffers. Real computers, with integer and bitwise math and floating point units and L2 caches, with threads and cores and a tenuous little network connection to a million billion other computers. Real computers not built for ease of human understanding but for blindingly, incomprehensibly fast speed.
</p><p><span>A lot of us have forgotten that</span>.
</p><p>In our haste to get our products, our projects, the works of our hands and minds, to as many people as possible, we take shortcuts. We make assumptions. We generalize, and abstract, and assume that just because these problems have been solved before that they never need to be solved again. We build abstraction layers, then forget we built them and build more on top.
</p><p>And it's true that many of us think we do not have the time, the money, the mental bandwidth to always consider these things in detail. The deadline is approaching or the rent is due or we have taxes to fill out and a manager on our back and someone asking us why we always spend so much time at the office, and we just have to stick the library or virtual machine or garbage collector in there to cover up the places we can't think through right now.
</p><p>Others of us were never taught to think about the computer itself. We learned about objects and classes and templates and how to make our code clean and pretty. We learned how to write code to make the client or the manager or the teacher happy, but made the processor churn. And because we did, that amazing speed we'd been granted was wasted, by us, in a death by a thousand abstraction layers.
</p><p><span>But some of us aren't satisfied with that.</span>
</p><p>Some of us take a few extra steps into the covered territory, the wheels sitting, motionless, in a pile behind us, examine their designs and decide there is a better way. The more experienced among us remember how software used to be, the potential that we know exists for computer programs to be useful, general, <em>and</em> efficient. Others of us got fed up with the tools we were expected to use without complaint, but which failed us time and time again. Some of us are just curious and don't know what's good for us. Don't trust what we've been told is good for us.
</p><p>We sat down and looked at our hardware, and examined our data, and thought about how to use the one to transform the other. We tinkered, and measured, and read, and compared, and wrote, and refined, and modified, and measured again, over and over, until we found we had built the same thing, but 10 times faster and incomparably more useful to the people we designed it for. And we had built it by hand.
</p><p>That is what Handmade means. It's not a technique or a language or a management strategy, it isn't a formula or a library or an abstraction. It's an idea. The idea that we can build software that works with the computer, not against it. The idea that sometimes an individual programmer can be more productive than a large team, that a small group can do more than an army of software engineers and *do it better*. The idea that programming is about transforming data and we wield the code, the tool we use to bend that data to our will.
</p><p> It doesn't require a degree, or a dissertation, or a decade of experience. You don't need an
expensive computer or a certificate or even prior knowledge. All you need is an open mind and a sense of
curiosity. We'll help you with the rest.
</p><p><span>Will you join us?</span>
</p><p>Will you build your software by hand?</p>

    <p>Hello and welcome to my Coronavirus Genome Walkthrough.</p>

<p>(Hoping someone comes out with that Vaccine Speedrun soon. This boss battle is really shaping up to be an intense one and we’ll need all the artifacts we can get.)</p>

<p>Here, I aim to provide a <em>mechanistic explanation</em> of the SARS-CoV-2 genome’s syntax and semantics. Let’s investigate what the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome actually does as if reading through code like a compiler, from nucleotides to amino acids all the way to proteins. From the four base pairs all the way up to the completed protein-coated virus, what is a virus like this is actually made of on the concrete, physical level?</p>

<h3 id="understanding-a-full-system">Understanding a Full System</h3>

<p>The underlying purpose of this essay is less about the coronavirus <em>per se</em> and more about how having a small—but functionally complete—piece of viral RNA to analyze gives me a unique opportunity to try to understand a complete self-replicating machine from scratch. This is not a feat that I would have the fortitude to manually replicate with the full human genome, for example—but the coronavirus genome, like the <a href="http://openworm.org/">nematode genome</a>, is small enough that we stand a chance at building a complete understanding. The task is perhaps akin to <a href="https://distill.pub/2018/building-blocks/">interpretability</a>, but for biological systems instead of artificial neural networks.</p>

<p>As a consequence, this essay is not intended to produce epidemiological conclusions; there are plenty of other sources for that! This essay is about fully understanding a biological system at the chemical and physical level.</p>

<h3 id="play-curiosity-and-mechanical-understanding">Play, Curiosity, and Mechanical Understanding</h3>

<p>Throughout this essay, I follow my curiosity in the style of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_play">serious play</a>: if I <a href="https://www.readthesequences.com/Noticing-Confusion-Sequence">notice I’m confused</a> about something, I look into it and explore it until I’m satisfied that I now understand, and that my understanding is <em>a <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/science-mechanisms/#ConMec">mechanical</a> understanding</em>. Things are made of stuff! It turns out that we can understand that stuff!</p>

<p>I may skip over some details that were not confusing to me during my own research, but your journey need not be the same as mine. If you’re confused about something while reading this essay, I encourage you to go and look it up! <a href="http://agentyduck.blogspot.com/2015/06/the-art-of-noticing.html">Notice</a> when your curiosity arises; that’s the meditation. Together, we can <a href="http://samoburja.com/how-to-find-the-frontier-of-knowledge/">learn new things</a>.</p>

<p>This all, at least, has been my intention as I set out to create this piece! As Ken Liu said of his philosophy while translating The Three-Body Problem, “I may not have succeeded, but these were the standards I had in mind as I set about my task.”</p>

<p>Part 1, here, covers just the genome and its translation to proteins. I hope to also write a Part 2 which would cover the structure and function of those proteins, their protein-protein interactions, and the full viral life cycle.</p>

<!--Finally, as you may already be able to tell, this essay also serves as a philosophical manifesto-by-example of how to think concretely about problems in biology. Along the way, I give some of my thoughts about the role of thermodynamics in molecular biology, legibility in complex systems, pedagogy, and the future of computational modeling.-->

<p>Let’s get started.</p>



<p>As a reminder, SARS-CoV-2 is a <em>positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus</em>.</p>



<p>What does this mean we can expect?</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Single-stranded</em>: Its genome is a single strand of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA">RNA</a> (ssRNA).</li>
  <li><em>Positive-sense</em>: That single strand of RNA can be immediately translated into protein by the ribosomes of the cell it infects.</li>
</ol>

<p>From this we can also infer that one of the proteins the virus encodes for must be <em>RNA-dependent RNA polymerase</em> (RdRP), a protein which synthesizes new RNA given an RNA template. That’s right: RNA → RNA. However, according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology">central dogma of molecular biology</a>, isn’t RNA → RNA an unconscionable heresy? Correspondingly, RdRP is not naturally found in cells! All known positive-sense ssRNA viruses therefore <em>must encode</em> RdRP in order to successfully commit this heresy.</p>



<p>…Wait a minute, the phrase “positive-sense ssRNA virus” implies the existence of <em>negative-sense</em> viruses. If those don’t encode their proteins directly, how can they possibly work?</p>

<h2 id="positive-sense-and-negative-sense">Positive sense and negative sense</h2>

<p>Negative-sense ssRNA viruses also exist! Influenza, Ebola, and measles are examples.</p>



<p>The inner contents of <em>negative-sense</em> ssRNA viruses consist not of an RNA genome but of a <em>ribonucleoprotein</em>, which incorporates both an RNA genome as well as a cohort of viral proteins capable of replicating RNA. Unlike positive-sense ssRNA viruses, negative-sense ssRNA viruses must travel with a working copy of their RNA-replicating proteins. This ribonucleoprotein has enzymatic activity!</p>

<h2 id="rdrp-as-drug-target">RdRP as drug target</h2>

<p>Since RdRP has (as far as I know) no legitimate purpose in human cells and is not naturally coded by them, might it offer a potential target for novel antiviral drugs?</p>

<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24102407/">Velkov et al. 2014</a> explores RdRP as a drug target for antivirals against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henipavirus">Hendra virus</a>, a negative-sense ssRNA virus, though I am unable to find the full text.</p>

<!-- <div class="unfurl-embed-info-media-default gallery-item-selectable"><img class="unfurl-embed-card-feature-image" src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/persistent/pubmed-meta-image.png"><div class="unfurl-embed-card-title unfurl-embed-card-title-default notranslate"><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24102407/">The RNA-dependent-RNA Polymerase, an Emerging Antiviral Drug Target for the Hendra Virus - PubMed</a></div><div class="unfurl-embed-card-description unfurl-embed-card-description-default notranslate"><div style="overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; -webkit-box-orient: vertical; display: -webkit-box; -webkit-line-clamp: 2;">Australia is facing a major national medical challenge with the emergence of the Hendra virus (HeV) as a medically and economically important pathogen of humans and animals.

<blockquote>
  <p>This review examines the current knowledge based on the multi-domain architecture of the Hendra RdRP and highlights which essential domain functions represent tangible targets for drug development against this deadly disease.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There must be some reason that developing antivirals against this protein is technically (or socially) complicated, or I’d have expected us to do it by now – there are a lot of RNA viruses that this drug target could theoretically hit. Flagging this discrepancy for further research.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup></p>



<p>Back to SARS-CoV-2! First, let’s get us a genome. Obviously this virus has seen some mutations as it’s spread around, as you can explore at <a href="https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global">NextStrain</a>, so we’ve technically got choices as to which one to analyze. For this thread I’ll just stick to analyzing <em>one</em> version of the genome: Wuhan-Hu-1.</p>

<p>As a reminder, each <code>A</code>, <code>G</code>, <code>C</code>, and <code>T</code> in a genome is one of the four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide">nucleotides</a>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenine">adenine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine">guanine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosine">cytosine</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymine">thymine</a>. There are actually <a href="https://www.scripps.edu/romesberg/publications.html">plenty of ways to engineer</a> different <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22850726/">unnatural base pair systems</a> by adding <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6429/884">artificial nucleotides</a>, and these can even be integrated into <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/98/9/4922">transcription</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24659">translation</a>, but <a href="https://carlbrannen.wordpress.com/2007/06/13/why-does-dna-only-use-4-nucleotides/">for</a> <a href="https://dreamerbiologist.wordpress.com/2013/02/16/why-did-nature-settle-on-just-four-nucleotides/">whatever</a> <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/32/E6476">reason</a>, these four <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07389-2">and not others</a> are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3331698/">what life ultimately ended up with</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/nucleotides.png"></p>
<p><small>The four nucleotides in DNA.</small></p>

<p>The genome of Wuhan-Hu-1 is available from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.3">NCBI GenBank</a>. Since SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, each <code>T</code> in this string technically represents a <code>U</code>, for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uracil">uracil</a>, RNA’s information-equivalent of thymine. The genome sequence is therefore:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>1     AUUAAAGGUU UAUACCUUCC CAGGUAACAA ACCAACCAAC UUUCGAUCUC UUGUAGAUCU
61    GUUCUCUAAA CGAACUUUAA AAUCUGUGUG GCUGUCACUC GGCUGCAUGC UUAGUGCACU
121   CACGCAGUAU AAUUAAUAAC UAAUUACUGU CGUUGACAGG ACACGAGUAA CUCGUCUAUC

...

29761 ACAGUGAACA AUGCUAGGGA GAGCUGCCUA UAUGGAAGAG CCCUAAUGUG UAAAAUUAAU
29821 UUUAGUAGUG CUAUCCCCAU GUGAUUUUAA UAGCUUCUUA GGAGAAUGAC AAAAAAAAAA
29881 AAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAA AAA
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a target="blank" href="https://benchling.com/s/seq-28k9llmwnY475iv7ogwF/edit">Follow along with the genome »</a></p>

<p>That’s 29,903 nucleotides. Since there are only four possible nucleotides, we can estimate the information compression value of each nucleotide at approximately 2 bits; the virus’s genome therefore requires only 7.5 kilobytes to store. That’s roughly as much data, byte for byte, as there are characters in this essay up to this point!</p>

<p>Lay out those 29,903 nucleobases along a ribose-phosphate backbone, reading them left to right <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directionality_(molecular_biology)">from the 5’ end to the 3’ end</a>, and bam – if that single molecule* were teleported into a cell, that’s 100% chemically sufficient** to infect a person with the plague du jour.</p>

<p>*plus the 5’ cap, discussed below</p>

<p><small>How to interpret the Wuhan-Hu-1 genome as a complete molecule.</small></p>

<h2 id="poly-a-tail">Poly-A tail</h2>

<p>First question, and perhaps the most obvious one to the naked eye – what’s with all the <code>AAAAA</code> at the end of the viral genome?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>29821 ...                                                ... AAAAAAAAAA
29881 AAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAA AAA
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><a target="blank" href="https://benchling.com/s/seq-28k9llmwnY475iv7ogwF/edit">Follow along with the genome »</a></p>

<p>It’s… yelling at us? Is it… suffering? Should we <a href="https://reducing-suffering.org/is-there-suffering-in-fundamental-physics/">help</a>?</p>

<p>Simple: It’s a <a href="https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/questions/11227/why-does-the-sars-cov2-coronavirus-genome-end-in-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa">3’ poly-A tail</a>! This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyadenylation">long tail of adenosine monomers</a> is extremely common in both our own cells and in RNA viruses.</p>

<p>Our own messenger RNA (mRNA) has a poly-A tail when it’s freshly produced in the nucleus so as to slow its degradation by the cell, allowing it to last long enough to be transcribed into protein. Naturally, if you’re a positive-strand RNA virus, you’re also going to want to last long enough to be transcribed into protein – so, you need the same feature, yourself.</p>

<p>Genome 0.11% explained. So far so good!</p>

<h2 id="5-cap">5’ cap</h2>

<p>While we’re discussing chemical features of mRNA, note that the viral genome presumably must also have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-prime_cap">5’ cap</a> – an extra <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7-Methylguanosine">7-methylguanosine</a> at the 5’ end of its RNA strand – just like mRNAs do.</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/5primecap.png"></p>
<p><small>A 5' cap, consisting of a 7-methylguanosine as well as methylation of the first two ribose sugars.</small></p>

<p>The cap is not directly shown in the viral genome sequence or mentioned in NCBI GenBank, but it is referenced in multiple papers discussing coronaviral genomes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since 2003, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus has drawn increased attention and stimulated numerous studies on the molecular virology of coronaviruses. Here, we review the current understanding of the mechanisms adopted by coronaviruses to produce the 5′-cap structure and methylation modification of viral genomic RNAs.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p>Coronaviruses possess a cap structure at the 5′ ends of viral genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs, which is generated through consecutive methylations by virally encoded guanine-N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) and 2′-O-methyltransferase (2′-O-MTase). The coronaviral N7-MTase is unique for its physical linkage with an exoribonuclease (ExoN) harbored in nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) of coronaviruses.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p>Here, we have reconstituted complete SARS-CoV mRNA cap methylation <em>in vitro</em>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Like the poly-A tail, the 5’ cap helps the genome to be recognized and translated by ribosomes rather than destroyed by the cell’s immune response.</p>

<p>How does the virus even ensure that it receives a 5’ cap and a poly-A tail, not to mention its outer coat? Hopefully these questions will be resolved by our review of its genes and proteins… let’s move on to look at those!</p>



<p>Per the “Features” section of the genome, again from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.3">NCBI GenBank</a>, here are the identifiable genes in this genome, in order:</p>

      <p><a href="https://crdt.tech/">CRDTs</a> are often praised as the "holy grail" for building collaborative applications because they don't require a central authority to resolve sync conflicts. They open up new possibilities to scale the backend infrastructure and are also well-suited as a data-model for distributed apps that don't require a server at all.</p><p>However, several text editor developers report not to use them because they impose a too significant overhead.</p><p>Just recently, Marijn Haverbeke wrote about his considerations against using CRDTs as a data model for <a href="https://codemirror.net/6/">CodeMirror 6</a>:</p><blockquote>[..] the cost of such a representation is significant, and in the end, I judged the requirement for converging positions to be too obscure to justify that level of extra complexity and memory use. <a href="https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/blog/collaborative-editing-cm.html">(source)</a></blockquote><p>The <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor">Xi Editor</a> used a CRDT as its data model to allow different processes (syntax highlighter, type checker, ..) to concurrently access the editor state without blocking the process. They reverted to a synchronous model because ..</p><blockquote>[..] CRDT is not pulling its (considerable) weight. <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor/issues/1187#issuecomment-491473599">(source)</a></blockquote><p>Apparently, everyone recognizes that CRDTs have a lot of potential, but concluded that the memory overhead of using them must be too expensive for real-world applications.</p><p>They bring up a fair point. Most CRDTs assign a unique ID to <em>every character</em> that was ever created in the document. In order to ensure that documents can always converge, the CRDT model preserves this metadata even when characters are deleted.</p><p>This seems to be particularly expensive in dynamic languages like JavaScript. Other languages allow you to efficiently represent all those characters and IDs in-memory using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language)">structs</a> (e.g. C or Rust). In JavaScript, everything is represented as an <code>Object</code> - basically a key-value map that needs to keep track of all its keys and values. CRDTs assign multiple properties to every single character in the document to ensure conflict resolution. The memory overhead of merely representing a document as a CRDT could be immense.</p><p>Every user-interaction creates more metadata that the CRDT needs to retain in order to ensure conflict resolution. It is not uncommon that CRDTs create millions of objects to store all this metadata. The JavaScript engine manages these objects on the heap, checks if they are referenced, and, if possible, garbage collects them. Another major problem is that with an increasing number of object creations, the cost of creating additional objects increases exponentially.

Most shared editing solutions are tied to a specific editor and to a specific backend. With Yjs, you can make any of the supported editors collaborative and exchange document updates through your custom communication channel, over a peer-to-peer WebRTC network, or over a scalable server infrastructure. My vision for this project is that you can simply compose your collaborative application using the technologies that make sense for your project. </p><figure><a href="https://github.com/yjs/yjs"><div><p>yjs/yjs</p><p>Peer-to-peer shared types.

The concepts discussed here are pretty generic and could be extended to almost any CRDT.</p><p>In order to determine the performance cost, we are are going to examine how Yjs maintains data. Please bear with me while I describe how the CRDT model is represented using JavaScript objects. This will be relevant later.</p><p>Similarly to other CRDTs, the YATA CRDT assigns a unique ID to every character. These characters are then maintained in a doubly linked list.</p><p>The unique IDs are<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamp"> Lamport Timestamps</a>. They consist of a unique user identifier and a logical clock that increases with each character insertion.</p><p>When a user types the content "ABC" from left to right, it will perform the following operations: <code>insert(0, "A") • insert(1, "B") • insert(2, "C")</code>. The linked list of the YATA CRDT, which models the textual content, will look like this:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.kevinjahns.de/content/images/2020/07/crdt-datamodel.svg" alt=""><figcaption>CRDT model of inserting content "ABC" (assuming the user has the unique client identifier "1")</figcaption></figure><p>Notice how every character can be uniquely identified by the combination of the unique client-id and an ever-increasing <code>clock</code> counter.</p><p>Yjs represents the items of the linked list as <code>Item</code> objects that contain some content (in this case a String), a unique ID, the links to the adjacent <code>Item</code> objects, and additional metadata that is relevant for the CRDT algorithm.</p><p>All CRDTs assign some kind of unique ID and additional metadata to every character, which is very memory-consuming for large documents. We can't get rid of metadata as it is necessary for conflict resolution. Yjs also uniquely identifies each character and assigns metadata, but represents this information efficiently. Larger document insertions are represented as a single <code>Item</code> object using the character-offset to uniquely identify each character individually. The below <code>Item</code> uniquely identifies character <code>"A"</code> as <code>{ client: 1, clock: 0 }</code>, character <code>"B"</code> as <code>{ client: 1, clock: 1 }</code>, and so on..</p><figure><pre><code>Item {
    id: { client: 1, clock: 0 },
    content: 'ABC',
    ...
}</code></pre><figcaption>Yjs's internal representation of items in the linked list</figcaption></figure><p>If a user copy/pastes a lot of content into the document, the inserted content is represented by a single <code>Item</code>. Furthermore, single-character insertions that are written from left to right can be merged into a single <code>Item</code>. It is just important that we are able to split and merge items without losing any metadata.</p><p>This type of compound representation of the CRDT model and its split-functionality have first been described in <a href="https://kundoc.com/pdf-a-string-wise-crdt-algorithm-for-smart-and-large-scale-collaborative-editing-sys.html">"A string-wise CRDT algorithm for smart and large-scale collaborative systems"</a>. Yjs adapts this approach for YATA and also includes functionality to merge <code>Item</code> objects.</p><h2 id="the-cost-of-operations">The Cost of Operations</h2><p>With this simple optimization in mind, let's have a look at how the number of modifications on a document relates to the amount of metadata that needs to be retained. We will measure metadata by the amount of <code>Item</code> objects created and later examine what the cost of a single <code>Item</code> is.</p><p>Every user interaction with a text editor can be expressed as either an <strong>insert</strong> or a <strong>delete</strong> operation.</p><ul><li><code>insert(index: number, content: string)</code><strong> </strong>Insertions of any size create a single <code>Item</code> that is integrated into the document. In some cases the integration requires to split an existing <code>Item</code>. So we have a maximum of two <code>Item</code> creations per insertion.</li><li><code>delete(index: number, length: number)</code> Deleting an <code>Item</code> only marks it as deleted. I.e <code>item.deleted = true</code>. Therefore, <code>Item</code> deletions are free and will reduce the amount of memory used because the <code>Item.content</code> can be removed. The <code>Item</code> doesn't need to retain the content for doing conflict resolution. But deleting a range of content might require to split two existing items. Therefore, the cost of deletions is a maximum of two <code>Item</code> creations also.</li></ul><p>By using the compound representation of CRDTs, the amount of metadata only relates to the amount of operations produced by a user. Not to the amount of characters inserted. This makes a huge difference in practice. Most larger documents are created by copy-pasting existing content or by moving paragraphs to other positions. Any kind of operation, even copy-paste and undo/redo, only create at most two <code>Item</code> objects.</p><p>Yjs also supports rich-text and structured documents. The above statement, that the amount of metadata only relates to the amount of operations, still holds true for these kinds of documents. But measuring operation-cost for more complex operations is out of scope of this article. An interesting observation in practice is that the document size of long-running …</p></div></article></main></div></div></div>

		<p><em><span>A</span></em><span><em><span>n Ecology of Mind</span></em></span><span> </span><span> is a film portrait of Gregory Bateson, celebrated anthropologist, philosopher, author, naturalist, systems theorist, and filmmaker, produced and directed by his daughter, Nora Bateson.</span></p>
		<p><span>T<span>he</span></span><span> film includes footage from Bateson’s own films shot in the 1930s in Bali (with Margaret Mead) and New Guinea, along with photographs, filmed lectures, and interviews.  His youngest child, Nora, depicts him as a man who studied the interrelationships of the complex systems in which we live with a depth motivated by scientific rigor and caring integrity.</span></p>
		<p><span>N<span>ora</span></span> Bateson’s rediscovery of his work documents the vast – and continuing – influence Bateson’s thinking has had on the work of an amazingly wide range of disciplines.  Through contemporary interviews, along with his own words, Bateson’s way of thinking reveals practical approaches to the enormous challenges confronting the human race and the natural world.</p>
		<p><span>G<span>regory</span></span> Bateson’s theories, such as “the double bind” and “the pattern which connects”, continue to impact the fields of anthropology, psychiatry, information science, cybernetics, urban planning, biology, and ecology, challenging people to think in new ways.   </p>
		<p><span>U</span><span>ntil now, his work has been largely inaccessible to most of us.  Through this film, Nora Bateson sets out to show that his ideas are not just fodder for academic theory, but can help instruct a way of life. She presents his thinking using a richly personal perspective, focusing on the stories Bateson used to present his ideas and how the beauty of life itself provided the framework of his life’s pursuits.</span></p>
		<p><span>T</span><span>his film hopes to inspire its audience to see our lives within a larger system - glistening with symmetry, play, and metaphor. An invitation to ask the kinds of questions that could help thread the world back together from the inside.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>I got into a discussion about monads recently. On a search to find some resources to share, I realized that most essays explained them with type signatures and rules. A missing ingredient to grok them, I think, is to understand the intuition behind them. How could you end up <em>inventing</em> monads?</p><p>Okay, let’s try to build that intuition. We’ll avoid both types and category theory.</p><p>Say you have a few functions to get a user, a profile, and a display picture:</p><pre><code>function getUser(id) { 
  return USERS[id] 
}

function getProfile(user) { 
  return user.profile
}

function getDisplayPicture(profile) { 
  return profile.displayPicture
}</code></pre><p>Now, given an id, how would you get the profile picture?</p><p>You could write this: </p><pre><code>getDisplayPicture(getProfile(getUser(id)))</code></pre><p>Buut, this would throw an error: all these functions <em>could</em> return null. If <code>getUser</code> returned null for example, you would see: </p><pre><code>Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'profile' of undefined</code></pre><p>To fix this, you may end up writing something like this:</p><pre><code>function getDisplayPictureFromId(id) { 
  const user = getUser(id)
  if (!user) return
  const profile = getProfile(user)
  if (!profile) return
  return getDisplayPicture(profile)
}</code></pre><p>But, this is getting pretty ugly. All these conditional returns distract from what you’re really trying to do. <strong>What if there was a way to get rid of these conditionals?</strong></p><p>So, that’s our challenge: let’s get rid of these conditionals. One way we can do this, is to make some kind of helper. This helper would let us chain these functions together: </p><pre><code>new Chainer(getUser(id))
  .whenExists(user =&gt; getProfile(user))
  .whenExists(profile =&gt; getDisplayPicture(profile))</code></pre><p>This looks pretty good. Let’s implement it.</p><h2>whenExists</h2><p><code>.whenExists</code> would only run the callback if the value exists. Here’s how you could write this:</p><pre><code>class Chainer {
  constructor(v) { 
      this.value = v
  }
  whenExists(f) { 
      if (!this.value) return this;
      return new Chainer(f(this.value))
  }
}</code></pre><p>And voila, with just this, we can now write</p><pre><code>function getProfilePictureFromId(id) { 
  return new Chainer(getUser(id))
    .whenExists(user =&gt; getProfile(user))
    .whenExists(profile =&gt; getDisplayPicture(profile))
}</code></pre><h2>More Problems</h2><p>Notice that <code>getDisplayPictureFromId</code> now returns a <code>Chainer</code>. </p><p>Imagine we had another function <code>resizeDisplayPicture</code>, that <em>also</em> returned a Chainer</p><pre><code>function resizeDisplayPicture(pic) { 
    return new Chainer(pic).whenExists(pic =&gt; ...
}</code></pre><p>What would happen, if we wrote:</p><pre><code>getProfilePictureFromId(id).whenExists(pic =&gt; resizeDisplayPicture(pic))</code></pre><p>Let’s look at whenExists again:</p><pre><code>whenExists(f) { 
  if (!this.value) return this;
  return new Chainer(f(this.value))
}</code></pre><p>If <code>getProfilePictureFromId(id)</code> did exist, we would run </p><pre><code>new Chainer(f(this.value))</code></pre><p>which in this case is</p><pre><code>new Chainer(resizeDisplayPicture(this.value)) </code></pre><p>Which becomes </p><pre><code>new Chainer(new Chainer(this.value)...</code></pre><p><strong>Uh oh. We now have a Chainer inside of a Chainer.</strong> Ideally, we’d want a function that somehow “merged” these chainers together.</p><h2>whenExistsMerge</h2><p>So let’s do that. We can call it <code>whenExistsMerge</code></p><pre><code>class Chainer {
  constructor(v) { 
      this.value = v
  }
  whenExists(f) { 
      if (!this.value) return this;
      return new Chainer(f(this.value))
  }
  whenExistsMerge(f) { 
      if (!this.value) return this;
      return f(this.value)
  }
}</code></pre><p>And with that, we can write </p><pre><code>getProfilePictureFromId(id)
  .whenExistsMerge(pic =&gt; resizeDisplayPicture(pic))
  .whenExists(resizedPic =&gt; ...)</code></pre><p><strong>Aand voila, you’ve just invented a specific type of monad.</strong> Kind of (1). Chainer is analogous to the <code>Maybe</code> monad. <code>whenExists</code> is analogous to its <code>fmap</code> operation, and <code>whenExistsMerge</code> is analogous to its <code>bind</code> operation. If you’re curious about the type-based technicalities now, <a href="http://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html" target="_blank">see this essay</a>. </p><p>So, now we’ve found this cool <code>Chainer</code>. We can stop here, or think a bit further. What’s so special about it? </p><p>Well, it’s like a box that wraps around some information. We can interact with that box with  <code>whenExists</code> and <code>whenExistsMerge</code>.</p><p>How else can we use the idea of <code>box</code> and <code>whenExists?</code></p><p>Here’s one. Let’s say you were dealing with callback hell: </p><pre><code>fetchUser(id, (err, user) =&gt; {
  if (err) ... 
    fetchProfile(profile, (err, profile) =&gt; { 
      if (err) ...
        fetchDisplayPicture(...
    }
}</code></pre><p>What if we created something like an <code>Async Chainer</code>: it stores the result of some future computation. Then, you could use the <code>whenExists*</code> functions, which let you interact with the value <em>when</em> it is computed. We turn the callback hell into</p><pre><code> fetchUser(id).whenExistsMerge(fetchProfile).whenExistsMerge(fetchDisplayPicture)</code></pre><p>Well, replace <code>whenExistsMerge</code> with <code>then</code>, and you're on a road to discover <code>Promise</code>, which is also a monad. Kind of (2). </p><p>Now, it’s pretty cool to notice that both the nullable use case and the async use case have the same interface. The name <code>whenExists</code> may be a bit too specific. Really, what it does is give you an interface to <code>map</code> over the value. If you use the word <code>map</code>, <code>whenExistsMerge</code> really lets you <code>flatMap</code> over the value. </p><p>This begins to get us to the fundamental abstraction of a monad: a box, with an interface for <code>map</code>, and <code>flatMap</code>. As you look deeper, you’ll notice that this abstraction can handle a lot of other things. If you’re curious, research the <code>Result</code> monad for example.</p><p>And with that, you’ve invented monads : ) </p><h2>Aside: Do you <em>really</em> need this?</h2><p>As you went through this, you may have realized that there are other ways to solve the problems that monads solve. Instead of <code>Chainer</code>, your language could have a <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html#safe-calls" target="_blank">safe call</a> abstraction. Instead of <code>Promise</code>, your language could have an <code>async/await</code> abstraction. Sometimes those can be a better <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5WdGrpoug" target="_blank">better choice</a>. Nevertheless, if your language doesn’t have those abstractions, you can use monads to solve them. And of course, like any powerful abstraction, you can invent new monads to simplify your business logic.</p><hr><p>(1) I cheated a bit with <code>Chainer</code>, by avoiding the subtypes <code>Just</code> and <code>Nothing</code>. This makes it so you can’t express something like <code>Just(null)</code>. Still, it gets at the essence : ) </p><p>(2) Likewise, <code>Promise</code> isn’t quite a monad, because it mixes both <code>flatMap</code> and <code>map</code> with <code>then</code>. This makes it so you can’t have a <code>Promise&lt;Promise&lt;Res&gt;&gt;</code>. Again though, it gets at the essence</p><p><em>Thanks to Joe Averbukh, Mark Shlick, Daniel Woelfel, Irakli Safareli, Jacky Wang for reviewing drafts of this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

This leads to a culture of competition which helps us thrive economically but can create divisions socially. <br></p><blockquote><h3>In the US individuality trumps collectivism or the group. </h3></blockquote><p>Living under the Austrians, Poles, Nazis and Soviet’s and going through forced starvation during Stalin’s Ukrainian Genocide of the 1930s when it was illegal to own bread, you needed the group to just live until the next day. <br></p><p>This group mindset is <em>strong</em>. Many Americans got into trouble with their Ukrainian friends because of our flimsy notions of friendship. <br></p><blockquote><h3>In Ukraine the group is bigger than the individual</h3></blockquote><p>In Ukraine you either would sacrifice your life for your friend and do anything they needed day or night or you were totally ignored. There was no wishy-washyness. <br></p><p>In America we say that we’re friends with everyone when we really just mean “acquaintance”.  Since this concept didn’t exist to Ukrainians they were always puzzled by how many so-called friends these Americans claimed to have! <br></p><p>In the Ukrainian classroom those students all saw each other as true bonded friends they’d do anything for - at least in school. So to them, letting their friend copy notes, or give answers to a test wasn’t just not a big deal, it was morally correct to do so. </p><p>Cultures oscillate between favoring the individual or favoring the group. In America we worship the individual to the point where the group often suffers. In Ukraine they worship the group to the point where the individual may suffer. <br></p><p>Where do you place your emphasis: the individual or the group? <br></p><p>Bren<br></p></div></div></div>]]>

<section id="mc_embed_signup">

</section>
<p>When I graduated from college, my dream was to lead a team at a startup. Over the past decade, I’ve had the opportunity to serve in a <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/work/">variety of engineering and management roles</a> with funded tech startups and, most recently I joined The Graide Network as their <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/joining-the-graide-network">Chief Technology Officer</a>.</p>
<p>The Graide Network was my dream job. I got to pick the tech stack, hire the team, make important decisions, and speak and write about all of it. It was challenging, exciting, and it felt like something I’d want to do forever.</p>
<p>In 2020, when Covid-19 struck, the business hit a wall. Our customers (K-12 schools) tightened their budgets, and like many early-stage startups, we had to let a few team members go. I had been managing the engineering team for four years, and now and after Covid, the team had contracted to just one other developer and me.</p>
<p>As I reflected on my career, I realized that it was time for a change. I had grown very comfortable as an early-stage startup CTO, and I was afraid that by continuing with The Graide Network (or finding a similar startup job), I would remain safely in my comfort zone forever.</p>
<h2 id="the-comfort-zone-the-most-dangerous-place-to-be">The Comfort Zone: The Most Dangerous Place to Be</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you opt for a safe life, you will never know what it’s like to win.”
<strong>- Richard Branson</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mECllQz.jpg" alt="Get out of your comfort zone"></p>
<p>Every leap forward I’ve made in my career has been followed by a visceral, gut-wrenching increase in anxiety.</p>
<p>I distinctly remember being brought into a meeting with the founders when I was at Packback and being told that our Head of Engineering was leaving and that I’d be taking over. I didn’t sleep that night. I couldn’t stop thinking, worrying, and asking myself what the hell I was going to do.</p>
<p>The same feeling carried me through <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/one-year-conference-summary">my first conference talk</a>. I had spoken in front of small audiences in meetings and informal settings, but being on stage with lights and a microphone, and a timer was sickening. I basically blacked out and, at some point, walked off stage while people clapped politely.</p>
<p>But, after leading small engineering teams for over five years at early stage startups, the job had become mundane. I had a process for everything, I knew what the most likely technical and business challenges were going to be, and I was getting great reviews from my teammates. I’m not saying I was the world’s best engineer or manager, but I had reached a level of adequacy that allowed me to be very comfortable.</p>
<p>While living in my comfort zone, I wasn’t having sleepless periods of frantic anxiety, but I also wasn’t growing.</p>
<h2 id="the-hedgehog-concept">The Hedgehog Concept</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The Hedgehog Concept comes from the Greek fable about the fox and the hedgehog: while the wily fox knows many things, the simple hedgehog only knows one thing, but that one knowledge bite is highly impactful in protecting itself against danger.
<strong>- Jim Collins</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Knowing that I needed to be chasing growth, I began contemplating a more significant career pivot, and <a href="https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-hedgehog-concept.html">Jim Collins’ Hedgehog Concept</a> kept coming to mind. The Hedgehog Concept says that to build something <em>great</em>, you have to focus on the intersection of these three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>What are you deeply passionate about?</li>
<li>What can you be the best in the world at?</li>
<li>What drives your economic engine?</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_D7CA14F8F5FDBCC0CAA5D1A347773A815DA981E958DB2DB5DE1BEBB0452535C7_1597613694050_hedgehog.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Collins was talking about building companies, but it’s true for careers as well. My job as an engineering leader had allowed me to earn good money, but I wasn’t going to be the best in the world at it, and I wouldn’t call engineering my life’s passion. When I think about what people might say at my funeral, it’s not, “Oh, Karl, he was a great engineer.”</p>
<p>As I started exploring my options, talking to friends and mentors, and weighing various business ideas, I kept wondering what I really wanted to be the “best in the world at?”</p>
<h2 id="the-best-at-one-thing-or-pretty-good-at-two-things">The Best at One Thing or Pretty Good at Two Things?</h2>
<p>Several years ago, I read <a href="https://amzn.to/2BEjOWx"><em>How To Fail at Almost Everything And Still Win Big</em></a>, by Dilbert creator Scott Adams. While I don’t agree with much of Adams’ politics, the book is full of sage advice for anyone who thinks differently from the mainstream.</p>
<p>One of my biggest takeaways was Adams’ idea about combining skills:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want something extraordinary, you have two paths:</p>
<ol>
<li>Become the best at one specific thing.</li>
<li>Become very good (top 25%) at two or more things.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first strategy is difficult to the point of near impossibility…I don’t recommend anyone even try. The second strategy is fairly easy. Everyone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top 25% with some effort.
<strong>-</strong> <a href="https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/career-advice.html"><strong>Scott Adams</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adams goes on to talk about how he was never going to be the best cartoonist, but he was pretty good at it and had a business background that was unique in the field. He realized that he didn’t want to compete with the best cartoonists, but instead to compete with the <em>very few</em> people who were good cartoonists with a prior career in business.</p>
<p>This simple yet brilliant idea makes becoming successful an order of magnitude easier.</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_D7CA14F8F5FDBCC0CAA5D1A347773A815DA981E958DB2DB5DE1BEBB0452535C7_1597613794724_0_RSROzF7UkOg8sdvO.png" alt="Skill stacking visualized on Forge"></p>
<h2 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting It All Together</h2>
<p>As I thought about my skills, passions, and the things that people would pay me for, I started to think about <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/writing/">writing</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve always loved writing. It’s therapeutic and allows me to help, teach, and encourage others. My final internship in college was as a technical writer, and a few companies had approached me about writing for their blogs. I figured that if I could find a few clients to pay me to write, I’d make a go of it.</p>
<h2 id="the-first-two-months">The First Two Months</h2>
<p>In May 2020, I <a href="https://github.com/malgamves/CommunityWriterPrograms">found a list of freelance technical writing opportunities</a>, and <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/start-freelance-blogging">I started applying</a>. By June, I had written for six different clients, and I was starting to trade out some of my lower-paying clients for higher-paying ones. I wasn’t making as much as I would as a developer, but I started to see a path forward.</p>
<p>I talked to my CEO at The Graide Network to let her know that <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/i-gave-my-notice-im-going-full-time-b37d46266b">I’d be transitioning out</a> by the end of the summer. I offered to ramp down slowly and stay on as a part-time advisor if she thought it would help. This eased the transition and allowed me to start thinking about how I could make a real living as a writer.</p>
<h2 id="the-fish-start-biting">The Fish Start Biting</h2>
<p>After writing a few articles and continuing to comb through my network, I had more work than I could handle.</p>
<p>I found out that companies have a really hard time finding experienced software engineers who are also good writers and started to wonder if the market might be bigger than I first thought. I was doing almost zero outbound sales and still being approached by 2-3 new clients per week. Several of my early clients had mentioned job opportunities, and people referred business to me from all over.</p>
<p>So, I did the logical thing and kept raising my rates.</p>
<p>While this priced out some of my early clients, they understood that I needed to make a living.</p>
<h2 id="so-this-is-product-market-fit">So this is Product-Market Fit?</h2>
<p>As I continued to field interest, I kept thinking about Justin Jackson’s essay, <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/jump"><em>What Does Product-Market Fit Feel Like?</em></a> In it, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Without you having to try too hard, customers should be showing up to buy your product…Many of the problems entrepreneurs face are related to <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/niche"><strong>targeting a niche</strong></a> where there aren’t a lot of fish, or the fish aren’t biting.
<strong>- Justin Jackson</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had worked with several startups where sales were <em>by far</em> the biggest challenge. Reflecting on those experiences, I realized that <strong>my past startups were trying to convince people to pay for something completely new.</strong> While this path makes sense for funded startups, I expected to spend months finding my first few clients, and instead, I had stumbled into a pond filled with hungry fish. It was exciting and a little bit scary.</p>
<p>I started to think about what it would take to scale this business up.</p>
<h2 id="productize-and-scale">Productize and Scale</h2>
<p>I’ve been listening to <a href="http://bootstrappedweb.com/">Brian Casel’s Bootstrapped Web podcast</a> for the past year. Brian runs a business called <a href="https://audienceops.com/">AudienceOps</a>, a “productized” content writing service where he’s been able to serve more clients and grow a profitable lifestyle business that runs mostly without him.</p>
<p>While I enjoy writing, I was nervous about freelancing full-time forever. What happens if I want to take a month off? If I have to keep increasing my rates, will I only be able to work with huge, boring clients? Will I get sick of writing variations on the same few technical topics for years?</p>
<p>One of my long-term career goals has always been to start a business. Freelancers may be self-employed, but they’re really just working several small jobs, so I knew I wanted to do something bigger than that.</p>
<p>In July, I stopped taking clients who wanted to hire me specifically and started redirecting them to my fledgling agency, <a href="https://draft.dev/">Draft</a>. While I imagine I’ll continue doing much of the writing this year, hiring other writers allows me to continue focusing on hard (to me) problems like sales, marketing, and building processes.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-corner-store">The New “Corner Store”</h2>
<p>Compared with the ambitious, venture-funded startups I worked for in the past, Draft is so…simple. There are customers with a need, and I have a skill that helps them meet that need. If I’m smart, I’ll be able to operationalize it and get out of the day-to-day within a few years. To me, that sounds like a fascinating problem to solve, even if it’s not something worthy of outside investment.</p>
<p>I see online lifestyle businesses like mine as the “corner store” of our generation. Our grandparents could lease a storefront, and (with a little luck and hard work) ride the wave of growing prosperity in their neighborhood to make a living. I’m not going to build the next Facebook, but there’s enough growth in the technology sector to make a living in lots of little niches you might not have expected.</p>
<p>So that’s why I left my career as a startup CTO to become a writer. <a href="https://twitter.com/karllhughes">Find me on Twitter</a> or <a href="https://mailchi.mp/a183cf10b418/startups">sign up for my newsletter</a> if you want to follow along.</p>

      <div>
        <p>In this post we'll write a Python to C compiler in Python. This is
especially easy to do since Python has a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html">builtin parser
library</a> and because a
number of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/">CPython internals are exposed for extension
writers</a>.</p>
<p>By the end of this post, in a few hundred lines of Python, we'll be able to
compile and run the following program:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat tests/recursive_fib.py
def fib(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return n

    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)


def main():
    print(fib(40))
$ python3 pyc tests/recursive_fib.py
$ ./bin/a.out
102334155
</code></pre>
<p>This post implements an extremely small subset of Python and
<strong>completely gives up on even trying to manage memory</strong> because I
cannot fathom manual reference counting. Maybe some day I'll find a
way to swap in an easy GC like Boehm.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/eatonphil/pyc">Source code for this project is available on Github.</a></p>
<h3 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h3><p>We'll need Python3, GCC, libpython3, and clang-format.</p>
<p>On Fedora-based systems:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo dnf install gcc python3-devel clang-format python3
</code></pre>
<p>And on Debian-based systems:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt install gcc python3-dev clang-format python3
</code></pre>
<p>
  This program will likely work as well on Windows, Mac, FreeBSD,
  etc. but I haven't gone through the trouble of testing this (or
  providing custom compiler directives). Pull requests welcome!
</p><h3 id="a-hand-written-first-pass">A hand-written first-pass</h3><p>Before we get into the compiler, let's write the fibonacci program by
hand in C using libpython.</p>
<p>As described in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/extending/embedding.html#very-high-level-embedding">Python embedding
guide</a>
we'll need to include libpython and initialize it in
our <code>main.c</code>:</p>
<pre><code>#define PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN
#include &lt;Python.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  Py_Initialize();

  return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>To compile against libpython, we'll use
<a href="https://helpmanual.io/man1/python3-config/">python3-config</a> installed
as part of <code>python3-devel</code> to tell us what should be linked
at each step during compilation.</p>
<pre><code>$ gcc -c -o main.o $(python3-config --cflags) main.c
$ gcc $(python3-config --ldflags) main.o
$ ./a.out; echo $?
0
</code></pre>
<p>Cool! Now as we think about translating the fibonacci implementation,
we want to keep everything as Python objects for as long as
possible. This means passing and receiving
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/object.html">PyObject*</a> to and from
all functions, and converting all C integers to
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/long.html">PyLong</a>, a "subtype" of
<code>PyObject*</code>. You can imagine that everything in Python is
an <code>object</code> until you operate on it.</p>
<p>
  For more information on objects in Python, check out
  the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html">Data
  model</a> page in Python docs.
</p><p>To map a C integer to a <code>PyLong*</code> we use
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/long.html#c.PyLong_FromLong">PyLong_FromLong</a>. To
map in reverse, we use
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/long.html#c.PyLong_AsLong">PyLong_AsLong</a>.</p>
<p>To compare two <code>PyObject*</code>s we can use
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/object.html#c.PyObject_RichCompareBool">PyObject_RichCompareBool</a>
which will handle the comparison regardless of the type of the two
parameters. Without this helper we'd have to write complex checks to
make sure that the two sides are the same and if they are, unwrap them
into their underlying C value and compare the C value.</p>
<p>We can use
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/number.html#c.PyNumber_Add">PyNumber_Add</a>
and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/number.html#c.PyNumber_Subtract">PyNumber_Subtract</a>
for basic arithmetic, and there are many similar helpers available to
us for operations down the line.</p>
<p>Now we can write a translation:</p>
<pre><code>#define PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN
#include &lt;Python.h&gt;

PyObject* fib(PyObject* n) {
  PyObject* zero = PyLong_FromLong(0);
  PyObject* one = PyLong_FromLong(1);
  if (PyObject_RichCompareBool(n, zero, Py_EQ) || PyObject_RichCompareBool(n, one, Py_EQ)) {
    return n;
  }

  PyObject* left = fib(PyNumber_Subtract(n, one));

  PyObject* two = PyLong_FromLong(2);
  PyObject* right = fib(PyNumber_Subtract(n, two));

  return PyNumber_Add(left, right);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  Py_Initialize();

  PyObject* res = fib(PyLong_FromLong(7)); // Should be 13

  return PyLong_AsLong(res);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Compile and run it:</p>
<pre><code>$ gcc -c -o main.o $(python3-config --cflags) main.c
$ gcc $(python3-config --ldflags) main.o
$ ./a.out; echo $?
13
</code></pre>
<p>That's great! But we cheated in one place. We assumed that the input
to the <code>fib</code> function was an integer, and we propagated
that assumption everywhere we wrote <code>PyNumber_*</code>
operations. When we write the compiler, we'll need to check that both
arguments are an integer before we call a numeric helper, otherwise we
may need to call a string concatenation helper or something else
entirely.</p>
<h3 id="compiler-architecture">Compiler Architecture</h3><p>We'll break the code into four major parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>libpyc.c</code>: helper functions for generated code</li>
<li><code>pyc/context.py</code>: utilities for scope and writing code in memory</li>
<li><code>pyc/codegen.py</code>: for generating C code from a Python AST</li>
<li><code>pyc/__main__.py</code>: the entrypoint</li>
</ol>
<p>
  When I'm writing a new compiler using an existing parser I almost
  always start with the entrypoint and code generator so I can explore
  the AST. However, it's easiest to explain the code if we start with
  the utilities first.
</p><p>We'll also want an empty <code>pyc/__init__.py</code>.</p>
<h3 id="libpyc.c">libpyc.c</h3><p>This C file will contain three helper functions for safely adding,
subtracting, and printing. It will be concatenated to the top of the
generated C file. We'll only support integers for now but this
structure sets us up for supporting more types later on.</p>
<p>We'll use
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/long.html#c.PyLong_Check">PyLong_Check</a>
before calling number-specific methods.</p>
<pre><code>#define PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN
#include &lt;Python.h&gt;

inline PyObject* PYC_Add(PyObject* l, PyObject* r) {
  // TODO: allow __add__ override

  // Includes ints and bools
  if (PyLong_Check(l) &amp;&amp; PyLong_Check(r)) {
    return PyNumber_Add(l, r);
  }

  // TODO: handle str, etc.

  // TODO: throw exception
  return NULL;
}

inline PyObject* PYC_Sub(PyObject* l, PyObject* r) {
  // TODO: allow __add__ override

  // Includes ints and bools
  if (PyLong_Check(l) &amp;&amp; PyLong_Check(r)) {
    return PyNumber_Subtract(l, r);
  }

  // TODO: handle str, etc.

  // TODO: throw exception
  return NULL;
}

inline PyObject* PYC_Print(PyObject* o) {
  PyObject_Print(o, stdout, Py_PRINT_RAW);
  printf("\n");
  return Py_None;
}
</code></pre>
<p>That's it! We could generate these as strings in Python but it gets
hairy to do so. By using a dedicated C file, we can take advantage of
syntax highlighting since this file is only C code. And since we've
marked all functions as <code>inline</code>, there's no runtime cost
to using not embedding these as strings in Python.</p>
<h3 id="pyc/context.py">pyc/context.py</h3><p>This file will contain a <code>Context</code> class for managing
identifiers in scope and for proxying to a <code>Writer</code> class
that contains helpers for writing lines of C code.</p>
<p>We'll have two instances of the <code>Writer</code> class in
<code>Context</code> so that we can write to a body (or
current/primary) region and an initialization region.</p>
<p>The initialization region is necessary in case there are any variables
declared at the top-level. We can't initialize these variables in C
outside of a function since every <code>PyObject*</code> must be
created after calling <code>Py_Initialize</code>. This section will be
written into our C <code>main</code> function before we enter a
compiled Python <code>main</code> function.</p>
<pre><code>import copy


class Writer():
    content = ""

    def write(self, exp: str, indent: int = 0):
        self.content += ("  " * indent) + exp

    def writeln(self, stmt: str, indent: int = 0):

</code></pre>
<p>This is all pretty boring boilerplate. Let's move on.</p>
<h3 id="pyc/<strong>main</strong>.py">pyc/<strong>main</strong>.py</h3><p>The entrypoint is responsible for reading source code, parsing it,
calling the code generator, writing the source code to a C file, and
compiling it.</p>
<p>First, we read and parse the source code:</p>
<pre><code>import ast
import os
import subprocess
import shutil
import sys

from context import Context
from codegen import generate

BUILTINS = {
    "print": "PYC_Print",
}


def main():
    target = sys.argv[1]
    with open(target) as f:
        source = f.read()
    tree = ast.parse(source, target)
</code></pre>
<p>Then we write <code>libpyc.c</code> into the body, register builtins,
and run code generation:</p>
<pre><code>
...

def main()
    ...

    ctx = Context()
    with open("libpyc.c") as f:
        ctx.body_write(f.read() + "\n")

    for builtin, fn in BUILTINS.items():
        ctx.register_global(builtin, fn)

    generate(ctx, tree)
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we create a clean output directory and write
<code>main.c</code> with the generated code and a <code>main</code>
function to initialization Python and any global variables:</p>
<pre><code>...

def main():
   ...

    # Create and move to working directory
    outdir = "bin"
    shutil.rmtree(outdir, ignore_errors=True)
    os.mkdir(outdir)
    os.chdir(outdir)

    with open("main.c", "w") as f:
        f.write(ctx.body.content)

        main = ctx.namings.get("main")["name"]
        f.write(f"""int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {{
  Py_Initialize();

  // Initialize globals, if any.
{ctx.initializations.content}
  PyObject* r = {main}();
  return PyLong_AsLong(r);
}}""")
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we run <code>clang-format</code> and <code>gcc</code> against
the generated C code:</p>
<pre><code>...

def main():
    ...

    subprocess.run(["clang-format", "-i", "main.c"])

    cflags_raw = …</code></pre></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <article>
          

<p>Google <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200809222648/https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/mission/">writes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our mission is to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is pretty hard, but Google has been at it a while. Let’s see how well Google is doing by asking it for some basic factual information, like the slowest animal.</p>

<p>Google says it’s the three-toed sloth:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.tedsanders.com/images/the-slowest-animal-google.png" alt="Google search for slowest animal"></p>

<p>To see just how wrong this is, take a look at this video of a sloth climbing a tree:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zNnWhQPQRFQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Can you imagine a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallest_organisms#Animals">1 millimeter snail</a> moving this quickly? A sponge? A coral? A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade">tardigrade</a>? A 100-micron long mite?</p>

<p>It takes almost no research at all to see that the sloth wouldn’t even be invited to the slowest animal Olympics, let alone win the gold medal.</p>

<p>Google has plenty of company though.</p>

<p>Siri guesses that it’s the <em>two-toed</em> sloth:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.tedsanders.com/images/the-slowest-animal-siri.png" alt="Siri search for slowest animal"></p>

<p>Bing returns images of sloths, but text saying it’s the seahorse:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.tedsanders.com/images/the-slowest-animal-bing.png" alt="Bing search for slowest animal"></p>

<p>Cortana returns text saying three-toed sloth while its first image is a Gila monster:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.tedsanders.com/images/the-slowest-animal-cortana.png" alt="Cortana search for slowest animal"></p>

<p>Although DuckDuckGo doesn’t elevate an editorial snippet, it returns 8 images of sloths and 1 image of a loris:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.tedsanders.com/images/the-slowest-animal-duckduckgo.png" alt="DuckDuckGo search for slowest animal"></p>

<p>YouTube’s top hit for animals used to say seahorse, but today says the three-toed sloth:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.tedsanders.com/images/the-slowest-animal-youtube.png" alt="YouTube search for slowest animal"></p>

<p>WolframAlpha gets it the closest yet, returning the brown garden snail and explicitly states that it reinterpreted my query as the slowest <em>land</em> animal:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.tedsanders.com/images/the-slowest-animal-wolfram-alpha.png" alt="Wolfram Alpha search for slowest animal"></p>

<p>Wikipedia returns an article with slowest animal by phylum and class, including coral with a speed of 0 m/s:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.tedsanders.com/images/the-slowest-animal-wikipedia.png" alt="Wikipedia search for slowest animal"></p>

<p>I find it quite interesting that of the 8 websites I asked, the only website that got the answer partially correct was the also the only website that’s a non-profit.</p>

<p><strong>2020 update:</strong> Despite being higher quality than all results returned by search engines, the Wikipedia article was deleted for being too low quality. Alas.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.tedsanders.com/images/the-slowest-animal-wikipedia-deletion.png" alt="Wikipedia deletion notice"></p>

<!--
If you [ask Google for a shirt without stripes](https://github.com/elsamuko/Shirt-without-Stripes), it shows you shirts *with* stripes:

To be fair, 'without' is a pretty tricky word. Amazon and Microsoft fail at this too. -->

<h4>Just another twelve-hundred</h4>
<p>Ok, another day another job 🙂</p>
<p>This time it is Amiga 1200 which is a super cool retro computer sought by a lot of folks nowadays.</p>
<p>Obviously, I’ve bought this unit in a non-working state. It was a bit dirty, with some scratches on the case but as it later turned out, required a bit more work inside 🙂</p>

<h4>Decrunching …</h4>
<p>Disassembly followed quickly. </p>
<p>It slowly started to become obvious that this poor Amiga was heavily corroded.</p>

<p>Looks like someone tried to fix it before me 🙂</p>

<h4>Fixing electronics</h4>
<p>In order to progress with this repair, I had to remove all ports, RF modulator, and replace electrolytic capacitors.</p>

<p>Some SMD pads on a PCB didn’t make it because of the corrosion 🙁</p>
<p>I’ve managed to fix that pad with a drop of resin. Once the resin cured, I could gently connect this pad to a trace with a bit of solder.</p>

<p>Finally, I could clean the whole board of dust, flux residue, and other gunk. Below, some pictures after cleaning.</p>

<p>Next, I’ve cleaned all ports with a steel brush on a rotary tool.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/p4aA6Xz.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/p4aA6Xz.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>

<p>I already knew that I will be replacing the RF modulator with the <a href="https://retrohax.net/shop/amiga/amiga-600-and-1200-s-video-adapter/">S-Video module</a>. It outputs way better video than Color Composite and is often a cool alternative if you have a monitor or TV with an S-Video input.</p>
<p>To install it, I usually use two M3 screws. Connecting it fairly straightforward as it takes 5V and GND from RF modulator vias. It also needs LUMA and CHROMA signals from CXA1145.</p>

<p>Fully recapped motherboard S-video mod and ports in place 🙂</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/i.imgur.com/vNnA0Yu.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/i.imgur.com/vNnA0Yu.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<h4>Keyboard</h4>
<p>Few of the keycaps had broken studs. I’ve gently removed studs that were stuck in plungers and bound them to corresponding keys by inserting a steel wire and used cyano-acrylic glue to hold them in place. </p>

<p>The keyboard membrane was damaged and a lot of pads worn out so I’ve decided to replace it with <a href="https://retrohax.net/shop/amiga/amiga-1200-keyboard-membrane/">a brand new keyboard membrane.</a></p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/i.imgur.com/1hb28c6.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/i.imgur.com/1hb28c6.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<h4>Metal shielding</h4>
<p>I had to get rid of all rust that covered the metal shielding. <a href="https://retrohax.net/extreme-refurbishing-episode-4-vampiric-amiga-500/">I’ve used an electrolytic method that I’ve described already in one of my previous posts.</a> Below a video with rust being removed from A500 shielding.</p>
<figure><p><span><iframe width="900" height="507" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L2h-X8FOv0M?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>
<p>It worked like a charm so I’ve spray-painted.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/i.imgur.com/Lk55DNv.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/i.imgur.com/Lk55DNv.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>

<h4>Case</h4>
<p>Finally, I had to clean all of the rust from a plastic case. To do it, I’ve covered all stains with Phosphoric Acid which nicely binds to Iron Oxide.</p>

<h4>Gotek and putting it all together</h4>
<p>Finally, I was ready to assemble it. I’ve replaced the original 3.5″ floppy drive with a GOTEK interface that was installed on a <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2788991">3D printed </a>bracket.</p>

<p>Regular readers have probably noticed my extremely low posting frequency lately. I would usually explain this with some excuse about being busy, but this time, I actually have a good reason behind it. I’ve been spending the past couple of months building a site of my own.</p>
<p>For years, I’ve been frustrated by the state of online discussions, and the platforms that host them. For years, I just sat back and complained, but this time, I thought I should take a stab at it myself, and try to build something better. I’m now proud to say that the site’s version-1 <a href="http://www.thecaucus.net/#/content/my_digest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is now complete</a>!</p>
<p>For those of you wondering why you should visit this site, and what makes it unique, here’s a summary of the guiding principles behind the site. I’m sure you’ll agree that this is indeed an ambitious project, never been attempted before, and I’m very curious to see how it shapes out.</p>
<h2>Why Caucus</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>How often have you seen content that is highly rated online, despite being inaccurate, misleading or inflammatory?</p>
<p>How often have you seen an online discussion resembling an echo chamber, with dissenting views being systematically silenced and suppressed?</p>
<p>How often have you seen a great online community crumble because its very success attracts swarms of new members who do not share the community’s values?</p>
<p>These are the problems that caucus was specifically designed to solve. By applying sophisticated Reputation-System based algorithms to rank crowd-sourced content, we aim to develop healthy online communities, and foster truly constructive and thought provoking dialogue.</p>
<h2>Our Principles</h2>
<div id="abouthow">
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p><em><span>Reputation Matters</span></em></p>
<p>The success of real world communities derives ultimately from reputation, and reputation-enhanced speech. The advice given by the wise is awarded greater reverence and prominence, than that of an angsty troublemaker. The converse of this, in the reputation-free internet, is vitriol and lowest-common-denominator mob rule. We believe that in order to effectively build online communities, and foster constructive discussion, we need digital reputations as well, and reputation-enhanced online speech.</p>
<p><em><span>Discussion Matters</span></em></p>
<p>Constructive discussion keeps the world spinning. Both the spreading of verified knowledge, as well as the discussion and synthesis of new ideas. Announcing to the world that you love Vanilla, is a very safe and popular thing to say. But there has to be more to life than simply discussing how awesome Vanilla is. The most important things in life can also be contentious. And that is exactly why they need to be discussed. Popular content is worth highlighting, but so too is controversial content. Only with a mix of both, can we engage in true dialogue.</p>
<p><em><span>Community Matters</span></em></p>
<p>In our increasingly anonymous online world, communities still matter as much as ever. Systems work best when people are allowed to self-organize into communities. Communities that have their own distinct principles, personalities, values and reputations. Communities composed of regulars, who embody the character of the community itself. Communities that are free to welcome outsiders who are a good cultural fit, and safeguard themselves against outsiders who are not. Communities that socially compete with one another, in order to provide its members with the best experience. And out of this competition, the greatest benefit for individuals: The freedom to pick and choose a community that best reflects her values and needs.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="aboutwhat">
<h2>Site Features</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p><em><u>Crowd-sourced Content Ranking</u></em></p>
<p>Through voting, <strong>you</strong> decide which content is worth being on the front page, and which content should be buried in the archives.</p>
<p><em><u>Earned Reputation</u></em></p>
<p>By posting content, and getting votes from others in the community, you can over time, build up your own reputation.</p>
<p><em><u>Reputation Enhanced Speech</u></em></p>
<p>The extent to which content is highlighted will depend on the reputation of the people posting and voting for it. We trust those, who are trusted by their community.</p>
<p><em><u>Fair Airtime</u></em></p>
<p>Some people post every thought that comes into their head, and others are more deliberate about posting things that are well thought out. Some people have an opinion on everything, and others only vote on things that they feel strongly about. We account for such posting/voting patterns to ensure that every person gets a fair voice in the community.</p>
<p><em><u>Merit Based Scoring</u></em></p>
<p>Some content may have accumulated more votes simply because it was posted at a better time, and thus, seen by more people. We normalize for such biases and ensure that every content is judged fairly on its own merit.</p>
<p><em><u>Promoting Controversy</u></em></p>
<p>Popular content has its place, but so too does controversial content. Only with a mix of both, can we engage in true, informative dialogue.</p>
<p><em><u>Community Specific Reputation</u></em></p>
<p>A person’s reputation is specific to each community. Together with reputation-enhanced-speech, this ensures that communities can retain their own unique culture, and not be deluged by outsiders.</p>

                    <p>I’ve been a software engineer a while now and I can say this with confidence - it is fun. It’s great and I wouldn’t trade it for anything else. It’s so much fun that some folks try to capture the most enjoyable elements and put them into games.</p>

<p>I’ve played two such games. The first is <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/504210/SHENZHEN_IO/">Shenzhen.io</a></strong>. This one looks similar to what an engineer working on embedded devices would see. You solve puzzles by writing assembly code on low power devices. What makes this game great is that they remove the annoying parts of writing and shipping code.</p>

<ul>
<li>The requirements are clear, rarely true on the job.</li>
<li>The edit-debug-compile loop is lightning quick. That combined with a great test suite means you can try several potential solutions in a minute.</li>
<li>The platform your code depends on (the game itself) doesn’t have bugs. You don’t need to fix your dependencies before you start on your own code.</li>
</ul>

<p>Should a software engineer play Shenzhen.io? The gameplay isn’t for everyone. For some people it feels too much “like work”. At the end of the day you want to relax, not work at tasks that feel similar to what you did for 8 hours. Despite that, I think it’s worthwhile just to see how much more fun a task becomes when the requirements are clear and developer tools are fast. Everyone knows that investing in our direction and our tools will help, but having fun playing this game reinforces that feeling.</p>

<!-- There's a great article about Shenzhen.io that I couldn't quite work in - https://probablydance.com/2016/11/07/lessons-learned-from-shenzhen-io/ -->

<p>The second game is <strong><a href="https://factorio.com/">Factorio</a></strong> which released last Friday, though it has been available as an early access preview for about 4 years now. Those who’ve played it are probably scratching their heads right now - this is a game about building a factory, not coding. You work with conveyor belts, metals, oil products to craft products necessary to make a spacecraft.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BqaAjgpsoW8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>And yet, this game reminds me of software engineering more than any other. Let me explain why.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Technical debt</strong>. Do we hack it for now or do we implement it right? The answer as always - it depends. Hacking it gets us closer to our goals right now but we have to pay off the debt eventually. Novice players (like me!) start out connecting various parts of our base by conveyor belts till our base resembles spaghetti, similar to poorly maintained codebases. Eventually we learn techniques to tame this complexity so our base/codebase becomes easier to reason about.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)</strong>. One of those techniques is reducing duplication. If you have a component that’s needed in multiple places, do you make it once and use it everywhere or do you copy paste in each place it’s needed? The answer is “it depends”. As an engineer, sometimes you use a library while other times you copy paste. It depends on the complexity of the component - a couple of functions can be copy pasted while something complex probably shouldn’t. So it is in Factorio, a certain component (electronic circuits) was being produced in 4-5 places. I eventually replaced them all with one centralised production array to simplify the factory.</li>
<li><strong>Scaling</strong>. A repeated theme in this game is building a production array and later finding we need 3-5x the throughput. The first few times this happens, it requires redoing from scratch. After we wise up, we start design our arrays with space for scaling up. So it is with software - our systems need to scale to many more users, sometimes without much warning. We design our systems keeping that in mind.</li>
<li><strong>Rebuilding</strong>. When we’re rebuilding a component in a single player game or a personal software project we don’t usually care if the component or the whole system stops working briefly. I was playing multiplayer with friends though, so I tried to make sure components I was working on didn’t break anything else. I created a new oil refinery system, shifted existing customers to the new one before decommissioning the old one. Zero downtime.</li>
<li><strong>Debugging</strong> to find root causes. Our factory is far from perfect, so something is always breaking as we add stuff to it. Finding the root causes of these issues is tricky, especially when fixing those leads to other problems, like playing whack-a-mole. An example from yesterday - We don’t have enough electricity, so we add more boilers, but now the water pipes need fixing. Then the water is fine, but we don’t have enough coal. That mirrors real life</li>
<li><strong>Teamwork</strong>. Most things are possible solo given enough time. But it’s quicker and more fun working with a team you like. We were able to move fast by splitting responsibilities among the team. We have one oil guy (me), one trains guy, one secretary of defense, among other roles. The others don’t care about the internals of the refinery system, just the interface - they use the outputs and let me know if it’s broken. It’s the same on large software projects - everyone can’t learn the intricacies of the whole system. Instead everyone learns the APIs of all components while a few are responsible for the implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Researching</strong>. We spend most of our time exploiting our existing knowledge to keep us in our local maxima of output. However, a smart player dedicates some time to learning new techniques. In our game, coal power wasn’t working out for us and I had dismissed nuclear power as an option because we didn’t have enough uranium ore. I looked into it again when we were desperately short of power and producing too much pollution. Turns out even a little ore is enough to power the base for a 100 hours if we do it right. It’s the same with software - our existing stack probably works well, but it’s smart to see what’s out there and possibly learn from others. New team mates can help here too - everything is new to them so they’re spending more time than you on learning. They can come across stuff that we didn’t know about and use that knowledge to find a higher maxima. A fresh pair of eyes is always good.</li>
<li><strong>Automation</strong>. You can do most things manually, it just takes time. But if you’re doing something repeatedly, it should be automated. The game gently eases you towards this idea by requiring a few items be automated. It gets better later in the game you unlock construction robots. You can tell them the layout of the production array you’ve designed, give them the materials and they will construct it for you. This reminded me of AWS CloudFormation and similar tools - although it’s possible to set up servers by hand, it’s quicker and less error prone to specify the end state and let a tool do it for us. But if you’ve developed software, you know that automation isn’t just a means to an end - it’s an end in and of itself. We do it because it makes us happy, even if we do too much of it and <a href="https://xkcd.com/1319/">forget what we were doing in the first place</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Putting out fires</strong>. Sometimes it’s hard to implement new features because we’re being pulled away to deal with alerts - all too common on software engineering teams. The typical solution is to have one team member deal with alerts while the rest focus on adding features. That’s we did in the game too.</li>
</ul>

<p>But more than any one thing, the game is about managing complexity. Designing a specification and implementing systems that fulfill that specification. Maintaining and growing that system over time.</p>

<p>IMO, playing Factorio will not make you a better software engineer. But if you’re a software engineer, you’ll likely find the game fun. And conversely, if you’re good at the game you should give software engineering a shot.</p>

<p>You can get Factorio at on the <a href="https://factorio.com/">official website</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/">Steam</a>. There’s also a <a href="https://factorio.com/download">free demo</a>, in case you’d like to try before you buy. (Just one thing - don’t wait for a sale. This game has never gone on sale and possibly never will.)</p>

	<p>
		If you're around my age, you'll remember Windows Minesweeper. It was one of several games included with Windows back in the day to try to train users in the use of the then-newfangled â€˜mouseâ€™. It doesnâ€™t come with Windows any more. You can get Minesweeper for Windows 10, but the developers haveâ€¦ made some choices.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you havenâ€™t played it, Minesweeper is a grid of squares, some of which have mines underneath, and your job is to click on all the others. If you click on a mine, you lose. You can also flag squares with the right mouse button to record that you think they are a mine. Your only clue as to where the mines are is that when you click on a square that isnâ€™t a mine, it tells you how many of the eight adjacent squares are mines. If that number is zero, the game automatically clicks on all the adjacent squares for you so you can get a little patch to start from. Hopefully that will include a 1 in a tight corner so thereâ€™s only one place its mine can go, and that will complete a nearby 1 so you can get some more numbers to work from, eventually leading you to complete the game.
	</p>
	<p>
		If youâ€™re not so lucky, you might not get a solvable board. A common situation is that you get down to the last two spaces and you know one of them is a mine but thereâ€™s no wat to predict which one. You have to guess. Heads you win, tails you just wasted 10 minutes carefully clearing the whole board only to be scuppered by a forced guess.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/mines.html">Thereâ€™s a version of Minesweeper that guarantees you never have to guess</a>, which is very nice. It neatly solves the problem of unwinnable games, and while I find that always knowing you can make a deduction can be too big a clue, in regular Minesweeper you could even lose straight off the bat â€” you have to guess the first move and maybe itâ€™ll be a mine. In this case, Windows Minesweeper quietly chooses a different arrangement of mines and pretends like you got lucky after all â€” but it doesnâ€™t do that if youâ€™re stuck at the <em>end</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		So what if we went further? Below is a version of Minesweeper where you will <em>never</em> be penalised when forced to guess. Any time there simply isnâ€™t enough information to deduce a safe move, weâ€™ll pull Windowsâ€™s trick and quietly rearrange the mines so you donâ€™t get penalised.
	</p>
	<p>
		But since that would on its own make the game too easy, the flip side of this coin is that if you <em>can</em> in theory deduce a safe move but guess anyway, the code will quietly rearrange the mines so that your unnecessary risk backfires and you lose.
	</p>
	<p><label>Width </label>
		<label>Height </label>
		<label>Mines </label>
		
	</p>
	
	<p>
		This game is also rigged to give you a zero on your first click rather than simply a non-mine space. To be honest this is mostly to avoid situations that are computationally difficult â€” this is not what I would call carefully optimised code. If I wanted to expand this I would (eg) make it precalculate things while youâ€™re staring at the screen instead of waiting for you to choose a square and then trying to work out what to do about it.
	</p>
	<p>
		More importantly, I would like to make the game recognise when thereâ€™s a forced guess _coming_ â€” currently if thereâ€™s a 50/50 chance in one corner of the grid that youâ€™re clearly going to have to take eventually, you have to wait until thatâ€™s <em>all</em> there is. If you take the chance when there was a safe space available elsewhere, youâ€™ll always lose.
	</p>
	<p>
		If I was feeling especially mean, I could insist that the player choose the square with the best odds of being safe, rather than simply judging whether or not each square is theoretically knowable. But I think that would be taking things too far.
	</p>

  <div>
    <p>COVID-19 has changed several of my habits. Below, I write about which ones that have changed and a prediction on their permanency.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Shopping</strong>: I buy &gt; 90% of my non-perishables online. I never liked in-person shopping and I haven’t had a car for twelve years so this trend was already in motion. When COVID hit, I subscribed to Amazon Prime which is big driver behind this percentage. The bulk of my in person shopping is done at the grocery store for buying produce. I predict this to be a permanent change because of the convenience factor of clicking a button and getting it two days later.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fitness</strong>: I live a one minute bike ride away from a 24 Hour Fitness Super Sport Gym. I no longer weight lift and because of that, my muscles have shrunk and I have gained weight. I now run but do not enjoy it as much. I go on atleast one walk everyday—something I never did before. I will go to gyms when they reopen so I can get back to weight lifting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Home</strong>: For my entire adult life, I never invested in a nice home because I never spent time there. Prior to COVID, I’d be out of the house from 10 to 8 because of work and networking events. Now I am home all the time and have bought a desk lamp, a bigger monitor, and rearranged my furniture. I don’t know whether this shift will be permanent because I don’t know what in-person work will look like post COVID.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cooking</strong>: Of my 14 lunch + dinner meals a week, I used to eat out ~10 times. Now, I cook that many times and eat out the rest. It’s been a real joy to try new cuisines, eat healthier, and just be more creative with food. This won’t be a permanent change for me because of time (I spend ~1hr/day cooking) but my cook to eat out ratio will probably settle to an event split when we’re back to normal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>In-person meetings</strong>: I moved to the Bay Area to meet smart people. The bulk of that happened at conferences, bars, and restaurants. I no longer go to any those. This will not be a permanent change because the substitute—virtual gatherings—are not even 25% comparable to an in-person experience.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Podcasts</strong>: Prior to COVID, I had never listened to a podcast. Now, I cook a lot more and make the 6 hour car drive to my parents house every so often. Podcasts make those long tasks enjoyable. I plan to continue listening because I love the medium - no ads, long format, deep intellectual discussions.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p> Neuroscientists at EPFL and the University of Edinburgh have discovered that the degree of motivation and the stamina to keep it up depends on the ratio between the neurotransmitters glutamine and glutamate in the nucleus accumbens of the brain.<br></p><div id="news-content-text" itemprop="description"><p>There is no question that motivation is one of the hardest and yet important factors in life. It’s the difference between success and failure, goal-setting and aimlessness, well-being and unhappiness. And yet, why is it so hard to get motivated – or even if we do, to keep it up?</p><p>That is the question that scientists led by Professor Carmen Sandi at EPFL and Dr Gedi Luksys at the University of Edinburgh have sought to answer. The researchers worked off previous knowledge that told them two things: First, that people differ a lot in their capacity to engage in motivated behavior and that motivational problems like apathy are common in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Second, to target an area of the brain called the “nucleus accumbens”.</p><p>Sitting close to the bottom of brain, the nucleus accumbens has been the subject of a lot of research. The reason is that it was quickly found to be a major player in functions like aversion, reward, reinforcement, and motivation.</p><p>To test and quantify motivation, the EPFL team designed what is known as a “monetary incentive force task”. The idea is that participants perform a task with increasing – and measurable – effort and get paid sums of money that correspond to their effort. Basically, do more and get paid more.</p><p>In this study, 43 men were scanned to measure–metabolites in the nucleus accumbens in their brains with a sophisticated brain-imaging technique called “proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy”, or <sup>1</sup>H-MRS. This can specifically measure the abundance of neurochemicals in the brain, such as neurotransmitters and metabolites. Because of this <sup>1</sup>H-MRS is used even in clinical settings to determine neurological disorders.</p><p>Subsequently, each participant was asked to squeeze a device that measures force – a dynamometer – to a given level of contraction in order to earn either 0.2, 0.5, or 1 Swiss franc. This procedure was repeated for a number of 120 consecutive trials, which made performance in the task quite demanding.</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Du-EkGwPRnA?rel=0" width="640"></iframe></p><p><em>Illustration of the hand-grip force exertion task. In the experiment, participants were first asked to squeeze the grip at their maximal force or capacity. Then, during task performance, in each trial, they had to squeeze it up to a force threshold of 50% of their maximal voluntary contraction and maintained at that force for another 3 seconds in order to earn the particular monetary incentive ascribed to each trial. The task consisted of 80 consecutive trials. Credit: João Rodrigues (EPFL)</em></p><p>The idea of the experiment was that the different sums would push participants to decide if they were going to invest energy and perform the task accordingly at each trial. The scientists also ran the experiment under isolation and group conditions to investigate the influence of competition on performance.</p><p>Once they had gathered the behavioral data, the researchers processed it through a computational model that estimated the most appropriate parameters that should be measured with regard to utility, effort, and performance functions. This allowed them to interrogate whether particular neurotransmitter levels predicted specific motivational functions.</p><p>The analysis revealed that the key to performance – and, by extension, motivation – lies within the ratio of two neurotransmitters in the nucleus accumbens: glutamine and glutamate. Specifically, the ratio of glutamine to glutamate relates to our capacity for maintaining performance over a long period of time – what the researchers term “stamina”.</p><p>Another discovery was that competition seems to boost performance even from the beginning of the task. This was especially the case for individuals with low glutamine-to-glutamate ratios in the nucleus accumbens.</p><p>“The findings provide novel insights in the field of motivation neuroscience,” says Carmen Sandi. “They show that the balance between glutamine and glutamate can help predict specific, computational components of motivated performance. Our approach and data can also help us develop therapeutic strategies, including nutritional interventions, that address deficits in effort engagement by targeting metabolism.”</p><p><em>Professor Carmen Sandi’s lab is part of EPFL’s </em><a href="https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sv/bmi/"><em>Brain Mind Institute</em></a><em>, situated in the </em><a href="https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sv"><em>School of Life Sciences</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><strong>Other contributors</strong></p><ul><li>EPFL Center for Biomedical Imaging</li><li>EPFL Laboratory of Functional and Metabolic Imaging</li><li>ICM Institute for Brain and Spinal Cord</li></ul></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><!-- .entry-header --><div><p>Recently I migrated this website over to WordPress.org. I tried to set it up so I could use my WordPress site with Github Pages. This post details the tribulations I faced while doing so. Here are the different sections; feel free to skip around however you like:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><a href="#backstory">The backstory: my previous setup and why I switched</a></li><li><a href="#requirements">Requirements for a new solution</a></li><li><a href="#mistakes">Two big initial mistakes</a></li><li><a href="#warning">A warning (because hindsight is 20/20)</a></li><li><a href="#run-locally">The treacherous journey to run WordPress locally</a></li><li><a href="#annoying-issues">More annoying issues I faced</a></li><li><a href="#is-it-working">Finally, it’s working?</a></li><li><a href="#conclusion">The Conclusion</a></li><li><a href="#postscript">Postscript: I’m never satisfied and here are a few more things about WordPress that I’m annoyed with</a></li></ol><h2 id="backstory"><strong>The backstory: my previous setup and why I switched</strong> to WordPress</h2><p>Prior to WordPress, I had a nice set up with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> (static site generator) and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github/Github Pages</a> (hosting &amp; serving). I liked this old setup because it was simple and free. I also liked Jekyll’s plain, minimal look. Jekyll’s visual style is very barebones and that’s exactly what I wanted.</p><p>My old workflow for editing and publishing posts was simple. I’d open a text editor, write a post in Markdown, and build and run my website locally to test the changes. Next, I’d push the new post to Github, where I’d re-deploy my website with the changes.</p><p>I first started to get annoyed with this setup when I had to re-remind myself how Jekyll glued together and rendered my site each time I wanted to publish a post. I got even more annoyed when I wanted to make changes to the layout. For example, I tried and failed multiple times to add a <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag to the head of my <code>index.html</code> file. This theoretically should have been a very simple change.&nbsp;</p><p>If this happened once or twice, I’d be fine with it. The bigger problem is that the purpose of my website is to encourage me to write more. I started to procrastinate writing because there was always some small thing I wanted to fix with Jekyll first. Then, when I made time to tinker around with Jekyll, I was annoyed that I spent more time doing that than actually writing.</p><h2 id="requirements"><strong>Requirements for a new solution</strong></h2><p>So, I decided to make it was time to change my setup. My new setup had to fulfill just two requirements:</p><ol><li><strong>Easy content management. </strong>I really like the idea of just writing something, editing it, and then hitting a button to publish it once it’s ready. I didn’t like diving into Ruby files just to fix configuration issues, deploy issues, UI issues, etc. (what was happening with Jekyll).&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Be a writing first experience. </strong>I’ve never quite liked writing in text editors. Something about it just doesn’t <em>feel</em> right, though I can’t put my finger on exactly what.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>I decided to go with WordPress because it seemed like it fulfilled both of those requirements really well. Also <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress.org</a> is free, unlike Webflow and Ghost, two alternatives I considered that are both quite pricey ($20/month for Webflow and $29/month for Ghost) and loaded with a bunch of features I don’t need yet.</p><h2 id="mistakes"><strong>Two big initial mistakes</strong></h2><p>As mentioned above, previously I used Github/Github Pages to host and serve my website. Github was free and worked great, so I wanted to rig up my WordPress setup to also use Github and Github Pages.&nbsp;</p><p>The only requirement to use Github Pages is that your site has to be static. Some light Googling showed me that there were a few plugins that converted WordPress site files to static pages. There were even <a href="https://www.hywel.me/static/site/wordpress/2016/07/17/fast-free-static-website-with-wordpress-and-github-pages.html">a few tutorials</a> describing how to do this, so I was confident this would be possible. That was my first big mistake.</p><p>Next, I began figuring out how to get WordPress to run locally. That was my second big mistake. My logic here was simple. Previously with Jekyll, I’d run my website locally, add my changes, and then push the new version of my website to Github to redeploy it. Thus, if I wanted to use WordPress with Github and Github Pages, then I should run my WordPress site locally, add my changes, and then push the new version of the site to Github.&nbsp;</p><p>While this logic wasn’t bad, I really should have tested the core assumption that it relied on first (the fact that the WordPress site <em>could</em> be converted into a static website). Or I should have done a bit more research than just some “light Googling” before venturing into a solution and stubbornly refusing to give up.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="warning"><strong>A warning (because hindsight is 20/20)</strong></h2><p>Here’s what I know now: running WordPress locally is a nightmare. Successfully figuring it out was way harder than it should have been. If you’re trying to do this yourself, don’t. You most likely don’t need to, and there’s probably another solution you can use to get to what you want.&nbsp;</p><p>(I should also caveat that I know almost nothing about Apache, MySQL, FTP, and PHP. If you’re familiar with them, then you might not have the same issues. However, I really don’t think I should have needed to learn about all of those technologies just to set up WordPress locally.)</p><h2 id="run-locally"><strong>The treacherous journey to run WordPress locally</strong></h2><p>First, I downloaded WordPress.org and installed it locally. The <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/installing-wordpress-on-your-own-computer/">official WordPress installation page</a> implied that I also needed some combination of Apache, MySQL, and PHP. A few of the links on that page were broken, a red flag that I promptly ignored.&nbsp;</p><p>I read a few other tutorials and subsequently downloaded and installed <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/">XAMPP</a>, making sure to include Apache, MySQL, PHP, and phpMyAdmin in the installation. I opened up XAMPP and pressed the “Start Application” button. That took me to an error page.</p><p>I clicked through some XAMPP tabs and pressed a few more buttons that started Apache, MySQL, and ProFTD. Now pressing “Start Application” took me to an XAMPP page. This seemed promising, but I still got an error page when trying to access my WordPress site which should have been running locally.</p><p>I bopped around a bit more and figured out that I had to enable local forwarding in XAMPP on an available port. I roll my eyes and question why XAMPP is so difficult to use.</p><p>Now that I could <em>see</em> my WordPress site locally, I still couldn’t do anything (e.g. create post). I learned that I needed to create a database locally via phpMyAdmin. Again, this is something that should have been easy, but the interface SUCKED. I had such difficulty performing such a simple action. I mean…just look at it:&nbsp;</p><figure><img width="1024" height="544" src="https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-1024x544.png" alt="phpMyAdmin home screen" srcset="https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-1024x544.png 1024w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-300x159.png 300w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-768x408.png 768w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-1536x817.png 1536w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-2048x1089.png 2048w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-600x319.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-1024x544.png" data-srcset="https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-1024x544.png 1024w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-300x159.png 300w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-768x408.png 768w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-1536x817.png 1536w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-2048x1089.png 2048w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-600x319.png 600w"><figcaption><em>phpMyAdmin home screen</em></figcaption></figure><figure><img width="1022" height="486" src="https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM.png" alt="bad database creation UI" srcset="https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM.png 1022w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM-300x143.png 300w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM-768x365.png 768w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM-600x285.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1022px) 100vw, 1022px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM.png" data-srcset="https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM.png 1022w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM-300x143.png 300w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM-768x365.png 768w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM-600x285.png 600w"><figcaption><em>phpMyAdmin “Create Database” page</em></figcaption></figure><p>Looking at these screenshots now makes me annoyed all over again.</p><h2 id="annoying-issues"><strong>More annoying issues I faced</strong></h2><p>I then ran into some issues that took me a long time to figure out. Surprisingly, there was not a lot of advice out there on good solutions. I spent more time than I’d like to admit on WordPress support forums and arcane blogs. I’ll include the two most annoying issues here for posterity and in the event that another poor soul is also sifting through Google searching for a solution.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Annoying error #1: “to perform the requested action WordPress needs to access your web server”</em></strong></p><p>To fix this, add <code>define( 'FS_METHOD', 'direct' );</code> to your <code>wp-config.php</code> file.</p><p><strong><em>Annoying error #2: fix the file and folder permissions error in WordPress / “installation failed could not create directory”</em></strong></p><p>To fix this, you need to give XAMPP write access to the local directory you have WordPress set up in. I spent awhile messing around with quite a few config files (like .htaccess) and FTP permission codes to no avail. The solution was ultimately simple: right-click on your local WordPress directory, click “Get Info”, scroll to “Sharing &amp; Permissions”, and change the permissions on your directory to “Read and Write (anyone)”.</p><h2 id="is-it-working"><strong>Finally, it’s working?</strong></h2><p>At long last, all of this is finally working and I now have WordPress running locally.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyways, the next step is to install a plugin to convert my site into a bunch of static pages. I go with <a href="https://www.simplystatic.co/">SimplyStatic</a>, the most popular and highly recommended plugin to do this.</p><p>I immediately run into quite a few errors with SimplyStatic. After progressively resolving each one, I ultimately run into one I can’t fix. I search some more and realize that it’s because SimplyStatic was only compatible with an earlier version of WordPress than the one I was running. I dig further and realize that the plugin hasn’t been updated for over two years. And there don’t seem to be <em>any</em> currently updated plugins that do this conversion. Epic FAIL.&nbsp;</p><p>I didn’t want to sink in even more time to learn how to convert the WordPress PHP files into static pages. I decided to cut my losses right there and abandon ship.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="conclusion"><strong>The Conclusion</strong></h2><p><strong><span>TL;DR? Don’t try to run WordPress locally, and don’t try to use WordPress with Github Pages to host and serve it. It won’t work.</span></strong></p><p>I ultimately ended up going with <a href="http://siteground.com/">Siteground</a> for managed hosting. Siteground’s interface is awful, but after poking around a bit I got most of it set up. I had a few minor configuration issues when enabling HTTPS and spent ~30 minutes chatting with a customer support agent, who was actually quite helpful.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="postscript"><strong>Postscript: I’m never satisfied and here are a few more things about WordPress that I’m annoyed with</strong></h2><ol><li>Unless you want your WordPress site to look bad or just like everyone else’s, you’ll probably want to customize an existing theme to your own liking. <strong>To do this, you’ll still need to hack around with code<em> </em></strong><em>(in this case, a combination of HTML, CSS and PHP)</em>. Theoretically, you could probably install a plugin to help you do this, but that’d probably slow down your site and further obscure how things actually work.&nbsp;</li><li>Getting used to WordPress itself was a bit of a curve. The main dashboard, for instance, is completely useless to me. I’ve just been ignoring all parts of the interface I don’t need, which thus far has been working pretty well.&nbsp;</li></ol><hr><p>If you liked this post, add your email address below to stay updated whenever there’s a new one.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

	
				<p>Have you ever had wrist-pain from using a mouse all day? I have. And recently it got a lot worse.</p>
<p>A while ago, my employer had sent me a shiny iMac to work from home.&nbsp;For security reasons, they&nbsp;required that I use it for work. Unfortunately for my wrist, this also meant that I would be stuck at a desk, whereby my hand and wrist would be in the same unnatural position&nbsp;for 40 hours a week. Gone&nbsp;were&nbsp;the days that I could freestyle around my room with my laptop, switching between my desk and my bed.</p>
<p>Within weeks, my wrist started to hurt. I was in pain every day. So I bought a vertical mouse.</p>
<p><a href="http://eftegarie.com/wp-content/uploads/evoluent-ergonomic-bluetooth-mouse.jpg"><img src="http://eftegarie.com/wp-content/uploads/evoluent-ergonomic-bluetooth-mouse-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://eftegarie.com/wp-content/uploads/evoluent-ergonomic-bluetooth-mouse-225x300.jpg 225w, https://eftegarie.com/wp-content/uploads/evoluent-ergonomic-bluetooth-mouse-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px"><br>
</a><span id="more-3989"></span></p>
<p><strong>Evoluent<br>
</strong>The folks at Evoluent have been making ergonomic mice since 1994. Their <a href="https://evoluent.com/" target="_blank">websites</a> is ugly as hell, and their branding is terrible. Yet they charge about $110 for a mouse. I had never tried an ergonomic mouse before, and I was afraid it would take me months to get used to it. But&nbsp;I desperately needed one, as I was in pain every day.&nbsp;I wanted to buy a product that had already&nbsp;withstood the test of time.</p>
<p>I looked for second hand ones, and I found one that fit my requirements. It was the&nbsp;<em>Evoluent VerticalMouse 4 Bluetooth</em>.&nbsp;I haggled the price down to $40 shipped! I figured I could easily resell it for more if I didn’t like it.</p>
<p>The upside of being a Middle Easterner is that you learn to negotiate everything from a young age. My mom even negotiates on prices in the supermarket, and she often wins. Can you believe that?</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth vs USB mini receiver<br>
</strong>When it comes to wireless mice, Bluetooth is superior to mice that&nbsp;rely on radio-frequency USB mini receivers, as&nbsp;they often&nbsp;have interference, causing your mouse to lag, shake up or briefly loose connection. I’ve experienced this a lot, even with expensive Logitech mice. Perhaps my desk is too messy or has too many peripherals on it. And with Bluetooth, you don’t need to take out the USB receiver when switching to another computer.</p>
<p><a href="http://eftegarie.com/wp-content/uploads/evoluent-ergonomic-vertical-mouse-wireless.jpg"><img src="http://eftegarie.com/wp-content/uploads/evoluent-ergonomic-vertical-mouse-wireless-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://eftegarie.com/wp-content/uploads/evoluent-ergonomic-vertical-mouse-wireless-300x225.jpg 300w, https://eftegarie.com/wp-content/uploads/evoluent-ergonomic-vertical-mouse-wireless-768x576.jpg 768w, https://eftegarie.com/wp-content/uploads/evoluent-ergonomic-vertical-mouse-wireless-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p><strong>Verdict<br>
</strong>Now let’s get to the point: As soon as I first used the mouse, I was relieved to find out how easy it was to use. I was able to control the pointer just as good as my normal mouse, right from the get-go. Phew, my biggest fear was gone! Note that during my research, I read online that some people took weeks or even months to get used to it, so your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>As of now, I’ve been using it for about a week, so I cannot comment on the battery life. But overall I am satisfied with this mouse. And most importantly; my wrist pain is gone completely. From daily pain to no paint at all.</p>
<p>I will cherish this mouse for as long as I can.</p>
<p>P.S.<br>
Evoluent has been neglectful of their brand and their product for years now. Their drivers are incompatible with modern Mac computers. Their website and product photography is ugly. There are barely any YouTubers reviewing their products. They are leaving a hole open in the market.</p>
<p>Someone should create a much better experience. There’s a tiny company here that I wish existed. I can summarize&nbsp;the business plan in one sentence:&nbsp;<em>“An ergonomic mouse that looks like it was designed and branded by Steve Jobs, for roughly half the price of an Evoluent”.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>So if anyone wants to explore this further with me, feel free to&nbsp;<a href="https://eftegarie.com/contact">contact me</a>. I have experience in designing physical products, branding and manufacturing.</p><p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Most WebAssembly tutorials and examples you will find online focus on using it inside the browser in order to accelerate various functionality of a website or web app.<br>
However, there is an area where WebAssembly is really powerful but not talked too much about: outside the browser usage scenarios. That is what we’ll focus on in this series of posts.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-webassembly">What is WebAssembly?</h2>
<p>Web people are on a roll of giving bad names to things (web-gpu is another example).<br>
WebAssembly is neither web or assembly, but a bytecode that can be targeted from languages like C++, C#, Rust and others. This means you can write some Rust code, compile it into WebAssembly and run that code in a WebAssembly virtual machine.</p>

<p>This is powerful because you won’t have to deal with garbage collected scripted languages anymore, and essentially use Rust or C++ as your <em>scripting language</em>.  WebAssembly enables predictable and stable performance because it doesn’t require garbage collection like the usual options (LUA/JavaScript).</p>

<p>It’s a relatively new product and there are a lot of rough edges, especially for out-of-browser scenarios. One of the roughest ones in my experience has been documentation for out-of-browser scenarios and this is the reason for my blog posts, to document my findings and hopefully help some people that may be interested in this subject.</p>

<h2 id="why-would-we-want-to-run-webassembly-outside-of-a-browser">Why would we want to run WebAssembly outside of a browser?</h2>
<p>For out of browser scenarios, one of its main advantage is that it provides system level access without compromising on security. This is done through WASI, the Web Assembly System Interface. <a href="https://wasi.dev/">WASI</a> is a collection of C-like functions that provide access to functionality such as <code>fd_read</code>, <code>rand</code>, <code>fd_write</code>, threads (WIP), in a safe way.</p>

<p>Here are a few scenarios where you would be able to use web-assembly outside of a browser:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A scripting language for a video game.</li>
  <li>To run some code with minimal overhead as Fastly/Cloudflare are doing with their compute-at-edge scenarios.</li>
  <li>To run some easy to update code on IoT devices safely and with minimal runtime overhead.</li>
  <li>Extreamly fast programs in environments where you can’t JIT for <em>reasons</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>For the best experience in this adventure, I suggest using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> as your IDE and install the following extensions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>rust-analyzer</code>: for autocomplete and other great features.</li>
  <li><code>Code-LLDB</code>: For debugging with LLDB (even works on Windows)</li>
  <li><code>WebAssembly by the WebAssembly foundation</code>: Allows you to disassemble and inspect <code>.wasm</code> binaries.</li>
</ul>


<p>First you need a Virtual Machine (VM) that can run your WebAssembly program. This VM needs to be embeddable, so you can add it in your game engine, or what we will call from now on <strong>host program</strong>. There are a few to pick from: <a href="https://github.com/wasm3/wasm3">WASM3</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime">Wasmtime</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime">WAMR</a>, and many others. They have various characteristics, such as supporting JIT, using as little memory as possible and so on and you have to choose one one that fits your target platform and scenario.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter too much what VM you’re choosing besides runtime properties, with the exception of debugging. The only VM that allows for a seamless debugging experience that I’ve found is Wasmtime (this is another one of those rough edges). So even if you don’t plan on deploying that anywhere due to other constraints, I suggest using it as the <strong>debug VM</strong>. Whenever you’d want to debug some WASM code you can launch it with Wasmtime.</p>



<p>First, we need to create a new <code>lib</code> project:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>cargo new <span>--lib</span> wasm_example
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In <code>Cargo.toml</code> add the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we can edit <code>lib.rs</code> and export the following <code>C</code> FFI compatible function from it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#[no_mangle]</span>
<span>extern</span> <span>"C"</span> <span>fn</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>i32</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>i32</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"From WASM: Sum is: {:?}"</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>);</span>
    <span>s</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This a function that takes two numbers, adds them, then prints the result before returning their sum.<br>
WebAssembly doesn’t define a default function that’s executed after a module is loaded, so in the host program you need to get a function by it’s signature, and run it (quite similar to how <code>dlopen</code>/<code>dlsym</code> works).</p>

<p>We expose this <code>sum</code> function (and any other functions we want to call from the host VM) as a function that’s callable from <code>C</code>, using <code>[#no_mangle]</code> and <code>pub extern "C"</code>. If you’re coming here from some WASM for the browser tutorials, you may notice we don’t need to use <code>wasm-bindgen</code> at all.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-we-compile-it">How do we compile it?</h2>
<p>Rust supports two targets for WebAssembly: <code>wasm32-unknown-unknown</code> and <code>wasm32-wasi</code>. The first one is bare-bones WebAssembly. Think of it like the <code>[#no-std]</code> of WebAssembly. It’s the kind you’d use for the browser that doesn’t assume any system functions are available.</p>

<p>At the other end, <code>wasm32-wasi</code> assumes that the VM exposes the <code>WASI</code> functionality, allowing a different implementation of the standard library to be used (the implementation that depends on the WASI functions to be available).</p>

<p>You can take a look at the available implementations for the Rust’s stdlib here: <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/library/std/src/sys">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/library/std/src/sys</a>  <br>
This is the implementation that assumes WASI functions are available to the rust program when running in a WebAssembly VM: <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/library/std/src/sys/wasi">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/library/std/src/sys/wasi</a>.</p>

<p>To comile for wasm32-wasi run:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># Run this just once</span>
rustup target add wasm32-wasi

<span># Compile for the wasm32-wasi target.</span>
cargo build <span>--target</span> wasm32-wasi
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="but-how-does-println-work">But how does <code>println!()</code> work?</h2>
<p>You may have noticed that we’re calling <code>println!()</code> and expecting the program to work and print to the console, but how does a WebAssembly program knows how to do that?</p>

<p>This is why we’re using <code>wasm32-wasi</code>. This target selects for the rust stdlib the version that assumes some functionality to be there (the <code>WASI</code> functions). Printing to the console means just writing to a special file descriptor. Most VMs allow that by default so we don’t need to do any special settings, besides compiling the correct <code>wasm32-wasi</code> target.</p>

<p>If you have installed the required extensions for vscode, you can now right click on <code>target/wasm32-wasi/debug/wasm_example.wasm</code> and select <code>Show WebAssembly</code> and you should have a new file open in vscode that looks like this:</p>

<p>This is a <code>wat</code> file. <code>wat</code> stands for WebAssembly text format. It’s kind of like looking at x64/ARM ASM instructions when disassembling a binary, just uglier and harder to understand. I have read that this was because the creators of WebAssembly couldn’t decide on a text format so they just left it in this ugly s-expression form.</p>

<p>The import statements here tell us that the WASM program needs the following functions <code>proc_exit</code>, <code>fd_write</code>, <code>environ_get</code>, <code>environ_sizes_get</code> to exist in the <code>wasi_snapshot_preview1</code> namespace.<br>
All imported or exported functions from a WebAssembly module require a namespace. <code>wasi_snapshot_preview1</code> is the WASI namespace so you can think of it as a reserved namespace for these functions. <code>println!</code> needs <code>wasi_snapshot_preview1::fd_write</code> to write to stdout.</p>

<h2 id="the-host-program">The host program</h2>
<p>You can pick any VM that has WASI available. I will use Wasmtime because later on I want to show you how to debug WebAssembly and this VM is the only one where debugging works at the moment.</p>

<p>The program loads the wasm binary file from the path: <code>examples/wasm_example.wasm</code>.<br>
This is the file you have previously compiled that you can find in <code>wasm_example/target/wasm32-wasi/debug/wasm_example.wasm</code>. <strong>Make sure you move it in the right place before running the host program.</strong></p>

<p>Here is the full listing of the host VM rust program that initializes the Wasmtime VM, loads the module, links against WASI and loads and executes the exported <code>sum</code> function from the WASM module:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>error</span><span>::</span><span>Error</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// A `Store` is a sort of "global object" in a sense, but for now it suffices</span>

    <span>// We start off by creating a `Module` which represents a compiled form</span>

<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
<p>This paper is an attempt to explain all the matrix calculus you need in order to understand the training of deep neural networks. We assume no math knowledge beyond what you learned in calculus 1, and provide links to help you refresh the necessary math where needed. Note that you do <b>not</b> need to understand this material before you start learning to train and use deep learning in practice; rather, this material is for those who are already familiar with the basics of neural networks, and wish to deepen their understanding of the underlying math. Don't worry if you get stuck at some point along the way---just go back and reread the previous section, and try writing down and working through some examples. And if you're still stuck, we're happy to answer your questions in the <a href="http://forums.fast.ai/c/theory">Theory category at forums.fast.ai</a>. <b>Note</b>: There is a <a href="#reference">reference section</a> at the end of the paper summarizing all the key matrix calculus rules and terminology discussed here.</p>






<h2 id="intro">Introduction </h2>


<p>Most of us last saw calculus in school, but derivatives are a critical part of machine learning, particularly deep neural networks, which are trained by optimizing a loss function. Pick up a machine learning paper or the documentation of a library such as <a href="http://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> and calculus comes screeching back into your life like distant relatives around the holidays.  And it's not just any old scalar calculus that pops up---you need differential <i>matrix calculus</i>, the shotgun wedding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra">linear algebra</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus">multivariate calculus</a>. </p>

<p>Well... maybe <i>need</i> isn't the right word; Jeremy's courses show how to become a world-class deep learning practitioner with only a minimal level of scalar calculus, thanks to leveraging the automatic differentiation built in to modern deep learning libraries. But if you really want to really understand what's going on under the hood of these libraries, and grok academic papers discussing the latest advances in model training techniques, you'll need to understand certain bits of the field of matrix calculus.</p>

<p>For example, the activation of a single computation unit in a neural network is typically calculated using the dot product (from linear algebra) of an edge weight vector <span>w</span> with an input vector <span>x</span> plus a scalar bias (threshold): <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-EEDCFA4252D0992243A283CE0EB777A6-depth003.31.svg">. Function <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-C599D931407509E0FA08F8686B205B6D-depth003.25.svg"> is called the unit's <i>affine function</i> and is followed by a <a href="https://goo.gl/7BXceK">rectified linear unit</a>, which clips negative values to zero: <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-66258AA93A4746DA10D306190271DE4B-depth003.25.svg">. Such a computational unit is sometimes referred to as an “artificial neuron” and looks like:</p>

<center>
<p><img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/neuron.png" alt="neuron.png" width="250"></p>
</center>

<p>Neural networks consist of many of these units, organized into multiple collections of neurons called <i>layers</i>. The activation of one layer's units become the input to the next layer's units. The activation of the unit or units in the final layer is called the network output.</p>

<p><i>Training</i> this neuron means choosing weights <span>w</span> and bias <span>b</span> so that we get the desired output for all <span>N</span> inputs <span>x</span>.  To do that, we minimize a <i>loss function</i> that compares the network's final <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-7971D42A6C6C6A28D6443F0645E4A036-depth003.25.svg"> with the <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-E146B831A1E53B95E4C63775285D62CF-depth003.25.svg"> (desired output of <span>x</span>) for all input <span>x</span> vectors. To minimize the loss, we use some variation on gradient descent, such as plain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent">stochastic gradient descent</a> (SGD), SGD with momentum, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent#Adam">Adam</a>.   All of those require the partial derivative (the gradient) of <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-7971D42A6C6C6A28D6443F0645E4A036-depth003.25.svg"> with respect to the model parameters <span>w</span> and <span>b</span>. Our goal is to gradually tweak <span>w</span> and <span>b</span> so that the overall loss function keeps getting smaller across all <span>x</span> inputs.</p>

<p>If we're careful, we can derive the gradient by differentiating the scalar version of a common loss function (mean squared error):</p>
<p><img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/blkeqn-A129949CD1EF7BE2CA8BD424D34F9930.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>But this is just one neuron, and neural networks must train the weights and biases of all neurons in all layers simultaneously.  Because there are multiple inputs and (potentially) multiple network outputs, we really need general rules for the derivative of a function with respect to a vector and even rules for the derivative of a vector-valued function with respect to a vector.</p>

<p>This article walks through the derivation of some important rules for computing partial derivatives with respect to vectors, particularly those useful for training neural networks. This field is known as <i>matrix calculus</i>, and the good news is, we only need a small subset of that field, which we introduce here.  While there is a lot of online material on multivariate calculus and linear algebra, they are typically taught as two separate undergraduate courses so most material treats them in isolation.  The pages that do discuss matrix calculus often are really just lists of rules with minimal explanation or are just pieces of the story. They also tend to be quite obscure to all but a narrow audience of mathematicians, thanks to their use of dense notation and minimal discussion of foundational concepts. (See the annotated list of resources at the end.)</p>

<p>In contrast, we're going to rederive and rediscover some key matrix calculus rules in an effort to explain them. It turns out that matrix calculus is really not that hard! There aren't dozens of new rules to learn; just a couple of key concepts.  Our hope is that this short paper will get you started quickly in the world of matrix calculus as it relates to training neural networks. We're assuming you're already familiar with the basics of neural network architecture and training. If you're not, head over to <a href="http://course.fast.ai/">Jeremy's course</a> and complete part 1 of that, then we'll see you back here when you're done. (Note that, unlike many more academic approaches, we strongly suggest <i>first</i> learning to train and use neural networks in practice and <i>then</i> study the underlying math. The math will be much more understandable with the context in place; besides, it's not necessary to grok all this calculus to become an effective practitioner.)</p>

<p><i>A note on notation</i>: Jeremy's course exclusively uses code, instead of math notation, to explain concepts since unfamiliar functions in code are easy to search for and experiment with. In this paper, we do the opposite: there is a lot of math notation because one of the goals of this paper is to help you understand the notation that you'll see in deep learning papers and books. At the <a href="#notation">end of the paper</a>, you'll find a brief table of the notation used, including a word or phrase you can use to search for more details.</p>

<p>There are other rules for trigonometry, exponentials, etc., which you can find at <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-calculus">Khan Academy differential calculus course</a>.</p>

<p>When a function has a single parameter, <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-50BBD36E1FD2333108437A2CA378BE62-depth003.25.svg">, you'll often see <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-6BDA8AF54C40BC23ED858E9E9F5C11D2-depth002.72.svg"> and <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-74CAF4D1EC90D3A36EA7C7BBFE65B516-depth003.25.svg"> used as shorthands for <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-5BA9D16419154B1BDBECA39D99E8E809-depth004.58.svg">. We recommend against this notation as it does not make clear the variable we're taking the derivative with respect to. </p>

<p>You can think of <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-624FEBB9A49A3FC96353C861D175C806-depth004.58.svg"> as an operator that maps a function of one parameter to another function.  That means that <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-EC0CEC5F9488EC510F8D688E7003222D-depth004.58.svg"> maps <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-50BBD36E1FD2333108437A2CA378BE62-depth003.25.svg"> to its derivative with respect to <span>x</span>, which is the same thing as <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-07A5EA519C4CEA1A3539E3A7FC289163-depth004.58.svg">. Also, if <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-FD91C508F91C2C84498680BD337C1D7A-depth003.25.svg">, then <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-B1ED3CF9BA4D6F25A5A4F481C45EC658-depth004.58.svg">. Thinking of the derivative as an operator helps to simplify complicated derivatives because the operator is distributive and lets us pull out constants. For example, in the following equation, we can pull out the constant 9 and distribute the derivative operator across the elements within the parentheses.</p>
<p><img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/blkeqn-A1EC7F214318E08949CC8BFCED138D94.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>That procedure reduced the derivative of <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-FDFD125C741CD062B2CA779DDE0524BE-depth003.25.svg"> to a bit of arithmetic and the derivatives of <span>x</span> and <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-32F5240D0DBF2CCBE75EF7F8EF2015E0-depth000.14.svg">, which are much easier to solve than the original derivative.</p>


<h2 id="sec3">Introduction to vector calculus and partial derivatives</h2>


<p>Neural network layers are not single functions of a single parameter, <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-50BBD36E1FD2333108437A2CA378BE62-depth003.25.svg">. So, let's move on to functions of multiple parameters such as <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-3BAF1600AE50930A155F58AE172B51BD-depth003.25.svg">. For example, what is the derivative of <span>xy</span> (i.e., the multiplication of <span>x</span> and <span>y</span>)? In other words, how does the product <span>xy</span> change when we wiggle the variables? Well, it depends on whether we are changing <span>x</span> or <span>y</span>.  We compute derivatives with respect to one variable (parameter) at a time, giving us two different <i>partial derivatives</i> for this two-parameter function (one for <span>x</span> and one for <span>y</span>).  Instead of using operator <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-624FEBB9A49A3FC96353C861D175C806-depth004.58.svg">, the partial derivative operator is  <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-4D6C379F66675645B3FFE28A15306857-depth004.67.svg"> (a stylized <span>d</span> and not the Greek letter <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-77A3B715842B45E440A5BEE15357AD29-depth000.22.svg">). So, <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-08DCCFBE629A14FCCD9FB9A20F2E367C-depth004.67.svg"> and <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-1FDCF7A9F137AE48FA25EE34A69F8201-depth006.34.svg"> are the partial derivatives of <span>xy</span>; often, these are just called the <i>partials</i>.  For functions of a single parameter, operator <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-4D6C379F66675645B3FFE28A15306857-depth004.67.svg"> is equivalent to <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-624FEBB9A49A3FC96353C861D175C806-depth004.58.svg"> (for sufficiently smooth functions). However, it's better to use <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-624FEBB9A49A3FC96353C861D175C806-depth004.58.svg"> to make it clear you're referring to a scalar derivative.</p>

<p>The partial derivative with respect to <span>x</span> is just the usual scalar derivative, simply treating any other variable in the equation as a constant.  Consider function <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-D6DEAE7E403381C2C425D4B40CCA936E-depth003.25.svg">. The partial derivative with respect to <span>x</span> is written <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-F063B8EC812DF3D204F9327F5D094073-depth004.67.svg">. There are three constants from the perspective of <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-4D6C379F66675645B3FFE28A15306857-depth004.67.svg">: 3, 2, and <span>y</span>. Therefore, <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-D981BA4BD14AC44C43A4E4E0EC750B4A-depth004.67.svg">. The partial derivative with respect to <span>y</span> treats <span>x</span> like a constant: <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-55A3A400FAD3326FEF1BB9DDD2658383-depth006.34.svg">.  It's a good idea to derive these yourself before continuing otherwise the rest of the article won't make sense.  Here's the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/multivariable-derivatives/partial-derivative-and-gradient-articles/a/introduction-to-partial-derivatives">Khan Academy video on partials</a> if you need help.</p>

<p>To make it clear we are doing vector calculus and not just multivariate calculus, let's consider what we do with the partial derivatives <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-84D799755A7F73945BD58B2E057121AB-depth004.67.svg"> and <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-A2DE2EC029172B84A0A0E8A8D00F5A6F-depth006.34.svg"> (another way to say <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-75645E70B6C95F7466C353E9C2306FE0-depth004.67.svg"> and <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-B20FF70C037320C2D0B710F4B592927E-depth006.34.svg">) that we computed for <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-D6DEAE7E403381C2C425D4B40CCA936E-depth003.25.svg">.  Instead of having them just floating around and not organized in any way, let's organize them into a horizontal vector. We call this vector the <i>gradient</i> of <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-3BAF1600AE50930A155F58AE172B51BD-depth003.25.svg"> and …</p></div>

		<p>Dear New Developer,</p>
<p>Congratulations! Let’s take a moment to celebrate the decision you’ve made to launch or redirect your career. What lies ahead is a lot of hard work, satisfaction, the occasional desire to throw your laptop out a window, and a ton of learning. That’s true of most professions, so you’re also in good company.</p>
<p>As a developer, you will solve a thousand puzzles, and then a thousand more. Your brain will stretch and grow. You will dream about databases or pixels or curly braces. I once had a dream where I was walking down a hallway, but the hallway <em>was my code</em>. It was a good dream. I found a bug.</p>
<p>Greg LeMond, a pro cyclist and three-time Tour de France winner, once said something about cycling that I want to share with you: <img data-attachment-id="6422" data-permalink="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2020/04/27/it-never-gets-easier-you-just-go-faster/lemond/" data-orig-file="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png" data-orig-size="355,239" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="lemond" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png?w=355" src="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png?w=1100" alt="lemond" srcset="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png 355w, https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png?w=150 150w, https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px"></p>
<p>“It never gets easier, you just go faster.”</p>
<p>In so many ways, that describes a career in software. The puzzles you struggle with today will be easy in a month or a year. You’ll learn new patterns and best practices. Then you’ll take on new, harder challenges. You’ll struggle with those and learn and grow. Then you’ll start the cycle (pun intended) all over again.</p>
<p>Something I’ll add, though, is that you’ll be able to approach later challenges with more experience and confidence. What we bring to our jobs is an accumulation of skills and experience. This isn’t linear. It sometimes goes smoothly, sometimes it’s faster than we imagine possible. Then there are stretches where it feels like we’re clambering around in the dark.</p>
<p>For instance, I was once asked to write a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Application_Protocol">WAP</a> application (think super early mobile apps before smart phones existed). I had absolutely no idea what I was doing and I was mostly left alone on the project. I started by drawing some screens, took a deep breath, and started building. It was really tough going, but so many lessons have stuck with me from that experience. My skills at breaking down challenges and approaching them bit by bit really improved. I became comfortable throwing away code because the first code I wrote was atrocious. Plus, the project was eventually canceled, which was entirely the right business decision. Through that, I learned about evaluating tradeoffs in terms of business value—my time was better spent on higher priority projects.</p>
<p>In my current adventure, nearly 20 years later, I’m once again writing a mobile app and applying all of those lessons. Picking up languages and frameworks that I haven’t used before is far less daunting. Ensuring that I’m working on the most important thing is a constant recalibration, but one that is comfortable now. Working through stumbling blocks one at a time and having patterns for getting through them is second nature.</p>
<p>Just like learning isn’t linear, neither are careers. Your path will be your own. What you are doing today may or may not be what you’re doing in ten years. You might go into any number of other areas in software, or stay the course as a developer. It’s your life and all those choices are equally valid. One of my former colleagues quit to make hand-built microphones; another makes goat cheese in the Catalan Pyrenees. My personal philosophy is that at each opportunity to make a career decision, you should pick the direction that interests you most. Just like you learn faster when you are interested in your subject, you will ship better software (or make better cheese) when you are interested in your job.</p>
<p>There’s much more I’d love to tell you, but this letter is growing long. I’ll add some concise tidbits before I end.</p>
<ul>
<li>You belong here. Try not to doubt that.</li>
<li>Get really good at debugging. It’s a skill and you will need it.</li>
<li>If you don’t respect your boss, or if they don’t respect you back, go find a new one.</li>
<li>Learning is part of your job. Make time for it.</li>
<li>Don’t be afraid to put your code in production.</li>
<li>Be a good team member. You will accomplish more and learn faster.</li>
<li>Ask lots of questions. Someone else probably wants to hear the answer.</li>
<li>And finally, have fun! You’ve got this!</li>
</ul>
<p>I wish you all the luck in the world!</p>

		<p><em>If you enjoy this article, please check out my free book by clicking <a href="https://deponysum.com/2020/03/30/something-to-read-in-quarantine-essays-2018-to-2020/">Here: “Something to Read in Quarantine: Essays 2018-2020.”</a></em></p>
<p id="b9a9">Natural Language Processing (NLP) per Wikipedia:</p>
<p id="34cf">“Is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.”</p>
<p id="7dd8">The field has seen tremendous advances during the recent explosion of progress in machine learning techniques.</p>
<p id="b5f8">Here are some of its more impressive recent achievements:</p>
<p id="cb15"><strong>A)</strong>&nbsp;The Winograd Schema is a test of common sense reasoning- easy for humans, but historically almost impossible for computers- which requires the test taker to indicate which noun an ambiguous pronoun stands for. The correct answer hinges on a single word, which is different between two separate versions of the question. For example:</p>
<p id="512d"><em>The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they feared violence.</em></p>
<p id="ece3"><em>The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they advocated violence.</em></p>
<p id="0ddf">Who does the pronoun “They” refer to in each of the instances?</p>
<p id="d33c">The Winograd schema test was originally intended to be a more rigorous replacement for the Turing test, because it seems to require deep knowledge of how things fit together in the world, and the ability to reason about that knowledge in a linguistic context. Recent advances in NLP have allowed computers to achieve near human scores:(<a href="https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard/</a>).</p>
<p id="0a43"><strong>B)</strong>&nbsp;The New York Regent’s science exam is a test requiring both scientific knowledge and reasoning skills, covering an extremely broad range of topics. Some of the questions include:</p>
<p id="a36d"><em>1.Which equipment will best separate a mixture of iron filings and black pepper? (1) magnet (2) filter paper (3) triplebeam balance (4) voltmeter</em></p>
<p id="9797"><em>2. Which form of energy is produced when a rubber band vibrates? (1) chemical (2) light (3) electrical (4) sound</em></p>
<p id="966a"><em>3. Because copper is a metal, it is (1) liquid at room temperature (2) nonreactive with other substances (3) a poor conductor of electricity (4) a good conductor of heat</em></p>
<p id="6d70"><em>4. Which process in an apple tree primarily results from cell division? (1) growth (2) photosynthesis (3) gas exchange (4) waste removal</em></p>
<p id="3a8a">On the 8th grade, non-diagram based questions of the test, a program was recently able to score 90%. (&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01958.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01958.pdf</a>&nbsp;)</p>
<p id="2f49"><strong>C)</strong></p>
<p id="267a">It’s not just about answer selection either. Progress in text generation has been impressive. See, for example, some of the text samples created by Megatron:&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08053.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08053.pdf</a></p>
<p id="b8f7"><strong>2.</strong></p>
<p id="db13">Much of this progress has been rapid. Big progress on the Winograd schema, for example, still looked like it might be decades away back in (from memory) much of 2018. The computer science is advancing very fast, but it’s not clear our concepts have kept up.</p>
<p id="1a6c">I found this relatively sudden progress in NLP surprising. In my head- and maybe this was naive- I had thought that, in order to attempt these sorts of tasks with any facility, it wouldn’t be sufficient to simply feed a computer lots of text. Instead, any “proper” attempt to understand language would have to integrate different modalities of experience and understanding, like visual and auditory, in order to build up a full picture of how things relate to each other in the world. Only on the basis of this extra-linguistic grounding could it deal flexibly with problems involving rich meanings- we might call this the multi-modality thesis. Whether the multi-modality thesis is true for some kinds of problems or not, it’s certainly true for far fewer problems than I, and many others, had suspected.</p>
<p id="5a4d">I think science-fictiony speculations generally backed me up on this (false) hunch. Most people imagined that this kind of high-level language “understanding” would be the capstone of AI research, the thing that comes after the program already has a sophisticated extra-linguistic model of the world. This sort of just seemed obvious- a great example of how assumptions you didn’t even know you were making can ruin attempts to predict the future.</p>
<p id="f943">In hindsight it makes a certain sense that reams and reams of text alone can be used to build the capabilities needed to answer questions like these. A lot of people remind us that these programs are really just statistical analyses of the co-occurence of words, however complex and glorified. However we should not forget that the relationships between words are isomorphic to the relations between things- that isomorphism is why language works. This is to say the patterns in language use mirror the patterns of how things are(1). Models are transitive- if x models y, and y models z, then x models z. The upshot of these facts are that if you have a really good statistical model of how words relate to each other, that model is also implicitly a model of the world.</p>
<p id="12db">It might be instructive to think about what it would take to create a program which has a model of eighth grade science sufficient to understand and answer questions about hundreds of different things like “growth is driven by cell division”, and “What can magnets be used for” that wasn’t NLP led. It would be a nightmare of many different (probably handcrafted) models. Speaking somewhat loosely, language allows for intellectual capacities to be greatly compressed. From this point of view, it shouldn’t be surprising that some of the first signs of really broad capacity- common sense reasoning, wide ranging problem solving etc., have been found in language based programs- words and their relationships are just a vastly more efficient way of representing knowledge than the alternatives.</p>
<p id="1e8b">So I find myself wondering if language is not the crown of general intelligence, but a potential shortcut to it.</p>
<p id="beea"><strong>3.</strong></p>
<p id="0095">A couple of weeks ago I finished this essay, read through it, and decided it was not good enough to publish. The point about language being isomorphic to the world, and that therefore any sufficiently good model of language&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a model of the world, is important, but it’s kind of abstract, and far from original.</p>
<p id="e0e2">Then today I read&nbsp;<a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/01/06/a-very-unlikely-chess-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this report</a>&nbsp;by Scott Alexander of having trained GPT-2 (a language program) to play chess. I realised this was the perfect example. GPT-2 has no (visual) understanding of things like the arrangement of a chess board. But if you feed it enough sequences of alphanumerically encoded games- 1.Kt-f3, d5 and so on- it begins to understand patterns in these strings of characters which are isomorphic to chess itself. Thus, for all intents and purposes, it develops a model of chess.</p>
<p id="1a14">Exactly how strong this approach is- whether GPT-2 is capable of some limited analysis, or can only overfit openings- remains to be seen. We might have a better idea as it is optimised — for example, once it is fed board states instead of sequences of moves. Either way though, it illustrates the point about isomorphism.</p>
<p id="a87a">Of course everyday language stands in a woolier relation to sheep, pine cones, desire and quarks than the formal language of chess moves stands in relation to chess moves, and the patterns are far more complex. Modality, uncertainty, vagueness and other complexities enter but the isomorphism between world and language is there, even if inexact.</p>
<p id="b6c0"><strong>Postscript- The Chinese Room Argument</strong></p>
<p id="f901">After similar arguments are made, someone usually mentions the Chinese room thought experiment. There are, I think, two useful things to say about it:</p>
<p id="3d7e">A) The thought experiment is an argument about understanding in itself, separate from capacity to handle tasks, a difficult thing to quantify or understand. It’s unclear that there is a practical upshot for what <em>AI can actually do.</em></p>
<p id="1f79">B) A lot of the power of the thought experiment hinges on the fact that the room solves questions using a lookup table, this stacks the deck. Perhaps we be more willing to say that the room as a whole understood language if it formed an (implicit) model of how things are, and of the current context, and used those models to answer questions? Even if this doesn’t deal with all the intuition that the room cannot understand Chinese, I think it takes a bite from it.</p>
<p id="96a9">— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —</p>
<p id="4642">(1)- Strictly of course only the patterns in true sentences mirror, or are isomorphic to, the arrangement of the world, but most sentences people utter are at least approximately true.</p>

– Tim Rocktäschel, 30/04/2018 – <i>updated 02/05/2018</i>
</p>

<p>
When talking to colleagues I realized that not everyone knows about <i>einsum</i>, my favorite function for developing deep learning models. 
This post is trying to change that once and for all! :)
Einstein summation (einsum) is implemented in <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.einsum.html">numpy</a>, as well as deep learning libraries such as <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/einsum">TensorFlow</a> and, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/6307">Thomas Viehmann</a>, recently also <a href="http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torch.html?highlight=torch%20max#torch.einsum">PyTorch</a>. 
For background reading on einsum, I recommend the excellent blog posts by <a href="https://obilaniu6266h16.wordpress.com/2016/02/04/einstein-summation-in-numpy/">Olexa Bilaniuk</a> and <a href="http://ajcr.net/Basic-guide-to-einsum/">Alex Riley</a>.
While their posts discuss einsum in the context of numpy, I am going to illustrate how einsum is extremely useful for writing elegant PyTorch/TensorFlow models.<sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
</p>
<div id="outline-container-orge7a71ce">
<h2 id="orge7a71ce"><span>1</span> Einsum Notation<sup><a id="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup></h2>
<div id="text-1">
<p>
If you are anything like me, you find it difficult to remember the names and signatures of all the different functions in PyTorch/TensorFlow for calculating dot products, outer products, transposes and matrix-vector or matrix-matrix multiplications. 
Einsum notation is an elegant way to express all of these, as well as complex operations on tensors, using essentially a domain-specific language.  
This has benefits beyond not having to memorize or regularly looking up specific library functions.
Once you understand and make use of einsum, you will be able to write more concise and efficient code more quickly.
When not using einsum it is easy to introduce unnecessary reshaping and transposing of tensors, as well as intermediate tensors that could be omitted.
Furthermore, domain-specific languages like einsum can sometimes be compiled to high-performing code, and an einsum-like domain-specific language is in fact the basis for the recently introduced <a href="http://pytorch.org/2018/03/05/tensor-comprehensions.html">Tensor Comprehensions</a><sup><a id="fnr.3" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> in PyTorch which automatically generate GPU code and auto-tune that code for specific input sizes. 
In addition, projects like <a href="https://github.com/dgasmith/opt_einsum">opt einsum</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Bihaqo/tf_einsum_opt">tf einsum opt</a> can be used to optimize tensor contraction order of einsum expressions.<sup><a id="fnr.4" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Let's say we want to multiply two matrices \({\color{red}\mathbf{A}}\in\mathbb{R}^{I\,\times\,K}\) and \({\color{blue}\mathbf{B}}\in\mathbb{R}^{K\,\times\,J}\) followed by calculating the sum of each column resulting in a vector \({\color{green}\mathbf{c}}\in\mathbb{R}^{J}\).
Using Einstein summation notation, we can write this as
\[
{\color{green}c_j} = \sum_i\sum_k {\color{red}A_{ik}}{\color{blue}B_{kj}} = {\color{red}A_{ik}}{\color{blue}B_{kj}}
\]
which specifies how all individual elements \({\color{green}c_i}\) in \(\color{green}\mathbf{c}\) are calculated from multiplying values in the column vectors \(\color{red}\mathbf{A}_{i:}\) and row vectors \(\color{blue}\mathbf{B}_{:j}\) and summing them up.
Note that for Einstein notation, the summation Sigmas can be dropped as we implicitly sum over repeated indices (\(k\) in this example) and indices not mentioned in the output specification (\(i\) in this example).
So far so good, but we can also express more basic operations using einsum. For instance, calculating the dot product of two vectors \({\color{red}\mathbf{a}},{\color{blue}\mathbf{b}}\in\mathbb{R}^I\) can be written as
\[
{\color{green}c} = \sum_i {\color{red}a_i}{\color{blue}b_i} = {\color{red}a_i}{\color{blue}b_i}.
\] 
A problem that I encounter often in deep learning is applying a transformation to vectors in a higher-order tensor. For example, I might have a tensor that contains $T$-long sequences of $K$-dimensional word vectors for \(N\) training examples in a batch and I want to project the word vectors to a different dimension \(Q\).
Let \({\color{red}\mathcal{T}}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\,\times\,T\times\,K}\) be an order-3 tensor where the first dimension corresponds to the batch, the second dimension to the sequence length, and the last dimension to the word vectors. 
In addition, let \({\color{blue}\mathbf{W}}\in\mathbb{R}^{K\,\times\,Q}\) be a projection matrix. The desired computation can be expressed using einsum
\[
{\color{green}C_{ntq}} = \sum_k {\color{red}T_{ntk}}{\color{blue}W_{kq}} = {\color{red}T_{ntk}}{\color{blue}W_{kq}}.
\]
As a final example, say you are given an order-4 tensor \({\color{red}\mathcal{T}}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\,\times\,T\times\,K\,\times\,M}\) and you are supposed to project vectors in the 3rd dimension to \(Q\) using the projection matrix from before. However, let's say I also ask you to sum over the 2nd dimension and transpose the first and last dimension in the result, yielding a tensor \({\color{green}\mathcal{C}}\in\mathbb{R}^{M\,\times,Q\times\,N}\).<sup><a id="fnr.5" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup> Einsum to the rescue! 
\[
{\color{green}C_{mqn}} = \sum_t\sum_k {\color{red}T_{ntkm}}{\color{blue}W_{kq}} = {\color{red}T_{ntkm}}{\color{blue}W_{kq}}.
\]
Note that transposing the result of the tensor contraction is achieved by swapping \(n\) with \(m\) (\({\color{green}C_{mqn}}\) instead of \({\color{green}C_{nqm}}\)).

<div id="outline-container-orgcd1f902">
<h2 id="orgcd1f902"><span>2</span> All you Need: Einsum in numpy, PyTorch, and TensorFlow</h2>
<div id="text-2">
<p>
Einsum is implemented in <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.einsum.html">numpy</a> via <code>np.einsum</code>, in <a href="http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torch.html?highlight=torch%20max#torch.einsum">PyTorch</a> via <code>torch.einsum</code>, and in <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/einsum">TensorFlow</a> via <code>tf.einsum</code>.<sup><a id="fnr.6" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup> All three einsum functions share the same signature <code>einsum(equation,operands)</code> where <code>equation</code> is a string representing the Einstein summation and <code>operands</code> is a sequence of tensors.<sup><a id="fnr.7" href="#fn.7">7</a></sup>
The examples above can all be written using an equation string. 
For instance, our first example \({\color{green}c_j} = \sum_i\sum_k {\color{red}A_{ik}}{\color{blue}B_{kj}}\) can be written as the equation string "\({\color{red}ik},{\color{blue}kj}\) -&gt; \({\color{green}j}\)". 
Note that the naming of the indices (\(i\), \(j\), \(k\)) is arbitrary but it needs to be used consistently. 
</p>

<p>
What's great about having einsum not only in numpy but also in PyTorch and TensorFlow is that it can be used in arbitrary computation graphs for neural network architectures and that we can backpropagate through it.
A typical call to einsum has the following form
\[
{\color{green}\textbf{result}} = \text{einsum}("{\color{red}\square\square},{\color{purple}\square\square\square},{\color{blue}\square\square}\,\text{-&gt;}\,{\color{green}\square\square}", {\color{red}\text{arg1}}, {\color{purple}\text{arg2}}, {\color{blue}\text{arg3}})
\]
where \(\square\) is a placeholder for a character identifying a tensor dimension.
From this equation string we can infer that \({\color{red}\text{arg1}}\) and \({\color{blue}\text{arg3}}\) are matrices, \({\color{purple}\text{arg2}}\) is an order-3 tensor, and that the \({\color{green}\textbf{result}}\) of this einsum operation is a matrix.
Note that einsum works with a variable number of inputs.
In the example above, einsum specifies an operation on three arguments, but it can also be used for operations involving one, two or more than three arguments.
Einsum is best learned by studying examples, so let's go through some examples for einsum in PyTorch that correspond to library functions which are used in many deep learning models.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hi everybody, happy Friday! I am Aaron Klotz, a Staff Software Engineer on the GeckoView team at Mozilla Corporation.</p>
<p>I have worked at Mozilla since the fall of 2012 and have worked on three different teams across that time: Performance, Platform Integration &amp; Security Hardening, and finally GeckoView.</p>
<p>Given the recent news about layoffs, I thought it might be cathartic to do an AMA to share my experiences at Mozilla and try to set the record straight the best that I can. I would not dare try this in other forums, but since the Tildes community is capable of civil discussion, I'll do it here! I provided some proof a long time ago when I first joined Tildes, and I'd like to think that many people in this community are willing to vouch for me at this point, but if you want more, I can add it.</p>
<p>Obviously I cannot discuss issues that are covered by my NDA (but fortunately most issues are <em>not</em> covered), and some details I might want to avoid out of sensitivity for people who were laid off. AMAA!</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 1:</strong> Also to make clear (if it wasn't obvious): These opinions are mine and mine alone, do not reflect the opinion of any Mozilla entity, etc. etc.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> I'm logging off for the night, but I'll try to follow up throughout the weekend if I have time. Thanks for all the questions! Hopefully I've cleared up some things for you!</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 3:</strong> Okay, I think I've gone through the other questions asked over the weekend, but I'm going to stop now! Thanks for your interest! Now, I've got a mobile browser to help build!</p>

	<p>The <a href="https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/">Trunk Based Development website</a> says “[…] a source-control branching model, where developers collaborate on code in a single branch called “trunk” and resist any pressure to create other long-lived development branches by employing documented techniques. They therefore avoid merge hell, do not break the build, and live happily ever after.”</p>
<p>That sounds great… but what exactly is it, and why should you care about it? For a bit, let’s forget about code and branches and use an analogy that is easier to understand — the transit system of a city.</p>

<h4>When is the next train?</h4>
<p>Imagine a city with lots of different train stations. The network can run using lots of trains at different frequencies. Let’s consider three different scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>A train passes through each station once every day</li>
<li>Trains pass through each station six times every day</li>
<li>Trains pass through each station a hundred times every day</li>
</ul>

<p>What will be the effect of the three different possibilities on the people living in the city?</p>
<p><b>In the first case</b>, if a person misses the train there is no other way to reach the destination until the next train, which unfortunately will arrive on the next day.</p>
<p><b>In the second case</b>, if a person misses one train they can catch another train in a few hours and won’t have to wait for an entire day to reach their destination. This means people don’t care about the schedule of the trains as much as they do in the first case. It is possible to reach the destination in a few hours — late, but possible.</p>
<p><b>In the last case</b>, if a person misses a train they can easily catch another train in a few minutes. It’s easy to imagine that people will stop caring about the train schedule altogether and focus on what they want to do at the destination. The transit system becomes an artifact that recedes in the background, letting people concentrate on what they actually want to do — living their lives and getting things done!</p>
<p>Now let’s go back to building and delivering software.</p>

<h4>Feature-driven delivery a.k.a. Unpredictability</h4>
<p>In a lot of teams, the frequency of releases is determined by “when this Important List of Features gets done”. That leads to unpredictable releases with large delays between deployments. Although such teams try to “fix” a release date and try to cut scope so that the Very Important Date can be met, it rarely works.</p>
<p>Engineers working on different feature branches rush to get their tasks done before The Date. Merging all of those feature branches becomes a painful ritual as people discover all sorts of changes that have happened in the repository over the past few weeks that they were working on their own branch. Merge meetings are scheduled and a War Room is created to tackle issues that stand in the way of meeting The Date. Inevitable, The Date starts to move. Seven “medium priority” bugs that customers have been complaining about need to be fixed. The CEO’s personal favourite feature request has to be part of this release even though the team heard of it a week ago.</p>
<p>Every little thing is important because who knows when the next release will go out? The entire team — nay the org — rallies around The Date even though it has changed three times and the original date has been forgotten.</p>
<p>There are some themes that emerge in this familiar scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Merge hell</b>, as discussed above, since multiple, long-running feature branches become part of the primary codebase very close to The Date.</li>
<li><b>Massive changesets</b> to review, or what happens in reality, no code review at all. Reviewing a three-thousand line diff that has been worked on for two weeks is an exercise in frustration.</li>
<li><b>Favouring the Rockstar Programmer</b> over the team, since it is considered acceptable and natural that a great engineer will disappear for a few days or weeks, and come back with all the work done in a branch far, far away from the rest of the codebase. Merging is the team’s collective problem, unfortunately.</li>
<li><b>Emotional turmoil</b> and a high probability of burnout for everyone in the team especially as The Date inches closer.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what is the solution to this problem? We need to increase the frequency of the trains, of course. Hundreds of them every day!</p>

<h4>Timeline-driven Delivery a.k.a. Daily Success</h4>
<p>For software engineering, that implies…</p>
<ul>
<li>We increase the frequency of production releases to as frequent as possible — daily, or even hourly!</li>
<li>We drastically reduce the size of changes that are merged into the trunk. As each merge request becomes small, reviewing it becomes far easier.</li>
<li>Since each merge integrates only a small number of changes, the possibility of conflicts also rapidly goes down. When conflicts do happen, resolving them is fast and painless.</li>
<li>Changes arrive into the codebase on a daily basis, which means the team is aware of the state of work that is in progress. Any impact from the changes being done is felt very early in the process, giving the team ample time to reach a resolution.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this sounds great in theory and it makes sense. How about in practice?</p>
<ul>
<li>TBD promotes <b>short-lived feature branches</b> and frequent merges with the trunk. A branch usually has only one developer, it doesn’t last more than a day or two before it gets merged into the trunk.</li>
<li>This automatically pushes teams towards <b>Continuous Integration</b>. Every commit that lands on the trunk goes through the CI pipeline, confirming that it is indeed ready for integration.</li>
<li>Once continuous integration is in place, it is natural to follow it up with <b>Continuous Delivery</b>. Since all commits that land on trunk have been marked “stable” by the CI pipeline, they can be deployed immediately.</li>
<li>Since an approved code review means the code will be available on trunk immediately, <b>teams rally together to review code</b> as fast and as many times as possible.</li>
<li>Not everything can be done within a day, and features can take a long time to build. In those cases, <b>work-in-progress code is “hidden” behind a feature flag</b>. Flags ensure that incomplete features can be reviewed and still land on the trunk.</li>
<li>Flags can also <b>act as a remote control</b> for making features available at a later time. Features can be fully developed and be part of the codebase, and then be remotely toggled on (or off). Once a feature has been “enabled”, the alternative code path and flags can be deleted from the codebase.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this comes together to ensure the codebase is releasable on demand. Bug fixes are deployed as soon as the fix is available on the trunk. Teams stop coordinating releases to figure out which commits are “safe” to release.</p>
<p>Developers go back to focusing on what is important — building features and eliminating bugs — rather than being burdened with a release date.</p>

August 16, 2020 | https://wimvanderbauwhede.github.io/articles/function-types/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wimvanderbauwhede.github.io/articles/function-types/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content" itemprop="articleBody">
				<p>This article builds on my earlier articles on <a href="https://wimvanderbauwhede.github.io/articles/roles-as-adts-in-raku/">algebraic data types</a> in on <a href="https://raku.org/">Raku</a> and their use in the practical example of <a href="https://wimvanderbauwhede.github.io/articles/list-based-parser-combinators/">list-based parser combinators</a>. </p>

<p>In this article I want to look at function types in some detail, and show a way to create well typed functions in Raku. If you are not familiar with functional programming (or with <a href="https://raku.org/">Raku</a>), I suggest you read my introduction <a href="https://wimvanderbauwhede.github.io/articles/decluttering-with-functional-programming/">"Cleaner code with functional programming"</a>. If you are not familiar with algebraic data types, you might want to read the other two articles as well. For most of the article, I provide examples in Raku, Python, Rust and Haskell. There is also some C and even some Fortran. </p>

<h2>Type signatures</h2>

<p>A function's type signature consists of the types of each of its arguments and the return type. In most typed languages, the type is part of the function signature. </p>

<p>For example in C</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span></span><span>int</span> <span>sqsum</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>,</span><span>int</span><span>);</span>

<span>int</span> <span>sqsum</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span><span>+</span><span>y</span><span>*</span><span>y</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>or in Fortran</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fortran"><span></span><span>integer </span><span>function </span><span>sqsum</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span><span>y</span><span>)</span>
    <span>integer</span> <span>::</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span><span>y</span>
    <span>sqsum</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span><span>+</span><span>y</span><span>*</span><span>y</span>
<span>end function</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>or in Rust</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span></span><span>fn</span> <span>sqsum</span><span>((</span><span>x</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span>)</span>: <span>(</span><span>i32</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>i32</span><span>))</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>i32</span> <span>{</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span><span>+</span><span>y</span><span>*</span><span>y</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span></span>

<span>let</span><span> </span><span>sqsum</span><span>  </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>|</span><span>x</span><span> </span>: <span>i32</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>y</span>: <span>i32</span><span>|</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>i32</span> <span>{</span><span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span><span>+</span><span>y</span><span>*</span><span>y</span><span>};</span><span></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>or in Raku</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>sub</span> <span>sqsum</span>(<span>Int</span>, <span>Int</span> --&gt; <span>Int</span>) {...}
<span>sub</span> <span>sqsum</span>(<span>Int</span> \<span>x</span>, <span>Int</span> \<span>y</span> --&gt; <span>Int</span>) { <span>x*x+</span><span>y</span><span>*</span><span>y</span> }

<span>my</span> <span>&amp;sqsum</span> = <span>sub</span> (<span>Int</span> \<span>x</span>, <span>Int</span> \<span>y</span> --&gt; <span>Int</span>) { <span>x*x+</span><span>y</span><span>*</span><span>y</span> };
</code></pre></div>
<p>or in Python, using the <code>typing</code> module:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Callable</span>

<span>def</span> <span>sqsum_</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span><span>:</span>  
    <span>return</span> <span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span><span>+</span><span>y</span><span>*</span><span>y</span>

<span>sqsum</span> <span>:</span> <span>Callable</span><span>[[</span><span>int</span><span>,</span><span>int</span><span>],</span> <span>int</span><span>]</span>  <span>=</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span><span>y</span> <span>:</span> <span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span><span>+</span><span>y</span><span>*</span><span>y</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>The type of a function of functions</h2>

<p>But what happens if we want to provide a function argument that is itself a function, or return a function (so-called <em>higher-order functions</em>)?</p>

<p>This is possible in most languages, but what I am interested in is the type information: what is the type signature of such a function of functions?</p>

<p>C supports functions-of-functions indirectly through function pointers, by creating a function type through a <code>typedef</code>. </p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C"><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>int</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>Fun</span><span>)(</span><span>int</span><span>,</span><span>int</span><span>);</span>

<span>int</span> <span>ten_times</span> <span>(</span><span>Fun</span> <span>f</span><span>)</span> <span>{...};</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Maybe surprisingly, venerable old Fortran does support passing functions and subroutines as arguments. Functions are typed by their return type; subroutines are not typed. </p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fortran"><span></span><span>program </span><span>fof</span> 
    <span>external</span> <span>::</span> <span>sqsum</span>
    <span>call </span><span>ten_times</span><span>(</span><span>sqsum</span><span>)</span>
<span>end program </span><span>fof</span>

<span>subroutine </span><span>ten_times</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>)</span>
    <span>integer</span> <span>::</span> <span>f</span>
    <span>! ...</span>
<span>end subroutine </span><span>ten_times</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In Rust you can provide the complete type of a function-as-argument: </p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span></span><span>fn</span> <span>ten_times</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>f</span>: <span>F</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>where</span><span> </span><span>F</span>: <span>Fn</span><span>(</span><span>i32</span><span>,</span><span>i32</span><span>)</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>i32</span> <span>{</span><span></span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span><span></span>

<span>ten_times</span><span>(</span><span>sqsum</span><span>);</span><span></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In Python we can use <code>Callable</code>, which also allow for the complete type to be expressed.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Callable</span>

<span>def</span> <span>ten_times</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>Callable</span><span>[[</span><span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>],</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
<span># ...</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The same example in Raku becomes</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>sub</span> <span>ten_times</span> (<span>Sub</span> \<span>f:</span>(<span>Int</span>,<span>Int</span> --&gt; <span>Int</span>)) {
<span>#...</span>
}

<span>ten_times</span>(<span>sqsum</span>);
</code></pre></div>
<p>So we can also pass the complete type. An equivalent way to write this is using the <code>&amp;</code> sigil <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/variables#index-entry-sigil_&amp;">which imposes the <code>Callable</code> type constraint</a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>sub</span> <span>ten_times</span> (<span>&amp;f:</span>(<span>Int</span>,<span>Int</span> --&gt; <span>Int</span>)) {
<span>#...</span>
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>The types can be nested too, e.g. <code>((Int, Int --&gt; Int), (Int, Int --&gt; Int) --&gt; Int))</code> is a valid type signature.</p>

<h2>Introducing the arrow</h2>

<p>All of the above ways to express function type signatures are perfectly adequate in their respective languages. However, with the exception of Raku, they all share the problem that these function-of-function type signatures don't compose very well: what if we want to write a function-of-function-of-function type? This is less far-fetched than it may seem.
I would like to introduce a notation used in type theory. It is at the same time simple and powerful. If you are familiar with functional languages like Haskell, Idris or Agda, you already know it. </p>

<p>Instead of mixing the type with the function declaration, it is written separately. The name of the function is followed by a colon and the list types of the arguments and the return value. Each argument is separated by an arrow. The above example of a function of two integer arguments returning an integer would be:</p>

<p>The function-of-a-function introduced above has as type:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span></span><span>ten_times</span> <span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>Int</span> <span>⟶</span> <span>Int</span> <span>⟶</span> <span>Int</span><span>)</span> <span>⟶</span>  <span>Int</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The parentheses group the type of the function that is the only argument of <code>ten_times</code>.</p>

<p>In this notation, the arrow can be interpreted as an operator which creates a function type from the two types that are its arguments. The important property of this operator is that it is right associative. What this means is that for example </p>

<p>is the same as</p>

<p>and as</p>

<p>and for completeness</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span></span><span>f</span> <span>:</span> <span>t1</span> <span>⟶</span> <span>(</span><span>t2</span> <span>⟶</span> <span>(</span><span>t3</span> <span>⟶</span> <span>t4</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>A detour into partial application</h2>

<p>The above groupings imply that our function <code>f</code> can be interpreted in three ways, as a function of:</p>

<ul>
<li>3 arguments of types <code>t1</code>,<code>t2</code>,<code>t3</code>, returning a result of type <code>t4</code>;</li>
<li>2 arguments of types <code>t1</code>,<code>t2</code>, returning a result of type <code>t3 -&gt; t4</code>; </li>
<li>1 argument of types <code>t1</code>, returning a result of type <code>t2-&gt;t3-&gt;t4</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's say we have values <code>v1</code>,<code>v2</code>,<code>v3</code> for the arguments and <code>v4</code> as the result:</p>

<p>But suppose we only apply <code>v1</code> and <code>v2</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text"><span></span>pf1 : t3 ⟶ t4
pf1 = f v1 v2
</code></pre></div>
<p>We get a new function <code>pf1</code> which takes a single argument <code>v3</code>: </p>

<p>And in the same way we can create <code>pf2</code> and <code>pf3</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span></span><span>pf2</span> <span>:</span> <span>t2</span> <span>⟶</span> <span>t3</span> <span>⟶</span><span>t4</span>
<span>pf2</span> <span>=</span> <span>f</span> <span>v1</span>

<span>pf3</span> <span>:</span> <span>t3</span> <span>⟶</span> <span>t4</span>
<span>pf3</span> <span>=</span> <span>pf2</span> <span>v2</span>

<span>v4</span> <span>=</span> <span>pf3</span> <span>v3</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Because <code>pf1</code>, <code>pf2</code> and <code>pf3</code> are functions and the above is true for all values of <code>v1</code>, <code>v2</code>, <code>v3</code> and <code>v4</code>, it follows that</p>

<p>For completeness, we can also apply <code>pf2</code> directly to two arguments:</p>

<p>This concept of creating a new function by not providing values for some of the arguments is called <em>partial application</em>, and many languages support it. Here are examples in Haskell, Raku, Python and Rust.</p>

<h3>Haskell</h3>

<p>In case you are not familiar with Haskell, this is what you need to know: it is whitespace-sensitive like Python, but has a markedly different syntax. Because everything is a function, there is no keyword to mark a function. Because there is only lexical scope, there is no need for any special scope identifiers. Function arguments are separated by spaces. Lambda functions (anonymous functions) start with a <code>\</code>,  chosen because it looks a bit like the Greek letter lambda, λ. </p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span></span><span>-- named function of 2 arguments</span>
<span>sqsum</span> <span>x</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span><span>+</span><span>y</span><span>*</span><span>y</span>
<span>-- lambda function bound to a named variable</span>
<span>sqsum</span> <span>=</span> <span>\</span><span>x</span> <span>y</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span><span>+</span><span>y</span><span>*</span><span>y</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The type of <code>sqsum</code> is 
<code>haskell
sqsum :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int
</code>
(Haskell uses <code>::</code> rather than <code>:</code> for the type signature)</p>

<p>In Haskell, partial application works exactly as in the examples above. So our function <code>sqsum</code> can be partially applied like this: </p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span></span><span>sqsum4</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>sqsum4</span> <span>=</span> <span>sqsum</span> <span>4</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We can apply <code>sqsum4</code> to the remaining argument:</p>

<p>This is very neat. But suppose you want to apply the second argument, rather than the first one? The Haskell Prelude library provides the function <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#v:flip">flip</a>, which simply flips the arguments:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span></span><span>flip</span> <span>::</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>b</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>c</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>b</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>c</span> 
<span>flip</span> <span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>\</span><span>x</span> <span>y</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>f</span> <span>y</span> <span>x</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>That is fine as far as it goes, but let's do a somewhat contrived example. Let's say we have a function of four arguments:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span></span><span>g</span> <span>::</span> <span>t1</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>t2</span> <span>-&gt;</span><span>t3</span> <span>-&gt;</span><span>t4</span> <span>-&gt;</span><span>tr</span>
<span>g</span> <span>x1</span> <span>x2</span> <span>x3</span> <span>x4</span> <span>=</span> <span>x1</span><span>*</span><span>x3</span><span>-</span><span>x2</span><span>*</span><span>x4</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>and we want to apply the 1st and 4th argument but not the others, something like <code>g v1 _ _ v4</code>.</p>

<p>One way to do this is to create yet another function (of course!):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span></span><span>apply14</span> <span>::</span> <span>(</span><span>t1</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>t2</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>t3</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>t4</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>tr</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>t1</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>t4</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>t2</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>t3</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>tr</span><span>)</span>
<span>apply14</span> <span>f</span> <span>x1</span> <span>x4</span> <span>=</span> <span>\</span><span>x2</span> <span>x3</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>f</span> <span>x1</span> <span>x2</span> <span>x3</span> <span>x4</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>And with this function we can partially apply the 1st and 4th argument of <code>g</code>:</p>

<p>This example mainly serves to illustrate the power of the arrow-based function type notation: it lays out the type of <code>apply14</code> clearly and concisely. </p>

<h3>Raku</h3>

<p>Raku provides the method <a href="https://docs.raku.org/routine/assuming">assuming</a>, which acts as a generalised version of our <code>apply14</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>my</span> <span>&amp;g14</span> = <span>&amp;g</span>.<span>assuming</span>( <span>v1</span>, *, *, <span>v4</span>);

<span>g14</span>(<span>v2</span>,<span>v3</span>); 
</code></pre></div>
<p>The return type of <code>assuming</code> is a <code>Callable</code>. This is a role for objects which support calling them. Thus, <code>g14</code> can be called as if it was a regular function.</p>

<h3>Python</h3>

<p>Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functools.html">functools</a> provide the <code>partial</code> function:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span>from</span> <span>functools</span> <span>import</span> <span>partial</span>
<span>g14</span> <span>=</span> <span>partial</span><span>(</span><span>g</span><span>,</span> <span>x1</span><span>=</span><span>v1</span><span>,</span><span>x4</span><span>=</span><span>v4</span><span>)</span>

<span>g14</span><span>(</span><span>v2</span><span>,</span><span>v3</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The return type of <code>partial</code> is a <code>partial</code> object, which has an attribute <code>partial.func</code>, a callable object or function. Calls to the partial object will be forwarded to func with new arguments and keywords, so you can say <code>g14(v2,v3)</code> instead of <code>g14.func(v2,v3)</code>.</p>

<h3>Rust</h3>

<p>Rust provides the <code>partial!</code> macro via its <a href="https://docs.rs/partial_application/0.2.1/partial_application/">partial_application</a> crate. Its behaviour is very similar to our <code>apply14</code>: "<code>partial!(some_fn =&gt; arg0, _, arg2, _)</code> returns the closure <code>|x1, x3| some_fn(arg0, x1, arg2, x3)</code>". </p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span></span><span>#[macro_use]</span><span></span>
<span>extern</span><span> </span><span>crate</span><span> </span><span>partial_application</span><span>;</span><span></span>

<span>fn</span> <span>g</span><span>(</span><span>x1</span>: <span>i32</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>x2</span>: <span>i32</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>x3</span>: <span>i32</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>x4</span>: <span>i32</span><span>)</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>i32</span> <span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>x1</span><span>*</span><span>x3</span><span>-</span><span>x2</span><span>*</span><span>x4</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>v1</span><span>=</span><span>...;</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>v2</span><span>=</span><span>...;</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>v3</span><span>=</span><span>...;</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>v4</span><span>=</span><span>...;</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>g14</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>partial</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>g</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>v1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>_</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>_</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>v4</span><span>);</span><span></span>

<span>    </span><span>g14</span><span>(</span><span>v2</span><span>,</span><span>v3</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Back to the function types</h2>

<p>Suppose we want a type like the one we defined in C using a <code>typedef</code>, which encapsulates the function type:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>int</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>Fun</span><span>)(</span><span>int</span><span>,</span><span>int</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In Haskell, that would be</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span></span><span>newtype</span> <span>Fun</span> <span>=</span> <span>Fun</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>and we can generalise this to be a generic function of two arguments by using type variables instead of concrete types:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span></span><span>newtype</span> <span>Fun2Args</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>Fun2Args</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>So how would we use this? Let's create an instance</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span></span><span>ft</span> <span>::</span> <span>Fun2Args</span> <span>a</span>
<span>ft</span> <span>=</span> <span>Fun2Args</span> <span>(</span><span>\</span><span>x</span> <span>y</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span><span>+</span><span>y</span><span>*</span><span>y</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is fine, but to apply the function we first must unwrap the type constructor:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span></span><span>((</span><span>\</span><span>(</span><span>Fun2Args</span> <span>f</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>f</span><span>)</span> <span>ft</span> <span>)</span> <span>3</span> <span>4</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>That is not very handy. A better way is to use the record type syntax which gives us an accessor function:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span></span><span>newtype</span> <span>Fun2Args</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>Fun2Args</span> <span>{</span> <span>unF</span> <span>::</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span><span>}</span>
<span>ft</span> <span>=</span> <span>Fun2Args</span> <span>(</span><span>\</span><span>x</span> <span>y</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span><span>+</span><span>y</span><span>*</span><span>y</span><span>)</span>
<span>(</span><span>unF</span> <span>ft</span><span>)</span> <span>3</span> <span>4</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now I have applied this to integer, but the type of the function is <code>Num a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a</code>, so this works for any type in the <code>Num</code> typeclass.</p>

<h2>Named function types for Raku</h2>

<p>In Raku, we can follow a similar approach of wrapping a function signature in a type, and it is actually simpler than in Haskell. We create a parametric role which takes the function as a parameter, and has a method with the signature of the function:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>role</span> <span>Fun2NumArgs</span>[<span>&amp;b</span>] {
    <span>method</span> <span>unF</span>( <span>Numeric</span> \<span>x</span>,  <span>Numeric</span> \<span>y</span> --&gt; <span>Numeric</span>) {
        <span>&amp;b</span>(<span>x</span>,<span>y</span>);
    }
}

<span>my</span> \<span>ft</span> = <span>Fun2NumArgs</span>[ -&gt;\<span>x</span>,\<span>y</span> {<span>x*x+</span><span>y</span><span>*</span><span>y</span>} ].<span>new</span>;

<span>say</span> <span>ft</span>.<span>unF</span>(<span>3</span>,<span>4</span>); 
</code></pre></div>
<p>But what is the benefit of doing this? Surely we could just have done</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>my</span> <span>&amp;f</span> =  -&gt; <span>Numeric</span>…</code></pre></div></div></div>

<p>I'm a science fiction writer, so I quite enjoy thinking about self-driving cars. They make for really interesting analogies about data, liability, self-determination, information security and openness.</p>
<p>Sometimes I write fiction about this! Deakin University commissioned "Car Wars," a short story about the sociotechnological issues raised by autonomous vehicle thought-experiments.</p>
<p><a href="https://this.deakin.edu.au/self-improvement/car-wars">https://this.deakin.edu.au/self-improvement/car-wars</a></p>
<p>(they also got a faculty member to write a quiz for it whose correct answers take a 180' different view to my own!)</p>
<p>And without any spoilers here, I'll say that subverted, lethal autonomous vehicles are a key plot point in Attack Surface, the third Little Brother book, coming out in Oct.</p>
<p><a href="https://read.macmillan.com/promo/attacksurfacepreordercampaign/">https://read.macmillan.com/promo/attacksurfacepreordercampaign/</a></p>
<p>But I'm a science fiction writer and that means I can tell the difference between "thought experiments" and "real things." Alas, the same cannot be said of corporate America.</p>
<p>For example, according to its own IPO filings, Uber can only be profitable if it invents fully autonomous vehicles and replaces every public transit ride in the world with them.</p>
<p>Elon Musk – a man whose "green electric car company" is only profitable thanks to the carbon credits it sells to manufacturers of the dirtiest SUVs in America, without which those planet-killing SUVs would not exist – makes the same mistake.</p>
<p>Musk wants to abolish public transit and replace it with EVs (he says that public transit makes you sit next to strangers who might be serial killers, which tells you a lot about his view of humanity).</p>
<p>Now, both Uber and Musk are both wrong as a matter of simple geometry. Multiply the space occupied by all those AVs by the journeys people in cities need to make by the additional distances of those journeys if we need road for all those cars, and you run out of space.</p>
<p>It's a trivially modelable Red Queen's Race, in which the more cars you add, the more road you need, the more spaced out everything gets, the more cars you need, the more road you need, the more spaced out everything gets, the more cars you need…</p>
<p>Indeed, these fairy tales require so much credulity to be taken seriously that they strain even the car-addled imaginations of American automotive culture, and also rely on the irrational exuberance inspired by imaginary self-driving cars to propagate and persist.</p>
<p>But that exuberance is sorely misplaced. Machine learning systems have brittle and unpredictable failure modes that can be triggered by accident or deliberately. The unconstrained problem of navigating busy cities with unquantifiable human activities is insoluble with ML.</p>
<p>Or, at least, it's insoluble if you care about whether cars kill even more people in even less predictable ways than they do now.</p>
<p>This is a lesson that Ford CEO Jim Hackett just learned the hard way.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-10-ford-ceo-says-the-company-overestimated-self-driving-cars.html">https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-10-ford-ceo-says-the-company-overestimated-self-driving-cars.html</a></p>
<p>After investing heavily in the technology and boasting about how Ford's future was a bet on the imminent arrival of AVs, Hackett has had to admit that "We overestimated the arrival of autonomous vehicles."</p>
<p>The company has sunk $4b into the technology. But there's gotta be a pony under there somewhere:</p>
<p>"When we bring this thing to market, it's going to be really powerful." -Hackett</p>

<p>Genomist Adam Rutherford is a gifted science communicator; the podcast he co-hosts, "The Curious Cases of Rutherford and Fry" is one of the best popular science programs I've ever heard: charming and informative at the same time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07dx75g/episodes/downloads">https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07dx75g/episodes/downloads</a></p>
<p>His 2017 book "A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived" used a survey of the state of the art in genomics to present an account of what we knew about human relatedness.</p>
<p><a href="https://boingboing.net/2017/07/03/the-human-race-without-races.html">https://boingboing.net/2017/07/03/the-human-race-without-races.html</a></p>
<p>The most compelling part of "Brief History" was Rutherford's skewering of junk DNA sciecne, especially the home ancestry/genetic testing industry, with its claims of being able to tell you if you're 32% viking and if so, which red wine you're genetically programmed to enjoy.</p>
<p>These sections are written with Rutherford's characteristic empathy – as someone who'd dedicated his life to genomics, he understands the impulse to connect your DNA with your life story – but they also warn about the harms arising from these false beliefs.</p>
<p>These harms are the subject of his new book, HOW TO ARGUE WITH A RACIST, a bestseller in the UK, just published in the US with new forematter updated in light of both the pandemic and the BLM uprising.</p>
<p><a href="https://theexperimentpublishing.com/catalogs/spring-2020/how-to-argue-with-a-racist/">https://theexperimentpublishing.com/catalogs/spring-2020/how-to-argue-with-a-racist/</a></p>
<p>Superficially, the "race science" promulgated by white supremacists – often repeated by people who should know better, sometimes internalized by racialized people who are harmed by this pseudoscience – has the ring of plausibility.</p>
<p>Whether that's the fairy tales about "race" and ability ("Jews are smart because of medieval money-lending laws" or "Black people perform well in sports because of the slave trade's selective breeding") or the studies grouping humanity into races based on genetic divergence.</p>
<p>Chances are you've encountered this stuff and not known what to make of it but thought it benign or at least neutral. But sociologists have scraped white nationalist message-boards to document the centrality of this stuff to the rise of a new movement of would-be genociders.</p>
<p>"How to Argue" is a point-by-point rebuttal to these race realists. Despite the title, Rutherford doesn't really expect that you'll convince someone who's obsessed with whether they have "Jewish genes" or who worships their ability to break down lactose with his arguments.</p>
<p>Those people, after all, are motivated reasoners. They've started from the end-point – "appearances and life circumstances notwithstanding, I am superior and deserve better" – and worked their way backwards to justify that story to themselves.</p>
<p>As Jonathan Swift wrote (and as Rutherford quotes): "It is useless to attempt to reason a man out of a thing he was never reasoned into."</p>
<p>But it's not just motivated reasoners who absorb this garbage. There's a whole business model built on selling people junk DNA science that makes "race science" regrettably spreadable.</p>
<p>That's where Rutherford is aiming: people who've assumed that 23andme and its rivals wouldn't be able to make millions selling you diagnoses of the precise quantity of viking DNA in your blood if there wasn't something to it.</p>
<p>And here Rutherford shines. He is, after all, a gifted science communicator. This is one seriously <em>charming</em> book, funny and witty and just flat-out fascinating.</p>
<p>Rutherford doesn't merely want to disabuse you of the fantastical claims of Junk DNA Science – he wants to excite you about the incredible NEW things we're learning thanks to the rapid advances in genomics.</p>
<p>Like the fact that Africa is the most genetically diverse place on Earth, with two members of the Sen tribe from different regions being more genetically divergent than a Swede and an Australian Aboriginal person.</p>
<p>And the fact that you only need to go back 11 generations before you reach an ancestor whose DNA is likely completely missing from your own genome. Or the small number of centuries you have to look back before you find the first common ancestor of every European.</p>
<p>And the amount of genetic outflow and backflow between seemingly isolated places – Bronze Age Africa and Europe, say – and the waves of migration we can trace through genomes that eliminate any claim to national genetic commonality in any land.</p>
<p>If you've ever wondered what role genomics plays in the dominance of people from east Africa in footraces, or the number of Jewish Nobelists, Rutherford's here for you, unpicking what we know about the role of genes in these attainments (spoiler: they're not that important).</p>
<p>All leavened with gentle and devastating dunks on "race science" believers and the wit of Douglas Adams in his prime.</p>
<p>It may not help you win arguments with racists – they cannot be reasoned out of what they weren't reasoned into.</p>
<p>But it a powerful innoculant against the ideas drifting out of their foetid pits and into the rest of the world.</p>

<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage the globe, lots of people are stuck
at home, either working remotely or sitting around without much to do. The
previous afternoon, I had stumbled across an online announcement that the
<a href="https://www.acm.org/articles/bulletins/2020/march/dl-access-during-covid-19">ACM Digital Library has been made free to all to read and download</a> to
help foster research, discovery, and learning during this time of crisis.
Feeling curious, and having previously wanted to read certain research papers
from the ACM DL previously, I took the opportunity to peruse through its library
and read as much content as I could. As I was doing so, I stumbled across a very
useful paper called <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3167132.3167261"><strong>"Syntax error recovery in parsing expression
grammars"</strong></a> by (Medeiros, S. and Fabio Mascarenhas, 2018) that I would
like to share, and I'll be testing some of its concepts using a prototype parser
written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> with the help of the <a href="https://docs.rs/nom"><code>nom</code></a> crate.</p>
<h2 id="some-background">Some background</h2>
<p>Language parsing is a very broad and interesting topic, with a swathe of varying
approaches and tools to choose from depending on the requirements of the task at
hand, but the basic premise is simple: the goal of a parser is to consume some
data as input, break it down into its component parts according to some grammar,
and derive meaning or understanding from it (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing">wiki</a>). I personally happen to
enjoy working with <em>parsing expression grammars</em> (PEGs) and <em>parser combinators</em>
when writing my own projects.</p>
<p>In case you are not familiar, PEG is a kind of declarative formal language for
describing other languages in terms of string pattern matching. That is, PEG
allows the parser author to declare the grammar of the language they wish to
parse using sets of expressions like those shown below:</p>
<pre><span>expr    ← sum
sum     ← product (('+' / '-') product)*
product ← value (('*' / '/') value)*
value   ← [0-9]+ / '(' expr ')'
</span></pre>
<p>These PEG rules would then be able to describe the rules to a simple arithmetic
language that behaves like this:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Input</th><th>Parsed syntax tree</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><code>123</code></td><td><code>Value(123)</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>1 + 2</code></td><td><code>Sum(Value(1), Value(2))</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>1 + 2 * 3</code></td><td><code>Sum(Value(1), Product(Value(2), Value(3)))</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>(1 + 2) * 3</code></td><td><code>Product(Sum(Value(1), Value(2)), Value(3))</code></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Any PEG expression can be converted directly into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser">recursive descent parser</a>,
either automatically using a parser generator or crafted by hand in the
programming language of your choice.</p>
<p>I really enjoy using parser combinator frameworks like <a href="https://docs.rs/nom"><code>nom</code></a> as a nice middle
ground between the two options, since they grant you the freedom and flexibility
of writing your parser fully in the host language (in this example, Rust), but
the resulting code is succinct, fairly declarative, and looks somewhat PEG-ish,
if you tilt your head and squint hard enough.</p>
<pre><span>fn </span><span>expr</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>str</span><span>) -&gt; IResult&lt;&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>, &amp;</span><span>str</span><span>&gt; {
    </span><span>sum</span><span>(input)
}

</span><span>fn </span><span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>str</span><span>) -&gt; IResult&lt;&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>, &amp;</span><span>str</span><span>&gt; {
    </span><span>let</span><span> op = </span><span>alt</span><span>((</span><span>char</span><span>('</span><span>+</span><span>'), </span><span>char</span><span>('</span><span>-</span><span>')));
    </span><span>recognize</span><span>(</span><span>pair</span><span>(product, </span><span>many0</span><span>(</span><span>pair</span><span>(op, product))))(input)
}

</span><span>fn </span><span>product</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>str</span><span>) -&gt; IResult&lt;&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>, &amp;</span><span>str</span><span>&gt; {
    </span><span>let</span><span> op = </span><span>alt</span><span>((</span><span>char</span><span>('</span><span>*</span><span>'), </span><span>char</span><span>('</span><span>/</span><span>')));
    </span><span>recognize</span><span>(</span><span>pair</span><span>(value, </span><span>many0</span><span>(</span><span>pair</span><span>(op, value))))(input)
}

</span><span>fn </span><span>value</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>str</span><span>) -&gt; IResult&lt;&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>, &amp;</span><span>str</span><span>&gt; {
    </span><span>recognize</span><span>(</span><span>alt</span><span>((digit1, </span><span>delimited</span><span>(</span><span>char</span><span>('</span><span>(</span><span>'), expr, </span><span>char</span><span>('</span><span>)</span><span>')))))(input)
}
</span></pre>
<p>Each of the four parsers above corresponds to a PEG rule, and since each one is
represented as a pure function, they compose nicely in code and each one can
easily be tested in isolation from the others, e.g. with inline unit tests. All
in all, I enjoy working with PEG and parser combinators!</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>I've been hacking on a parser and <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">language server</a> for the <a href="https://nixos.org/nix/">Nix programming
language</a> as a side project (<a href="https://github.com/ebkalderon/nix-language-server">GitHub</a>) for some time now, and this extended
period of being stuck at home renewed my interest in working on it. This
language server aims to supply code analysis, and auto-completion for compatible
third-party text editors and IDEs. This project has been very challenging for me
to work on, in a good way, because language servers tend to have very strict
requirements of their underlying parsers.</p>
<p>Most compilers and static analysis tools are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_program">batch programs</a> which act like a
dumb pipe, consuming source code in one end and spitting an executable out the
other (yes, incremental compilation and artifact caching bends this analogy a
bit, but the basic premise still holds). This means that their parsers and
resulting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">abstract syntax trees</a> are optimized for very different things than
what an interactive IDE would want.</p>
<p>Since the user is continuously modifying the source text and entering keystrokes
into their editor, the parser providing syntax checking for their editor is very
frequently exposed to incomplete or downright invalid snippets of code more
often than not. This means that halting parsing and bailing with an error
message whenever the first error is encountered, like many traditional parsers
do, is <em>simply not an option</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1711539/76758522-1ee9ad80-678a-11ea-84cd-111739ecd379.gif" alt="rust-analyzer in action">
<em>Source: <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/thisweek/2020/03/16/changelog-16.html">rust-analyzer Changelog #16</a></em></p>
<p>Instead, the parser needs to be as fault-tolerant as possible, always producing
a syntax tree of some kind on every single parse and deriving as much syntactic
and semantic meaning as it can from user input, however malformed it might be.
Your editor should still be able to provide meaningful code completion, hover
documentation, go-to-definition, and symbol searching regardless of whether
there is a missing semicolon somewhere halfway down the page.</p>
<h2 id="a-naive-approach">A naive approach</h2>
<p>When I first started working on this project, I had chosen to implement my Nix
parser in Rust using <code>nom</code> 5.0, since that was the tool I was most comfortable
using for writing parsers at the time.</p>
<p>As I was writing up my parsers, I very quickly realized that bailing early from
parsing with an <code>Err(nom::Err::Error(_))</code> or <code>Err(nom::Error::Failure(_))</code>
wasn't a good idea for emitting errors. The former triggers a backtrack, which I
didn't always want, and the latter would halt parsing altogether with an error,
which I never wanted. <code>Err(nom::Error::Incomplete(_))</code> sounded promising due to
the name, but it too ended up being useless given the design constraints I had
in mind. I needed some way to log that a non-fatal parse error had been
encountered and resume parsing as though nothing had happened, but
unfortunately, there seemed to be nothing in the vast <code>nom</code> parser combinator
toolbox that could help me deal with this.</p>
<p>Given that <code>nom</code> parser combinators are pure functions whose signatures are
structured like this:</p>
<pre><span>impl </span><span>Fn(Input) -&gt; IResult&lt;Input, Output, Error&gt;
</span></pre>
<p>which maps to:</p>
<pre><span>impl </span><span>Fn(Input) -&gt; Result&lt;(Remaining, Output), Error&gt;
</span></pre>
<p>I decided to carry these non-fatal parse errors through the <code>Output</code> instead of
returning them through <code>Result::Err(nom::Error::Error(_))</code> using a custom data
structure which I had named <a href="https://github.com/ebkalderon/nix-language-server/blob/master/nix-parser/src/parser/partial.rs#L64-L68"><code>Partial</code></a>. This was a monadic data structure which
was essentially:</p>
<pre><span>pub struct </span><span>Partial&lt;T&gt; {
    </span><span>value</span><span>: Option&lt;T&gt;,
    </span><span>errors</span><span>: Vec&lt;Error&gt;,
}

</span><span>impl</span><span>&lt;T&gt; Partial&lt;T&gt; {
    </span><span>pub fn </span><span>map</span><span>&lt;U, F&gt;(</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>f</span><span>: F) -&gt; Partial&lt;U&gt;
    </span><span>where</span><span>
        F: FnOnce(T) -&gt; U
    { ... }

    </span><span>pub fn </span><span>flat_map</span><span>&lt;U, F&gt;(</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>f</span><span>: F) -&gt; Partial&lt;U&gt;
    </span><span>where</span><span>
        F: FnOnce(T) -&gt; Partial&lt;U&gt;
    { ... }

    </span><span>pub fn </span><span>value</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;T&gt; {
        ...
    }

    </span><span>pub fn </span><span>errors</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; &amp;[Error] {
        ...
    }

    </span><span>pub fn </span><span>verify</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; Result&lt;T, Vec&lt;Error&gt;&gt; {
        ...
    }
}
</span></pre>
<p>This data structure was complemented with a bunch of custom <code>nom</code> combinators,
e.g. <code>map_partial()</code>, <code>expect_terminated()</code>, and <code>skip_if_err()</code>, which would
allow me to compose these fault-tolerant parsers together while accumulating
errors in the <code>errors</code> field.</p>
<p>The consumer of this data structure would then choose to either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Assert that they need a valid AST without errors by calling <code>expr.verify()</code>,
transforming the <code>Partial&lt;T&gt;</code> into a <code>Result&lt;T, Vec&lt;Error&gt;&gt;</code>. This option
would be useful for traditonal batch compiler authors, as well as for testing
and debugging.</li>
<li>Extract and examine the contents of the <code>value</code> and <code>errors</code> field
separately. This is what the language server would do: publish the
accumulated errors to the user's editor in the form of diagnostics and then
perform further analysis on the syntax tree contained in <code>value</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>All the parser combinators would have this function signature instead:</p>
<pre><span>impl </span><span>Fn(Input) -&gt; IResult&lt;Input, Partial&lt;Output&gt;, Error&gt;
</span></pre>
<p>While this approach seemed to work well initially, it spiralled out of control
once the parser grew beyond a certain size. The number of <code>Partial</code> specific
combinators grew, the parser logic got hairier, more imperative, and trickier to
debug, and the performance implications of carrying around a heavy stack of
errors from function to function <a href="https://github.com/ebkalderon/nix-language-server/commit/4cd939a2917709a527bd1967f4a29bfd9f2767cc">were astonishingly awful</a>. It didn't
look and feel that much like PEG anymore.</p>
<p>I will admit I learned a lot about a breadth of topics during this time, from
benchmarking functions with <a href="https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs"><code>criterion</code></a> to generating flamegraphs with
<a href="https://github.com/ferrous-systems/flamegraph"><code>cargo-flamegraph</code></a>, and going to extreme lengths to avoid heap allocations to
make the parser as fast as possible. I used <a href="https://docs.rs/nom_locate"><code>nom_locate</code></a> to retain string span
information and be as zero-copy as possible when constructing the syntax tree.
But ultimately, I couldn't fix all the warts and fundamental flaws. I needed a
new approach.</p>

<p>Finally, back to the paper that originally inspired this article! I shelved this
project some months ago due to work and personal life matters, but came back
to it last month with some fresh ideas and a better intuition of where to look.
Discouraged by the previous setbacks, I was questioning whether parser
combinators in general were flexible enough to express parsers which were both
permissive and fault-tolerant, while also emitting good hand-crafted
diagnostics. But then I stumbled upon the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3167132.3167261">"Syntax error recovery in parsing
expression grammars" (2018)</a> paper while scouring the ACM DL search
engine for interesting articles last night.</p>
<p>The authors of this paper actually managed to get pretty great results parsing
the <a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua programming language</a> using a set of extended PEGs, producing excellent
tailor-made diagnostics rivaling the automatic error recovering capabilities of
their control, a top-down <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LL_parser">LL parser</a>…</p></article></section></div>

<p>This is a quick writeup of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography">steganographic</a> tool
that I threw together: <a href="https://github.com/woodruffw/steg86"><em>steg86</em></a>. It uses a quirk of the
x86 instruction encoding format to hide messages in pre-existing binaries with no size or
performance overhead.</p>

<p>You can play with it yourself by fetching it with <code>cargo</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>cargo <span>install </span>steg86
<span>$ </span>steg86 <span>--help</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="a-quick-steganography-refresher">A quick steganography refresher</h2>

<p>Steganography is the practice of concealing data within other data. A variety of different
common formats open themselves up to steganographic channels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Image formats: using the least significant bits of the color space</li>
  <li>Audio formats: hiding information in background noise, or hiding an image
in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram">spectrogram</a></li>
  <li>Plain text: using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack">homographs</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_joiner">special spacing characters</a> to encode information</li>
</ul>

<p>On its own, steganography is <em>not</em> a replacement for cryptography: it’s strictly
obfuscatory, and does not provide any deniablity of the embedded message if revealed.</p>

<p>That being said, there exist a variety of use cases for steganographic schemes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Coupled with strong cryptography, they <em>do</em> allow for deniability: depending on the format,
an extracted message can be made indistinguishable from random noise prior to decryption.</li>
  <li>Steganography can be used for fingerprinting and asset management.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_Identification_Code">Commercial printers</a> are well-known for doing this;
video games have also used it to <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/09/steganography_i_1.html">track users and their machines</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="doing-steganography-on-computer-programs">Doing steganography on computer programs</h2>

<p>There are two obvious avenues for doing steganography on compiled programs. <em>steg86</em> does
<strong>neither</strong> of these, but for the sake of completeness:</p>

<h3 id="instrumenting-the-program-via-the-compiler">Instrumenting the program via the compiler</h3>

<p>Compilers perform instruction selection to lower their internal representations into machine code.
Instruction selection can be informed by any number of weights, including
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_allocation">register pressure</a>, individual instruction
performance (clock cycles, use of shared units), and feature availability
(e.g., selecting an older version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions">SSE</a>
to be compatible with more CPUs).</p>

<p>In this approach, the steganographer would control the compiler and its instruction selection
weights, encoding information in particular selections of instructions (or other parts of
code generation, like stack object order).</p>

<p>This affords a great deal of flexibility and control, but also makes it more difficult for the
compiler to perform optimal selections. It also requires the steganographer to maintain
their (forked) compiler. Not a bad idea, but requires a decent amount of effort.</p>

<h3 id="instrumenting-the-container-format">Instrumenting the container format</h3>

<p>Another approach is to ignore the compiled instructions themselves, and focus on the binary
container: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format">ELF</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach-O">Mach-O</a>, or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable">PE</a>, among others.</p>

<p>These formats afford many opportunities for embedding information: the order
(both file and virtual address) of segments and sections, the order and layout
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relocation_(computing)">relocation tables</a> and the composition of
their internal rules, and so on.</p>

<p>Instrumenting the binary format rather than the executable code means not having
to muck with instruction selection, but is also less bountiful in terms of
information density. It’s also not portable, e.g. tricks for hiding information
in ELF relocation entries would have to be tweaked for PEs.</p>

<h2 id="how-steg86-works">How <em>steg86</em> works</h2>

<p>Instead of controlling instruction selection or tweaking the details of the containing binary
format, <em>steg86</em> takes a third route: it uses the presence of <em>semantic duals</em> in the x86 and AMD64
instruction formats to selectively rewrite a program <em>after</em> compilation.</p>

<h3 id="semantic-duals">Semantic duals</h3>

<p>Like every ISA, x86 (and AMD64) have multiple ways to encode the semantics of a particular
(higher level, conceptual) operation. For example, clearing a register:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>; xor'ing a register with itself clears all bits</span>
<span>xor</span> <span>eax</span><span>,</span> <span>eax</span>

<span>; and'ing a register with 0 also clears all bits</span>
<span>and</span> <span>eax</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span>

<span>; we could also set 0</span>
<span>mov</span> <span>eax</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span>

<span>; ...or subtract</span>
<span>sub</span> <span>eax</span><span>,</span> <span>eax</span>

<span>; ...or load a "computed" address that's always 0</span>
<span>lea</span> <span>eax</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>…among many others. Unfortunately, this doesn’t work exactly as we’d like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each of these alternatives may have a different length when encoded, e.g. 2 bytes for
<code>xor eax, eax</code> versus 6 for <code>lea eax, [0]</code>. Consequently, rewriting one in terms of another
might entail a length change and subsequent relocation and displacement fixups.</li>
  <li>Each of these alternatives has subtle microarchitectural differences: they set and clear
different arithmetic flags, have different implicit segmentation behavior, and so on.
We don’t know perfectly whether the original operations took advantage of those details,
so many of our potential alternatives run the risk of subtle breakage.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fortunately, this is <strong>not</strong> what <em>steg86</em> does.</p>

<p>Instead, <em>steg86</em> takes advantage of one of the quirks of the x86 instruction encoding: the ModR/M
byte:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/modrm.png" alt="The ModR/M byte."></p>

<p>The ModR/M byte is normally used to encode one or more explicit register and/or memory operands
to an opcode<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>: it’s how x86 can supply the rich range of source-to-sink modes that it has
(register-to-memory, memory-to-register, register-to-register, immediate-to-register, &amp;c).</p>

<p>Because register-to-memory and memory-to-register are both valid source-sink combinations for
many opcodes, many have encoding forms like the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>; xor register with register/memory32 and store register/memory32</span>
<span>xor</span> <span>r</span><span>/</span><span>m32</span><span>,</span> <span>r32</span>

<span>; xor register/memory32 with register and store register</span>
<span>xor</span> <span>r32</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span><span>/</span><span>m32</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Consequently, there are actually <strong>two</strong> ways to encode <code>xor eax, eax</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>; r/m32, r
31 C0

; r, r/m32
33 C0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These encodings are <em>semantic duals</em>: they have different opcodes, but belong to the same
instruction family, have the same length, and have the <em>exact same behavior and performance</em>.
We could replace every occurrence of <code>31 C0</code> with <code>33 C0</code> and our programs would happily chug along,
none the wiser.</p>

<p>As it turns out, there are actually quite a few of these duals on some of the most common
x86 instructions<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>ADD r/m8, r8   &lt;=&gt; ADD r8, r/m8

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each dual represents one bit of information: we can arbitrarily assign one form
to be <code>true</code> and its counterpart to be <code>false</code>. Given enough of them in a target
program, we can hide a message by translating between the forms. The result:
a binary that’s exactly the same size as the original and with the same performance
characteristics, but with a hidden message.</p>

<p>That’s all <em>steg86</em> does: it locates every semantic dual in its target program, maps
its input message to a bitstring, and translates each dual depending on its corresponding
message bit. Because it only uses duals, it’s completely agnostic to its containing format:
the <code>steg86</code> CLI currently supports ELF, Mach-O, and PE/PE32+ binaries.</p>

<p>Here’s what that actually looks like, with (some of the) differing bytes highlighted in red:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/steg86_vbindiff.png" alt="vbindiff between bash and steg'd bash"></p>

<p>And, of course, try it for yourself:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>steg86 profile /bin/bash
Summary <span>for</span> /bin/bash:
  175828 total instructions
  27957 potential semantic pairs
  27925 bits of information capacity <span>(</span>3490 bytes, approx. 3KB<span>)</span>

<span>$ </span>steg86 embed /bin/bash test.steg <span>&lt;&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"hello world!"</span>

<span>$ </span>steg86 extract test.steg
hello world!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/woodruffw/steg86/blob/master/README.md">README</a> for prior work and
future refinements to <em>steg86</em>’s informational capacity.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: An important note: because compilers and assemblers tend to select just one of the forms
above, <em>steg86</em> <strong>cannot</strong> provide deniability, even with strong encryption. Its transformations
will always look abnormal compared to a compiler-produced binary.</p>

            <h3>Body Weight Has Surprising, Alarming Impact on Brain Function</h3> 
			<h4>Higher BMI is linked to decreased cerebral blood flow, which is associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and mental illness, according to a new study in JAD</h4>		</p><div>

							<em>August 5, 2020</em><br>
							<strong>Amsterdam, NL and Costa Mesa, CA, USA – As a person's weight goes up, all regions of the brain go down in activity and blood flow, according to a <a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad200655" target="_blank">new brain imaging study</a> in the <em><a href="http://j-alz.com/" target="_blank">Journal of Alzheimer's Disease</a></em>. One of the largest studies linking obesity with brain dysfunction, scientists analyzed over 35,000 functional neuroimaging scans using single-photon emission computerized tomography from more than 17,000 individuals to measure blood flow and brain activity. </strong>
						</p><p>Low cerebral blood flow is the #1 brain imaging predictor that a person will develop Alzheimer’s disease. It is also associated with depression, ADHD, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, traumatic brain injury, addiction, suicide, and other conditions. “This study shows that being overweight or obese seriously impacts brain activity and increases the risk for Alzheimer’s disease as well as many other psychiatric and cognitive conditions,” explained Daniel G. Amen, MD, the study’s lead author and founder of Amen Clinics, one of the leading brain-centered mental health clinics in the United States</p>

<p>Striking patterns of progressively reduced blood flow were found in virtually all regions of the brain across categories of underweight, normal weight, overweight, obesity, and morbid obesity. These were noted while participants were in a resting state as well as while performing a concentration task. In particular, brain areas noted to be vulnerable to Alzheimer’s disease, the temporal and parietal lobes, hippocampus, posterior cingulate gyrus, and precuneus, were found to have reduced blood flow along the spectrum of weight classification from normal weight to overweight, obese, and morbidly obese.</p>

<p>Considering the latest statistics showing that 72% of Americans are overweight of whom 42% are obese, this is distressing news for America’s mental and cognitive health.</p>
<p>Commenting on this study, George Perry, PhD, Editor-in-Chief of the <em>Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease</em> and Semmes Foundation Distinguished University Chair in Neurobiology at The University of Texas at San Antonio, stated, “Acceptance that Alzheimer’s disease is a lifestyle disease, little different from other age-related diseases, that is the sum of a lifetime is the most important breakthrough of the decade. Dr. Amen and collaborators provide compelling evidence that obesity alters blood supply to the brain to shrink the brain and promote Alzheimer’s disease. This is a major advance because it directly demonstrates how the brain responds to our body.”</p>
<p>This study highlights the need to address obesity as a target for interventions designed to improve brain function, be they Alzheimer disease prevention initiatives or attempts to optimize cognition in younger populations. Such work will be crucial in improving outcomes across all age groups.</p>
<p>Although the results of this study are deeply concerning, there is hope. Dr. Amen added, “One of the most important lessons we have learned through 30 years of performing functional brain imaging studies is that brains can be improved when you put them in a healing environment by adopting brain-healthy habits, such as a healthy calorie-smart diet and regular exercise.”</p>

<p>The original AKAI MPC 3000 Classic released in 1994 as the step up from its predecessor, the MPC 60 (and the later MPC 60 mkII). MSRP was staggering, coming in at just under $4,000 in the early 90’s (a little over $7,000 in today’s money). It was clear that this machine was meant for professional studios and intended to be a tool for deliberate music applications.</p>

<p>The black AKAI MPC 3000 LE is a limited edition release of only 2000 individually numbered units in the year 2000. </p>



<p>There is a rumor that only 1400 units have been released to the public because as far as we know, the public has not seen any units numbered 1400 through 2000. Let it be known if you have one of these rare units.</p>

<h2>History of the AKAI MPC 3000</h2>



<h3>Roger Linn</h3>



<p>In 1980 Roger Linn designed and released the worlds first drum machine that uses samples called the LM-1, under his own company Linn Moffett Electronics with then partner Alex Moffett. Eventually Linn Electronics went out of business and the next chapter would be Roger Linn and Akai Professional linking up to create new products. The collaboration was a good fit because Akai needed a creative designer and Roger Linn wasn’t a fan of the manufacturing aspects of the business. In 1988 they would release the Akai MPC 60 and later followed by the updated MPC 60 MKII. In 1994 came the release of the MPC 3000, the celebrated upgrade from the MPC 60 line.</p>



<h3>MPC 60 vs MPC 3000</h3>



<ul><li>MPC 60: 12 bit audio – MPC 3000: 16 bit audio.</li><li>MPC 60 has 750KB of stock memory, expandable to 1.5 MB. The MPC 3000 has 2 MB of stock memory, expandable up to 32 MB.</li><li>The MPC 60 only has a single mono sampling input, while the MPC 3000 has dual stereo inputs.</li><li>MPC 60 has no filters whle the MPC 3000 comes equipped with a lowpass filter.</li><li>Both sound slightly different from eachother. Some prefer the 60, others prefer the 3000.</li></ul>



<p>Roger Linn’s vision for what a drum machine could be revolved around <em>grooves</em>. A drum machine had to have great groove to it. So he wanted it to be simple and be able to record exactly what you threw at it. This required the timing to be super tight in the MPC 3000. Linn made sure all the details were figured out for this on the backend and the result is a machine that grooves perfectly.</p>

</div><figcaption>Roger Linn talks about the AKAI MPC 3000.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hip-hop took an immediate kinship to the machine. Early notable users were producers like DJ Quik, Battlecat, Dr. Dre and J DIlla. The creation of the drum machine sampler ushered in innovation to a musical artform that was previously based around two turntables. The innovation of the sampler elevated the artform to a new frontier. Roger Linn himself has said that he did not anticipate this.</p>



<blockquote><p><em><span><b>”The AKAI MPC simultaneously </b></span><strong>digitized beat-making, progressed the pastiche musical form, and freed Hip-Hop from the confines of earlier technology.”</strong></em></p><cite><a href="https://happymag.tv/in-praise-of-the-akai-mpc-a-hip-hop-time-machine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HappyMag.Tv</a></cite></blockquote>



<h3>J Dilla</h3>



<p>J Dilla started to make a name for himself in the mid 90’s with classic records like Pharcyde’s “Runnin”, Janet Jackson’s “Got Til It’s Gone”, and Q-Tip’s “Breathe &amp; Stop”.</p>

<p>Out of Dilla’s music also spawned the R&amp;B sub-genre Neo-soul. Also connected to the MPC 3000 through J Dilla’s work.</p>



<p>It’s safe to say that nobody else has displayed the MPC 3000’s groove capablities better than J Dilla. He was turning off the quantize setting during a time when literally everybody was relying on quantization for electronic music creation. He approached the MPC 3000 like a drummer would, and in turn he is regarded as one of the best drum programmers of all time.</p>

<h3>Dr. Dre</h3>



<p>After the release of the landscape-changing album <em>The Chronic 2001</em> in 1999 by Dr. Dre, more of the public started to take strong notice of the machine. Dr. Dre stated in an interview with Scratch Magazine that he used four or five different MPC 3000’s at one time for the creation of the album to avoid the drawbacks of using disks and memory. He shared that during this time his beats were layed down with the drums in the 3000 first, and everything else revolving around that.</p>

<h2>Interesting Facts About the MPC 3000</h2>



<ul><li>There are no visual waveforms. You chop on the MPC 3000 with numbers, editing the start and end time of samples with numerical digits. Others would argue that you can chop by individually sampling each chop.</li><li>There is no EQ or FX in the MPC 3000. Only a lowpass filter and attack/decay, and delay.</li><li>You can only cutoff 2 other pads per pad. Compare this with modern drum machines where you can apply choke groups, etc. and cutoff any pad.</li></ul>



<h2>Why The MPC 3000 Is The Best Drum Machine of All Time</h2>



<p>To put it plainly, the simplicity.</p>



<p>Even though technically an MPC is a computer, the ushering in of personal computers as we know them today, and the fast innovation simply changed how music was being made. Workflow started to shift from unmanageably short sample times to hoards of collections of samples on hard drives. Modern workflow now allows freely auditioning any sized samples and endless decisions to be made with endless tools at your fingertips, effectively debilitating creativity very easily.</p>



<p>If Roger Linn had not been the first to incorporate sampling into drum machines, and then successfuly iterate on it leading into the release of the 3000, its safe to say that Hip-Hop and House music would not have taken it under their wing and catapulted the machine into the history books in the way that its heralded as a classic machine and musical instrument.</p>



<p>When you take a step back, its easy to realize that the 3000 was really where things peaked for drum machines. The MPC 3000 knocked it out of the park where it mattered most…. The sound, the timing, and the workflow. Drum machines that came after the MPC 3000 started to offer new abilities and functions, but traded them for things like the beefy analog sound and streamlined workflow.</p>



<p><strong>The Timing</strong></p>



<p>When you talk to fans of the MPC 3000, you hear them talk about “The Feel.” They will tell you that the feel of the 3000 is like no other drum machine or sampler that exists. This is due to the timing that Roger Linn built into the machine. The timing on the MPC 3000 is extremely tight and about as true as you can get. It will record exactly what you play. Essentially, it is the essense of what a “groovebox” is.<br>The sequencer on the MPC 3000 is second to none.</p>



<p><strong>The Sound</strong></p>



<p>Theres something about the sound of the MPC 3000. It’s the sampling engine, but it also seems to be more than that. For drums, while subtle… enthusiasts will tell you its unmatched. While the sampling engine will color sounds in its own way, the 3000 also seems to have a unique glue which provides subtle punch. Sounds will jump off of the track and manage to coexist beautifully on the 3000.</p>



<p><em>The low end on the MPC 3000 is amazing.</em></p>



<p>The MPC 3000 is very bottom heavy and thick in sound. Roger Linn has talked about how they tried to make it sound like a tape machine. And it clearly does. You can drive this machine extremely hot and loud without ever losing any bottom end.</p>



<p>You can’t really get a computer or any DAW to sound like an MPC 3000. Some claim its a matter of boosting the low end, and cutting some of the high end frequencies to match the sound of the 3000. This is simply false. There are much more nuances happening that have yet to be achieved on a computer… mostly the digitial to analog conversion. The DAC on the MPC 3000 is extremely unique. It’s a machine and it sounds like a machine, in a good way. In the best way possible.</p>



<p><strong>The Workflow</strong></p>



<p>The workflow is unmatched. It’s minimal, but it also gives you the proper buttons for only the functions and screens that you need. </p>



<p>The addition of a number pad is brilliant and is extremely useful allowing …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>A question I often hear from teams - both new and established - is “should we host our stack on <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>?”.  Given all the buzz it gets in the tech world a lot of people assume&nbsp;so.</p>
<p>I’ve been working with k8s for several years - often with very powerful and complex platforms - and I think the truth is more&nbsp;nuanced.</p>
<p>Here’s my attempt at untangling that decision.  It’s geared toward startups and self-sufficient teams in wider organisations with responsibility for hosting their own products.  It might also have value to people in more traditional <span>IT</span> departments at larger&nbsp;organisations.</p>
<h3>How Can it Help&nbsp;Me?</h3>
<p>Kubernetes isn’t just a 2018-era buzzword.  It’s a robust, highly scalable system that allows you to construct application deployments out of well-considered primitives (<code>Pod</code>, <code>Service</code>, <code>Ingress</code> etc) then does its damnedest to make the reality match.  When applications crash it restarts them.  When whole swathes of underlying machines disappear it tries to replace them.  If you’re running numerous services (probably developed as a microservice architecture) and you’re looking for efficiency, resilience and a good story for deployment it can do a lot for&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>Want a basic degree of resilience in your service? (yes you do) - run <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/">multiple replicas</a> in your deployment then balance traffic between&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>If your workload is ‘bursty’ (e.g. a lot of <span>API</span> traffic) you could build on this by rigging up <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/">autoscaling</a> to grow capacity when it’s needed.  This can save you a lot of money - instead of paying for peak capacity all of the time, provision a baseload amount to keep the platform ticking over and bring up more replicas when they’re needed.  And if you can <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/custom-and-external-metrics">import the queue length</a> into your system autoscaling works for queue-based workloads&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>Worried about your code breaking?  Configure liveness/readiness <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/">probes</a> and Kubernetes will automatically restart your services when they fail.  Likewise for hardware failure - I’ve seen clusters who’ve lost half their nodes keep on trucking like nothing happened.  A well-configured and maintained Kubernetes cluster can be incredibly robust.  If you have the resources you might even try running a <a href="https://netflix.github.io/chaosmonkey/">chaos-monkey</a>-like <a href="https://www.gremlin.com/chaos-monkey/chaos-monkey-alternatives/kubernetes/">tool</a> to make certain your stack will tolerate regular&nbsp;failures.</p>
<p>Kubernetes has excellent features for integrating with your <span>CI</span> workflow.  The most common pattern I see for this is a build (ideally standardised across all your projects) that pushes an image to a Docker registry then kicks your k8s cluster to load it.  Depending on taste that can be done by modifying the deployment to pull a new tag, or pointing the tag to the new image and triggering k8s to reload all pods.  In most cases (migrations ruin everything) deployment can be fully automated: if you trust your tests and feature flags it can be 100% automatic (aka <a href="https://www.continuousdelivery.com/">Continuous Delivery</a>); for the less brave a manual approval step after the build eases the pain.  Either way your developers should be able to release most builds to the cluster without any help from Kubernetes&nbsp;specialists.</p>
<p>In a similar vein to <span>CI</span> it can help you standardise logging and monitoring for your applications.  Doing this is by no means unique to Kubernetes, but having a single cluster-wide system that gathers together data about all your services in the same place can greatly ease the pain of debugging.  I’ve seen particularly good results come from using <a href="https://github.com/fluent/fluentd-kubernetes-daemonset">fluentd</a> to pipe json-structured logging output from applications into <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/"><span>AWS</span> CloudWatch</a> and query it through <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AnalyzingLogData.html">Insights</a>.</p>
<p>Finally it can do a great deal to increase efficiency - both at the hosting layer (i.e. jamming as many applications onto those expensive <span>EC2</span> instances as possible) and also reducing the time your developers need to spend deploying software.  Humans cost more than computers so for most organisations the second of these will be the biggest win.  But Kubernetes isn’t magic - I’ve seen some beautiful, efficient clusters and some total gas guzzlers.  <em>You’ll only save money with Kubernetes if you invest in using it&nbsp;correctly.</em></p>
<h3>Where Does Kubernetes&nbsp;Shine?</h3>
<p>First of all think about your workload.  What kind of applications do you need to run?  How do they talk to each other and the outside world?  From experience I’d say the following attributes make your stack a good&nbsp;fit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Broadly speaking have you followed a microservice architecture?  There’s little value in Kubernetes if your world only has one application.  You’ll need to <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/examples/">Dockerize</a> your applications to deploy them to k8s; doing this from day 1 of any project is a good way to make yourself think about the boundaries between&nbsp;services.</li>
<li>Are your services exposed to each other and the outside world via <span>HTTP</span>(s) (probably yes, it’s 2020)?  This will fit k8s’ model nicely and you can use one of the normal <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx">ingress controllers</a> to front&nbsp;them.</li>
<li>Are your applications suitable to be load balanced?  No local state (use PostgreSQL / Redis / whatever for that), communication over known endpoints, fast startup/shutdown.  That isn’t to say you can’t keep shortlived state like a Redis cache in your cluster but for many cases you’d do better to use the boxed services a cloud provider&nbsp;offers.</li>
<li>Kubernetes is also well suited to headless applications like batch processing (through its <code>Job</code> <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/">controller</a>) and long-lived&nbsp;queue-consumers.</li>
<li>Is memory (and to a lesser extent <span>CPU</span>) usage predictable?  Kubernetes will try to host your applications on the same physical machines, so if one of them goes haywire and consumes all the <span>RAM</span> other workloads may be randomly killed.  In my experience this is the single biggest source of instability on Kubernetes clusters.  If you understand the resource usage of your applications you can declare a <code>resources.requests</code> and <code>resources.limits</code> to guarantee they’ll always get the memory they need and won’t be bad&nbsp;neighbours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Conversely here are a few kinds of workload I <em>don’t</em> think you should use it&nbsp;for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Static websites.  Typically you’d do this by baking your content into an <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/">Nginx</a>-derived image and exposing it via your cluster’s ingress controller.  That’s a terrible way to host static content: all those little copies of Nginx need to be maintained, it’s inefficient and far less resilient / performant than it could be at the network level.  Sure you could stick it behind a <span>CDN</span> but if you’re doing that, why not have a cloud service host the content as&nbsp;well?</li>
<li>Hosting untrusted code.  That could mean applications supplied by your customers or third party code with a history of security problems, e.g. Wordpress or a dodgy library from <span>NPM</span>.  By default Kubernetes’ features for isolating workloads aren’t great.  You can add things like <a href="https://www.projectcalico.org/">Calico</a> to control network access but it’s easy to screw up and your security model is always going to be 100% dependent on the container runtime.  The default for this (Docker, based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups">Linux cgroups</a>) offers a huge attack surface to compromised applications: if a codebase your cluster is running gets hacked an attacker will not find it hard to escalate their access to the rest of the cluster.  Interesting work is being doing on alternatives to cgroups (e.g. <a href="https://katacontainers.io/">Kata Containers</a>) but it’s not yet mainstream enough to recommend to the average&nbsp;user.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your workload isn’t a good fit you may still have options for shoehorning it into Kubernetes (e.g. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/">volumes</a> can be used for long-lived state), but expect to spend a lot of engineering time working around the problems.  A lot of them are bad practices anyhow so your resources time might be better spent designing them out of the stack altogether - they’re only going to hurt you further down the&nbsp;line.</p>
<h3>No Magic&nbsp;Bullet</h3>
<p>Kubernetes isn’t a magic bullet.  It can help to move the complexities of hosting applications into a well-designed layer of their own but it won’t make them go away.  You’re always going to have to secure and maintain your&nbsp;platform.</p>
<p>To make a cluster useful for the average workload a menagerie of add-ons will be required.  Some of them almost everyone uses, others are somewhat niche.  Examples include (the Nginx <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx">ingress controller</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager">cert-manager</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler">cluster-autoscaler</a> to add extra nodes when you don’t have enough capacity.  Having a bespoke set of software operating key features of the environment makes your cluster a unique snowflake and it needs to be managed as such.  Also they need to be updated regularly and can sometimes be of questionable quality.  Configuration management tools like <a href="https://helm.sh/">Helm</a> or <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/kubernetes/latest/docs">Terraform</a> are nigh-on mandatory: tinker with a cluster by hand at your peril, absent a declarative setup you’ll never be able to spin up another in exactly the same way.  I’ve seen this lead to no end of problems when operating or replacing more mature&nbsp;clusters.</p>
<p>When running any nontrivial stack on Kubernetes a degree of curation is always going to be required.  Letting anybody deploy whatever they like, however they like to your cluster can only lead to chaos.  You’ll end up with mess of inconsistently named applications scattered across dozens (or worse, one) namespaces with nobody knowing how they fit together.  Congratulations: you took your old spaghetti infrastructure and replaced it with a new flavour of spaghetti infrastructure, just served on a cooler kind of&nbsp;plate.</p>
<p>The most successful Kubernetes implementations I’ve seen are those where infrastructure specialist(s) work with developers to make sure workloads are well-configured, standardised, protected from one another and have defined patterns of communication.  They’ll handle the initial setup of an application on an infrastructure, hopefully wired up to a build/release system so dev teams can ship new versions of the code without help.  In a lot of ways this mirrors the wider culture of your organisation - if engineering is a chaotic free-for-all of bad communication and ill-defined responsibilities your hosting environment will mirror it.  At best this leads to unreliability; at worst an unreliable, unmaintainable, expensive&nbsp;mess.</p>
<h3>Cost of&nbsp;Ownership</h3>
<p>If you’re running applications on a large scale …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
          <section>
            <p>On our journey to true zero carbon hosting we want to explore if the world is ready for the next step: low power computing resources based on ARM.</p>

<p>For this reason we started this crowdfunding campaign that lasts 30 days and you can make an impact by choosing ARM or Intel for running your workload.</p>

<p>If only 50 people decide to go for ARM, we will build a new ARM hosting in our Zero Carbon Data Center here in Switzerland.</p>

<h2>Dedicated ARM computing</h2>

<p>We would like to take the next step and introduce <em>dedicated ARM compute resources</em>. Initially the offer will be for a Quad (4) core systems featuring 2 GB of RAM and 16GB of storage (microSD, class 10). These systems are using very little power and could shape the way how hosting is offered.</p>

<p>Using ARM, you will get a real, physical hardware instead of virtualised resources. The CPU will be based on the Allwinner A64 SoC running at 400 Mhz.</p>

<p>The choice of operating systems will be adjusted to ARM. Planned are Armbian, Arch Linux, Alpine Linux and NetBSD. More are likely to follow.</p>

<h2>The classic Intel/x86 way</h2>

<p>This crowdfunding also works as a vote. 
Do you prefer staying on x86_64, Intels 64 bit technology or do you want to switch to ARM?
While x86 is proven and virtualisation also helps to be energy efficient, the general design of x86 CPUs is more performance orientated and thus by design requiring more energy.</p>

<p>The choice of operating systems for the x86 VMs is the same ones as listed on <a href="https://datacenterlight.ch/">DataCenterLight.ch</a>.</p>

<h2>The offer</h2>

<p>If you can choose freely, what would you buy? We would love to know! We have created the following 4 offers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dedicated IPv6 Only ARM, 4 Cores, 2 GB RAM, 16 GB microsd storage for 159.5 CHF/year</li>
<li>Dedicated IPv6 ARM with dedicated NAT64 mapped IPv4 address, 4 Cores, 2 GB RAM, 16 GB microsd storage for 258.5 CHF/year</li>

			<p>My fridge was recently full of instant film. I mean that literally, it was not possible for me to put any more packets of the film into the fridge without risking damaging them:</p>

<p><img width="625px" src="https://leejo.github.io/images/2020/fuji/fridge.jpg"></p>

<p>I had acquired all of the film one day when my printer sent me an email asking if I wanted to purchase 93 packs of Fujifilm FP-100c for 2,790.- CHF. That’s 30.- CHF per box, about three times what this film used to retail for and about one third of what it currently sells for<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. So I thought about the offer for five minutes, then said yes.</p>

<p>I figured I could sell half of the packs and recoup my costs, after various expenses, then I would have around 45 boxes that I could shoot a photo project with. So I picked the film up and thanked my printer. He even included the above fridge, three Polaroid cameras, and a bunch of accessories for free. So whichever way I spin this, even if a few packs went missing in the post, I would still be close to doubling my investment <em>at the least</em> if I decided to sell all the film. Not bad.</p>

<p>The film had been discontinued, at least announced to be, in early 2016. The film was still available on a wholesale level up until sometime in 2018 so people had started stockpiling it and the prices inevitably went up. The problem with photographic film is that it will start go off in a few years as the chemicals break down, so it needs to be cold stored. This is especially the case with instant film as there are chemicals not just to record the image but also the entire development process is included in each frame.</p>

<p><strong>Instant Film</strong></p>

<p>There’s a market for this stuff as there is a range of old cameras and backs for other cameras that can only function with it. The film comes in dedicated plastic packs that the cameras/backs are designed to work with. You load a pack, fiddle about a bit, and you are ready to shoot. Like other instant films you take the shot, pull out the frame, give it a minute or two, then “peel apart” the frame to reveal the image.</p>

<p>The film can still be bought “new” on auction sites, some analog specific photography stores, and private sellers; but all of the film is now expired as the last batch was marked to do so in early 2019, so there’s a risk involved in any purchase of this film if you want it “fresh”. To purchase a single box of the film from one of the last batches you should expect to pay around 100.- CHF. Ten times what it originally retailed for.</p>

<p>Given there are ten frames in each box, and due to the fickle nature of the cameras that shoot this type of film you can often lose one or even two frames due to mechanical or exposure issues, you’re paying in the region of 12.- CHF <em>per photo</em>.</p>

<p>This is not a case of having to learn how to load and use the film - sometimes you just have bad luck. The paper mechanism used to pull out the shot frame and prepare the next sometimes tears. Just last week I was using some and the first frame leader from the box tore, I had to open the camera to retrieve the next leader and lost another three frames in the process. Somehow the third frame managed to hide amongst the rest and turned up again between the 6th and the 7th frame, something I’ve not experienced before.</p>

<p>This is not fun, it’s quite ridiculous, and if I’m being honest I don’t see the point of this stuff and find it all very annoying. I say that as someone who is steeped in the film process. Sure I understand the aesthetic and the tangible nature of the process, but that’s not for me. I mean, if you really want to shoot it that’s fine, but at this price point I would now prefer to <a href="https://leejo.github.io/projects/bergbahnen/polaroids/">emulate it</a>, at least when the reason to do so is to have some sort of contextual point for the aesthetic. Each to their own of course.</p>

<p><img width="625px" src="https://leejo.github.io/images/2020/fuji/freezer.jpg"></p>

<p>Anyway, Fuji have got form with this. I’ve been using some of their film stocks for close to two decades so have seen product lines come and go, and my other fridge/freezer (above) contains some of those products that I do continue to use. Of course you can still purchase some of the discontinued film if you really want to. A few of those I use or used to are detailed below, and this is in no way an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_discontinued_photographic_films#Fujifilm">exhaustive list</a>:</p>

<p><strong>Neopan 1600</strong> - A mid to high speed black and white film that had a grain structure that I haven’t seen in other films. I used this quite a bit when shooting skate photos but it was never available in formats larger than 35mm so I stopped when I moved exclusively to medium format. You see this now and then for sale, but it won’t be good to shoot as it’s <em>at least</em> a decade expired and mid-high speed film doesn’t last more than a few years after expiry unless it’s frozen; and of course you can’t guarantee the storage history.</p>

<p>I have seen this selling for 30 to 50.- CHF for a <em>single</em> roll of 35mm, or 250.- CHF for ten packs. That’s five to ten times its original retail price.</p>

<p><strong>Fuji Fortia</strong> - a once/twice off colour slide film that was released around 2005. It was like Fuji’s Velvia 50 (detailed below) but with even more saturated reds. There were rumours that it was a batch of Velvia that didn’t pass quality control, so Fuji sold it as a special edition for the cherry blossom season in Japan. It was available for a couple of years so probably just a single run, which does backup the “it was a messed up Velvia batch” rumor.</p>

<p>You see rolls of this for sale now and then, with the price approaching ten times what it originally retailed for. This was available in medium format so I did shoot it and you can see what I mean about the saturation from the image below, which I actually had to <em>desaturate</em> a little in post as it was just too much.</p>

<p><img width="625px" src="https://leejo.github.io/images/2020/fuji/2008_poppies_cambs.jpg"></p>

<p><strong>Acros 100</strong> - Another Fuji speciality, a medium to slow speed black and white film that offered four selling points: extremely fine grain for its box speed (100 ISO), very contrasty in normal development, very sharp, and very good reciprocity failure rates. You can shoot exposures up to several minutes long with little adjustment required, which may well be unique amongst all film stocks.</p>

<p>This was discontinued a couple of years ago but then came back as Acros II, however it is no longer Fuji manufacturing it and I believe it is a co-operation with Ilford<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. This is probably a good thing, however the 4x5 version of the film is not being made and luckily I stocked up on this a few months before its original discontinuation was announced so I have enough to last me for a few years at least. I am using this film for a specific project, which is why I bought a few boxes; my current count is 12 remaining, that’s 240 frames.</p>

<p>I rarely see this for sale in its 4x5 version, and those I do see tend to not be from the final batches, which had expiry dates of 2019-10. This was selling for about 70.- CHF a box when it was available and I suspect those final batch boxes would go for at least twice that now.</p>

<p><strong>Velvia 50</strong> - The classic landscape (and Formula 1?<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>) photographer’s slide film. Very popular up until around, I dunno, 2005? It’s still going, but i suspect will be discontinued soon. It’s no longer available outside Japan in large format sizes, and Fuji have cut down on the number of options for it in smaller sizes. Also of note is that when I was stockpiling it the boxes had very short expiry dates, less than a year, suggesting that sales have slumped. Since then the price in Japan has gone up 50% so it’s no longer a compelling option.</p>

<p>I still shoot this, but it’s very fickle. It needs graduated neutral density filters in many cases (which I don’t have) and suffers from terrible reciprocity failure and very easy over/under exposure even if you know what you’re doing. You often have to bracket your exposures +/- a stop, which is not cheap when shooting large format film. When you get it right you understand why it was number one it its niche, again another shot that I had to pull back the saturation:</p>

<p><img width="625px" src="https://leejo.github.io/images/2020/fuji/lac_leman_2019.jpg"></p>

<p><strong>What Does This All Mean</strong></p>

<p>Discontinued film stocks are selling for twice to ten times their original retail price, so should you invest in film? Nah, not at all. Unless you discover a batch of Fuji FP-100c that’s been cold stored, is from 2018 or 2019, and selling at less than 40.- CHF a box, in which case go for it and double your investment. Clearly there is a market for discontinued photographic film emulsions, but they’re a niche within a niche and we’re now down to the products that don’t offer a unique selling point.</p>

<p>The discontinuation of the above stocks doesn’t mean much, really - you can just switch to another stock and adjust as necessary. Yeah it’s frustrating at first, but that’s the nature of film. The issue with Fuji FP-100c being discontinued is that it also renders an entire range (and more) of cameras unusable<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>. There are no other options, or at least limited options, to continue using the cameras<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>That’s what’s kind of sad about this entire thing, although I guess that is the end state of all technology designed around using refills to function. Printers, things with fixed internal batteries, liquid fuel vehicles, SodaStreams? There’s more of these than you think. We will still have 35mm film for a long time I suspect, and 120 and 4x5 and 8x10 and so on; but some of the more niche products are approaching obsolescence and thus unavailability. We can retrofit some of the technology that require these refills, but eventually the expense isn’t worth it.</p>

<p>My reasons for shooting film are because it gives me access to alternative formats and some technical controls that I can’t get elsewhere, at least not at an affordable price point<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>. Movements, a square or panoramic frame, an alternative way to interact with my subjects. An interesting observation about instant film is the reaction to it, compared to shooting a digital image that is effectively the same. The tangible nature of the process really is a hook.</p>

<p><em><strong>An Iverson ghost is an embedding of APL like array programming features in nonAPL languages and tools.</strong></em></p>
<p>You would be surprised at how often Iverson ghosts appear. Whenever programmers are challenged with processing large numeric arrays they rediscover bits of APL. Often they’re unaware of the rich heritage of array processing languages but in <code>NumPy's</code>&nbsp;case, they <em>indirectly</em> acknowledged the debt. In <a href="http://numpy.sourceforge.net/numdoc/numdoc.pdf"><em>Numerical Python</em></a> the authors wrote:</p>
<p><em>“The languages which were used to guide the development of NumPy include the infamous APL family of languages, Basis, MATLAB, FORTRAN, S and S+, and others.”</em></p>
<p>I consider “infamous” an upgrade from <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/ewd498.html">“a mistake carried through to perfection.”</a></p>
<p>Not only do developers frequently conjure up Iverson ghosts. They also invariably turn into little apostles of array programming that won’t shut up about how cutting down on all those goddamn loops clarifies and simplifies algorithms. How learning to think about operating on entire arrays, versus one dinky number at a time, frees the mind. Why it’s almost as if array programming <a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/papers/tot.htm">is a tool of thought.</a></p>
<p>Where have I heard this before?</p>
<p>Ahh, I’ve got it, when I first encountered APL almost fifty years ago.</p>
<p>Yes, I am an old programmer, a fossil, a living relic. My brain is a putrid pool of punky programming languages. Python is just the latest in a longish line of languages. Some people collect stamps. I collect programming languages. And, just like stamp collectors have favorite stamps, I find some programming languages more attractive than others. For example, I recognize the undeniable utility of <code>C/C++</code>, for many tasks they are the only serious options, yet as useful and pervasive as <code>C/C++</code> are they have never tickled my fancy. The notation is ugly! Yeah, I said it; suck on it C people. Similarly, the world’s most commonly used programming language <code>JavaScript</code> is equally ugly. Again, <code>JavaScript</code> is so damn useful that programmers put up with its many warts. Some have even made a few bucks writing books about its <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do">meager good parts</a>.</p>
<p>I have similar inflammatory opinions about other widely used languages. The one that is making me miserable now is <code>SQL</code>, particularly Microsoft’s variant&nbsp;<code>T-SQL</code>. On purely aesthetic grounds I find well-formed <code>SQL</code> queries less appalling than your average <code>C</code> pointer fest. Core <code>SQL</code> is fairly elegant but the macro programming features that have grown up around it are depraved. I feel dirty when&nbsp;forced to use them which is just about every other day.</p>
<p>At the end of my programming day, I want to look on something that is beautiful. I don’t particularly care about how useful a chunk of code is or how much money it might make, or what silly little business problem it solves. If the damn code is ugly I don’t want to see it.</p>
<p>People keep rediscovering array programming, best described in Ken Iverson’s 1962 book <a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/papers/APL.htm"><em>A Programming Language</em></a>, for two basic reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s an efficient way to handle an important class of problems.</li>
<li>It’s a step away from the ugly and back towards the beautiful.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both of these reasons manifest in <code>NumPy</code>‘s resounding success in the Python world.</p>
<p>As usual, efficiency led the way. The authors of <em>Numerical Python</em> note:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why are these extensions needed? The core reason is a very prosaic one, and that is that manipulating a set of a million numbers in Python with the standard data structures such as lists, tuples or classes is much too slow and uses too much space.</p></blockquote>
<p>Faced with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBAijg5Betw">“does not compute”</a> situation you can either try something else or fix what you have. The Python people fixed Python with <code>NumPy</code>. <a href="https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-exact-difference-between-a-Pythoneer-and-a-Pythonista">Pythonistas</a> reluctantly embraced <code>NumPy</code> but quickly went <em>apostolic!</em> Now books like <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920038481.do"><em>Elegant SciPy</em></a> and the entire <code>SciPy</code> toolset that been built on <code>NumPy</code> take it for granted.</p>
<p>Is there anything in <code>NumPy</code> for programmers that have been drinking the array processing Kool-Aid for decades? The answer is yes! <a href="http://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/NuVoc">J programmers</a>, in particular, are in for a treat with the new Python3 addon that’s been released with the latest J 8.07 beta. This addon directly supports <code>NumPy</code> arrays making it easy to swap data in and out of the J/Python environments. It’s one of those best of both worlds things.</p>
<p>The following <code>NumPy</code> examples are from the <code>SciPy.org</code> <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/quickstart.html">NumPy quick start tutorial</a>. For each <code>NumPy</code> statement, I have provided a J equivalent. J is a descendant of APL. It was largely designed by the same man: Ken Iverson. A scumbag lawyer or greedy patent troll might consider suing <code>NumPy</code>‘s creators after looking at these examples. APL’s influence is obvious. Fortunately, Ken Iverson was more interested in promoting good ideas that profiting from them. I suspect he would be flattered that APL has mutated and colonized strange new worlds and I think even zealous Pythonistas will agree that Python is a delightfully strange world.</p>

<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>In this episode of the “<a href="https://kislayverma.com/category/for-the-layman/">For the layman</a>” series, I am going to discuss what the “cloud” is. We’ve all heard of iCloud, AWS, cloud computing etc, and understand the power of their ubiquitous presence. Let’s understand the history and the mechanics of the Cloud a little more.</p>
<hr>
<p><span><strong>tl;dr –</strong> The Cloud is Uber for computers. It is made up of hundreds of thousands of computers (aka servers) that users can rent out to run their software in exchange for a regular fee – mostly based on usage. Cloud companies take care of running the hardware with all kinds of best practices so that software developers and software development companies don’t have to and can focus on their core work.</span></p>
<hr>
<p>Have you ever seen one of those high intensity surgery scenes in movies where the doctor keeps shouting at the nurses “Give me a clamp” or “Give me 5cc of &lt;insert medicine name&gt;”? For the longest time, software development used to be like (only less high stakes for the most part). Programmers would write awesome <a href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">applications that could eat the world</a>. But running these awesome apps required big computers. So while the programmer finished writing the last line of code or polishing the last bit of documentation (HAHAHAHA), she would start screaming, “Give me a big computer”.</p>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/give-me-a-big-computer-1024x637.jpg" alt="" width="506" height="314" srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/give-me-a-big-computer-1024x637.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/give-me-a-big-computer-300x187.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/give-me-a-big-computer-768x478.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/give-me-a-big-computer-1536x955.jpg 1536w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/give-me-a-big-computer-1142x706.jpg 1142w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/give-me-a-big-computer-1070x665.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/give-me-a-big-computer.jpg 1603w" sizes="(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px"></figure></div>
<p>For many years, this meant going out and buying the computer, plugging it in, installing a bazillion things on it, and forever making sure no one pulled out the plug by mistake. I’m not even getting into the bureaucracy of procuring said computer. As companies started churning out more and more software, this got to be a real problem. With the rise of the cloud, today the application developer could herself set up a new computer with no more than a few clicks of the mouse. No fuss at all. <strong>The cloud has commoditized hardware and the operations around it.</strong></p>
<p>To understand the rise of cloud computing, let’s look a little bit at the history of computers and their use.</p>
<hr>
<p>The first programmable computer was (arguably) the one developed by Alan Turing’s team in Bletchley Park as part of the allied effort at intelligence gathering in WW2. “<strong>Programmable Computer</strong>” means that this was a machine that could be arranged to do any calculation. Configured one way, it could crack the Nazi ENIGMA code. Set up another way, it could compute the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/03/six-things-probably-didnt-know-pi/">value of Pi</a> to the umpy-umpth decimal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is remarkable by itself because most machines now or since do only one thing. A screwdriver, a bulldozer, an airplane, all of them do exactly one thing. Even the “swiss knife” is a collection of many machines, each for one purpose. So this “programmable computer” was a breakthrough in its own right because you could get it to do anything by programming it in different ways.</p>
<p>Anyhow, with a dazzling array of innovations in hardware and computer science, it came to be that computers became commonplace. They could be found in people’s homes, and what we know today as Silicon Valley was beginning to take shape. However, access to computers at the scale at which this new computing revolution wanted it was still not easy. You could easily buy a computer for your home or office, but buying 50 computers was still a pain. Marc Randolph recounts the story from the launch day of Netflix in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07QRVWBX2?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=kislayverma-21&amp;camp=3638&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=B07QRVWBX2">That will never work</a> about how his team were constantly rushing out to buy more computers from a neighbourhood shop because of the unexpectedly large number of people visiting the website.</p>
<p>Since this buy-on-demand model did not work very well, software companies started buying and keeping computers in their office (this is still done widely and is called <strong>on-premise/on-prem</strong>). IT teams would set up the computers, power system, air conditioning, cable layouts, failsafes etc in some designated area in the office. This meant that the company always had a buffer stock of computing power at hand. The cost of this was the capital tied up in all the servers whether being used or not.</p>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/on-prem-deployments-1013x1024.jpg" alt="" width="514" height="519" srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/on-prem-deployments-1013x1024.jpg 1013w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/on-prem-deployments-297x300.jpg 297w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/on-prem-deployments-150x150.jpg 150w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/on-prem-deployments-768x776.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/on-prem-deployments-1070x1081.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/on-prem-deployments.jpg 1233w" sizes="(max-width: 514px) 100vw, 514px"></figure></div>
<p>And you know what the sneaky software developers did (and have been doing since)? They found out that getting computers wouldn’t be so much of a pain anymore, so they started churning out even more software. Sooo much more of it. Easy supply further fuelled the hunger for computational resources.</p>

<p>The other problem for companies was that off-the-shelf computers came in certain specific sizes. Roughly speaking, <strong>a computer is made up of storage (Hard disk), computing power (CPU cores), memory (RAM) and the network (LAN/Internet)</strong>. But in the new digital age, all kinds of programs were being written which demanded each of these in different combinations. Some wanted a lot of network but didn’t do much computing (Netflix, Zoom), some stored a lot of data but didn’t have to be fast (data backup systems), and so on.</p>
<p>Most companies couldn’t afford to keep all combinations of such machines at hand. It was too expensive to buy and they would have had to keep a team of engineers for this alone. So some smart folks at IBM, the premier computing company of its time, came up with the idea of <strong>Virtualization</strong>. Virtualization allowed us to hide multiple computers and all their resources behind a curtain and think in terms of their aggregate resources. E.g. Ten 4 core computers with 8 GB RAM and 256 GB storage each became a collection of 40 cores, 80 GB RAM, and 2560GB of storage which could be parcelled out into “<strong>virtual machines</strong>” as per the programmer’s requirement. e.g. All of the above mentioned resources could be combined to make 2 huge virtual machines (aka VMs) of 20 cores, 40 GB RAM, and 1280GB storage. Wide adoption of virtualization has since hidden the actual computers (aka <strong>bare metal</strong>) from the programmers view.</p>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtualization-1024x753.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="338" srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtualization-1024x753.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtualization-300x220.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtualization-768x564.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtualization-1536x1129.jpg 1536w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtualization-1070x786.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtualization.jpg 1664w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px"></figure></div>
<p>While virtualization gave organization’s huge leeway in terms of deploying computational resources efficiently, it also introduced a huge “<strong>Virtualization Layer</strong>” to the already complex stack of hundreds, sometimes thousands of computers they were running. Some companies were reaching the stage where they couldn’t house all their servers in their offices and had to open up <strong>data-centers</strong> (separate facilities for storing and operating all the servers). This was obviously a huge capital investment and distraction for these companies. They didn’t want to be in the business of running hardware, but they had no choice.</p>
<p>Around the dot com crash of the 90s, some companies (especially Amazon) had a lot of computers and expertise in operating them, and were looking to make some money. They realized that with the internet potentially connecting all computers of the world to each other, they could not only rent out their servers to people who needed to use them, but also sell their expertise in operating them reliably as a service with the hardware. This was the origin of the <strong>cloud</strong> (or <strong>cloud computing</strong> or <strong>cloud services</strong>) as we know it today.</p>
<p>The users of the cloud (the renters of the servers) essentially reach out into the Cloud to lay their hands on mostly Virtual Machines as per their computing needs without worrying about where they kept, which brand they are, and whether they are connected to the power supply or not. Cloud companies like AWS, Azure, GCP, Digital Ocean (where this blog is hosted) take care of all that so we can just focus on running the cool Facemash applications we have written. Users pay an hourly, or monthly, or some other sort of recurring charge based on their usage of these machines. No more scrambling around to buy computers, connect them etc etc. With heavy automation, today even individual developers can manage more computing power than entire teams not too long ago.</p>

<p>In the last decade, this process of cloudification has gone beyond hardware and even into the realm of software. Most cloud providers have “<strong>managed services</strong>” under which they provide well set up and maintained installations of the most commonly used software already running. We don’t even have to set up this software now – we just rent a running version of it for our own purposes -as if it was a physical thing. This is a huge blessing for startups since some of the most commonly used types of software like databases, firewalls, caches, message queues are available at only a few clicks notice and don’t have to be installed and operated. The barrier to entry in the software world has never been lower with more and more of the grunt work being moved off to the cloud.</p>
<p>Think of cloud hardware and software in terms of the “<a href="https://kislayverma.com/for-the-layman/for-the-layman-ep-1-what-is-a-distributed-system/">distributed car</a>” I had discussed in a previous article. The engine, the wheels, the fuel injection system etc are all in the cloud now, and you can have as many of them as you can pay for. As the car maker, you can now focus on your unique value addition – the branding, the interiors and leather seats, the new electric battery that only you hold the patent to, and so on.</p>
<p>Today, the cloud is part of the internet’s infrastructure like highways or schools for the real world. Most people want highways and schools as a means to an end. They don’t want to have to build them themselves. The cloud plays the same role for anyone that wants to build software. The result – omnipresent software and huge cloud provider bills 🙂</p>

	<p>Looking at Mozilla’s finances, it’s reasonable to conclude that Google is keeping them on life support to keep the anti-trust hounds at bay. Mozilla’s deal with Google will account for at least 70% of their revenues going forward. That’s over $400 million to be the default search provider in 4% of browsers. For 1 year. I’ll bet my next paycheck that Google reupped this rather generous agreement to avoid a repeat of Microsoft’s troubles over an Internet Explorer monopoly. My guess is that Google will decide it’s in their interest to pull the plug right around the time this latest wave of anti-trust talk blows over.</p>

<p>With the troubles at Mozilla, Google is one step closer to replicating the WeChat and Facebook walled-garden model on the Web. A quick survey a the field of play shows just how far Google has come in capturing the once open Web.</p>

<h2 id="browser-war-is-over">(Browser) War is over</h2>

<p>Chrome’s ability to dictate web standards will only get stronger over time. Safari and Firefox have been able to apply some shame to Chrome on things like disabling third-party cookies, but soon it’ll just be Apple left with a voice.</p>

<p>But Google doesn’t even need Chrome to dictate standards since it controls the Web’s front door. AMP, a technology no one asked for, is now on over 70% of all marketing websites for no other reason than Google said so.</p>

<p>And let’s not forget that most people now access the web via mobile devices, 75% of which run Google’s Android.</p>

<h2 id="original-sins">Original Sins</h2>

<p>Two deficiencies have determined the course the Web has taken: lack of native search and lack of native payments.</p>

<p>Lacking native distributed search allowed Google to grab a monopoly position as the entry point to the web. The Web’s orignal architects were off base on hyperlinks; it turns out people just want to skip right to the answer they’re looking for. There was once the beginnings of an alternative in public bookmarking sites, but social networks came and sucked all the air out of that space.</p>

<p>Lack of a safe and easy way of exchanging funds was a big factor in advertising becoming the dominant business model on the Web. No-charge services became the norm because, for a long time, there was no reasonable way to pay for them. Enter advertising to fill the void. I think it’s safe to say that Google’s AdWords is the dominant advertising platform on the open Web, which means it holds a commanding position in the Web’s finances.</p>

<p>I’m also going to throw in an honorable mention to poor native video support (it is hyper_text_ after all). It’s beating a dead horse to point out that Google also serves up the vast majority of videos streamed on the Web.</p>

<h2 id="so-then">So then…</h2>

<p>So Google controls the Web’s search and video infrastructure. It can and does dictate standards and media formats. It also controls a huge chunk of the revenues available when publishing and selling on the Web. It even controls the operating system and browser through which most people interact with it.</p>

<p>Google’s capture of the Web is a <em>fait accompli</em>. Only legislation will keep the World Wide Web from finally becoming Web by Google (TM).</p>

	<h4>The wisdom is that BGP is the only Datacenter protocol, but is it? Do we know?</h4>

          <p>I worked at Amazon for 17 years as a network engineer. Now I’m out of Amazon and looking at the industry, I’m learning new things. <strong>One of the things I’ve learned recently is that OSPF shouldn’t be used for Clos leaf-spine networks because of scale.</strong> I’ve heard that it can’t keep up with the size and scale of the modern datacenter networks. <a href="https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/release-independent/solutions/topics/task/configuration/ip-fabric-underlay-cloud-dc-configuring.html">Juniper IP Fabric Underlay Network Design and Implementation</a> is an example of the recommendation.  <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7938">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7938</a> is what as used as the reference for using eBGP to be the routing protocol inside of large Clos networks.</p>

<p><strong>This is a shock to me</strong> since we built large OSPF Clos networks a decade ago. We built networks this way with hundreds of routers (even thousands) speaking OSPF. I’m not saying it is easy or that we didn’t have to understand OSPF well; If you don’t design it well, you get a flooding disaster. But if you do set it up right, it works really well. It converges quickly and doesn’t collapse under failure. The key thing is to be sure you understand how flooding works and you focus on areas and summarization. There are different things you have to be aware of when you are designing a Clos network with BGP vs OSPF. With BGP you have to be figure out how to mitigate path hunting. With OSPF need to work on how to avoid congestion collapse.</p>

<p>There is also work on building new protocols for these large Clos or Clos-like networks, such as <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/rift/documents/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/rift/documents/</a>. I don’t understand why OSPF or ISIS isn’t good enough so I don’t understand why these are necessary. There <a href="https://pc.nanog.org/static/published/meetings/NANOG74/1763/20181003_Martin_Routing_In_Dense_v1.pdf">are some good ideas in RIFT</a>, I’m just haven’t seen a reason to use it.</p>

<p>When we did this we were using CPUs from 2003 and we were using a lesser known OSPF stack. It’s OSPF implementation was okay, but we were strongly warned away from using their BGP implementation by the developers. <strong>We had to understand and mitigate risk</strong>. We had to test it as well as we could and be very careful in our first deployments. The stack had never been battle tested like this before. We still ran into some scary performance issues but got to work with great software engineers on the protocol stack to work through problems and figure out our scale.</p>

<p>Others agree with me, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qmvg2mnbcPg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qmvg2mnbcPg</a>, even though they are mostly focusing on smaller networks than I was working on. But either way, OSPF can be made to work just fine on very large (or small) Clos networks.</p>

<p>As an example of the scale, this is a generic 24 port 3-tier Clos. It is possible to make OSPF work on this. This is smaller than what we were working on in 2012.
<img src="https://elegantnetwork.github.io/assets/images/24port-3tier-clos-resize.png" alt="24 port 3-tier clos"></p>

<p>To understand and then mitigate the risks an unknown OSPF stack, at scale, is why I started building a configuration management system and started <a href="https://elegantnetwork.github.io/posts/Network-Validation-with-Vagrant/">simulating our network design</a>. We needed to understand how any OSPF protocol stack would work. Could we make the protocol scale at all? We needed to see what would actually happen with a real OSPF implementation. <strong>I cannot stress enough how important this simulation was.</strong> We did not understand the problem of flooding and we did not understand the solution until we had tried it out in simulation.</p>

<p>Before that, though, we spent a lot of time on white boards arguing about topology and OSPF. <strong>I think whiteboards are the most important tool for network design</strong> currently available, which makes me sad. I wish that wasn’t true, I want much better tools. I can’t even tell you the number of disasters averted by 2-3 great network engineers arguing over a whiteboard. This works really well, but there are important reasons it’s not good enough. One is that for many of these discussions, it’s extremely hard to get data to make the decisions. In this case, a comparison of convergence time and failure detection in a 3-tier Clos with eBGP, iBGP, and OSPF should be required, but we didn’t have that capability.</p>

<p>In a dense mesh-like network such as a Clos network, the concerns around OSPF swirled around four main issues: the effect of flooding, the size of the link state database, the speed of SPF calculations, and the ability for OSPF to carry a large number of prefixes. We were concerned about OSPF scaling w.r.t. its flooding and it’s the flooding that is expensive with a Link State Database protocol, not the Shortest Path First (SPF) calculations. Which means you have to be very careful about what is flooded, what are the areas, and how things are summarized. I didn’t understand this until I had a simulation and I could try things out with areas or without, and the effect was dramatic. I think it’s often true that there is a part of a design that you don’t understand, which is one of the big reasons to do simulation. We didn’t have the ability to lab up a network as big as we were going to be building, so the simulation was critical. I can’t even imagine what we would have done without it. Based on the simulation, we created targeted tests for real hardware to understand how it would deal with the scale.</p>

<p>The point of this article is not that OSPF is better than BGP, but that it does work in very large size Clos networks. I’m frustrated that so much of the industry went a direction without great data or analysis, just following one set of opinions and design choices. <strong>I wish there were easy ways for people to be able to design, simulate and test different designs</strong> like this so that they could decide for themselves the tradeoffs they’d like to make, rather than have to rely on some type of industry hype. There needs to be a better way to be able to describe topologies and designs so that it’s really easy to try out different ideas.</p>

<p>If you have other considerations, such as you want to run IPv6, or EVPN, a single instance of eBGP such as the one popularized by the open source routing suite, FRR, maybe the simplest or elegant. But with proper design, scale is not the reason to use BGP over OSPF. If you are running a small Clos network and don’t have IPv6 or EVPN, OSPF is more straightforward and generally faster, as was the common practice before the advent of BGP in the data center.</p>

<p>No matter what, you need to understand the choices that you are making and understand the tradeoffs. This is hard to do, and especially hard in networking because we lack design patterns and good tools to help us understand the implications of our choices.</p>

<p>If anybody knows about tools or design patterns or even somebody who’s actually compared OSPF vs BGP in Clos networks with data, I’d love to hear about it.</p>

        <p><span>T</span>he atmosphere is such a roiling mess that it defies analysis even by todayâ€™s most sophisticated meteorological algorithms. But its complexity didnâ€™t stop the French scientist Pierre-Simon Laplace from cracking one simple aspect of atmospheric behavior in the late 1700s. Despite never seeing a global weather map, Laplace developed a theory predicting that continent-size pressure waves would periodically sweep around the globe.&nbsp;<br></p>
<ul><li> is a journalist covering developments in the physical sciences both on and off the planet. His work has appeared in <span>Scientific American, The Christian Science Monitor</span> and <span>LiveScience</span>, among other publications. Previously, he taught physics and English in Mozambique and Japan, and he has a bachelorâ€™s in physics from Brown University.</li></ul>
<p>â€œAtmospheric modeling of the pencil-and-paper kind was pretty damn crude until the 20th century, and yet Laplace managed to do this,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.atmos.colostate.edu/people/faculty/randall/" target="_blank">David Randall</a>, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University. â€œI think itâ€™s astounding.â€�</p>
<p><a href="https://library.si.edu/digital-library/book/traite-de-mecanique-celeste" target="_blank">Laplaceâ€™s ideas</a>&nbsp;launched a centuries-long quest to find such waves. But the oscillations proved as gentle as they are giant, stubbornly refusing to reveal themselves even to some of the biggest names in the physical sciences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At last, the search is over. An exquisite new meteorological data set has uncovered what millions of barometer readings missed: an ensemble of waves that race around the Earth, covering it in a patchwork quilt of high- and low-pressure zones. The detection is a stunning vindication of a vintage theory.</p>
<p>â€œThis a really beautiful piece of work,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="https://acee.princeton.edu/directory/leo-donner/" target="_blank">Leo Donner</a>, a geophysicist at Princeton University who was not involved in the study.</p>
<p><strong>The Planetâ€™s Piano Strings</strong></p>
<p>Laplace wondered to what degree the moon gravitationally squeezes the air surrounding our planet, and he set out to analyze the types of waves that might emerge as a consequence. He imagined the atmosphere as a thin fluid on a smooth sphere, and he concluded that gravity should pin one class of waves to the ground, where they would move more or less horizontally—two-dimensional undulations that hug the planetâ€™s surface. â€œHe was really the first guy with this picture in his mind,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="http://iprc.soest.hawaii.edu/users/kph/" target="_blank">Kevin Hamilton</a>, a professor emeritus at the University of Hawaiâ€˜i, MÄ�noa and co-author of the study. â€œIt was an amazing insight.â€�</p>
<p>Laplace didnâ€™t name these waves or work out their behavior in detail, but modern atmospheric scientists now describe them as â€œnormal modesâ€�—waves that resonate like the ringing of a bell. The simplest mode raises the pressure in one hemisphere and lowers it in the other. More energetic modes create checkered patterns of smaller zones of high and low pressure. They race around the globe at speeds exceeding those of most passenger planes, mainly eastward and westward.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/abstractions_bc542a8209f391f0e17d773f1de150e9.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-08-15 at 11.13.12 PM"><figcaption><span>High pressure (red) and low pressure (blue) waves travel around Earth. These four globes represent four different modes of the pressure waves. </span><br><span>T. Sakazaki and K. Hamilton, doi:10.1175/JAS-D-20-0053.1</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Though Laplace started by thinking of the influence of the moon, the waves arise more from Earthâ€™s general pandemonium: Storms rage. Winds slam into mountain ranges. Turbulence stirs the pot further. Some portion of the energy from these collective abuses fires up the normal modes, which are the only tones at which the atmosphere can respond. â€œItâ€™s like a kitten walking on the keys of the piano,â€� Randall said. â€œThe random forcing can show you what strings are in the piano.â€�<br></p>
<p>Laplace put the idea into peopleâ€™s heads that such waves might exist, and his mathematics gave physicists the tools to calculate the atmosphereâ€™s tuning. But would anybody be able to hear its notes?</p>
<p>Around the same time that Laplace came out with his model, explorers and naturalists including Alexander von Humboldt noticed that pressure in the tropics rose and fell every 12 hours. The daily timing linked the changes to heating from the sun, but theorists couldnâ€™t explain why the effect was so large. The mystery continued to puzzle scientists for nearly a century, until Lord Kelvin guessed in 1882 that the sunâ€™s heating cycle resonated with one of Laplaceâ€™s â€œfree oscillations.â€� He thought that the sun could deliver an outsized push because it created vibrations at precisely the frequency of one of Laplaceâ€™s oscillations, much as an opera singer can shatter a wine glass with the right pitch. His proposition turned out to be wrong—researchers in the 1960s determined that a more complicated phenomenon amplifies the solar influence—but it spurred scientists to work out the quantitative details of Laplaceâ€™s theory and calculate exactly what frequencies the normal modes should have.<br></p>
<p>The lowest notes matching those predictions wouldnâ€™t enter the scientific record until the 1980s,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jmsj1965/58/4/58_4_281/_article" target="_blank">first from an analysis by Taroh Matsuno</a>, a Japanese meteorologist, and&nbsp;<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JD091iD11p11867" target="_blank">later from another</a>&nbsp;by Hamilton and Rolando Garcia, now at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Hamilton and Garcia stumbled upon the ideal data set: a weather station in colonial Indonesia that carried out hourly pressure measurements over the better part of a century, missing just two readings in 79 years.</p>
<p>The record was as meticulous as it was prolonged, with researchers relying on a microscope to log shifts of mercury as fine as one-hundredth of an inch. Analyzing this and other data sets, Hamilton and Garcia were able to just make out traces of one of the longest normal modes.</p>
<p>The shorter waves seemed beyond reach until last year, when the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts released a data set called ERA5. The product blends readings from thousands of ground stations, weather balloons and satellites, and it uses weather models to intelligently fill in the blanks. The result is a data set aiming to reconstruct the same information that would have been captured by a global network of weather stations spaced every 10 kilometers and taking readings every hour from 1979 to 2016.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/50503904-Takatoshi-Sakazaki" target="_blank">Takatoshi Sakazaki</a>, an assistant professor at Kyoto University in Japan, wasnâ€™t looking for Laplaceâ€™s waves when ERA5 came out. He was initially focused on temperature variations, and he viewed the pressure peaks as unwelcome noise. But when he realized they might be normal modes, he laid them over the theoretical expectations, and voila: â€œI found they almost perfectly matched,â€� he said.</p>
<p>Sakazaki wasnâ€™t sure how significant his find was, so he reached out to Hamilton, who had been his postdoctoral research adviser, to check if the peaks might be of interest.</p>
<p>They were. Hamilton had spent decades prior to 1980 sifting through weather station data for hints of the lowest atmospheric tones. Now in his inbox he suddenly had evidence of the full symphony.</p>
<p>Sakazaki and Hamilton worked together to analyze the full three-dimensional structure of the waves in excruciating detail; they&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/jas/article/77/7/2519/347483/An-Array-of-Ringing-Global-Free-Modes-Discovered" target="_blank">published</a>&nbsp;their findings in the July 2020&nbsp;issue of the&nbsp;<em>Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences</em>. Their research details the behavior of many dozens of waves beyond the few found in the 1980s. Some of the highest-energy waves cycle from high pressure to low pressure a dozen times as they stretch around the planet; additional sets of waves get spun off by Earthâ€™s rotation. All their results precisely match predictions based on Laplaceâ€™s equations. â€œI just imagined when I saw this,â€� Hamilton said, â€œthat Laplace and Kelvin and those guys would be excited to see something like this.â€�</p>

<p>Looking at some “exciting” <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/whatsnew/3.8.html">features landing in Python 3.8</a>, I’m still disappointed and frustrated by the language… like by quite a few other languages.</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="7204" data-permalink="https://ilya-sher.org/chimpanzee-978809_640/" data-orig-file="https://ilyasherdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/chimpanzee-978809_640.jpg" data-orig-size="640,640" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;5.6&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D7000&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;200&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.0015625&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="chimpanzee-978809_640" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://ilyasherdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/chimpanzee-978809_640.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://ilyasherdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/chimpanzee-978809_640.jpg?w=640" src="https://ilyasherdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/chimpanzee-978809_640.jpg?w=640" alt="" srcset="https://ilyasherdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/chimpanzee-978809_640.jpg 640w, https://ilyasherdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/chimpanzee-978809_640.jpg?w=150 150w, https://ilyasherdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/chimpanzee-978809_640.jpg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure></div>



<p>As an author of another programming language, I can’t stop thinking about how things “should have been done” from my perspective. I want to be explicit here. My perspective is <strong>biased</strong> towards correctness and “WTF are you doing?”. Therefore, take everything here with a appropriate amount of salt.</p>



<p>Yes, not talking about any “positive” changes here.</p>



<h2>Assignment Expressions</h2>



<blockquote><p>There is new syntax <code>:=</code> that assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression.</p></blockquote>



<p>A fix which couldn’t be the best because of previous design decision.</p>



<p>“Somebody” ignored the wisdom of Lisp, which was “everything is an expression and evaluates to a value” (no statements vs expressions), and made assignment a statement in Python years ago. Now this can not be fixed in a straightforward manner. It must be another syntax. Two different syntaxes for almost the same thing which is <code>=</code> for assignment as a statement and <code>:=</code> for expression assignment.</p>



<h2>Positional-only Parameters</h2>



<blockquote><p>There is a new function parameter syntax <code>/</code> to indicate that some function parameters must be specified positionally and cannot be used as keyword arguments:</p></blockquote>



<pre><code>def f(a, b, /, c, d, *, e, f):
    print(a, b, c, d, e, f)</code></pre>



<p>Trying to clean up a mess created by mixing positional and named parameters. Unfortunately I did not give it enough thought at the time and copied parameters handling behaviour from Python. Now <a href="https://ngs-lang.org/">NGS</a> also has the same problem as Python had before 3.8. Hopefully, I will be able to fix it in some more elegant way than Python did.</p>



<h2>LRU cache</h2>



<blockquote><p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache"><code>functools.lru_cache()</code></a> can now be used as a straight decorator rather than as a function returning a decorator. So both of these are now supported</p></blockquote>



<p>OK. Bug fix. But … (functools.py)</p>



<pre><code>    if isinstance(maxsize, int):
        # Negative maxsize is treated as 0
        if maxsize &lt; 0:
            maxsize = 0</code></pre>



<p>If you are setting LRU cache size to a negative number, it’s 99% by mistake. In NGS that would be an exception. That’s the approach that causes <code>rm -rf $myfolder/</code> to remove <code>/</code> when <code>myfolder</code> is unset. Note that the <code>maxsize</code> code is not new but it’s still there in Python 3.8. I guess that is another mistake which can not be easily fixed now because that would break “working” code.</p>



<h2>Collections</h2>



<blockquote><p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/collections.html#collections.somenamedtuple._asdict"><code>_asdict()</code></a> method for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple"><code>collections.namedtuple()</code></a> now returns a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/stdtypes.html#dict"><code>dict</code></a> instead of a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict"><code>collections.OrderedDict</code></a>. This works because regular dicts have guaranteed ordering since Python 3.7</p></blockquote>



<p>OK. Everybody had the mistake of making maps unordered: Perl, Ruby, Python.</p>



<ol><li>Ruby <a href="https://www.igvita.com/2009/02/04/ruby-19-internals-ordered-hash/">fixed that with the release of version 1.9</a> in 2008 (according to the post).</li><li>Python <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/">fixed that with the release of version 3.7</a> in 2018 (which I take as 10 years of “f*ck you, the developer”).</li><li>Perl <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/keys.html">keeps using unordered maps according to documentation</a>.</li><li>Same for Raku, again according to <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/hashmap">the documentation</a>.</li></ol>



<p>NGS had ordered maps from the start but that’s not a fair comparison because NGS project started in 2013, when the mistake was already understood.</p>



<hr>



<p>How all that helps you, the reader? I encourage deeper thinking about the choice of programming languages that you use. From my perspective, all languages suck, while NGS aims to suck less than the rest for the intended <a href="https://github.com/ngs-lang/ngs/wiki/Use-Cases">use cases</a> (tl;dr – for DevOps scripting).</p>



<hr>



<h2>Update 2020-08-16</h2>



<p>Discussions:</p>



<ol><li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24176823">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24176823</a></li><li><a href="https://lobste.rs/s/rgcgjz/python_3_8_makes_me_sad_again">https://lobste.rs/s/rgcgjz/python_3_8_makes_me_sad_again</a></li></ol>



<h2>Update 2020-08-17</h2>



<p>It looks like the article above needs some clarification about my perspective: background, what I am doing and why.</p>



<h3>TL;DR</h3>



<p>The main points of the article are:</p>



<ol><li>Everything still sucks, including Python. By sucks I mean does not fit well with the tasks I need to do neither aligned with how I think about these tasks.</li><li>I am trying to help the situation and the industry by developing my own programming language</li></ol>



<h3>Background about my Thinking</h3>



<p>In general, I’m amazed with how bad the overall state of programming is. That includes:</p>



<ol><li>All programming languages that I know including my own NGS. This is aggravated by inability to fix anything properly for any language with substantial amount of code written in it because you will be breaking existing code. And if you do break, you get the shitstorm like with Python 3 or Perl 6 (Raku).</li><li><a href="https://github.com/MohGovIL/hamagen-react-native/issues/115">Code quality</a> of the programs written in all languages. Most of the code that I have seen is bad. Sometimes even in <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/cpp-docs/issues/1929">official examples</a>.</li><li>Quality of available materials, which are sometimes <a href="https://dev.to/ilya_sher_prog/comment/m9oe">plainly wrong</a>.</li><li>Many of existing “Infrastructure as code” solutions, which in most cases follow the same path:<ol><li>Invent  a DSL or use YAML.</li><li>“figure out” later that it’s not powerful enough (by the way there is an elegant solution – a programming language, forgot the name)</li><li>Create pretty ugly programming language on top of a DSL that was intended for data.</li></ol></li></ol>



<p>I am creating new programming language and a shell out of <strong>frustration with current situation, especially with bash and Python</strong>. Why these two? Because that’s what I was and still using to get my tasks done.</p>



<p>Are these languages bad? I don’t think it’s a question with any good answers. <a href="https://ilya-sher.org/2017/10/10/why-i-have-no-favorite-programming-language/">These languages don’t fit the tasks that I’m trying to do</a> nor are aligned with how I think while being apparently one of the best choices available.</p>



<h3>This Article Background</h3>



<ol><li>Seen some post on RSS about new features in Python 3.8.</li><li>Took a look.</li><li>Yep, everything is still f*cked up.</li><li>Wrote a post about it which was not meant to be “deep discussion about Python flaws”.</li></ol>



<p>I was not planning to invest more time in this but here I am trying to clarify.</p>



<h3>And your Language is Better? Really?</h3>



<p>Let’s clarify “better”.  For me, it’s to suck less than the rest for the intended use cases.</p>



<blockquote><p>author really does consider himself a superior language designer than the Python core-dev team</p></blockquote>



<p>( From <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/iartgp/python_38_makes_me_sad_again/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/iartgp/python_38_makes_me_sad_again/</a> )</p>



<p>I consider myself in much easier circumstances:</p>



<ol><li>No substantial amount of code is written in NGS yet.</li><li>I’m starting later and therefore have the advantage of looking at more languages, avoiding bad parts, copying (with adaptation) the good parts.</li><li>NGS targets a niche, it’s not intended to be general purpose language. Choices are clearer and easier when you target a niche.</li><li>The language that I’m creating is almost by definition is more aligned with how I think. Hoping that people out there will benefit from using NGS if it is more aligned with how they think too.</li><li>See also my <a href="https://ilya-sher.org/2016/10/28/creating-a-language-is-easier-now/">Creating a language is easier&nbsp;now</a> (2016) post.</li></ol>



<p>Will I be able to make a “better” language?</p>



<p><strong>From technical perspective</strong>, that’s probable: I am a skilled programmer in several languages and I have languages to look at more than everybody else had before. My disadvantage is not much experience in language design. I’m trying to offset that with thinking hard (<a href="https://github.com/ngs-lang/ngs/wiki#design-documents">about the language</a>, the essence of <a href="https://ilya-sher.org/2019/05/18/on-information-loss-in-software/">what is being expressed</a>, common patterns, etc), looking at other languages and experimenting.</p>



<p><strong>From marketing perspective</strong>, I need to learn a lot. I am aware that “technically better” doesn’t matter as much as I would like to. Without community and users that would be a failed project.</p>



<p>Also don’t forget luck which I might or might not have.</p>



<h3>What if NGS fails?</h3>



<p>I think that the situation today is unbearable. I’m trying to fix it. I feel like I have to, despite the odds. I hope that even if NGS fails to move the industry forward it would be useful to somebody who will attempt that later.</p>

<p><strong>Simple Android* MVI architecture using kotlin flows</strong></p>
<p><em>* The library is platform-neutral but was designed with Android in mind</em></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="groovy"><span>dependencies</span> <span>{</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Check our <a href="https://github.com/pedroql/mvflow/releases">releases on github</a> to see what’s new.</p>
<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>
<p>We set off with the objective of creating a minimalistic library, simple yet with all the
capabilities you need.</p>
<h3 id="minimalistic-yet-complete-">Minimalistic yet complete</h3>
<p>MVFlow has a very small API surface. It strives to be the smallest conceivable MVI library that could exist.
In just a few minutes you will know everything there is to know about the API!</p>
<h3 id="simple-">Simple</h3>
<p>The library introduces few - if any - new concepts outside MVI,
<a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/basics.html">Kotlin coroutines</a>, and
<a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/flow.html">Kotlin flows</a>.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with those concepts, you can start using the library without a problem; if you are new to some of these
concepts, you will be able to apply those concepts outside this library too.</p>
<h3 id="coroutines-and-flows-as-powerful-abstractions-">Coroutines and flows as powerful abstractions</h3>
<p>Any MVI library needs to accomplish the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Manage the current state (Model in MVI)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Call a render function when the state changes (View in MVI)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Detect user interactions (Intent in MVI)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Process user intents, potentially mutating the current state</p>
</li>
</ul>


<p>We believe that coroutines and flows are extremely powerful concepts that can be applied to this architecture.
They enable us to build a very powerful API with a small and simple surface.</p>
<p>Here are some advantages that they bring:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Coroutines make asynchronous calls very simple to write and easy to reason about;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flows are a great abstraction to represent user events (clicks) and updates from background work;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coroutine scopes make handling the lifecycle of requests very simple</p>
<ul>
<li>For example: if you have pending work for a particular screen, and the user presses back, by
cancelling that screen’s coroutine, all related jobs and listeners are cancelled too.

</ul>
<h3 id="with-mvflow-you-are-in-control--">With MVFlow you are in control </h3>
<p>The library only gives you an implementation of MVI, but doesn’t force you into specific patterns other than using MVI
and coroutines.</p>
<p>You are free to use dependency injection your way; you are free to do navigation your way; plug your
logging framework (or not). You can use data stores, use cases, interactors, or any other abstraction to get and
manipulate your data.</p>
<p>MVFlow plays well with Android’s ViewModel, but you don’t have to use it.</p>
<h2 id="what-if-i-am-new-to-mvi-coroutines-or-flows">What if I am new to MVI, coroutines, or flows?</h2>
<p>There are plenty of guides introducing these concepts. We are still working on a brief introduction to MVI,
meanwhile we suggest you read the following articles:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://hannesdorfmann.com/android/model-view-intent">Model-view-intent on Android</a> by Hannes Dorfmann - one of the
first posts (if not the first) about MVI</p>

</ul>

<p>For learning about coroutines and flows, the official guides are a good source of information:</p>

</li>

<p><a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/flow.html">Flow official guide</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="api">API</h2>
<h3 id="view">View</h3>
<p>The library has two main interfaces: <code>MVFlow</code> and <code>MVFlow.View</code>. Let’s take a look at the view first:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="kotlin"><span>interface</span> <span>View</span><span>&lt;</span><span>State</span><span>,</span> <span>Action</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>fun</span> <span>render</span><span>(</span><span>state</span><span>:</span> <span>State</span><span>)</span>

    <span>fun</span> <span>actions</span><span>():</span> <span>Flow</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Action</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, this is a very simple interface: any view needs to know how to render a given state (which is a generic
class defined by you) and creates a flow of actions which
report the user interactions with the UI.</p>
<p>Read the article <a href="https://pedroql.github.io/mvflow/implementing-your-view-actions-flow/">implementing your view actions flow</a> to see how you
can implement the actions method.</p>
<p>Let’s implement a simple screen with a list of users. The current state indicates whether it is loading information, the
users that were loaded (if any) and a error message (if any):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="kotlin"><span>data</span> <span>class</span> <span>User</span><span>(</span> 
     <span>// ... 
</span><span></span><span>)</span>

<span>data</span> <span>class</span> <span>State</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>val</span> <span>users</span><span>:</span> <span>List</span><span>&lt;</span><span>User</span><span>&gt;?,</span>
    <span>val</span> <span>isLoading</span><span>:</span> <span>Boolean</span><span>,</span>
    <span>val</span> <span>errorMessage</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>?</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The possible actions are loading users (say, by pressing a button or doing a pull-to-refresh gesture) and selecting a
user by tapping on its row:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="kotlin"><span>sealed</span> <span>class</span> <span>Action</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>object</span> <span>LoadUsers</span> <span>:</span> <span>Action</span><span>()</span>
    <span>data</span> <span>class</span> <span>UserSelection</span><span>(</span><span>val</span> <span>user</span><span>:</span> <span>User</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>Action</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><h3 id="handler">Handler</h3>
<p>So now that we have a view, we can render the UI and send actions into a flow when the user interacts with the app.</p>
<p>The next step is doing something with those actions. Typically, this involves doing some operation like a network or
database call, and we might want to change the current state from said jobs.</p>
<p>This is where <code>Handler</code> comes in. To keep things simple, this is just a lambda but it is type-aliased for more
meaningful parameter names:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="kotlin"><span>typealias</span> <span>Handler</span><span>&lt;</span><span>State</span><span>,</span> <span>Action</span><span>,</span> <span>Mutation</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>State</span><span>,</span> <span>Action</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Flow</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Mutation</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Reading that aloud, we see that a handler is a function that receives the current state and an action the user just
performed. The handler performs what this action requires (e.g. making a network call) and returns a flow of mutations.
A mutation is the information of what needs to change in the current state.
When the handler completes the network request, it can emit a value into the mutation flow to update the state.</p>
<p>Continuing our example, there are three reasons to change the state: we started loading data, we received an error from
the request or we received data (new users) from the request:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="kotlin"><span>sealed</span> <span>class</span> <span>Mutation</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>object</span> <span>StartedLoading</span> <span>:</span> <span>Mutation</span><span>()</span>
   <span>data</span> <span>class</span> <span>ErrorLoading</span><span>(</span><span>val</span> <span>message</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>Mutation</span><span>()</span>
   <span>data</span> <span>class</span> <span>UsersReceived</span><span>(</span><span>val</span> <span>users</span><span>:</span> <span>List</span><span>&lt;</span><span>User</span><span>&gt;)</span> <span>:</span> <span>Mutation</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>

</code></pre></div><h3 id="reducer">Reducer</h3>
<p>Right now we have a view rendering the state and telling us of actions performed by the user. We also have a handler
that is receiving those actions and acting on them. The handler emits mutations that we already know will be used to
update the current state.</p>
<p>Now the reducer enters the stage:</p>
<p>A reducer is just another function that receives the current state and a mutation. It will combine both, producing
the a new state the succeeds the current one.</p>
<p><em>Note: although the handler receives the current state when an action is performed, if the handler performs a slow
operation, the handler will no longer know the most recent state. This is why the handler can’t mutate the state
directly.</em></p>

<p>At this point we have explained the main MVI components. The final step is assembling them together so that actions are
sent to the handler, mutations are sent to the reducer, and new states are sent to the view.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>All you need to do is to create a <code>MVFlow</code> object and call <code>takeView</code> on it. And the loop will start!</p>

</code></pre></div><p>If you are wondering what <code>Logger</code> is, that is just a method that receives one <code>String</code>. The library will call this
with logging information and you can decide to print this to the logs or not.</p>
<h3 id="special-effects">Special effects</h3>
<p>Effects are an optional feature that can be very useful for UI-related operations like showing
Toasts and navigating to new screens.</p>
<p>Because the handler may have a different lifecycle from the view, it should not perform these operations directly (it
would also break the single responsibility principle).</p>
<p>To make this common scenario easier to address, there is a new set of interfaces that extend the interfaces we have seen
until here. These interfaces have the suffix <code>WithEffects</code> and bring additional functionality to make external effects
possible.</p>
<p>The changes are very simple:</p>
<p>The <code>Handler</code> instead of just receiving the current state and one action, receives one effect sender that can be used to
send effects to be handled externally. <code>Effect…</code></p></article></div></div></div></div>

      <p><a href="https://crdt.tech/">CRDTs</a> are often praised as the "holy grail" for building collaborative applications because they don't require a central authority to resolve sync conflicts. They open up new possibilities to scale the backend infrastructure and are also well-suited as a data-model for distributed apps that don't require a server at all.</p><p>However, several text editor developers report not to use them because they impose a too significant overhead.</p><p>Just recently, Marijn Haverbeke wrote about his considerations against using CRDTs as a data model for <a href="https://codemirror.net/6/">CodeMirror 6</a>:</p><blockquote>[..] the cost of such a representation is significant, and in the end, I judged the requirement for converging positions to be too obscure to justify that level of extra complexity and memory use. <a href="https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/blog/collaborative-editing-cm.html">(source)</a></blockquote><p>The <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor">Xi Editor</a> used a CRDT as its data model to allow different processes (syntax highlighter, type checker, ..) to concurrently access the editor state without blocking the process. They reverted to a synchronous model because ..</p><blockquote>[..] CRDT is not pulling its (considerable) weight. <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor/issues/1187#issuecomment-491473599">(source)</a></blockquote><p>Apparently, everyone recognizes that CRDTs have a lot of potential, but concluded that the memory overhead of using them must be too expensive for real-world applications.</p><p>They bring up a fair point. Most CRDTs assign a unique ID to <em>every character</em> that was ever created in the document. In order to ensure that documents can always converge, the CRDT model preserves this metadata even when characters are deleted.</p><p>This seems to be particularly expensive in dynamic languages like JavaScript. Other languages allow you to efficiently represent all those characters and IDs in-memory using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language)">structs</a> (e.g. C or Rust). In JavaScript, everything is represented as an <code>Object</code> - basically a key-value map that needs to keep track of all its keys and values. CRDTs assign multiple properties to every single character in the document to ensure conflict resolution. The memory overhead of merely representing a document as a CRDT could be immense.</p><p>Every user-interaction creates more metadata that the CRDT needs to retain in order to ensure conflict resolution. It is not uncommon that CRDTs create millions of objects to store all this metadata. The JavaScript engine manages these objects on the heap, checks if they are referenced, and, if possible, garbage collects them. Another major problem is that with an increasing number of object creations, the cost of creating additional objects increases exponentially.

I hope to convince you that the overhead is actually very small even for large documents with long edit histories.</p><h2 id="yjs">Yjs</h2><p>Yjs is a framework for building collaborative applications using CRDTs as the data model. It has a growing ecosystem of extensions that enable shared editing using different editors (<a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/yjs-prosemirror"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/prosemirror">ProseMirror</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@remirror/extension-yjs"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/remirror"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/remirror">Remirror</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/yjs-quilljs"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/quill">Quill</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/codemirror">CodeMirror</a>, ..), different networking technologies (<a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider/y-websocket">WebSocket</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider/y-webrtc">WebRTC</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider/y-hyper">Hyper</a>, ..), and different persistence layers (<a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/database-provider/y-indexeddb">IndexedDB</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/database-provider/y-leveldb">LevelDB</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/database-provider/y-redis">Redis</a>, ..). Most shared editing solutions are tied to a specific editor and to a specific backend. With Yjs, you can make any of the supported editors collaborative and exchange document updates through your custom communication channel, over a peer-to-peer WebRTC network, or over a scalable server infrastructure. My vision for this project is that you can simply compose your collaborative application using the technologies that make sense for your project. </p><figure><a href="https://github.com/yjs/yjs"><div><p>yjs/yjs</p><p>Peer-to-peer shared types.

If not, and you want to dive into this rabbit hole, I recommend this fun interactive series:</p><figure><a href="https://lars.hupel.info/topics/crdt/01-intro/"><div><p>CRDTs: Part 1</p><p><img src="https://lars.hupel.info/img/profile.jpg"><span>Lars Hupel</span><span>Lars Hupel</span></p></div><p><img src="https://lars.hupel.info/img/topics/crdt/world.jpg"></p></a><figcaption>A fun interactive series about CRDTs</figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://crdt.tech/resources"><div><p>CRDT Resources • Conflict-free Replicated Data Types</p><p>Resources and community around CRDT technology — papers, blog posts, code and more.</p><p><img src="https://crdt.tech/assets/favicons/favicon-192x192.png"><span>Conflict-free Replicated Data Types</span></p></div><p><img src="https://crdt.tech/assets/img/crdt-favicon.png"></p></a><figcaption>Good entry point to find more CRDT related resources</figcaption></figure><p>The concept paper that describes Yjs' conflict resolution algorithm YATA is available on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310212186_Near_Real-Time_Peer-to-Peer_Shared_Editing_on_Extensible_Data_Types">Researchgate</a>. The concepts discussed here are pretty generic and could be extended to almost any CRDT.</p><p>In order to determine the performance cost, we are are going to examine how Yjs maintains data. Please bear with me while I describe how the CRDT model is represented using JavaScript objects. This will be relevant later.</p><p>Similarly to other CRDTs, the YATA CRDT assigns a unique ID to every character. These characters are then maintained in a doubly linked list.</p><p>The unique IDs are<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamp"> Lamport Timestamps</a>. They consist of a unique user identifier and a logical clock that increases with each character insertion.</p><p>When a user types the content "ABC" from left to right, it will perform the following operations: <code>insert(0, "A") • insert(1, "B") • insert(2, "C")</code>. The linked list of the YATA CRDT, which models the textual content, will look like this:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.kevinjahns.de/content/images/2020/07/crdt-datamodel.svg" alt=""><figcaption>CRDT model of inserting content "ABC" (assuming the user has the unique client identifier "1")</figcaption></figure><p>Notice how every character can be uniquely identified by the combination of the unique client-id and an ever-increasing <code>clock</code> counter.</p><p>Yjs represents the items of the linked list as <code>Item</code> objects that contain some content (in this case a String), a unique ID, the links to the adjacent <code>Item</code> objects, and additional metadata that is relevant for the CRDT algorithm.</p><p>All CRDTs assign some kind of unique ID and additional metadata to every character, which is very memory-consuming for large documents. We can't get rid of metadata as it is necessary for conflict resolution. Yjs also uniquely identifies each character and assigns metadata, but represents this information efficiently. Larger document insertions are represented as a single <code>Item</code> object using the character-offset to uniquely identify each character individually. The below <code>Item</code> uniquely identifies character <code>"A"</code> as <code>{ client: 1, clock: 0 }</code>, character <code>"B"</code> as <code>{ client: 1, clock: 1 }</code>, and so on..</p><figure><pre><code>Item {
    id: { client: 1, clock: 0 },
    content: 'ABC',
    ...
}</code></pre><figcaption>Yjs's internal representation of items in the linked list</figcaption></figure><p>If a user copy/pastes a lot of content into the document, the inserted content is represented by a single <code>Item</code>. Furthermore, single-character insertions that are written from left to right can be merged into a single <code>Item</code>. It is just important that we are able to split and merge items without losing any metadata.</p><p>This type of compound representation of the CRDT model and its split-functionality have first been described in <a href="https://kundoc.com/pdf-a-string-wise-crdt-algorithm-for-smart-and-large-scale-collaborative-editing-sys.html">"A string-wise CRDT algorithm for smart and large-scale collaborative systems"</a>. Yjs adapts this approach for YATA and also includes functionality to merge <code>Item</code> objects.</p><h2 id="the-cost-of-operations">The Cost of Operations</h2><p>With this simple optimization in mind, let's have a look at how the number of modifications on a document relates to the amount of metadata that needs to be retained. We will measure metadata by the amount of <code>Item</code> objects created and later examine what the cost of a single <code>Item</code> is.</p><p>Every user interaction with a text editor can be expressed as either an <strong>insert</strong> or a <strong>delete</strong> operation.</p><ul><li><code>insert(index: number, content: string)</code><strong> </strong>Insertions of any size create a single <code>Item</code> that is integrated into the document. In some cases the integration requires to split an existing <code>Item</code>. So we have a maximum of two <code>Item</code> creations per insertion.</li><li><code>delete(index: number, length: number)</code> Deleting an <code>Item</code> only marks it as deleted. I.e <code>item.deleted = true</code>. Therefore, <code>Item</code> deletions are free and will reduce the amount of memory used because the <code>Item.content</code> can be removed. The <code>Item</code> doesn't need to retain the content for doing conflict resolution. But deleting a range of content might require to split two existing items. Therefore, the cost of deletions is a maximum of two <code>Item</code> creations also.</li></ul><p>By using the compound representation of CRDTs, the amount of metadata only relates to the amount of operations produced by a user. Not to the amount of characters inserted. This makes a huge difference in practice. Most larger documents are created by copy-pasting existing content or by moving paragraphs to other positions. Any kind of operation, even copy-paste and undo/redo, only create at most two <code>Item</code> objects.</p><p>Yjs also supports rich-text and structured documents. The above statement, that the amount of metadata only relates to the amount of operations, still holds true for these kinds of documents. But measuring operation-cost for more complex operations is out of scope of this article. An interesting observation in practice is that the document size of long-running …</p></div></article></main></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>The Indonesia National AI Strategy, now known as <span><a href="https://ai-innovation.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stranas KA</a></span> (<em>Strategi Nasional Kecerdasan Artifisial)</em>, has been published. The new strategy was announced by the <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Research_and_Technology/National_Research_and_Innovation_Agency_(Indonesia)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minister of Research and Technology</a></span> and head of the <a href="https://www.ristekbrin.go.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>BRIN</span></a> (the National Research and Innovation Agency) <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambang_Brodjonegoro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bambang PS Brodjonegoro </a></span>in an television address made last Monday to mark the country’s 25th National Technology Awakening Day. The minister also launched an electronic innovation catalogue, helping Indonesian technology developers to market their offerings and sell to government procurement offices.</p>
<p>Transforming Indonesia into a Fourth Industrial Revolution economy has become focus for the government over the past few years and the necessity of creating a digital-savvy workforce has become a top priority. Stranas KA aims to tie together many of the country’s digital initiatives and maps closely to <em><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_of_Indonesia_2045" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visi Indonesia 2045</a></span></em>, the country’s broad economic, social, governance and technology development strategy. The National Artificial Intelligence Strategy Framework provides an at-a-glance view of how these different goals are held in context.</p>
<p>Stranas KA aims to support five national priorities, where the government believes that artificial intelligence could have the biggest impact on national progress and outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Health services</strong> – With 268 million people living across 6,000 of Indonesia’s total 17,504 islands, delivering a consistent standard of healthcare is a national challenge. The archipelago also faces increased risks from global disease outbreaks such as SARS and, recently, Covid-19. The country’s response to the pandemic has already somewhat accelerated plans for smart hospitals and health security infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Bureaucractic reform</strong> – With a civilian civil service of about 4 million, reforming the government’s highly centralised administration remains a significant challenge. Indonesia is lagged in implementation of digital services, according to the United Nations <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/publications/publication/2020-united-nations-e-government-survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>E-Government Development Index (EGDI)</span></a>, ranking below Borneo, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. President <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joko_Widodo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joko Widodo</a></span> has promised to create a citizen-centric digitised service government <em>(Pemerintahan Digital Melayani)</em> in the next five years.</p>
<p><strong>Education and research</strong> – Education is integral to Visi Indonesia 2045 and the move towards online schooling during the Covid-19 pandemic has laid bare the country’s digital divide. The pressures of the digital economy are also recognised by development plans. According to the government, Indonesia needs a digital workforce of 113 million by 2030-2035.</p>
<p><strong>Food security</strong> – According to President Widodo, food security remains Indonesia’s top priority and the Food Security Agency focuses on three main areas: food availability, food accessibility and food utilisation. Food, agriculture and fisheries government departments and agencies have already begun using satellite technology, machine learning and smart farming to better plan, forecast and manage agricultural production and natural resources.</p>
<p><strong>Mobility and smart cities</strong> – The number of people living in Indonesia’s urban areas is now close to 60 percent and is expected to rise to 70 percent of the total population by the year 2050. The government currently plans to develop 98 smart cities and 416 smart districts, under Indonesia’s 100 Smart Cities Plan.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Indonesia national AI strategy identifies four key focus areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Ethics and Policy</li>
<li>Talent Development</li>
<li>Infrastructure and Data</li>
<li>Industrial Research and Innovation</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Indonesia is already one of South East Asia’s biggest investors in artificial intelligence, with IDC’s 2018 <span><a href="https://www.idc.com/ap/pulse/2018-november" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asia-Pacific Enterprise Cognitive/AI survey</a></span> finding that 25 percent of large organisations in the country have adopted AI systems (compared with 17% in Thailand, 10% in Singapore and 8% in Malaysia).</p>
<p>Smart cities, one of Stranas KA’s five top priority areas, have been identified as a fundamental building block for Indonesia’s Industry 4.0 future. Last year President Widodo announced plans to create a new futuristic smart city capital on the island of Borneo, to replace Jakarta. The <span><a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2019/12/23/nagara-rimba-nusa-announced-as-winner-of-new-capital-city-design-contest.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new capital</a></span> will rely heavily on sustainable smart city systems, cleantech and infrastructure run by emerging technologies such as 5G, AI and IoT (Internet of Things). Originally slated for completion by 2024 (pre-pandemic) and estimated to cost $33 billion, the project reportedly received an offer by Japanese multinational investor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoftBank_Group" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SoftBank Group</a> to invest up to $40 billion.</p>
<p>The Indonesia National AI Strategy details a programme roadmap for both its four key focus areas and the five national priorities, for which it considers plans as short-term (2020-2024) and longer-term (2025-2045). All in all, the strategy document identifies 186 programmes, including many that aim to develop the plans, pilot schemes, policies and regulations, plus checks and balances, necessary to drive the overall strategy.</p>
<p>Underpinning the acceleration of Indonesia’s artificial intelligence journey, Stranas KA includes plans for national standards, regulations and an ethics board to ensure that usage of AI is in accordance with the country’s <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancasila_(politics)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pancasila</a> </em>values system.</p>
<p>The development of the 194-page National Artificial Intelligence Strategy was coordinated by the Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology or <span><a href="https://www.bppt.go.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BPPT</a></span>, a non-ministerial government agency under the coordination of the Ministry for Research and Technology, and was widely anticipated to be announced in July or August. A wide variety of public and private sector organisations contributed to the plan including government ministries, universities, industry associations and national telecom providers.</p>
<p>Although many of the programmes and initiatives detailed in the Indonesia National AI Strategy can be found in existing government strategies, plans and policy, Stranas KA is nevertheless highly ambitious. The success of the overall plan will likely rest heavily on how many of the foundation programmes it is able to get off the ground during the next 4-5 years.</p>

<p>I always had troubles managing errors in Clojure until I discovered <a href="https://github.com/exoscale/ex">ex</a> (written by a coworker, thanks to him :p). This library was a game changer for me.</p>
<p><code>ex</code> allows you to define exception types in the ex data by setting the <code>:exoscale.ex/type</code> key. You can then use the <code>try+</code> macro to catch Exceptions with a given type, like in this example:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="clojure">(ex/try+

  (throw (ex-info "Argh" {:type ::bar :foo "a foo"}))

  (catch ::foo data
    (prn :got-ex-data data))

  (catch ::bar {:as data :keys [foo]}
    ;; in that case it would hit this one
    (prn :got-ex-data-again foo))

  (catch ExceptionInfo e
   ;; this would match an ex-info that didn't get a hit with catch-ex-info)

  (catch Exception e (prn :boring))

  (finally (prn :boring-too))</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p><code>ex</code> also provides default types like <code>:exoscale.ex/not-found</code>, <code>:exoscale.ex/forbidden</code> and helper functions to create exceptions (like <code>(exoscale.ex/ex-not-found "not found !" {:foo "bar"})</code> to create an exception of type <code>:exoscale.ex/not-found</code>, or <code>exoscale.ex/ex-not-found!</code> to create and throw it).</p>
<p><code>ex</code> also allows you to derive exceptions types from other types.<br>
Let’s take an example. You might want have multiple types for authentication errors, like <code>::invalid-api-key</code> or <code>::invalid-token</code>, but make them all derive from <code>::ex/forbidden</code> to be able to convert them easily to an HTTP response:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="clojure">(ex/derive ::invalid-api-key ::ex/forbidden)
(ex/derive ::invalid-token ::ex/forbidden)

(defmulti ex-&gt;response
  (fn [e]
    (some-&gt; e ex-data :type))
  :hierarchy exoscale.ex/hierarchy)

(defmethod ex-&gt;response ::ex/forbidden [e]
  {:body (ex-message e)
   :status 403})

(defmethod ex-&gt;response ::ex/not-found [e]
  {:body (ex-message e)
   :status 404})

(defmethod ex-&gt;response :default [_]
  {:body "default error message"
   :status 500})</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Let’s generate some errors:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code>(ex-&gt;response (ex/ex-not-found "thing not found"))
{:body "thing not found", :status 404}

(ex-&gt;response (ex-info "invalid token" {:type ::invalid-token}))
{:body "invalid token", :status 403}

(ex-&gt;response (ex-info "invalid api key" {:type ::invalid-api-key}))
{:body "invalid api key", :status 403}

(ex-&gt;response (ex-info "error !" {}))
{:body "default error message", :status 500}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>You can do tons of things with this library !</p>
</div></div>]]>

<h2>Or, Why is Mediterranean Maritime Sovereignty So Complicated?</h2>



<p>The Mediterranean Sea could almost be considered an inland body of water, except for a small connection to the Atlantic Ocean (only 16 km or 10 miles) between the coasts of Spain and Morocco at the Strait of Gibraltar. The waters of the Mediterranean can be further divided into the Alboran, Libyan, Levantine, Aegean, Ionian, Adriatic, Tyrrhenian, and Balearic Seas. Twenty-three separate States lay claim to the waters of the Mediterranean Sea, and many of these are overlapping or disputed leading to an incredibly complex picture of maritime sovereignty.</p>



<h2>The Established Boundaries</h2>



<p>There are, however, twenty-two established maritime boundaries between the various Mediterranean States. The oldest is between Cyprus and the UK on behalf of its Sovereign Base Areas (SBAs) of Akrotiri and Dhekelia located in the south of the island. Both the land and maritime boundaries between the SBAs and Cyprus were established by the same agreement from which Cyprus gained its independence from the UK on 16 August 1960. The <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/cyprus-united-kingdom-maritime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maritime boundary</a> extends in four separate parts from the various land boundary termini on the coast and delimits the UK’s claimed three nautical mile territorial sea and Cyprus’s 12. The UK ceded all exclusive economic zone (EEZ) claims to Cyprus.</p>

<p>The most recent (as of late July 2020) Mediterranean maritime boundary is between Greece and Italy, signed on 9 June 2020. This new agreement updates a 24 May 1977 Treaty, transforming the already-established 16 point maritime boundary into WGS-84 and confirming its application for the EEZ, in addition to the continental shelf (CS). The 2020 update left the tripoints, with Albania in the north and Libya in the south, undefined. The Italy–Greece boundary is arguably less interesting than the second most recent Mediterranean maritime boundary between Turkey and Libya (signed 27 November 2019). That will be covered in greater depth below.</p>

<p>Surprise! Greece and Egypt signed a new EEZ boundary Agreement on Thursday, August 6. The details have not yet been released to the public, but both Turkey and Libya have already protested the new boundary.</p>



<p>The shortest established Mediterranean maritime boundary is between <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/italy-slovenia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Italy and Slovenia</a> at 15 M and the longest is between <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/italy-tunisia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Italy and Tunisia</a>, which runs for 528 M.</p>



<p>That leaves about 30 maritime boundaries to be established, some of which are currently being negotiated (Greece and Albania) and some of which have 300 plus years of dispute that will need to be resolved before maritime boundary delimitation can begin (Spain and the UK on behalf of Gibraltar).</p>



<h2>Disputed Maritime Space</h2>



<p>When looking at disputed maritime areas in the Mediterranean, Turkey is the shadow over all of the eastern Sea. Its role in the Cyprus–Northern Cyprus conflict as well as the full extent of maritime disputes with Greece will be discussed in greater detail below. This section is to delve into Turkey’s full set of unilateral maritime claims which were updated in 2019.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-1024x576.png" alt="Map showing Turkey's unilateral maritime claim, overlaid with established maritime boundaries and provisional equidistance lines from Sovereign Limits." srcset="https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-300x169.png 300w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-60x34.png 60w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-768x432.png 768w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-1536x865.png 1536w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-2048x1153.png 2048w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-600x338.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><em>This map depicting extensions of Turkey’s EEZ claims was released by a Turkish diplomat in December 2019 (the map source and more information is from this <a href="https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/map-delineates-turkeys-maritime-frontiers-in-med-sea-149379" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a>). To capture the complicated nature of all of the other claims and established maritime boundaries, we’ve overlaid Sovereign Limits maritime data over top.</em> Between points A and B is the established maritime boundary with Northern Cyprus and between points E and F the new line with Libya.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Additionally, on 27 November 2019, Turkey and the UN-backed government of Libya (Libya is in the midst of a civil war, so yes, there are two entirely separate governments) signed a short, two-point maritime boundary agreement that dangles in the middle of Greek-claimed sea. This new boundary enraged neighboring Greece and Egypt as well as the entire EU. Its location deviates from the equidistance default stipulated by UNCLOS. Turkey and Libya note that the bilaterally negotiated boundary has nothing to do with third states, but as Greece claims the waters surrounding this new delimitation, it has caused quite a stir. The new August 2020 Egypt–Greece maritime boundary likely overlaps with the Libya–Turkey boundary in some capacity.</p>



<p>The conflict between Cyprus and Northern Cyprus would not have reached its modern outcome without Turkish involvement. Disagreements between Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots on the island of Cyprus have been ongoing since even before Ottoman control of the island, and the modern conflict began shortly after independence from the United Kingdom. Turkey moved to occupy northern Cyprus in 1974 and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus declared independence in 1983. Today, Turkey is the only country who recognizes Northern Cyprus’s statehood.</p>



<p>The island of Cyprus is now divided by a UN mandated and monitored buffer zone that snakes its way through hilly territory and divides the capital city (for both Cypruses) of Nicosia. The southern Greek Republic of Cyprus is an EU member and is recognized by the UN as the sole sovereign power of the island.</p>



<p>Related to the Cyprus dispute, the maritime picture off the coast of the island is quite complicated. The Republic of Cyprus has established maritime boundaries with <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/cyprus-egypt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Egypt</a>, <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/cyprus-israel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Israel</a>, and <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/cyprus-lebanon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lebanon</a>, in addition to the short UK boundaries already mentioned. Northern Cyprus agreed to a maritime boundary with Turkey, that the southern Republic of Cyprus disputes. Due to the nature of the dispute, the maritime boundaries between Cyprus and Northern Cyprus are also unresolved (and unlikely to become so in the foreseeable future).</p>



<p>Turning to the maritime disputes between Turkey and neighboring Greece offers an even more complicated picture (at least delimitation wise) due to the multitude of Greek Islands that lay just off the Turkish coast. Relations between Turkey and Greece have been historically complicated and often quite problematic, negativity driven by both the conflict in Cyprus and unresolved maritime issues in the Aegean Sea. Oil was discovered in the continental shelf in 1973, adding [literal] fuel to the fire.</p>

Turkey’s proposed maritime boundary lies to the west of equidistance.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Greece and Turkey have two extremely different perspectives on the possible delimitations of the maritime boundary through the Aegean Sea. Turkey is not a signatory of UNCLOS and claims that Greece’s Aegean Islands are not entitled to full continental shelf claims and would seek to have a mainland coast equidistance boundary through the middle of the Aegean Sea, while enclaving the Greek islands on the Turkish side of the maritime boundary line. Greece, a signatory of UNCLOS, meanwhile proposes a strict equidistance-based maritime boundary utilizing all of its islands, pushing the maritime boundary far to the east, just off the Turkish coast. Turkey’s position on the Greek claim is that this would create a “Greek Lake” of the Aegean Sea and severely limit Turkey’s freedom of navigation from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean.</p>



<p>There is also at least one officially disputed island between Turkey and Greece known as Imia by the Greeks and Kardak by the Turks. Turkish claims to additional islands have been made and redacted over the years.</p>



<p>Conflict over Greek and Turkish maritime claims is common. During the summer of 2020, Turkey has been conducting seismic surveys in Greek-claimed waters. And Greece is working on increasing its military power in response to Turkish aggression. Meanwhile, diplomats from the two states also sat down for a round of negotiations. In August, Greece called for talks to continue or a referral of the dispute to the ICJ.

<p>Looking beyond Turkey-centered disputes, there is a handful of interesting and impossible to resolve conflicts that speckle the entire Mediterranean Sea and neighboring bodies of water. Israel and Lebanon seem to be constantly in conflict over both their unresolved <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/israel-lebanon-land" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">land boundary</a> and maritime frontier. Natural gas reserves have been discovered in maritime space that both states claim, and in 2018 Lebanon auctioned off several disputed oil blocks. Israel is currently working on its own oil exploration in the disputed area.</p>



<p>The Palestinian territory of Gaza set forth maritime claims in 2015 and 2019 in which they proposed lateral boundaries with Egypt and Israel, creating a corridor of Palestinian maritime space before reaching the boundary with Cyprus. Both Israel and Egypt have submitted protests to the UN over Palestine’s unilateral maritime claims.</p>

<p>The former Yugoslav States of Croatia and Slovenia also have disputed maritime space in the northern Adriatic Sea despite a <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/croatia-slovenia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2017 Permanent Court of Arbitration Award</a> delimiting the boundary (Croatia had unilaterally withdrawn from the case in 2015 following a scandal). Slovenia accepts the Tribunal’s delimitation, but Croatia does not.</p>



<p>Some similarities can be drawn to the maritime boundary between Greece and Albania in the southern reaches of the Adriatic Sea. The two States signed a maritime boundary agreement in 2009, but this document was annulled shortly thereafter by Albania. Negotiations over the maritime boundary began again in 2018 and are ongoing. And with Greece’s current dedication to maritime boundary delimitation with its neighbors it is plausible that a new Greece–Albania maritime boundary Agreement …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>Read about how we were able to use publicly available data to create large amounts of content and take our marketing to the next level.</p>

<h2 id="why-should-you-read-this">Why Should You Read This?</h2>
<p>Are you in the process of starting a SaaS, e-commerce store or a local business? Then I think this story can help you develop a strategy to get your first hundred dollars MRR without spending tons of money on marketing. Lets begin.</p>
<h3 id="we-had-a-product-without-traffic-what-to-do">We Had a Product Without Traffic, What to Do?</h3>
<p>One of the first products we developed was an online preparation course for the Swedish SAT test. We created thousands of practice questions, hired math experts to write tutorials and spent a lot of time creating optimized landing pages. However, the traffic never came. This was our start.</p>
<p><img src="https://mocki.io/hpskolan.png" alt="Swedish SAT" title="Swedish SAT"></p>
<p>At the stage we were at, I think a lot of developers creating their own products give up. Developers can spend an insane amount of time creating a product <strong>THEY</strong> like. But unfortunately we are not good at selling our products or showing them to users in a way that make them interested.</p>
<p>We started thinking what people actually search for in regards to the Swedish SAT and college education. After doing some analysis we noticed that a lot of people used search queries like:</p>
<ol>
<li>What SAT score is required to get into Law at Stockholm university?</li>
<li>What SAT score is required to get into any Law school in Sweden?</li>
<li>What SAT score is required to get into Computer Science at Linköping university?</li>
<li>Which education in Sweden was the hardest to get into?</li>
<li>Which education had the most applications 2015?</li>
</ol>
<p>You see these are all related to education. And we figured out that a lot of people searching for these things are interested in improving their SAT test score. So how did we use this? We could have started writing articles like crazy about each education programme, but that would be really time consuming. Instead we approached the problem like developres and started to look at how we could actually generate one page with this kind of data for each education in Sweden.</p>
<h3 id="open-data-apis--the-golden-egg-">Open Data APIs - the Golden Egg 🥚</h3>
<p>This is where things start to become interesting. Open data APIs! At Mocki we are very supportive of governments and organizations opening up their data publicly. It's an amazing way to let normal companies or people develop applications that never would have been developed otherwise. Our interest in open data started that day when we got our hands on application data for every education in Sweden.</p>
<p>For a specific education programme we were able to see</p>
<ol>
<li>The number of applicants.</li>
<li>The number of accepted people.</li>
<li>The required SAT score to get accepted.</li>
<li>The percentage of women/men</li>
<li>The percentage of Swedish/Non-Swedish people.</li>
<li>And a lot more…</li>
</ol>
<p>Suddenly we were able to answer all the questions mentioned earler. We also realised that we could create a website out of this. So that's what we did. At that time there wasn't much competition for these search queries either which was great.</p>
<p>This is a screenshot of some of the data for med school and Lund University. One of the most popular universities in Sweden. It may be hard for a non Swede to understand what the data means. But that's not important here. The important thing is that we created pages with hundreds of words, graphs and tables all automatically generated.</p>
<p><img src="https://mocki.io/antagningspoang.png" alt="Swedish SAT" title="Med school Lund"></p>
<h3 id="could-this-be-considered-spam">Could This Be Considered Spam?</h3>
<p>If you use this tactic in the wrong way with randomized data or just non useful information it's not good. But we knew that this was data people really wanted to find! All the generated texts were useful and provided great user value. And modern day search engine optimization really comes down to providing great value for a <strong>user</strong>.</p>
<p>This was all confirmed when Google started picking up the pages and loved them. We quickly started ranking on all sorts of keywords related to SAT. In just a couple of weeks we reached traffic numbers of around 10 000 users per month and it kept steadily increasing each day. All user metrics were amazing. Long average time spent on page and many interactions with the graphs. We also noticed people visiting several different pages because they got hooked on seeing all the different graphs we provided.</p>
<h3 id="the-final-step">The Final Step</h3>
<p>So we had suddenly created our own traffic source with relevant users. We started putting up banners on the site with the SAT data leading directly to our SAT prep SaaS. The results were great! We got a lot of signups and had to go back working on our course platform since the users discovered bugs and other problems. But we now had a steady flow of new paying customers. That's where you want to be because that is when a SaaS becomes fun.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-you-use-open-data-apis-to-do-the-same">How Can You Use Open Data Apis to Do the Same?</h3>
<p>This strategy may not be applicable for every service out there. But I will try to create one other example where I think this could work.</p>
<p>Lets say you own a snow shoveling business and you are currently expanding to a lot of different cities. Then I think you could combine this strategy with using local SEO.</p>
<ol>
<li>Use an open API to get all cities in your country with more than x amount of people</li>
<li>Try to find some weather API providing detailed data about if its going to snow</li>
<li>Try to find historical snow data for every city.</li>
</ol>
<p>So what can we do with with this data? We can generate something like the following text</p>
<p>“What is the snow situation town X right now? - Snow shoveling forecast”,</p>
<p>“Town with X with Y inhabitants usually has around Z number of snow days per year. The temperature in September to February is between K degrees. On our snow and ice scale town X has the score of S (scould be calculated by an algorithm that you create). You will probably have to shovel snow around D days per winter.”</p>
<p>“It's currently heavily snowing in town X, so be prepared to shovel snow the next D days.”</p>
<p>Each page would be both useful and kind of unique. It's important to make sure to have enough variables as Google might think its duplicate content otherwise. When you have created these pages you now have a local snow shoveling page for a lot of cities. Put up your phone number or a link to your booking system and start scaling your snow shoveling business.</p>
<p>There are probably a lot of better examples, but I hope I gave you enough to get thinking :)</p>
<h3 id="create-an-open-api-and-start-sharing-your-data">Create an Open API and Start Sharing Your Data!</h3>
<p>If you are a government, organization or just a company with some great data set you should think about sharing it. In some cases the data is your business and then it's of course not the best idea. But in a lot of cases there is not much to lose. In Scandinavia where Mocki is founded the governments are currently doing great efforts to make data publicly available. There are a lot of applications that will never be developed by governments and state organizations but that companies or hobby programmers would love to create.</p>
<p>Lets say your government would release all the data on every traffic accident in your country, including the location and severity. Then you could create an app warning about historically dangerous roads. It's these types of things that become possible when the data is released to the public.</p>
<p>With Mocki it's very easy to create a simple API with mock data or real data. You can for example use Mocki if you want to make some of you data available to a hackathon or other event. It's a good and safe start as you wouldn't need to expose any of your own infrastructure or sensitive data sources. If that sounds interesting you can sign up with GitHub or send us a message to the bottom right.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

    <p>With Mozilla Corporation laying off about 350 employees since the beginning of 2020, things don't look bright for Firefox, the only cross-platform browser providing any alternative to Google's Chrome(ium) monopoly. While they're not going away for the next few years at least, I believe it is also clear that they need to diversify their income pretty urgently. Here's how I hope to see them bouncing back.</p><h2 id="mozilla-foundation-vs-mozilla-corporation">Mozilla Foundation vs. Mozilla Corporation</h2><p>Since I see the confusion around this happening way too often, I want to start off by explaining the difference between the Mozilla Foundation (MoFo) and the Mozilla Corporation (MoCo).</p><p>MoCo was created as a subsidiary of the MoFo almost exactly 15 years ago. It's in charge of developing all the Mozilla's products: Firefox, Pocket, and others. All of its profits are going straight to MoFo, and nobody else owns any part of it (no other shareholders, no stocks, no dividents).</p><p>This structure allows MoCo to pursue business partnerships and deals that are hard or impossible to do in a non-profit, but as a consequence, you can't donate money to a corporation. That's why the donations to Mozilla go to the Foundation, which mostly does advocacy, finances fellowships, and similar, meaning that you can't donate directly to the Firefox development.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I was a Ford-Mozilla Open Web Fellow in 2017/2018, during which I was an employee of <a href="https://www.bitsoffreedom.nl/">Bits of Freedom <i></i></a>, with my sallary being sponsored by the by MoFo and the <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/">Ford Foundation <i></i></a>.</p><br><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="how-you-can-give-money-to-the-mozilla-corporation-today">How you can give money to the Mozilla Corporation today</h2><p>MoCo currently has three B2C (business-to-consumer) products that you can purchase.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The oldest of them is <a href="https://getpocket.com/premium">Pocket Premium <i></i></a> ($4.99/month). While Pocket is definitely more than usable without paying anything, it has some features that are exclusive to its premium members. Since Pocket is owned by the MoCo (which is itself owned by MoFo), money spent towards its premium account counts as a revenue gained by the corporation that's in charge of developing Firefox.</p>
<p>The second B2C product a newly-released <a href="https://vpn.mozilla.org/">Mozilla VPN <i></i></a> (also $4.99/month), currently available in only 6 countries (the US, the UK, Canada, New Zealand, Signapore, and Malasyia), though that list should expand later in the year.</p>
<p>The last one is <a href="https://fpn.firefox.com/">Firefox Private Network</a> ($2.99), which is more like a proxy than a VPN. If you decide to use it, all of your Firefox traffic gets routed through some Cloudflare server (you can't choose your location like you can with a VPN). It's currently only available in the US.</p>
<p>All in all, Mozilla would need quite a large amount of paid users to support their development. Then there are other smaller, free-to-use products:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://monitor.firefox.com/">Firefox Monitor <i></i></a>, which checks if some of your email addresses were a part of some breach (in cooperation with <a https:="" input.sh="" mozilla-subscription-service-pack="" href="">Have I Been Pwned <i></i></a>).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/lockwise/">Firefox Lockwise <i></i></a>, which is a password manager rivalling the likes of Bitwarden, LastPass, 1password, etc.</li>
<li><a href="https://send.firefox.com/">Firefox Send <i></i></a>, which is an end-to-end encrypted file sharing web service. (Note: at the time of writing this, Mozilla shut it down because it was increasingly used for Malware transfer, but they're planning on bringing it back online.)</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/notes-by-firefox/">Firefox Notes <i></i></a>, an experimental end-to-end encrypted note taking app that allows you to take notes on your desktop and your Android/iOS device.</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>I've seen many people suggesting that Mozilla Corporation should abandon these smaller projects to focus exclusively on Firefox. I, however, believe that they should double down on these smaller projects.</p><h2 id="the-service-pack">The service pack</h2><p>I could see a future in which Mozilla has a bunch of freemium online services that would enhance the online experience of its users. Similarly to Pocket, they could add more features to these smaller projects and hide some of them behind a paywall.</p><p>I could also see them bundling those premium features together across products into one service pack behind the Firefox brand, effectively making a Firefox Power Pack.</p><p>Firefox, on its own, would still be free and open to everyone to use with no payment necessary, but you can optionally boost your online experience and support Firefox's development by paying for the app pack.</p><p>The biggest advantage of this approach is that they could charge more than their currently do in their B2C products. Throughout the years, I've payed $13-20/month for the services that Mozilla's already offering. If I were to switch all of those subscriptions to a brand I can get behind, I can see myself paying quite a bit for them.</p><ul><li>I'd pay $15/month right now if there was an option to do that.</li><li>I'd pay up to $25/month if they double down on this approach and offer more features across their current services.</li></ul><p>Since I can't do that today, the least I could do is re-subscribe to Pocket Premium, which I have proudly done while writing this:</p><figure><img src="https://input.sh/content/images/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-14-16-44-20.png" alt="A screenshot of me completing the signup to Pocket's Premium service." srcset="https://input.sh/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-14-16-44-20.png 600w, https://input.sh/content/images/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-14-16-44-20.png 962w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Unfortunately, the country I'm in right now is not currently supported by their other B2C products, so please Mozilla, take more of my money!</p>

<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mindflash.org/coding/learn-programming/the-proper-way-to-learn-as-a-beginner-programmer-57" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="internal">Practice makes perfect</a>. I repeat it in a lot of my blog posts because of how important it is and is key to learning any programming language effectively. I think the best way to practice is by making personal projects, because they are long exercises rather than just a few functions, and they can also be a great contribution to your resume!</p>



<p>There are plenty of lists of projects to do to improve, but one thing that I never liked about them is that they always propose some generic, uninteresting and useless project that you will throw away once you are done with it. It’s already very hard to complete personal projects, so it’s a recipe for failure if you start with a personal project that you don’t care about deeply.</p>



<p>In this article I will present a list of 7 (and a half) personal projects that can help you improve at programming, or to learn a new language, but that you can also keep and develop after, because they actually bring you value outside of just programming skills.</p>



<h2>Make a personal resume website</h2>



<p>I think making a website to present your profile to potential employers is a great way to start out with personal projects. It’s a project that is easy to accomplish because theoretically it only requires HTML &amp; CSS skills. At the same time you can add a lot of technologies on top, depending on what you want to present.</p>



<p>The content to put in your website is pretty much the same as you resume: work and school experiences, a list of your skills, and a presentation of your personal projects. The advantage is that you have much more space on your website than on a one-page resume, and you can use more medium like pictures. I would also recommend adding a contact form, so that people can reach out directly.</p>

<figcaption><em>The (slightly outdated) skills section on my own resume website</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Your resume website can also be the opportunity to spend some time on the graphic design aspect of it. It’s important down the line, because even if we are writing code, we are building software for people, and user experience matters. Great code that nobody uses because of a bad UI is useless.</p>



<p>You will practice <strong>HTML, CSS, UI / UX design</strong>, and potentially <strong>JavaScript</strong> and the <strong>backend </strong>programming language of your choice. You will also learn how to host a website and things related to that. Software engineering isn’t limited to coding, and you will need at least basic skills in system administration and networking in your career.</p>



<h2>Add a blog to your resume website</h2>



<p>Once your resume website is ready, or even during its development, you can go further and start building a blog. You could use WordPress, like I do for MindFlash, but if the goal is to improve your skills, a custom-made one will be better. You will also be able to integrate it better with the design of your CV website.</p>



<p>A blog is a good idea for multiple reasons:</p>



<ul><li><span>You will learn how to structure your thoughts when explaining technical aspects, which will be invaluable later for your job, when you have to write design documents, tutorials for your team, and technical documentation for your code.</span></li><li>You can build your “personal brand”. Especially if you don’t have a common name, it’s easy to rank on Google and it’ll be the first thing that people can see when they search your name,</li><li>You can share your knowledge. It’s a rewarding experience to know that some people enjoyed your teachings. I wrote a <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" href="https://medium.com/@antwaneb/catch-and-handle-all-404-errors-from-your-webservice-in-angular-5-2269b717d78f" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">tutorial on Medium</a> about some topic on Angular and I was ecstatic to see that someone linked it to solve a problem in a Github issue!</li></ul>



<p>For technical aspects, you will again have to deal with HTML &amp; CSS, but this time a backend programming language will be mandatory. On top of that, you will see new concepts, since you will need to use a database, and you will also have to manage permissions, with a “writer” account that is the only one allowed to post articles.</p>



<p>You could even separate the frontend and the backend, and start building a microservices infrastructure. It is overkill for a basic project, but if it fits the technologies you want to learn, it’s a good choice. For example, you can use Angular for your frontend, and it will call a backend API written in PHP with a framework.</p>



<h2>A script using the Spotify API to detect new albums of your favorite artists</h2>



<p>Back when I was around 15 years old, I made a script that called the Deezer and Spotify APIs to check all the new releases from my artists. Spotify sends emails for the major releases from artists you follow, but they don’t do it for all releases, and it’s easy to miss news albums.</p>



<p>Both platforms provide an easy to use and very complete API that you can call to get a large number of information about the data they have. You can access the documentation for the <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">Spotify API</a>, which will guide you through the different endpoints that you can use.</p>



<p>An example workflow for your application would be to authenticate your account, then retrieve the list of artists you follow, and finally run queries to get the list of albums they have released. The next step would be to compare this list to a database, or even just a file, to check which are the releases you haven’t heard of yet.</p>



<p>This project can take many forms, it could be a website, or just a script ran by a scheduled task, and you will have a wide range of available technologies to use.</p>



<p>Beside the programming language that you will use to make this, you will learn how to call a public API. You can explore different ways to notify you of the new albums, by sending a notification to your desktop, an email, or maybe even a <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" href="https://www.twilio.com/sms" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">text message</a> to your phone!</p>



<h2>A custom homepage aggregating news from your favorite sources</h2>



<p>For this one, you will be able to leverage other personal projects that you might do, or have done already, such as the Spotify “new albums notifier”. The goal is to gather all the news sources that you like in a single homepage, for your desktop, or your web browser.</p>



<p>To do that, you will have to create multiple separate modules that will handle different types of data sources, and aggregate them in a database:</p>



<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external"><strong>RSS feeds</strong></a>. They are XML “files” that are used a lot by blogs and other news sources, and you can subscribe to get to get notifications when a new story is published. There are plenty of open source XML parsing libraries online, so it will be the occasion to learn how to use 3rd party libraries. Actually, this blog offers an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mindflash.org/feed" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="internal">RSS feed</a> with the latest articles!</li><li><strong>HTML pages</strong>. For those, you will need to manually parse (well, using a library) HTML tags to extract the information you need from the website, which means that you will need one specific module for each website to parse.</li><li><strong>APIs</strong>. Again, if you want to get your latest albums from Spotify, you would use a public API offered by the service, but many other big websites offer similar services, like Instagram or Facebook.</li></ul>



<p>Think about any of the websites you consult daily, and how you could extract those information to then feed them in your database and display them on your custom homepage.</p>



<p>This project can really be an opportunity to put in place multiple microservices, each responsible to extract one type of information and then inject it in a central database. This is a good use case for <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">AWS Lambdas</a> for example.</p>



<h2>A platform to track your job applications, cover letters and resumes</h2>



<p>If you are looking for a job, you will have to apply to many places. When I was looking for my end-of-studies internship 2 years ago, I applied to over 60 job offers, and that’s really not that many.</p>



<p>It can get pretty tricky to track all of those applications, and also time consuming to maintain an excel sheet, write the potential cover letters for each company, adapt your resume in some cases, and update the status of all those. For this, I suggest you create a website or a software where you can submit the companies that you applied to, a link to the job posting, and the status of those applications.</p>



<p>Then, you can go a lot further and build on top of that, a system to automatically generate for you, based on a template, a cover letter and a resume adapted to the company that you are applying for. Most of the parts of those documents will be common, but you can have a text box where you input specific details and it gets integrated into your template automatically. You could even email the recruiter automatically.</p>



<p>I think this project is a good opportunity to follow a real development process, where you will define the functionalities you want to integrate, make diagrams for the different features (you can <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mindflash.org/coding/quick-and-easy-uml-diagrams-with-plantuml-499" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="internal">use PlantUML to easily make UML diagrams</a>) and make sure you have an idea of what the application will look like before starting to build it.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/svg/PLAnRiCW5Dpv2kGnZOVk7M8vf2LAi8LHeauMTMXZoM3BnfMYjlzU9nW2BHDtx-uzTBpLe7clHza0K3Ly663Qoewh2_m2yA7GVQq-eE9IW1zmha_2bQNGv_OqM5VITKrTSLstodUEVMEDlkAFcGdPDLmB8xJ8gKBslHRDtRfkgr4AfOt8ej3gsD1AnJ3HHcBkeMtcGbFQVef-9xGMlSt34Q7TBzWUGeqIRjitTkd4DQRfOC8G9SKBpfStpD0-psX2NmtC4Tqd115cOxHk5-6jPw6v7eUv9SbOcUJv3gErQN9CCCFakTnaj4n8SKHqUPzzmEXO69njDeYM5AK87z3wHb6qHIcRm3n-7kIcksoVlkFOHXgIVcJk5wF72CPn2oCLtVyG-3jY58jGuGkkHVESV_GS4W1sMnVJEpmH060br6dQ-by0" alt="An example of UML for a application to manage resume" width="414" height="388"><figcaption><em>An quick example of UML I made for this application</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<h2>Scripts to automatize repetitive tasks</h2>



<p>A few years ago there was a story that got heavily <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" href="https://www.thejournal.ie/programmer-scripts-to-do-his-job-email-his-wife-2469028-Jan2016/" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">shared in the news</a> where a programmer made a bunch of scripts to automatize a few repetitive and annoying tasks. He automatized the coffee machine of his office to pour it exactly over the time he took him to reach the machine from his desk, he made a script that automatically restored a database backup when he was receiving an email from a specific customer with the word “problem” in the title, etc. You can see those scripts, amongst others, on a Github repository called <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" href="https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">hacker-scripts</a>.</p>



<p>I won’t say that I totally believe that this story is true, but you get the idea. You can automatize tasks to run them automatically on a schedule you decide, or on demand. Those scripts will depend heavily on what you need, but here are a few ideas:</p>



<ul><li>Bulk renaming of your pictures. If you are taking a lot of photos, it’s to rename them by date instead of using the default IMG_2042.jpg.</li><li>Automatically backup your files. Make a script that listens to a local folder and automatically uploads to Dropbox any file that you put in the folder.</li><li>Your “custom homepage” that I mentioned earlier could also be a …</li></ul></div></div>

You are not alone here, is the only consolation I have for you at this juncture. I have the same pain and I alleviate it a bit by modularizing the schema to separate files and use string interpolation in the schema definition file. This alleviates some of the said pain points. But absence of intellisense during development is a pain in the back making me question if I'm witnessing "graphql pop-culture" or genuine strengths of it. I'm still experimenting and so this opinion may change and will be updated as I learn. </span></span></li><li><span face=""><span><b>Not all fields are relevant to all consumers of my API either for the reasons of security or business context. Take for instance, the password field in the User isn't required beyond the signup or password change functionality even for the very user and is breach of security for others to get even the hash of it in their context in fetching Users. Is there a way I can customize this behavior in GraphQL? 
</b>That's a great question and I'm yet to figure it out. But do hope there is a way out for this, as this is a very basic criteria, after all. My reference API would be Github API, for this.</span></span></li><li><span face=""><span><b>Given that the API's exposes the fields, would it end-up being too rigid for Public APIs where you don't own the client/consumer app?</b> 
Sorry, I don't have an answer for this one. Github can't be taken as a reference case for this, so I'd have to look out for a business case likely in the B2B space where different clients demand different needs from an API.</span></span></li><li><span face=""><span><b>I see a myriad of ways to building GraphQL APIs for consumption and unsure how one is different from the other and if I am missing something. Am I?</b>
As I see it, you will still be an early adopter of GraphQL, given the state of evolution that it is in today. Thus, your choice of platform could determine if you are taking SDL-first or code-first approach to development. And then your choice of runtime, could determine how you design and build your schema, how you implement your resolvers (if you know what it is in the graphql context), etc. Doing a PoC with some of the popular options will help you determine what best fits your team context. </span></span></li></ol><p><span face=""><span>More would be added as I experiment with GraphQL and have more conversations in this space. Stay tuned..</span></span></p>

    <p><img alt="" src="https://www.chzsoft.de/site/site/assets/files/1042/atari-st-web.jpg" width="640"></p>

<hr><p>In the following tutorial, I’ll describe how I connected my Atari ST to the Internet via using a cheap ESP8266 microcontroller as a WiFi-to-serial router – running at 19.2 kbit/s. Note that there are faster solutions for network connectivity for the Atari, such as NetUSBee or CosmosEx. However, the setup I describe here is about as low-cost as it can get. You’ll probably have to spend less than 10 USD for the hardware.</p>

<p>Also note that Internet on the Atari is of limited use; don’t expect to be able to surf modern websites with your ST. Simpler services such as chatting via IRC (Internet Relay Chat) or file downloads via FTP are possible, however.</p>

<hr><h3>Disclaimer</h3>

<p> I shall not be held responsible for any damage to your hardware or data for or other issues caused by this tutorial. Also, while I will try to answer your questions, please don’t expect me to provide professional support for everything described here. Please see below for alternative ways to get help.</p>

<hr><h3>Building the hardware</h3>

<p>The core component is the ESP8266 microcontroller from <a href="http://espressif.com/products/hardware/esp8266ex/overview">Espressif</a> with WiFi connectivity. I use it on an ESP-01 board, but any other board with this microcontroller will do just as well. Furthermore, you’ll need a level shifter such as a MAX3232 for the RS-232 serial port and a 3.3 V power supply. I wired everything according to this schematic:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://www.chzsoft.de/site/site/assets/files/1041/schematic.png" width="674"></p>

<p>At least temporarily you’ll also need a serial cable for your PC (e.g. a USB-to-serial adapter) with 3.3(!) V logic levels to flash the firmware.</p>

<hr><h3>Flashing the firmware</h3>

<p>The ESP8266 will act as a WiFi-to-serial router running the Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/martin-ger/esp_slip_router">esp_slip_router firmware by Martin Ger</a>. I had to modify the firmware a little bit, for example to set the default serial bit rate to 19.2 kbit/s and to make this bit rate configurable. (In the meantime, the command to configure the bit rate has been added to Martin's original firmware as well.)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.chzsoft.de/site/site/assets/files/1042/firmware-bitrate.zip">Download the modified firmware here</a> and flash it using your preferred ESP8266 flash tool. For my ESP-01 board I used <a href="https://github.com/espressif/esptool">esptool</a> and the following command – you’ll have to adapt <code>com8</code> to the serial port you want to use for flashing:</p>

<p><code>esptool.py --port com8 write_flash -ff 40m -fm dio -fs 8m 0x0 0x00000.bin 0x10000 0x10000.bin</code></p>

<p>In case your ESP8266 has never been flashed with <em>any </em>firmware before, you also need to flash the file&nbsp;<code>esp_init_data_default.bin</code>, which <a href="https://www.chzsoft.de/site/site/assets/files/1042/esp_init_data_default.bin">you can download here</a>. Symptoms of missing <em>init data</em> can be endless reboot loops of the ESP8266 and possibly wildly flashing LEDs on the module. The correct address depends on the size of the flash chip. <a href="https://nodemcu.readthedocs.io/en/master/en/flash/#sdk-init-data">You can read more details here.</a> Then use the flash software such as esptool again, substituting the correct address and serial port for your module:</p>

<p><code>esptool.py --port com8 write_flash -ff 40m -fm dio -fs 8m <em>address</em> esp_init_data_default.bin</code></p>

<hr><h3>Getting and configuring the software</h3>

<p>The setup of SLIP serial link on the Atari ST is not plug-and-play, in fact it was the thing I spent most time on. So you can now <a href="https://www.chzsoft.de/site/site/assets/files/1042/software-atari.zip">download a software package</a> that I pre-configured for you, containing the STinG network stack for your Atari. The download will even fit on a 720k floppy disk. If you want to run it from harddisk – which I recommend – you’ll have to use a text editor to change the drive letter in <code>AUTO\STING.INF</code> and <code>CONTROL.INF</code>.</p>

<p>As it is usual on Atari TOS, you need to restore the correct order of the programs in the AUTO folder. In order to do this, first move <code>DRVIN.PRG</code> from the <code>AUTO.TMP</code> folder to the <code>AUTO</code> folder, then move <code>MFP.PRG</code> into the <code>AUTO</code> folder and finally move <code>STING.PRG</code> into the <code>AUTO</code> folder.</p>

<p>After booting from the floppy (or your harddisk), STinG will be installed. However, you still have to configure the WiFi-to-serial router to use your WiFi credentials. To do so, start TELNET.PRG and open a connection to host <em>192.168.240.1</em> and port <em>7777</em>. You will get a <code>CMD&gt;</code> prompt. Use the <code>set ssid</code> and <code>set password</code> commands to enter the login data to your WiFi, then enter the <code>save</code> and <code>reset</code> commands to store the configuration and restart the firmware. The connection will be lost after the reset command. Open a new connection to the same host and port number. The <code>show</code> command should then display that the module is connected to your WiFi. If it isn’t, double-check the login data. You can also use the <code>scan</code> command to see if your WiFi is visible to the ESP8266. Make a note of the DNS server shown.</p>

<p>See below for <a href="#bitrate">instructions to configure the serial bit rate</a> used by the firmware. Be sure to read the warning there as well.</p>

<p>See the following screenshot for an examplary configuration session. Note that you will obviously get different values for the IP address and the DNS server.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://www.chzsoft.de/site/site/assets/files/1042/telnet_configuration.png" width="640"></p>

<p>From the desktop accessory menu, select <em>Control Panel</em>, then <em>STinG Protocols</em> and <em>Resolver</em>. Enter the DNS server that was previously displayed to you into the <em>Name Server</em> field. Don’t forget to click <em>Save</em>. See this screenshot for an example:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://www.chzsoft.de/site/site/assets/files/1042/dns_configuration.png" width="273"></p>

<hr><h3>Now what?</h3>

<p>Your Internet connection is configured now and can be used with any program that supports the STinG or STiK network stacks. Apart from the Telnet client, I’ve also included an IRC (chat) client and the web browser CAB. However, please note that the versions of CAB and CAB.OVL are terribly outdated and are only included as a proof-of-concept. You can also find several suitable FTP and e-mail clients for the Atari, such as <a href="http://www.atack.cz/atari/">aFTP and aMail</a>.</p>

<hr><h3><a id="bitrate" name="bitrate"></a>Increasing the connection speed</h3>

<p>The default bit rate of the firmware is 19.2 kbit/s, the maximum speed that the MFP (serial controller) in the Atari ST is capable of without any hardware modification. However, more advanced Atari computers – such as the MegaSTE, TT or Falcon – can use higher bit rates on the serial port if the proper <a href="http://atariftp.czietz.de/pub/atari/Modem/hsmoda07.zip">HSMODEM serial driver</a> is used. Hence, I modified the firmware to allow you to configure the bit rate. To do so, use <code>TELNET.PRG</code> to connect to <em>192.168.240.1</em>, port <em>7777 </em>(same as above). At the <code>CMD&gt;</code> prompt enter the <code>set bitrate</code> command, e.g. <code>set bitrate 57600</code>, then enter the <code>save</code> command. After the next power-up of the ESP8266 or after a <code>reset</code> command, the firmware will use the new bit rate.</p>

<p>In the desktop accessories menu, select <em>Control Panel</em>, then <em>Serial Ports</em> and change the bit rate of STinG accordingly. Don't forget to click <em>Save</em>.</p>

<p> Be aware that the firmware will accept any bit rate. If you set a bit rate not supported by your computer, you will not be able to use <code>TELNET.PRG</code> to change it again. If the module is still connected to your WiFi and you know its IP address (shown as <em>External IP</em> with the <code>show</code> command) you can <em>telnet </em>to this IP and port <em>7777</em> from another computer in your WiFi to change the configuration. Otherwise, you will have to erase the flash of the ESP board, e.g. with esptool, and then reflash the firmware to revert to 19.2 kbit/s. So, be sure to double check the bit rate before you enter the <code>save</code> command.</p>

<hr><h3>Limitations</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, the connection speed is limited by capabilities of the ST’s serial port. Furthermore, the WiFi-to-serial router does network address translation for outgoing connections only. Incoming connections will not work. This means that you cannot run a server on your Atari and that FTP file transfers will only work in the passive mode.</p>

<hr><h3>Questions?</h3>

<p>I very much prefer if you ask your questions in <a href="http://atari-forum.com/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=31586">this Atari Forum thread</a> because then others can benefit from the answers. Also, please don’t expect me to reply immediately, this is only a hobby project of mine.</p>

<p>Last May, I  discovered that a critical vulnerability I had reported earlier this year had resulted in my first CVE. Since the combination of vulnerabilities that led to this unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) was pretty fun to discover, I want to share the story about how brute force enabled me to hack into two organizations’ Active Directory-linked systems.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I did a thing! Found a pretty cool chain of vulnerabilities leading to RCE. Go and be patching your ADSelfService. 🔥 <a href="https://t.co/ZEybiAnpIg">https://t.co/ZEybiAnpIg</a></p>— Pieter Hiele (@honoki) <a href="https://twitter.com/honoki/status/1258122265989963781?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 6, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<h2>The Target</h2>



<p>While performing some routine visual reconnaissance with <a href="https://github.com/michenriksen/aquatone">Aquatone</a>, I noticed a similar-looking login page on two different subdomains from unrelated bug bounty programs.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="703" src="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-1024x703.png" alt="" srcset="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-1024x703.png 1024w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-300x206.png 300w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-768x527.png 768w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-700x480.png 700w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2.png 1374w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Both subdomains contained customized versions of this default login screen.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The software behind this login screen is Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus, which offers a portal that allows users to reset the password of their own Active Directory (AD) accounts. (Anybody who has worked in a large organization will recognize why this sounds like a useful thing to have.)</p>



<p>Since I figured that any bugs I would find on this product could potentially impact multiple companies, and more so, because it sounded very likely that this is linked to the organization’s Active Directory, it seemed like a good idea to spend some time here.</p>



<p>My first efforts led to discovering a few basic reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, which had apparently been identified by other researchers already. So I had to dig a little deeper. Luckily, it turned out the whole product can be downloaded and installed as a trial for 30 days.</p>



<h2>The Setup</h2>



<p>Since I was convinced there would probably be more XSS vulnerabilities to find, I decided to download and install the software with the idea of browsing through the Java source code looking for more bugs.</p>



<p>Having installed the software, I now had the advantage of being able to execute all tests locally, as well as read through the source code to understand exactly what happens in the application, and even use <code>grep</code> in the installation folder to find potentially interesting files.</p>



<div><div><div><div><p><h5>Sidenote</h5></p><div><p>To reverse engineer Java applications, I like to use <a href="https://github.com/Konloch/bytecode-viewer">Bytecode Viewer</a>, which decompiles and formats Java class files into readable Java code. It also allows to edit byte code and recompile the file on the fly and works great to decompile Android APK files too.<br></p></div></div></div></div></div>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="643" src="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-3-1024x643.png" alt="" srcset="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-3-1024x643.png 1024w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-3-300x188.png 300w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-3-768x482.png 768w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-3-700x439.png 700w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-3.png 1501w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>I started off manually browsing through some of the Java source files without many interesting discoveries. However, I did build an understanding of the software components and how they work together. This tends to be invaluable when looking for complex bugs in applications, so was definitely worth spending a couple of hours on. As a result, I had a pretty good picture of application features, the parts of the application that consisted mostly of legacy code vs. the parts that looked more recent, the parts that had been modified to fix previous security vulnerabilities, etc.</p>



<p>At one point, I decided to build a word list of application endpoints, which could hopefully serve two purposes: to perform some “classic” security tests directly against the endpoint, and to serve as a useful resource when targeting similar applications at some point in the future.</p>



<h2>The Bugs</h2>



<h4>1. Insecure deserialization in Java</h4>



<p>During my enumeration of the application’s endpoints, I spotted the following lines in one of the <code>web.xml</code> files:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="xml" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
&lt;servlet-name&gt;CewolfServlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
&lt;url-pattern&gt;/cewolf/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;</pre>



<p>When I googled that, I found <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48176">a published RCE against a <code>cewolf</code> endpoint</a> on another ManageEngine product, using a path traversal in the <code>img</code> parameter – this looked very promising!</p>



<p>Sure enough, after manually placing a file in a folder on my local installation, I could confirm that the deserialization vulnerability also existed in this version of ADSelfService Plus by browsing to <code>http://localhost:8888/cewolf/?img=/../../../path/to/evil.file</code></p>



<p>This meant I had a ready-to-use Java deserialization vulnerability on the targeted sites, but I would only be able to exploit it if I found a way to upload arbitrary files to the server first. So the work wasn’t quite done yet.</p>



<h4>2. Arbitrary file upload</h4>



<p>Finding an arbitrary file upload vulnerability did not look like an easy challenge. To maximize my attack surface, I continued to configure the software on my machine, which required setting up a local Domain Controller and an Active Directory domain to play with.</p>



<p>Fast forward through hours of downloading ISOs, making space on HDDs, VMware Workstation shenanigans, Microsoft Windows Server administration and watching Youtube videos with titles like “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRf_uU0vrMM&amp;t=773s">How to Set Up a Windows Server 2019 Domain Controller</a>“, and I finally had a setup that allowed me to log in to the admin panel.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="445" src="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-13-1024x445.png" alt="" srcset="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-13-1024x445.png 1024w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-13-300x130.png 300w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-13-768x334.png 768w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-13-700x304.png 700w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-13.png 1469w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>I finally set up a working copy of ADSelfService Plus, time to hack.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>With full admin access to the application, I could now further map out application features and API endpoints. For obvious reasons, I spent most of my time investigating all different upload features in the application, until I came across one feature that supported uploading a smartcard certificate configuration, resulting in a POST request to <code>/LogonCustomization.do?form=smartCard&amp;operation=Add</code></p>



<p>When I noticed that the uploaded certificate file was stored on the server’s file system without modifying the name, I figured that this might be the way forward to leverage the deserialization bug! So I traced this API call through the source code to find out more about possible ways to attack this.</p>



<p>On a high level, this is how that worked:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="888" height="410" src="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-12.png" alt="" srcset="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-12.png 888w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-12-300x139.png 300w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-12-768x355.png 768w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-12-700x323.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px"></figure>







<ol><li>A logged-in administrator can upload a smartcard configuration to <code>/LogonCustomization.do?form=smartCard&amp;operation=Add</code>;</li><li>This triggers a backend request to the server’s authenticated RestAPI on <code>/RestAPI/WC/SmartCard?HANDSHAKE_KEY=secret</code> using a secret handshake that is generated on the server side;</li><li>Before executing the requested action, the <code>HANDSHAKE_KEY</code> is validated against a second API endpoint on <code>/servlet/HSKeyAuthenticator?PRODUCT_NAME=ManageEngine+ADSelfService+Plus&amp;HANDSHAKE_KEY=secret</code> which returns <code>SUCCESS</code> or <code>FAILED</code> depending on the passed <code>secret</code>;</li><li>If successful, the uploaded certificate is written to <code>C:\ManageEngine\ADSelfService Plus\bin</code></li></ol>



<p>Interestingly, the <code>/RestAPI</code> endpoint was publicly accessible, so any request with a valid <code>HANDSHAKE_KEY</code> would bypass user authentication and be processed by the server.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the <code>/servlet/HSKeyAuthenticator</code> was also publicly accessible, allowing an unauthorized user to manually verify if an authentication secret was valid or not.</p>



<p>With this in mind, I returned to the now familiar source code.</p>



<h4>3. Bruteforceable authentication key </h4>



<p>I identified two interesting Java classes with some help from <code>grep</code>, and from my installation’s PostgreSQL database that contained a useful inventory of API endpoints and their authentication needs:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="711" height="459" src="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-10.png" alt="" srcset="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-10.png 711w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-10-300x194.png 300w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-10-700x452.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 711px) 100vw, 711px"><figcaption>Another benefit to local installations of software is full access to the underlying database.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>A snippet from <code>HSKeyAuthenticator.class</code> in <code>com.manageengine.ads.fw.servlet</code>:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="java" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="5-8" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
      try {
         String message = "FAILED";
         RestAPIKey.getInstance();
         String apiKey = RestAPIKey.getKey();
         String handShakeKey = request.getParameter("HANDSHAKE_KEY");
         if (handShakeKey.equals(apiKey)) {
            message = "SUCCESS";
         }

         PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
         response.setContentType("text/html");
         out.println(message);
         out.close();
      } catch (Exception var7) {
         HSKeyAuthenticator.out.log(Level.INFO, " ", var7);
      }

   }
</pre>



<p>And one from <code>RestAPIKey.class</code> in <code>package com.manageengine.ads.fw.api</code>:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="java" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="3-4,11,13" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">  public static void generateKey()
  {
    Long cT = Long.valueOf(System.currentTimeMillis());
    key = cT.toString();
    generatedTime = cT;
  }

  public static String getKey()
  {
    Long cT = Long.valueOf(System.currentTimeMillis());
    if ((key == null) || (generatedTime.longValue() + 120000L &lt; cT.longValue()))
    {
      generateKey();
    }
    return key;
  }
</pre>



<p>As you can see from those pieces of code, the API authentication key of the server is set to the current time in milliseconds and has a lifespan of 2 minutes. This means that at any given moment, there are 120 000 possible authentication keys (120 seconds * 1000 milliseconds/second).</p>



<p>In other words, if I could generate at least 1000 requests per second consistently over a time span of 2 minutes, I would have a guaranteed hit at the moment the authentication key expired and regenerated. While that seems like a large number for a network-level attack, a successful attack is not necessarily beyond the realm of possibility. Especially keeping in mind that even at a lower than 100% success rate, and given sufficient time, a successful hit becomes more and more likely.</p>



<p>In practice, I quickly had a working proof-of-concept that would brute force my local instance’s secret in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>However, when employing the script against a live target (i.e. over an <em>actual</em> internet connection), I wasn’t as lucky. I ran and reran the script with different configurations and settings for hours, and overnight without result, and was starting to fear my approach would have to be abandoned.</p>



<p>Furthermore, I got temporarily sidetracked because I wasn’t sure what time zone my target servers were running in. I ended up rerunning my script with multiple offsets from my own (CET) until I found out that Java’s <code><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#currentTimeMillis()">currentTimeMillis</a></code> apparently returns time in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and I needn’t have bothered.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Project managers who do resource management successfully reap more benefits in terms of better project outcomes and happier teams and clients.</p><div>
			
			<p>Resource Management is knowing how to utilize resources in an efficient way so projects get delivered on time, clients are happy with deliverables, teams don’t burn out, and there’s an actual profit at the end of it all.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_management" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> describes it as the efficient and effective development of an organization’s resources when they are needed.</p>

<p>Resource management can be applied to various aspects of a business in different industries, though it usually deals with Project Management. In other words, for the purpose of this article, let’s stick with Project Resource Management.</p>

<p>Resources can be intangible, like People and Time, and tangible, like Cash and Technology. Each aspect needs to be managed properly so they’re available and not diminishing, as they overlap in the process.</p>

<p>With the ever increasing trend of #WFH (working from home) and <a href="https://claritask.com/blog/working-remotely">remote work</a>, which a lot of successful companies big and small have recently adopted, it’s more crucial than ever to do project resource management right.</p>

<h2>Something you’ve already been doing</h2>
<p>Chances are, if you are a project manager, you’ve already been doing project resource management. The important part is to be aware of it and its techniques, which in turn will help you catapult ahead and become an irreplaceable “wizard” project manager of sorts.</p>

<p>Here are some real life examples:</p>

<h3>Content Marketing Firms</h3>
<p>If you are a content marketing firm, you will need writers and time to get the job done. Sometimes you may have less time for each of one of your writers, in which case you may get your client to agree on a smaller scope with a potentially similar impact. Other times, you may have the time, but less writers on hand. Knowing how to handle these situations is key in doing project resource management the right way.</p>

<h3>Web Design Firms</h3>
<p>In a web design firm, you’ll need web designers, front and back-end developers, technology (servers, framework of choice), writers. Each one of these resources (people mostly) needs to be arranged so they work in sync, and no part of the project is delayed. You may start with the design first (web designers), however your front and back-end developers should not be waiting around. They might be finishing up another project as the UI design is being completed in a new project, in which case they can start fresh right after.</p>

<h3>Advertising Agencies</h3>
<p>At an ad agency, you will have designers, copywriters, ad producers (usually third parties: cameras, editors), and clients to manage. It’s a wide skill set that requires a ton of flexibility, facilitation, understanding, and zen like traits, so you don’t lose your mind by mid-March.</p>

<h2>A Well oiled machine</h2>
<p>As you can see, this dance needs to be choreographically refined if your goal is to run a profitable business with a happy productive team behind it.</p>

<p>Now you don’t need to run everything as a Swiss watch, even though that should be the aspiration, but you may run the risk of burning out your team and not having them “fresh” for next projects in line.</p>

<p>In other words it’s OK for your team to slack around from time to time. <strong>Example:</strong> Your front-end developer might go at full speed as they’re delivering a project. And once the next week rolls in, they can do a bit of maintenance on older projects, while “waiting around” for the UI designer to get done with their part. This way they’re resting actively, recharging their batteries, and getting ready for the next sprint. In our line of work it’s a long marathon made up of many sprints and active rests.</p>

<blockquote><p>As your team grows and learns working with one another. They’ll unknowingly lend you a hand and manage themselves, while always understanding what’s to come.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Micromanaging is something you want to avoid as your team grows, not just in numbers but in wisdom. Your aim is to let go of direction. Running a synergized team that understands the overall goal is where you want to be.</p>

<p>At the core of it, project resource management is “energy management”. You want to manage your finite energy, or rather your team’s finite energy. The intent should always be to let it replenish and go again at it the next time around.</p>

<h2>What about transparency?</h2>
<p>A lot of firms employ transparency about every bit of their project. Some go down into detail and share every aspect of it. While we at Claritask like to run things transparently, we believe that way too much of it can backfire and inundate some of your team members. We’re not suggesting “you hide” things from your team. Information should be freely available across the board. But, there are times when junior team-members could easily be intimidated by the overall scope and importance of your project. As they keep growing into seniority, they’ll naturally want to know more about how their contribution affects the overall project. It’s always best to let team members grow into the transparency they desire rather than throw every bit of information at them and run the risk of burning them out early on.</p>

<h2>Companies big and small</h2>
<p>Bigger firms have the actual resources to hire a “resource manager”. For the rest of us, it’s a skill we must hone as we manage projects on a daily basis. Being a project manager that does resource management well, gives you the rare super power not just to delegate tasks but when and how to delegate them.</p>

<p>In smaller companies, where project scope and pace might change on a weekly basis, you need to know when to take someone out of the project or shuffle them out entirely on a different deliverable. You want to do this gracefully or you may risk losing their trust next time around. This bit is called “Resource Leveling”: a technique that aims at discovering unused capacities of a team member. Let’s say someone in your team is a developer but they know a thing or two about UI design. You can quickly borrow this secondary skill they have and deliver your project on time.</p>

<h2>The hard truth</h2>
<p><strong>The bottom line is this:</strong> You are not <a href="https://claritask.com/blog/the-way-to-becoming-a-good-project-manager">a complete project manager</a> without the skillset of a resource manager. In other words, managing a project doesn’t mean just allocating tasks as they come in, without the sense of how things are moving forward, what tools you have left, how much time is at your disposal, and who from your team you have available at any given time.</p>

<h2>At the core of it, successful project resource management:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keeps everyone happy, so your and your team’s hair is not constantly on fire.</li>
<li>Gives you margin to try something new if things don’t work out the way you had planned initially.</li>
<li>Creates trust in your team. Lets your team know that you’re on their side by allocating resources and making their well-being a priority. <strong>Happy team = Successful project outcomes.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Resource managing “people” as a key aspect of any projects</h2>
<p>Tangible things like Cash and Technology can be easily measured. People, on the other hand, are unpredictable. Not on a personal level, but things that happen around them. A successful project manager is always aware of their team’s biorhythm.</p>

<p>At times a specific team member may struggle with a single task because of the stress with the overall scope of the project. An empathic project manager will understand this and nudge them ever so slightly towards inspiration and motivate them to come up with an easier solution.</p>

<blockquote><p>As you develop these skills, you’ll have a better sense of seeing problems before they surface. You’ll learn how to somewhat predict the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the best ways to understand how to “resource manage” your team is knowing what’s coming up for them in the near future. One way to do this in Claritask is via the “MY TASKS” section in which you can quickly view everyone’s load at one glance.</p>

<p>Being a successful project resource manager it makes your job easier. It helps you become a great leader as you move each chess piece confidently and with less risk, because you’ve created the necessary margins before the project even started.</p>

<p>This way you’ll deliver more projects on time, have happier clients, make more dollars per hours spent, and become known as a company that makes magic happen by delivering stellar work with less resources available.</p>

<p><strong>If we want to leave one thing with you at the end of this article is this:</strong> The key to successful project resource management is to run a lean operation and do more with less waste along the way.</p>

<h3>Break someone’s code today!</h3><p>On September 1st of 2000 Damian Conway sent a proposal №188, promoting the idea of Private Keys and Methods.</p><p>In those days, Perl’s object-oriented programming relied heavily on hashes. Indeed, a hash can store data values by keys, as well as  references to routines, which is how you can describe an object with data attributes and methods. With bits of syntax sugar here and there one can make shortcuts to work with such an object’s state and behavior.</p><p>So can be done in Raku nowadays:</p><pre id="advent-code-fdb55dec-8cdf-4465-89e6-a64a01297843"><table>

It gives you means to divide your coding efforts into a couple of different realms, one of which has “Nobody but I can use this” policy and its opposite takes the famous “Use it as you please and we will try really, really hard not to break anything knowingly” stance.</p><p>While encapsulation by itself is not a Great Code Problems Solver (you can write scary code anyways!) nor it reduces the amount of bugs (as if it happens!), but it certainly can save you some nerves during rewriting code (which sometimes is a Great Way To Solve Problems) and reduces coupling between components (which does reduce the amount of bugs, right? Hope never dies).</p><p>Here, inspired by the <code>Tie::SecureHash</code> module approach, Damian Conway has proposed a way to support encapsulation in a hash-based object-y system.</p><h3>Sugar – the keyword way</h3><p>The proposal describes a unary function named <code>private</code>, which can be applied to a single hash entry, a slice of entries or a whole hash:</p><pre id="advent-code-922ff4d7-0f96-4ebf-b620-d3383d9fe9e7"><table>

<h3>Conclusion: Huffmanize it!</h3>

<p>Raku wisdom says “Huffmanize your syntax”, as mighty Huffman coding it tells you to make things which are common to type easier to type.</p><p>With the Raku object system being ground up overhauled, the question of encapsulation was not forgotten! Not! In! A! Bit! (sorry for all the line noise you just heard).</p>

<p>Private things in Raku are marked with an exclamation mark. Firstly, it indicates to the reader those code bits are important. Secondly, for attributes it serves as a secondary “sigil”, namely “twigil”, which tells the reader that some interesting scoping is involved here. Thirdly, it looks like it has some class. Fourthly… Do you really expect more reasons here? Please, come up with your ideas in the comments!</p><p>Using Raku for some years, it suddenly strikes with a simple consistency here:</p><pre id="advent-code-e041a903-314f-48ac-a379-d7ea49cce3f1"><table>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="EssayContents"><div id="EssayContentsInner"><div><blockquote><em>Quantum mechanics: real black magic calculus.</em><p>— Albert Einstein, writing to a colleague in 1925</p></blockquote><p>In fairy tales, a wizard will say the magic words of a spell, or inscribe a set of magic symbols, and the world will change. Fireballs shoot from their hands; the hero is revived from an endless slumber; a couple falls in love. We smile when we hear such stories. They seem quaint but implausible. Common sense tells us that merely speaking certain words, or inscribing certain symbols, cannot cause such changes in the world. And yet our scientific theories are not so different. By speaking the words or inscribing the symbols of such a theory, we can greatly deepen our understanding of the world. That new understanding then enables us to change the world in ways that formerly seemed impossible, even inconceivable. Consider quantum mechanics, one of our deepest theories. It has helped us create lasers, semiconductor chips, and magnetic resonance imaging. One day it will likely help us create quantum computers, perhaps even quantum intelligences. Quantum mechanics is magic that actually works.</p><p>In this essay, we explain quantum mechanics in detail. We will describe all the principles of quantum mechanics in depth, nothing held back. It's not a handy-wavy treatment, of the kind often found in articles written for a general audience. While such articles can be entertaining, trying to learn quantum mechanics by reading them is like learning to play basketball by merely watching basketball being played. This essay will get you out on the mathematical court of quantum mechanics. Of course, you won't learn to slam dunk, at least not yet. But the essay will ground you in an understanding of the fundamentals of quantum mechanics, which you can later build upon and extend.</p><p>To read the essay, you must first understand the quantum circuit model of quantum computation. If you're not familiar with quantum circuits, you can learn about them from our earlier essay, <a href="https://quantum.country/qcvc">Quantum Computing for the Very Curious</a>. You may wish to pause to read that essay now, if you haven't already. Once you've understood that material you shouldn't need any other prerequisites. Indeed, when you learned quantum computing, you learned in passing almost all of quantum mechanics. In <a href="#postulates">Part I</a> of this essay we distill those past ideas, collecting them up into the package known as quantum mechanics.</p><p>Although quantum mechanics is not so difficult to learn, it's a theory which has disturbed many people. Here's a few classic quotes on this puzzlement:</p><blockquote><p><em>I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics … Do not keep saying to yourself, if you can possibly avoid it, “But how can it be like that?” because you will get “down the drain”, into a blind alley from which nobody has yet escaped. Nobody knows how it can be like that. </em>– Richard Feynman</p><p><em>I have thought a hundred times as much about the quantum problems as I have about general relativity theory.</em> – Albert Einstein</p><p><em>If quantum mechanics hasn't profoundly shocked you, you haven't understood it yet.</em> – Niels Bohr</p></blockquote><p>If quantum mechanics is not so difficult to learn, why has it so disturbed many great physicists? What do they mean when they say they don't understand it, or are shocked by it? How can a scientific theory be both beautiful and disturbing? In <a href="#trouble-with-qm">Part II</a> of this essay we'll explore these questions. As we'll see, despite its simplicity quantum mechanics raises striking conceptual problems, problems which are among the most exciting open problems in science today.</p><p>The essay is presented in an unusual form. It's an example of what we call a <em>mnemonic essay</em>, written in the <em>mnemonic medium</em>. That means it incorporates new user interface elements intended to make it almost effortless for you to remember and apply the ideas in the essay. The motivator is that most people (ourselves included) quickly forget much of what we read in books and articles. The mnemonic medium takes advantage of what cognitive scientists know about how humans learn, creating an interface which ensures you'll remember the ideas and how to apply them near permanently. More on how that works below.</p><p>So, what is quantum mechanics? It's fun to wax poetic about it being magic that actually works, or to quote eminent scientists saying no-one really understands it. But while fun, those statements give no direct enlightenment. What is quantum mechanics, really?</p><p>Quantum mechanics is simply this: it's a set of four postulates that provide a mathematical framework for describing the universe and everything in it. These postulates reflect ideas you've already seen in the quantum circuit model: how to describe a quantum state; how to describe the dynamics of a quantum system; and so on. But rather than talk abstractly, it's better to just see the first postulate:</p><h2 id="first-postulate-qm">The first postulate: state space</h2><blockquote><strong>Postulate 1:</strong> Associated to any physical system is a complex vector space known as the <em>state space</em> of the system. If the system is isolated, then the system is completely described by its <em>state vector</em>, which is a unit vector in the system's state space.</blockquote><p>This may seem densely written, but you already know most of it. In particular, we've been working extensively with qubits, and we've seen this postulate in action. For a qubit the state space is, as you know, a two-dimensional complex vector space. The state is a unit vector in that state space (i.e., has length <span><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>)</span>. And the condition that the state vector is a unit vector expresses the idea that the probabilities for the outcomes of a computational basis measurement add up to <span><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>.</span></p><p>It's not just qubits that have a state space. The first postulate of quantum mechanics tells us that <em>every</em> physical system has a state space. An atom has a state space; a human being has a state space; even the universe as a whole has a state space. Admittedly, the first postulate doesn't tell us what the state space is, for any given physical system. That needs to be figured out on a case-by-case basis. Different types of atoms have different state spaces; a human being has a different (and much more complicated) state space; the universe has a more complicated state space still.</p><p>As an example, suppose you're interested in what happens when you shine light on an atom. To give a quantum mechanical description, you'd need a state space to describe atoms and the electromagnetic field (i.e., light). <em>A priori</em> it's not obvious what that state space should be. How many dimensions should the state space have? How do particular physical configurations of atoms and light correspond to states in that state space? By itself, quantum mechanics doesn't answer these questions. It merely does the subtle-but-important job of instructing you to look for answers to these questions. Fortunately, there is a theory, known as quantum electrodynamics (often shortened to QED), which describes how atoms and light interact. Among other things, QED tells us which states and state spaces to use to give quantum descriptions of atoms and light.</p><p>In a similar way, suppose we're trying to describe particles like quarks or the Higgs boson. Just as with the atoms-and-light example, quantum mechanics tells us we need figure out the right state spaces and state vectors. But it doesn't tell us what those are. In this case, the additional theory needed is the standard model of particle physics. Like QED, the standard model sits on top of basic quantum mechanics, fleshing it out, telling us things which aren't in the four postulates of quantum mechanics.</p><p>More generally, quantum mechanics alone isn't a fully specified physical theory. Rather, it's a framework to use to construct physical theories (like QED). It's helpful to think of quantum mechanics as analogous to an operating system for a computer. On its own, the operating system doesn't do all the user needs. Rather, it's a framework that accomplishes important housekeeping functions, creating a file system, a graphical display and interface, and so on. But users need another layer of application software on top of those basic functions. That application layer is analogous to physical theories like QED and the standard model. The application layer runs within the framework provided by the operating system, but isn't itself part of the operating system<span>This analogy was popularized in Scott Aaronson's book “Quantum Computing Since Democritus”; MN believes Scott first heard it in a <a href="https://www.fields.utoronto.ca/av/audio/00-01/quantum_computing/nielsen1.mp3">talk</a> MN gave at the Fields Institute in Toronto in 2001. This wouldn't warrant mention, except when MN uses the analogy, people often respond “oh yes, that's Scott Aaronson's way of thinking about quantum mechanics”. MN doesn't recall where he first heard it, or if the description is original.</span>.</p><p>In this essay, we won't get deeply into QED or the standard model or the other theories physicists have developed to describe particular physical systems. Rather, our focus is on quantum mechanics itself – the four postulates. For examples, we'll mostly draw on the quantum circuit model, which makes simple and reasonable assumptions about state spaces and state vectors. This model is already an extremely rich arena for studying quantum mechanics. If you wish, you can learn later about QED, the standard model, and so on.</p><p>Of course, this means there is still much more to learn, beyond the scope of this essay. Each physical system requires learning its own particular set of recipes for state spaces and state vectors. You already know some such recipes: if we say “let's consider a 3-qubit system”, then we know the state space is just the 8-dimensional complex vector space spanned by the computational basis states <span><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mn>0</mn><mo stretchy="false">⟩</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mn>0</mn><mo stretchy="false">⟩</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mn>0</mn><mo stretchy="false">⟩</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">|0\rangle|0\rangle|0\rangle</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>,</span> <span><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mn>0</mn><mo stretchy="false">⟩</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mn>0</mn><mo stretchy="false">⟩</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="false">⟩</mo><mo separator="true">,</mo><mo>…</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">|0\rangle|0\rangle|1\rangle, \ldots</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>.</span> By contrast, you probably don't know the recipe QED gives telling us how to construct the state space for a couple of hydrogen atoms interacting with the electromagnetic field<span>A little more strictly speaking, QED tells us how charged elementary particles like electrons interact with the electromagnetic field.

          <p>Languages are often judged initially on their "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program">Hello,
world!</a>" program.
How easy is it to write? To run? How easy is it to understand? It's a very
simple program, of course, one of the simplest, even... just produce a little
text, and display it, what could be simpler?</p>
<p>It's really not fair to judge a language by such a cursory impression, but it
<em>can</em> give you an idea of what a language <em>values</em> and how it works. What does
the syntax look like? Is it typed? Is it interpreted? You can usually tell a
lot at a glance.</p>
<p>For example, One of Ruby's (many) hello worlds is so simple, it's also Python!</p>
<pre><code>print(<span>'Hello world!'</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>Often, people coming from interpreted languages experience compiled, systems
languages to be more complicated right off the bat. There is the obvious added
complexity of compiling and running being separate steps, as opposed to simply
pointing an executable at some source code and seeing a result right away, but
there are often syntactical constructs to go along with that...</p>
<p>At first glance, Rust's hello world looks fairly inert, as well:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>fn</span> <span>main</span></span>() {
    <span>println!</span>(<span>"Hello World!"</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>But <code>println!</code> is actually a macro, what does it look like expanded?</p>
<pre><code><span>macro_rules!</span> println {
    () =&gt; ($crate::<span>print!</span>(<span>"\n"</span>));
    ($($arg:tt)*) =&gt; ({
        $crate::io::_print($crate::format_args_nl!($($arg)*));
    })
}
</code></pre>
<p>You'll notice that this <em>also</em> has a macro <em>inside of it.</em> This matches on the
second case (because there is an argument present) and calls into
<code>$crate::format_args_nl!</code> and passes the result of that to <code>$crate::io::_print</code></p>
<pre><code><span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>_print</span></span>(args: fmt::Arguments&lt;<span>'_</span>&gt;) {
    print_to(args, &amp;LOCAL_STDOUT, stdout, <span>"stdout"</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>which calls into <code>print_to</code>, which looks like</p>

<p>To be clear, I'm not faulting Rust here at all, my point is exactly the

"Hello world!" than <code>puts "la de da"</code> or similar would have you believe on its

<p>Hello world!</p>
<p>We all know that a languages like Ruby or Python are designed explicitly to
hide this sort of complexity from us and let us get on with the dirty business
of munging data blobs or serving web requests or solving sudokus or whatever,
and thank goodness for that, but wow that is <em>quite</em> a lot, isn't it?</p>
<hr>
<p>When people come from languages that were designed to be ergonomic to more
systems oriented languages, they're often jarred by what they perceive to be
code thatis inelegant, ugly, and verbose. To be sure, it sometimes <em>is</em> exactly
that... (although anyone who has worked with a "pretty" language in a production
codebase knows that those are not immune to these descriptors either).</p>
<p>Usually, the tradeoff is explicit: elegance and simplicity for
<em>control</em>...  specific and granular <em>control</em>, over the program that will
eventually be run.  It isn't always necessary, in fact it is almost always _un_necessary,
to have <em>that</em> much control over your program. Obviously, productivity matters,
and if your business is <em><em>insert viable business</em></em>, well it's likely that your
goals are not going to be optimally met by futzing with manual memory
management all day (<a href="https://danluu.com/sounds-easy/">at least from the macro level, in the general
sense</a>).</p>
<p>But what if you <em>do</em> need that control? Well then, <em>you need it</em>. When every
ounce of performance actually is necessary, or on embedded systems with hard
memory constraints, or when writing code for some bespoke or otherwise uncommon
processor.</p>
<p>I'm going to choose one language, Zig, and dive deep into its hello world, but
it is important to note here that my point is not primarily about Zig, it's
about how <em>all</em> languages have to contend with an enormous amount of complexity
in order to do <em>anything</em>, even the simplest of tasks like a hello world
program. Complexity that is, for the most part, hidden from us in our day to
day. So what in the hello world is <em>actually</em> going on then?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll be using the most current minor release version of Zig: 0.6.0.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Let's take a walk</h2>
<p><a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>'s hello world looks like this, from the docs.:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> std = <span>@import</span>(<span>"std"</span>);

<span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>main</span></span>() !<span>void</span> {
    <span>const</span> stdout = std.io.getStdOut().outStream();
    <span>try</span> stdout.print(<span>"Hello, {}!\n"</span>, .{<span>"world"</span>});
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you are new to zig, a quick word on this syntax before I get into the gritty
details.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> std = <span>@import</span>(<span>"std"</span>);
</code></pre>
<p><code>@import</code> is a <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.6.0/#Builtin-Functions"><em>compiler
builtin</em></a> function
that assigns the namespace of the file it is referencing to the <code>const</code>
variable on the left hand side.</p>
<pre><code><span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>main</span></span>() !<span>void</span> {
  
}
</code></pre>
<p>Just like in C, <code>main</code> is a special function that marks the entry point to a
program after it has been compiled as an executable. Unlike in C, it accepts no
arguments (C's main function has a variety of vagaries that make it a bit
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/4207223">unique</a>) and command line input is
available through utility functions to allow easier cross platform use.</p>
<p>It is marked <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.6.0/#Keyword-pub"><code>pub</code></a> so
that it is accessible from outside of the immediate module ('module' here
referring to nothing more than the top level scope of the current namespace...
i.e., the file), this is a necessary step since, as the program's entry point,
<code>main</code> would <em>have</em> to be accessible from outside the immediate scope.</p>
<p><code>fn</code> is the function keyword.</p>
<p><code>main()</code> is the name of the function (and where the argument list <em>would</em> be)
and <code>!void</code> is the return type. Looking a little closer at that return type:</p>
<p>In C, the return type of a function is declared <em>before</em> anything else. This
makes a certain amount of sense: it's congruent with how variables are
declared, after all, and scanning the file you can see clearly "calling this
will get you that."</p>
<p>In Zig, the return type comes after the function declaration but before the
function body. This also makes sense! It's the same in Rust and Go, and seems
to be generally a more modern approach. The reason is actually pretty simple:
doing it this way makes it possible to have a context-free grammar! C and C++
put the parser in a position where it <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14589346/is-c-context-free-or-context-sensitive">has to understand semantics to even just
<em>parse</em> the source
code.</a></p>
<p>In Zig, <code>main</code> returns <code>void</code> (well, actually, it can return a variety of
things, and if it returns void (which is just a way of saying it doesn't return
anything at all)), it's actually returning
<a href="https://github.com/jfo/zig/blob/7381aaf70e0cad92fc52b79f3aa2a0abb7c3ee04/lib/std/start.zig#L241-L244"><code>0</code></a>
as a success code, but) there is a wrinkle!  <code>void</code> is preceded by an
exclamation mark. This means: "This function is supposed to return <code>void</code>, but
it <em>could</em> fail and return an error." This is an <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.6.0/#Inferred-Error-Sets">inferred error
set</a>, and
whenever a function that <em>could</em> fail is called, the compiler will enforce that
you handle that error at the call site. More on Zig's error handling some other
time, for now it is enough to understand what the <code>!</code> in front of the return
type declaration means. I want to move on to the body of the function, let's go
line by line.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> stdout = std.io.getStdOut().outStream();
</code></pre>
<p>So, we can see that this is a call into a standard library function (<code>std</code>)
that returns something that we assign to <code>const stdout</code>. Standard out (stdout) and
standard error (stderr) may be familiar concepts from the shell, but what does it
mean to be referring to <code>stdout</code> here in this program? What exactly <em>is</em>
<code>stdout</code>? Whatever it is, it's being returned by the call to <code>outStream()</code>,
which is a method called on the return value of <code>std.io.getStdOut()</code>, so we
first need to know what <em>that</em> is.</p>
<p>To the source! In the Zig source tree, <code>std</code> lives in <code>lib/std/std.zig</code>, which
is a file that makes a wide variety of functionality available. It includes the line:</p>
<pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>const</span> io = <span>@import</span>(<span>"io.zig"</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>Which is referred to on the <code>std</code> variable as <code>std.io</code> (again, notice the <code>pub</code>
keyword, without which this declared constant would be inaccesible outside of
this immediate scope). Going deeper, into <code>lib/std/io.zig</code>...</p>
<pre><code><span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>getStdOut</span></span>() File {
    <span>return</span> File{
        .handle = getStdOutHandle(),
        .capable_io_mode = .blocking,
        .intended_io_mode = default_mode,
    };
}
</code></pre>
<p>So, <code>stdout</code> is a <em>File</em> struct. Let's look at that. It is imported at the top
of <code>io.zig</code> as</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> File = std.fs.File;
</code></pre>
<p>and lives in the source, perhaps unsurprisingly, at <code>lib/std/fs/File.zig</code>. This
struct definition is quite long, so I'll focus on what we want to look at, the
<code>outStream()</code> method.</p>
<h2>An aside: methods vs functions</h2>
<p>Zig doesn't <em>really</em> have methods, but it's useful to talk about a special
class of functions <em>as</em> methods, since the calling convention supports implicit
passing of <code>self</code> when called on a struct "instance" using dot syntax. Let me
show you what I mean.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> std = <span>@import</span>(<span>"std"</span>);

<span>con…</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Aug 15, 2020</p>
<p>This is a hand-wavy philosophical article about programming, without quantifiable justification, but with some actionable advice and a case study.</p>
<p>Suppose that there are two types in the program, <code>Blorb</code> and <code>Gonk</code>.
Suppose also that they both can <code>blag</code>.</p>
<p>Does it make sense to add the following trait?</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>trait</span> <span>Blag</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>blag</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>I claim that it makes sense only if you have a function like</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>fn</span> <span>blagyify</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>Blag</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>That is, if some part of you program is generic over <code>T: Blag</code>.</p>
<p>If in every <code>x.blag()</code> the <code>x</code> is either <code>Blorg</code>, or <code>Gonk</code>, but never a <code>T</code> (each usage is <em>concrete</em>), you don’t need this abstraction.
“Need” is used in a literal sense here: replace a trait with two inherent methods named <code>blag</code>, and the code will be essentially the same.
Using a trait here doesn’t achieve any <a href="https://caseymuratori.com/blog_0015">semantic compression</a>.</p>
<p>Given that abstractions have costs “don’t need” can be strengthen to “probably shouldn’t”.</p>

<p>Not going for an abstraction often allows a for more specific interface.
A monad in Haskell is a thing with <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>.
Which isn’t telling much.
Languages like Rust and OCaml can’t express a general monad, but they still have concrete monads.
The <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> is called <code>and_then</code> for futures and <code>flat_map</code> for lists.
These names are <em>more specific</em> than <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> and are easier to understand.
The <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> is only required if you want to write code generic over type of monad itself, which happens rarely.</p>
<p>Another example of abstraction which is used mostly concretely are collection hierarchies.
In Java or Scala, there’s a whole type hierarchy for things which can hold other things.
Rust’s type system can’t express <code>Collection</code> trait, so we have to get by with using <code>Vec</code>, <code>HashSet</code> and <code>BTreeSet</code> directly.
And it isn’t actually a problem in practice.
Turns out, writing code which is generic over collections (and not just over iterators) is not that useful.
The "but I can change the collection type later" argument also seems overrated — often, there’s only single collection type that makes sense.
Moreover, swapping <code>HashSet</code> for <code>BTreeSet</code> is mostly just a change at the definition site, as the two happen to have almost identical interface anyway.
The only case where I miss Java collections is when I return <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>, but mean a generic <em>unordered</em> collection.
In Java, the difference is captured by <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> vs <code>Collection&lt;T&gt;</code>.
In Rust, there’s nothing built-in for this.
It is possible to define a <code>VecSet&lt;T&gt;(Vec&lt;T&gt;)</code>, but doesn’t seem worth the effort.</p>
<p>Collections also suffer from <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> problem — collapsing similar synonyms under a single name.
Java’s
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Queue.html">Queue</a>
has <code>add</code>, <code>offer</code>, <code>remove</code>, and <code>poll</code> methods, because it needs to be a collection, but also is a special kind of collection.
In C++, you have to spell <code>push_back</code> for <code>vector</code>'s push operation, so that it duck-types with <code>deque</code>'s <code>front</code> and <code>back</code>.</p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<i title="Note"></i>
</td>
<td>
<p>Collection hierarchy is a sufficient, but not necessary condition for mixing up method names.
Rust’s <code>BinaryHeap</code> should have had <code>BinaryHeap::pop_max</code> method.
Alas, we are stuck with <code>pop</code>, which, coupled with the fact that the heap is surprisingly and uselessly a max-heap, means many student-hours wasted on debugging misbehaving Dijkstra algorithm.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Finally, the promised case study!
rust-analyzer needs to convert a bunch of internal type to types suitable for converting them into JSON message of the Language Server Protocol.
<code>ra::Completion</code> is converted into <code>lsp::Completion</code>; <code>ra::Completion</code> contains <code>ra::TextRange</code> which is converted to <code>lsp::Range</code>, etc.</p>
<p>The first implementation started with an abstraction for conversion:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre><span>pub</span> <span>trait</span> <span>Conv</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>type</span> <span>Output</span><span>;</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>conv</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Self</span><span>::</span><span>Output</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>This abstraction doesn’t work for all cases — sometimes the conversion requires additional context.
For example, to convert a rust-analyzer’s offset (a position of byte in the file) to an LSP position (<code>(line, column)</code> pair), a table with positions of newlines is needed.
This is easy to handle:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre><span>pub</span> <span>trait</span> <span>ConvWith</span><span>&lt;</span><span>CTX</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>type</span> <span>Output</span><span>;</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>conv_with</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>ctx</span><span>:</span> <span>CTX</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Self</span><span>::</span><span>Output</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Naturally, there was an intricate web of delegating impls.
The typical one looked like this:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre> 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8

11
12
</pre></td><td><pre><span>impl</span> <span>ConvWith</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>LineIndex</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>TextRange</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>type</span> <span>Output</span> <span>=</span> <span>Range</span><span>;</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>conv_with</span><span>(</span>
        <span>self</span><span>,</span>
        <span>line_index</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>LineIndex</span><span>,</span>
    <span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>lsp_types</span><span>::</span><span>Range</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>Range</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span>
            <span>self</span><span>.start</span><span>()</span><span>.conv_with</span><span>(</span><span>line_index</span><span>),</span>
            <span>self</span><span>.end</span><span>()</span><span>.conv_with</span><span>(</span><span>line_index</span><span>),</span>
        <span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>There were a couple of genuinely generic impls for converting iterators of convertible things.</p>
<p>The code was hard to understand.
It also was hard to use: if calling <code>.conv</code> didn’t work immediately, it took a lot of time to find which specific impl didn’t apply.
Finally, there were many accidental (as in “accidental complexity”) changes to the shape of code: <code>CTX</code> being passed by value or by reference, switching between generic parameters and associated types, etc.</p>
<p>I was really annoyed by how this conceptually simple pure boilerplate operation got expressed as clever and fancy abstraction.
Crucially, almost all of the usages of the abstraction (besides those couple of iterator impls) were concrete.
So I replaced the whole edifice with much simpler code, a bunch of functions:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre> 1

    <span>let</span> <span>end</span> <span>=</span> <span>position</span><span>(</span><span>line_index</span><span>,</span> <span>range</span><span>.end</span><span>());</span>
    <span>lsp_types</span><span>::</span><span>Range</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>start</span><span>,</span> <span>end</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>position</span><span>(</span>
    <span>line_index</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>LineIndex</span><span>,</span>
    <span>offset</span><span>:</span> <span>TextSize</span><span>,</span>
<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>lsp_types</span><span>::</span><span>Position</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Simplicity and ease of use went up tremendously.
Now instead of typing <code>x.conv()</code> and trying to figure out why an impl I think should apply doesn’t apply, I just auto-complete <code>to_proto::range</code> and let the compiler tell me exactly which types don’t line up.</p>
<p>I’ve lost fancy iterator impls, but the
<a href="https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/pull/4418/commits/1586bab0b97bef411e6187dfc389557edbc5a16e">total diff</a>
for the commit was <code>+999,-1123</code>.
There was some genuine code re-use in those impls, but it was not justified by the overall compression, even disregarding additional complexity tax.</p>
<p>To sum up, “is this abstraction used exclusively concretely?” is a meaningful question about the overall shape of code.
If the answer is “Yes!”, then the abstraction can be replaced by a number of equivalent non-abstract implementations.
As the latter tend to be simpler, shorter, and more direct, “Concrete Abstraction” can be considered a code smell.
As usual though, any abstract programming advice can be applied only in a concrete context — don’t blindly replace abstractions with concretions, check if provided justifications work for your particular case!</p>

<p><em>tl;dr: Four graphs show that almost all of Mozilla’s revenue comes
from Google et al., and the majority of its expenses go to software
development.</em></p>

<p>In my <a href="https://civilityandtruth.com/2020/08/13/mozillas-uncertain-future/">last post about Mozilla</a> I included a bit of data and a
lot of opinions. In this post I’ll reverse that and provide more data
and fewer opinions.</p>

<p>I was interested in knowing at a high level what were the major
categories of Mozilla’s revenue and (what’s a bit more interesting)
what were the major categories of Mozilla’s expenses. To do this I
went through the consolidated financial statements for the Mozilla
Foundation and Mozilla Corporation, extracted the data I was
interested in, and applied a bit of R code.</p>

<p>The graph above shows the major categories of revenue for Mozilla from
2005 through 2018, the last year for which we have financial
data. Note that I consolidated some categories of revenue to simplify
the graph. For example, I combined income from interest and dividends,
investment gains and losses, and similar categories into an overall
category of miscellaneous revenue.</p>

<p>The results are not surprising: by far the major driver of revenue was
royalties received from Google and other search engine vendors, with
everything else (including grants and donations to the Mozilla
Foundation) being relatively negligible.</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>The data for the various high-level categories is bit more interesting
when expressed as a percentage of total revenue. Again, royalties from
Google and other search engine providers dominate the picture, never
going below 90% of total revenue and typically at 95% or greater.</p>

<p>There’s one interesting anomaly for the years prior to 2009, in which
miscellaneous income rose to almost 10% of total revenue and then
dropped below zero (i.e., it constituted a net loss). This appears to
be due to Mozilla Foundation and/or Corporation investments doing well
in the run-up to the financial crisis of 2008, and then suffering
losses. Since 2009 miscellaneous income has been more stable as a
percentage of total revenue, possibly due to the favorable economic
environment and/or more conservative investment strategies.</p>

<p>Also, for future reference note the category relating to subscriptions
and advertising, which is currently under 5% of total revenues. I
presume that revenues relating to Pocket are assigned to that
category, and that revenues from the Mozilla VPN and other services
will go there as well. It will be interesting to see in future
financial statements whether that category grows substantially as a
percentage of total revenue. That will be a key indicator of whether
Mozilla is going to be able to move beyond its dependence on Google and
other search engine providers.</p>

  <p><a href="https://civilityandtruth.com/assets/images/mozilla-expense-categories.png"><img src="https://civilityandtruth.com/assets/images/mozilla-expense-categories-embed.png" alt="Graph of Mozilla’s main categories of expenses"></a></p>

</figure>

<p>The graph above shows the main categories of expenses incurred by the
Mozilla Foundation and Mozilla Corporation considered together. As one
might expect, the largest category of expenses is for activities
related to software development, including the salaries of the
software developers themselves.</p>

<p>The next two largest categories are marketing, i.e., activities
relating to promotion of Mozilla products and services, and general
and administrative, i.e., all the support activities needed to keep
Mozilla running, including the salaries of people not involved in
software development. It’s interesting to note that marketing-related
expenses seem to have leveled off somewhat in the years leading up to
2018.</p>

<p>The programs category includes things other than software development
that further the nonprofit goals of Mozilla. Mozilla Foundation grants
and fellowships go here, among others.</p>

Commons Attribution 4.0 International license</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The final graph shows the data in the previous graph expressed as a
percentage of total expenses. Here again we see the large amount of
expenses relating to software development, just above 60% in the years
leading up to 2018.</p>

<p>Marketing and general and administrative expenses have tended to be in
the range of 10% to 20%, with marketing sometimes higher than G&amp;A
and sometimes lower. Finally, program-related expenses have been
rising in the years leading up to 2018, and if this trend continues in
2019 and beyond may come to make up around 10% of total Mozilla
spending.</p>

<p>That concludes this brief tour of Mozilla’s finances. There is more
that could be said about Mozilla’s finances, but that’s a task I will
leave to others; see the section below for how to get started.</p>

<p>Finally, thanks to all who read my prior post and tweeted about it,
and to those who ended up following me on Twitter or subscribing to my
(very occasional) newsletter. If you’re interested in more of my
thoughts on Mozilla I will likely end up disappointing you: this will
probably be my final Mozilla-related post for a while, and perhaps
forever. Feel free to unfollow me or unsubscribe unless you have an
interest in whatever other topics I might end up writing about next.</p>

<p>A lot of my Google searches are specific and require lots of typing, e.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>site:cppreference.com OR site:cplusplus.com realloc</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This searches for "realloc" on <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/">cppreference.com</a> and <a href="https://www.cplusplus.com/">cplusplus.com</a>.
To reduce the amount of typing, I built a command line tool that allows me to
use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science)">macros</a> that expand into larger phrases. E.g. I can write</p>
<blockquote>
<p>{cpp} realloc</p>
</blockquote>
<p>instead of writing</p>
<blockquote>
<p>site:cppreference.com OR site:cplusplus.com realloc</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>I could copy-and-paste these URLs into my browser. But, since I use macOS, I
create a <a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Functions.html#Functions">shell function</a> that uses the <a href="https://ss64.com/osx/open.html">open</a> command:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ gg() { open "$(./search-google "$@")" ; }
$ gg {movie} alien 1979
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>(Opens URL in my browser.)
</code></pre>

<p>I place the macro file in my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory">home directory</a> using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.home">pathlib.Path.home</a>.</p>
<p>I read from the macro file using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.read_text">pathlib.Path.read_text</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.finditer">re.finditer</a>.
I use a regular expression to extract the macros from the macro file, and I use
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.strip">str.strip</a> to remove excess whitespace from the macros.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format_map">str.format_map</a> to perform the macro substitutions.</p>
<p>Instead of performing substitutions until I hit a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_(mathematics)">fixed point</a>, I perform a
finite number of substitutions.
(This is the constant <code>MAX_MACRO_SUBSTITIONS</code>.)
I do this because it is an easy way to prevent unbounded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion">recursion</a>, and, in
practice, my macros are not complex enough to cause this strategy to fail.</p>
<p>A macro substitution will fail if I reference a macro that doesn't exist, e.g.
<code>{xyxhkj}</code>.
I handle this by using the context manager <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.suppress">contextlib.suppress</a>.
This allows me to catch the relevant exception and stop performing
substitutions, without terminating the whole program.</p>
<p>I build the URL by combining a constant prefix,
<code>https://www.google.com/search?q=</code>, with the query string.
I use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.quote_plus">urllib.parse.quote_plus</a> to properly escape the query string. E.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>import urllib.parse
query = "site:news.ycombinator.com haskell"
print(query)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>site:news.ycombinator.com haskell
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>print(urllib.parse.quote_plus(query))
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>site%3Anews.ycombinator.com+haskell
</code></pre>

<p>In this week's post, you learned how to build a command line tool that helps
you search Google.
You learned how to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html">pathlib</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html">re</a> modules to parse the macros.
And you used the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html">urllib.parse</a> module to properly construct the URL.</p>
<p>My challenge to you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Read about the different Google search operators. (<a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en">"Refine web searches" via
google.com</a>.)</p>
<p>Create a few macros that would be useful to you. Some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a macro that restricts searches to <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">ruby-lang.org</a>.</li>
<li>Create a macro that searches for upcoming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5K_run">5K races</a> in a specified city.</li>
<li>CreateÂ&nbsp;a macro that searches a person's name, but excludes results from
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>.</li>
</ul>

Erdős, who is well-known for his contributions to number theory, set theory, probability theory, graph theory, and more, as well as the invention of the Erdős Number, a measure of one's proximity to having collaborated with him, is of course a subject himself. That said, in Hoffman's biography of him, there is a bit about the behavior of mathematicians and a lone physicist that does well to embody the spiritual and cognitive differences between the two groups, both of which share a passion for mathematical thinking but nevertheless are separable beasts.&nbsp;</p><p><span></span>The excerpt of interest tells of a mathematics conference in which a group of mathematicians return to the coffee table after a talk only to find a puzzle.</p><p><a name="more"></a><i>The rest filed out and raced toward a folding table that supported two large brown plastic tanks, one labeled WITH CAFFEINE, the other WITHOUT CAFFEINE. The mathematicians had already tanked up once, before the graph theo- rist's talk, and now the labels on the tanks were curiously switched. The mathematicians were in a tizzy and stared, puzzled, at the tanks. Their collective brainpower, fine for discerning the latest wrinkles in infinite graph theory, was stalling out on the case of the true Joe.</i></p><p><i>Finally a lightbulb went off in the head of a jovial, beer-bellied fellow in a JOY OF SETS T-shirt. He stepped forward and filled his Styrofoam cup, half from one tank and half from the other.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>"I see," laughed one of his compatriots, "the game-theoretic solution!"</i></p><p><i>"I have another solution," said a thin man whose hands trembled slightly, apparently from a caffeine high. He&nbsp;</i><i>filled his cup a quarter full from one of the tanks.&nbsp;</i><i>"This is the asymptotic solution," he announced. "I'm already so wired I only want a little bit more; whatever is in the cup, I win."</i></p><p><i>A bystander who was a physicist rather than a mathematician didn't understand the need for all this sophisticated thinking. He pointed out that one tank was bigger than the other, and that the bigger tank presumably held caffeinated coffee since more people drink it than drink decaf. &nbsp;The mathematicians were taken aback by the simplicity of the solution. "Our different approaches," said the physicist, "remind me of an old joke. A physicist and a mathematician are flying cross-country together. Each is keeping a diary of the trip. They fly over a white horse in Iowa. The physicist writes, 'There is a white horse in Iowa.' The mathematician writes, 'There exists, somewhere in the Midwest, a horse, white on top.'"</i></p><p>For all that has been written about the difference between physicists and mathematicians, especially with the goal of illuminating their inner minds, this passage provides both a reasonable illustration and a good laugh.</p><p><b><a href="http://twitter.com/philliplevin"> Did you enjoy this?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>Tips for when the novelty of remote working wears off</span></p></div><div><p>Many of us have unexpectedly found ourselves remote working this year. At first, it seemed like a dream - no more commute! No more tedious office politics! An extra hour in bed in the morning! But now that we've all been working away in our spare rooms and on our sofas for weeks on end the novelty is beginning to wear off.</p>
<p>Here are some of the downsides to remote working, and tips for how to overcome them…</p>
<h2>It's impossible to focus</h2>
<p>When you're working in isolation it can be really hard to keep your mind from wandering. Whether it's taking a minute to load the dishwasher, feed the cat or plan your weekend it's all too easy for those five minute breaks to become half an hour of mindless scrolling on TikTok.</p>
<p>It's a fine balance between keeping on task, and allowing your mind a bit of breathing room - after all in the buzz and noise of an office you'd likely face micro distractions all day.</p>
<p>A great way to keep yourself motivated, productive and focussed is to try the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Pomodoro Method</a>. It's a scientifically proven technique where you knuckle down and work in 25 minute bursts, followed by timed five minute breaks to refresh your mind. There are great <a href="https://tomato-timer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Pomodoro apps</a> available so that you can time it on your phone, or even on your <a href="https://gallery.fitbit.com/details/fa42ebf3-10ec-4b0e-8dbb-2e36d4020f0a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Fitbit</a>!</p>
<h2>It can be lonely</h2>
<p>If you're used to going into an office every day it's a big adjustment to miss out on the team culture. All those water cooler moments, team meetings and coffee breaks really help to top up your mind's need for social interaction. You might have found Greg from accounts seriously annoying with his constant holiday stories, but now that you don't speak to him (or anybody else) for hours on end you strangely find yourself wondering if he ever got to go to Cancun?</p>
<p>Teams using Slack can help their members to keep social interaction going by using tools such as <a href="https://aboutsnack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Snack</a>, which enables spontaneous video chats between colleagues, with ice breaker questions and timers to keep it fun and brief.</p>
<h2>Work/life balance becomes a blur</h2>
<p>You've always wanted more 'life' in your work/life balance, but now that work is in your home, and you only have to walk a few steps from your bed to your desk, it all seems a bit too close for comfort.</p>
<p>The ideal situation is of course to have a home office that you can close the door on at the end of the day, but if that's not possible, consider solutions such as a Murphy desk that you can close up when you clock off so that your work space isn't staring you in the face as you try to relax.</p>
<h2>Creativity can dry up</h2>
<p>When you are sitting in the same environment day in day out, without the stimulation of your team around you, it can be hard to keep coming up with fresh new ideas. When you find yourself hitting the brick wall, take some time to see what the competition are up to. Also have a look at your customers, see what they're talking about on social media, or how they are adapting to current circumstances. By bringing the outside into your day you can create serendipity by stumbling across something that inspires your next brilliant project. Sometimes you have to get out of your zone and create your own lightbulb moment!</p>
<h2>Unexpected video calls</h2>
<p>There's no getting around this one. Just make sure you at least change out of your pyjamas each day!</p></div></div>]]>
