<p>i bought a macbook pro (16", 2019) in May as my XPS died (motherboard fried maybe?). personally i dont like apple at all, but fuck it, i had never used a mac before, so why not? i really love to try new things</p>
<p>for my experience i am satisfied with my macbook, except for some stupid issues, one of which is what im going to dig into in this article</p>
<p><strong>shutdown/restart hang (caused by a kernel panic)</strong></p>
<p>i found many users have encounterd the (almost) same panic: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/constant-kernel-panics-userspace-watchdog-timeout-no-successful-checkins-from-com-apple-windowserver.2222878/">https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/constant-kernel-panics-userspace-watchdog-timeout-no-successful-checkins-from-com-apple-windowserver.2222878/</a></p>
<p>Also on reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/hwk0o5/how_to_stop_watchdog_timeout_kernel_panics/">it's the exactly same panic</a></p>
<p>if you look at the posts you will find they are actually having different problems except all the problems lead to (the same) watchdog timeout</p>
<p>my panic report looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>panic(cpu 2 caller 0xffffff7f881a1aae): watchdog timeout: no checkins from watchdogd in 302 seconds (11 totalcheckins since monitoring last enabled), shutdown in progress

</pre></div>
<p>everytime the hang happens, it eventually gives me a backtrace like this</p>
<p>i called customer service, the friendly tech support suggested that i should reinstall the system (if i cant figure out how to reproduce the panic),
so i erased the partition table and restarted from scratch, then the hang happened again after a few shutdowns</p>
<p>i was really upset, but as i cant reproduce the panic, i cant even ask apple to fix it</p>
<p>then i decided to look into the panic myself</p>
<h2 id="the-backtrace">the backtrace</h2>
<p>the first glance at panic report tells me it might be something wrong with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Management_Controller">SMC</a>, i followed apple's guide to reset SMC, without luck</p>
<p>apple diagnostics reports no issue</p>
<p>so it must be in the kernel right?</p>
<p>lets start reading the backtrace</p>
<p>by reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack">Call Stack</a> you will have a basic understanding of how kernel subroutines get executed</p>
<p>so how is it executed? just read from brace bottom to top</p>
<p>first thing first, the panic report only gives me related kernel extensions, to find out exactly what code is causing the panic, we have to get symbols from the kernel (extensions)</p>
<p>we dont need to download anything to debug such a problem, the kernel is installed on our machine, just copy it, along with all the related extensions:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>/System/Library/Kernels/kernel <span># kernel</span>
/System/Library/Kernels/Extensions <span># extensions</span>
</pre></div>
<p>follow <a href="https://www.repleo.nl/wordpress/symbolicate-os-x-kernel-panics-using-lldb/">https://www.repleo.nl/wordpress/symbolicate-os-x-kernel-panics-using-lldb/</a> to locate symbols</p>
<p>the kernel slide bytes, and AppleSMC text base address can be found in the panic report, like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>Kernel slide:     0x0000000007400000

com.apple.driver.AppleSMC(3.1.9)[4589419D-7CCC-39A9-9E2F-F73FE42DD902]@0xffffff7f881a9000-&gt;0xffffff7f881c7fff
</pre></div>
<p><img alt="lldb" src="https://jm33.me/img/mac_panic/lldb.webp"></p>
<p>from this screenshot we can see more clearly about what's going on, the backtrace tree is now symbolicated</p>
<h2 id="lets-reverse-some-code">lets reverse some code</h2>
<p>as far as i know AppleSMC kext is proprietary, the only way to know what it does is to reverse it</p>
<p>from lldb, we dont see anything worthy of reversing, its just a watchdog timeout call</p>
<p>anyways, AppleSMC module seems interesting, lets reverse it</p>
<p>after loading the AppleSMC binary, we have to rebase the binary so it matches the address at runtime: Edit, segment, rebase program</p>
<p>press G then paste the address <code>0xffffff7f881b6d9c</code>, we get:</p>

<p>I don't think the <code>while (1)</code> loop is ever going to end. When <code>thread_policy_set</code> fails, it enters the loop and never breaks out.</p>
<p><code>v13</code> represents 1 sec I think. Basically this loop puts a mutex io lock, then feeds watchdog (when the timer pointer plus 248 is null or whatever), finally it sleeps for 1 sec, repeats the loop.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!*</span><span>((</span><span>_BYTE</span><span>*</span><span>)</span><span>this</span> <span>+</span> <span>248</span><span>))</span>

</pre></div>
<p>When it stops feeding the watchdog, watchdog timeouts after about 3 min, hence the panic.</p>
<h2 id="whats-watchdog">whats watchdog</h2>
<p>from <code>man watchdogd</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>watchdogd ensures that the system is healthy and able to make forward progress throughout the system lifecycle.
    If watchdogd or the Watchdog KEXT determine that the system is unhealthy they will attempt to take corrective action and ultimately may panic the system to get it back to a usable state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchdog_timer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchdog_timer</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, in the case of the Linux operating system, a user-space watchdog daemon may simply kick the watchdog periodically without performing any tests. As long as the daemon runs normally, the system will be protected against serious system crashes such as a kernel panic. To detect less severe faults, the daemon[4] can be configured to perform tests that cover resource availability (e.g., sufficient memory and file handles, reasonable CPU time), evidence of expected process activity (e.g., system daemons running, specific files being present or updated), overheating, and network activity, and system-specific test scripts or programs may also be run.[5]</p>
<p>Upon discovery of a failed test, the Linux watchdog daemon may attempt to perform a software-initiated restart, which can be preferable to a hardware reset as the file systems will be safely unmounted and fault information will be logged. However it is essential to have the insurance of the hardware timer as a software restart can fail under a number of fault conditions. In effect, this is a dual-stage watchdog with the software restart comprising the first stage and the hardware reset the second stage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>from my understanding, <code>SMCWatchDogTimer</code> stopped kicking watchdog somehow (at <code>IOLockUnlock()</code>), then watchdog realizes <code>AppleSMC</code> might be dead, it initiates a panic, reboot and throw the panic report to user</p>

      <p>If you like circles, spheres and shapes that fit nicely together, you’ll probably like spherical circle packings. In this post, I’ll describe how I turned one into a lamp.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>A circle packing is an arrangement of circles that fit tightly together, so that no circle can be enlarged without causing overlaps. Circle packing is a nice mathematical rabbit hole<sup id="fnref:circle_packing" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:circle_packing">1</a></sup>, but this post focuses on Steiner chains, which is the type of packing I used for building the lamp (more pictures of which can be found <a href="https://stuffmatic.com/projects/circle-lamp">here</a>).</p>

<h2 id="steiner-chains">Steiner chains</h2>

<p>A Steiner chain<sup id="fnref:steiner_chain" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:steiner_chain">2</a></sup> is constructed by surrounding a circle with a ring of additional circles that are all also tangent to a larger circle. In other words, a Steiner chain consists of circles packed in a circle (a concept I’ve previously explored in <a href="https://stuffmatic.com/projects/copper-circles">this project</a>).</p>

<div>
  
    <p><img src="https://stuffmatic.com/assets/posts/circle_packing_lamp/steiner.png" alt="A simple Steiner chain.">
    </p>
    
  
  <p>A simple Steiner chain with a center circle surrounded by a ring of 9 smaller circles, all tangent to the bounding circle (dashed).</p>
  
</div>

<p>The fact that a Steiner chain fits tightly in a circle can be used to construct nested packings by repeatedly replacing the center circle with a smaller Steiner chain. Here’s an animation illustrating the idea.</p>

    </p>
    
  
  <p>Nesting Steiner chains.</p>
  
</div>

<p>The lamp is built from a total of 13 circles, forming a nested Steiner chain with two rings, each containing 6 circles.</p>

<h2 id="deforming-a-circle-packing">Deforming a circle packing</h2>

<p>It’s intuitively clear that a circle packing can’t be arbitrarily deformed without “ruining” it. For example, stretching a packing in one direction turns the circles into ellipses. Luckily, there is a class of circle preserving planar deformations, so called Möbius transformations<sup id="fnref:mobius_transformation" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:mobius_transformation">3</a></sup>, that can be used to parametrically control the shape of a circle packing. This is really useful for parametric design purposes.</p>

  <p>Möbius transformations applied to a circle packing.</p>
  
</div>

<h2 id="going-spherical">Going spherical</h2>

<p>The Möbius transformations described in the previous section turn out to be the only options for transforming a circle packing in the plane. However, if we venture into three dimensional space, there is another option: <em>inverse stereographic projection</em><sup id="fnref:stereographic" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:stereographic">4</a></sup>. Loosely speaking, this transformation can be used to wrap a circle packing around a sphere.</p>

<p>For this project, I put together a parametric design tool to explore interesting spherical circle packings. This tool generates packings in three steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a nested Steiner chain</li>
  <li>Apply a Möbius transformation</li>
  <li>Wrap the packing around a sphere using inverse stereographic projection</li>
</ol>

<p>Here’s an animation showing the tool in action.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="generating-the-blueprint">Generating the blueprint</h2>

<p>The previous sections outline a method for creating nice spherical circle packings. In order to create physical objects from these packings, I wrote some code for procedural generation of laser cutter blueprints. One cruical thing to keep in mind when making a pendant lamp is the center of mass. To ensure the lamp is hanging properly, the center of mass and the wire hole need to lie on the same vertical line. The center of mass calculation is simplified by the fact that it only has to deal with circles (the contribution from the joints is negligible).</p>

</div>

<h2 id="building-the-lamp">Building the lamp</h2>

<p>Once I had generated a blueprint and manufactured the parts, assembling the lamp went pretty smoothly. All circles, joints and joint holes were numbered so I would not have to think too much during assembly.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="description">
<p>Google is the biggest internet company in the world today.&nbsp; And it seems that this giant, successful company is going to have a birthday. As a present, we came up with a few interesting facts in honor of the birthday <b>big boy</b> company.</p>
<h2>1. People do not seem to know Google’s exact birth date.</h2>
<p>Yes, it is true. People do not know the exact date of Google’s birthday. It has been reported that Google has been given six different dates for their official birthday. Eventually they decided they need a fixed date, so that people know when to celebrate. Google later determined that <b>September 27th</b> will be the day.</p>
<h2>2. Google may even happen to be 25 years old.</h2>
<p>There are some indications that the real birth date might come even earlier than ’98. Google could be in fact, over the age needed to purchase alcohol in the US, legally. Although Google already has encoded their official starting date with the cryptic “98 9 27” doodle, it all must have started even earlier. In 1995, in the dormitory of Standford, the two main Google guys initiated the miracle power behind the most popular search engine in the world. Some say that during the infant years of Google development, the two founding men were frequently in disagreement with each other. However, we have the search engine today as proof they eventually shook hands and decided to put aside their differences and get to work.</p>
<h2>3. Google has a T-rex dinosaur on-site as a special reminder.</h2>
<div><p>Indeed, there is a T-rex on-site at Google’s headquarters. The dyno structure features a bone from a real Tyrannosaurus. When an amateur paleontologist initially discovered the bone by accident, they thought it comes from a different type of dinosaur. Stan, the name of the bone construction, is a vivid reminder that adaptation is key to survival.</p><p>Apart from being a preferred gathering <a href="https://www.demilked.com/google-campus-dinosaur-stan-flamingos/" target="_blank">spot for flamingos meeting</a>, Stan is there to remind Google employees they need to give their best all the time. Or risk having their company become extinct, just like a dinosaur.</p></div>
<h2>4. A T-rex game likes to hide in Google Chrome.</h2>
<div><p>Google is fond of dinosaurs, we noticed. Apart from the giant structure at their HQ, they also made a digital dyno version. When you browse the net on Google Chrome, a warning will appear about Google not being able to connect.</p><p>When the dinosaur is visible, if you push the space bar on your keyboard, a game will begin where you are a running dinosaur jumping over obstacles. The game length is theoretically infinite and has been an arena for peculiar competition for the highest score.</p></div>
<h2>5. Many things are hiding in Google’s products.</h2>
<p>You can find many Google easter eggs by doing a simple search. These hidden gems become quite apparent once you begin to understand what they are.&nbsp; For example, searching with the word “askew” will return search results in a tilted view. You can also try “zerg rush,” “blink HTML” or the classic “Google in the 1998”.</p>
<h2>6. Google was not at all pleased that the name of the company became a generic search term.</h2>
<p>“Google” and “just Google it” are common words, but the company thought that could undermine all their efforts. There is, however, no way to stop such a trend. We have little control over how language use evolves. Marketing departments would say they want the brand name should circulate as much as possible. Still, Google has reached a level where the term becomes forever embedded in our culture. At this point, the process of “genericization” becomes unstoppable and out of control, even Google’s.</p>
<h2>7. Google devours more businesses than people genuinely think.</h2>
<p>Some estimate that Google purchases more than one company per week. Most of the companies tend to be small, but some can be rather large. Most of the acquired products get blended in with others that are already part of an applied marketing strategy.&nbsp; However, Android resides firmly within Google’s realm on its own accord and is very well known.<br>Google does not usually sell the companies that it buys. </p>
<h2>8. The “I’m Feeling Lucky” Google button cost more than tens of millions of dollars per year.</h2>
<p>This button is really fun. But for Google, it is an expensive add-on. The simple task of taking a person directly to the top result page without the advertising makes Google miss a lot of potential revenue. That lost income estimates put it at around $110 million. When addressed directly, Google officials responded that without the feeling lucky button Google will look like a corporate beast with an exclusive focus on money. The fact that the button remains on the main google page is a true testament that Google understands the search engine is for the real people out there.</p>
<h2>9. The first Google storage building blocks come from Lego.</h2>
<p>Google, one of the largest companies in the world today, has many demands, most of them understandably also pretty big. For example, all the countless public photos, videos and emails needs a place to stay, and there are building-size structures that come to the rescue. But back in 1996, things were different for the Google founders, when they had to find a solution for their first storage device need. The hard drives they found were too bulky, so they produced unique server boxes made out of Lego parts.</p>
<h2>10. Google proves to be very generous to the spouses of employees who die while working for the company.</h2>
<p>Losing a loved one on the job is always tough. Dying while working in a comfortable, air-conditioned office is not the same as, say, a coal mine accident. However, one thing is sure: death comes unexpectedly, and it is a hard stone to all sides involved. Google understands that and pays the husband or wife of the decreased fifty percent of their salary for the next ten years! Even the children of those unfortunate enough to perish on the job have benefits too – they are set with compensatory payments till they reach adulthood.</p>
<h2>11. One search on Google requires more computing power than it took to send astronauts of Apollo 11 to the moon. </h2>
<div><p>Isn’t that a funny statistic? Searching with Google is made so simple now. Most people don’t believe when they hear the actual computing and networking power behind every simple search querry.</p><p>Searching the internet today takes more resources than were necessary to put people on the moon. Even your smartphone has better capabilities than the equipment NASA had when they attempted the first moonwalk. </p></div>
<h2>12. One time Google experienced a crash for five minutes, and almost half of the whole internet went down too.</h2>
<div><p>What if you can’t use your computer for five minutes? No bid deal, right? You can take a walk and come back again. Five minutes for Google is too much.</p><p>It was on August 19, 2013, when the famed Google stopped operating for a total of five minutes. This short interruption sufficed for Google to take down around 40% of all internet traffic.</p><p>While it is true that many companies have risen to the occasion and provide search opportunities for people, Google still dominates the more substantial part of the internet. Google has grown to the point where it almost became a synonym for the internet itself. When Google has a problem, the chances are that so does most of the world wide web.</p></div>
<h2>13. Google employs goats.</h2>
<div><p>There is a lot of beautiful green space around Google offices. And that could require a lot of mowing for sure. So they come up with the ingenious idea to have some goats to take care of the grass for them.</p><p>According to Google employees, they love goats because for a score of reasons. Goats are not as noisy, don’t cause any pollution, and, most of all, are more cure and cuddly than lawnmowers.</p></div>
<h2>14. Google has lots of dogs on site.</h2>
<div><p>Speaking of goats, Google also loves all kinds of animals and lets people bring their pets to work. Having your best friend around you is a huge booster for morale and productivity.</p><p>Note that cats are not banned from Google. It’s just that cats don’t usually get along with dogs, so there are fewer of them on-site. But there are still quite a few.</p></div>
<h2>15. Google has given a dog the title of Top Dog.</h2>
<p>According to Google’s official history, the dog of the owner of Google, whose name is Yoshka, is the first and only dog to be given the name Top Dog back in 1999. A post appeared on Google by Yoshka, stating that all dogs are welcome to come to Google. Yoshka is not the only dog in the company, but it was the first. The dog owner was non-other than Urs Hölzle. He was the person responsible for reducing the power needed for Google data centers by half!</p>
<h2>16. Google centered their logo on the main search page in 2001.</h2>
<div><p>Google’s homepage is simple, a much-needed requirement when millions around the world visit it on a daily. Any changes to that page, even the tiniest ones, will be indeed significantly noticed.</p><p>In the early days of the search engine, the Google logo resided to the left side of the page. But in 2001, they moved it to the center and has been there ever since. This seemingly slight change is pretty significant. It changed how the main page is perceived forever.</p></div>
<h2>17. Google continues to make small changes.</h2>
<div><p>There have been some rather small adjustments to the Google logo, in time. Those changes include the layout of the letters of the word “Google.”</p><p>Small changes are the general approach, but Google also goes big. They came up with different ways to arrange the words, which included a new font too.</p></div>
<h2>18. Changes include the name.</h2>
<p>In recent years, the most significant and notable change occurred when the company changed its name from Google to Alphabet. That change was prompted by the fact the company was dominating most of the search, information, internet and other aspects of the business.</p>
<h2>19. Google Instant.</h2>
<p>Google Instant means that you will see results immediately as soon as you start typing if your connection allows it.&nbsp; Google can then collect ample information on you about your browsing patterns to get you where you want to go even faster. Google Instant changes the autocomplete options, and the suggested search results in an …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Using SPF on HELO/EHLO hostnames is repurposing SPF to validate a different thing</h2>

	<p><small>September 26, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Back in June I discovered that <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/spam/SPFForHELOs">in theory we should have SPF records
for EHLO hostnames too</a>. The conventional explanation
for this (apart from 'big email providers say so', the usual reason
to do anything in modern SMTP) comes from, for example, <a href="https://bridge.grumpy-troll.org/2020/07/small-mailserver-bcp/">this
writeup of small mailserver best current practices</a>,
and goes like this (I'm paraphrasing):</p>

<p>People use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework">SPF</a>
to validate the envelope sender domain (the SMTP MAIL FROM). However,
when you send a bounce, it has a null sender and thus no sender
domain to use for SPF checks. So the sender domain is taken from
the EHLO hostname, for lack of a better place to get it from (since
there is no SMTP level 'the bounce claims to have been sent by X
domain' information to be had, although this is commonly in the
message headers).</p>

<p>This is of course kind of bogus. What is really happening here is that
receiving mail servers are attempting to validate that the EHLO/HELO
hostname itself is not forged and are using SPF for this purpose. This
is a complete repurposing of SPF, which we can see since 'Sender' is
right in the name 'Sender Policy Framework' and there's no 'sender' of
the bounce that is visible at the SMTP level (and no entirely standard
way that it's visible in the mail headers, either).</p>

<p>There are some lessons here for email related 'standards' and in general
any Internet standards, which I can summarize this way: if there's a
hole that people think needs filling, any nearby peg will get hammered
into it regardless of what the peg was originally designed for.</p>

<p>PS: This elaborates on <a href="https://twitter.com/thatcks/status/1307064512302940161">a recent tweet of mine</a> that was
sparked by adding SPF DNS records for our EHLO hostnames (and writing
the official explanation of the change for our records).</p>

<h3>Sidebar: This explanation and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208">RFC 7208</a></h3>

<p>RFC 7208 says two things in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208#section-2.3">section 2.3, <em>The "HELO" Identity</em></a>:</p>

<ul><li>it's RECOMMENDED that you check the HELO identity (but carefully)
all the time, and do so before checking MAIL FROM.</li>
<li>if the envelope sender is the null sender, the message is presumed
to come from 'postmaster@&lt;HELO name&gt;' and this is used as the
MAIL FROM to check (even if you already checked the HELO identity).</li>
</ul>

<p>I haven't gone through RFC 7208's section on doing SPF checks to see
if it treats HELO and MAIL FROM checks somewhat differently in its
algorithm, because frankly I'm not interested enough.</p>

<p>This means that RFC 7208 itself is a superset of the conventional
explanation I summarized above. In RFC 7208, you have SPF records
for your EHLO hostnames both because of bounces and because receivers
are recommended to check them all the time. This implies that all
of your mail sending machines should have SPF records, not just the
ones that can send bounces.</p>

<p>(Now that I've looked that up, I may need to update some of our
DNS records. Again.)</p>

<p>I use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html">csv</a> module to read and write <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV files</a>.
The method <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.Sniffer.sniff">csv.Sniffer.sniff</a> analyzes a sample of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV file</a> and guesses the "dialect" (delimiter, quoting, etc.).
I use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictReader">csv.DictReader</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictWriter">csv.DictWriter</a> instead of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.reader">csv.reader</a> and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.writer">csv.writer</a> because I want to expose the rows as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict">dictionaries</a> instead</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#compile">compile</a> to prepare text to be executed as code by <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec">exec</a>.
To determine the new columns to add to the output, I examine how
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict">collections.OrderedDict</a> <code>env_local</code> changes after processing a row.
I ignore local variables that start with <code>_</code> because I wanted an easy way to
create "temporary variables" that won't show up in the output.</p>
<p>When I process each row of the input <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV file</a>, I create a <code>RowProxy</code> object
that allows accessing <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict">dictionary</a> entries as attributes. E.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rp = RowProxy({"cat": 3})
rp["cat"]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>3
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rp.cat
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>3
</code></pre>

<p>In this week's post you learned how to a command line tool that manipulates
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV files</a>.
You learned how to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html">csv</a> module to read and write <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV files</a>, as well as how to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.Sniffer">csv.Sniffer</a> to automatically deduce the
"dialect" of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV file</a>.
You also learned how to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#compile">compile</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec">exec</a> to run text as Python code.</p>
<p>My challenge to you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Build a tool like <code>csv-proc</code> that allows you to filter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV files</a>
based on some criteria.
For example, if you only want to view prediabetic patients from <strong>data.csv</strong>,
you could call your program like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ csv-filter data.csv '100 &lt;= float(row.glucose_mgdL) &lt; 126'
</code></pre>

<h2><span>Work in Progress</span></h2>
<p>
<i>
Generating random Pac-Man mazes is a deceptively difficult problem that I spent some months working on.  It is not easy to describe clearly.  I hope you are patient.  This page is an effort to begin communicating how the algorithm works.  It will slowly be refined (your feedback appreciated) until it is all stated as clearly as possible.
</i>
</p>

<h2>Contraints</h2>
<p>
The mazes are built carefully to closely match design patterns deduced from the original maps found in Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Map is 28x31 tiles.</li>
<li>Paths are only 1 tile thick</li>
<li>No sharp turns (i.e. intersections are separated by atleast 2 tiles).</li>
<li>There are 1 or 2 tunnels</li>
<li>No dead-ends.</li>
<li>Only I, L, T, or + wall shapes are allowed, including the occasional rectangular wall.</li>
<li>Any non-rectangular wall pieces must only be 2 tiles thick.</li>
</ul>

<h2>It's like Tetris</h2>

<p>
We start by stacking tetris pieces on a 5x9 grid. Gravity pulls the pieces in the left direction rather than down.  The edges of the resulting tetris pieces correspond to walkable paths in the maze.  This grid is then mirrored across the left vertical axis to create a symmetric map, then scaled by 3 to form an original-size 28x31 map.
</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p>
For clarity, I call the squares in the initial 5x9 grid, <b>cells</b>, and the squares in the final 28x31 grid, <b>tiles</b>.  So, this algorithm first creates the <b>cells</b> and transforms them into <b>tiles</b>
</p>

<h2>Simple Model</h2>

<p>
Shown in the above diagram titled "Simple Model" is the 5x9 grid of tetris pieces.  The pieces are created one cell at a time using some algorithm to limit the type of pieces at certain locations (they are numbered to show the order of creation).
</p>

<p>
The ghost pen and the edge between rows 7 and 8 at column 1 are present in every map, since the starting location of Pac-Man and the ghost pen location are constant.
</p>

<h2>Height and Width Adjustments</h2>

<p>
Cells are directly transformed into a 3x3 group of tiles. Unfortunately, this creates a resulting map that is too short by 1 tile and too wide by 1 tile.  So, we increase the height of one cell for every column, and decrease the width of one cell for every row, allowing the generated map to fit in the exact dimensions of the original game.
</p>

<p>
Shown in the above diagrams titled "Height Adjustments" and "Width Adjustments", the highlighted cells are the candidate cells whose size can be changed without creating ugly walls (i.e. walls that have non-uniform thickness).
</p>

<p>
Arrows occupy cells which have been chosen for size adjustment.  Care is taken to prevent discontinuities in the edges as a result of the shifting of cells from the size change.
</p>

<h2>Border Cells and Tunnels</h2>

<p>
I won't explain too much about this right now.  But the above diagram titled "Border Cells and Tunnels" has arrows to indicate the tunnel candidates.  The highlighted cells show the type of tunnel candidates by color.  Some cell edges are erased to create some variation in how walls connect with the boundary of the map (shown in green).  The tunnel creation algorithm is sophisticated in how it chooses different types of tunnels.
</p>

<h2>Final Paths</h2>

<p>
When the cells are finally transformed into tiles, what you are left with is shown in the diagram above titled "Final Paths".  Here you can directly map a cell to a 3x3 group of tiles.  You can even pick out the cells whose height are width have been adjusted by 1 tile in this map.
</p>

<h2>Final Tiles</h2>

<p>
See how the above diagram titled "Final Tiles" differs from "Final Paths".  The paths are shifted from the tile <em>edges</em> toward the tile <em>centers</em>.  Each tile with a path going through its center is turned into a path tile.  Finally, any tile that touches a path tile becomes a wall tile.  The map structure is now complete.
</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I admit it: I haven’t taken notes in a while. Back in university I was generally using OneNote and drawing quick illustrations on the touch screen of my Lenovo. But that was a while ago, and I just recently found a reason to take notes again.</p>
<p>I began the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Coursera machine learning</a> course and ended up looking into note-taking solutions, trying to figure out which would suit my style and the content of the course best. After bouncing between a few different tools, my final “stack” is:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.notion.so/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Notion</a> for taking notes (you can see the notes <a href="https://www.notion.so/Machine-Learning-Notes-fe3bb4e0fab84020a151739f6033e785" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://excalidraw.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Excalidraw</a> for illustrations (I won’t discuss this further, but it is a great way to generate quick and easy graphics for notes without getting caught up on perfectionism — for an example see the graphics on <a href="https://www.notion.so/Linear-Regression-with-One-Variable-c6742a27450f41118b8eb953c99275cf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this page</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jupyter</a> for running Python code (not actually required for the course, but I do it anyways so I can learn Python as I work through the course — you can view the notebooks <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/liamross/machine-learning-notes/tree/master/notes/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I chose these because they ended up working best for me personally, but they may not be the best fit for everyone. However, I’ll discuss more why I made the choices I did, and you can decide for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>First, some requirements:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The tool should allow me to take notes easily and quickly</li>
<li>It should have good support for code snippets and math</li>
<li>Notes should look good with minimal intervention</li>
</ol>
<p>There have been an abundance of note-taking apps released recently (or not so recently), and many of them overlap in terms of functionality. I’m going to go through the ones I considered and explain why I ended up choosing Notion.</p>

<p>Now for the options that I immediately ruled out:</p>
<h3 id="onenote"><a href="#onenote" aria-label="onenote permalink"></a><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/microsoft-365/onenote/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">OneNote</a></h3>
<p>Even though it served me well in university, I decided not to use OneNote for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>No native code snippet support (although it can be added with a plugin)</li>
<li>I wasn’t really a fan of the infinite canvas approach, I like some more structure</li>
<li>It feels pretty geared towards touch screens, and I’m not drawing my illustrations any more</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="evernote"><a href="#evernote" aria-label="evernote permalink"></a><a href="https://evernote.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Evernote</a></h3>
<p>The old reliable option. Definitely the most well-known out of all the options. Also probably the worst. I almost immediately ruled it out because:</p>
<ol>
<li>No syntax highlighting</li>
<li>No latex support (necessary for a course like machine learning with lots of math)</li>
<li>Limited formatting options (or at least obvious easy-to-use ones from my quick check)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="roam"><a href="#roam" aria-label="roam permalink"></a><a href="https://roamresearch.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Roam</a></h3>
<p>The hyped new note-taking tool / early cult formation. People have been going wild for it on twitter, so I figured I’d look into it. At the end of the day I ruled it out for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It costs money ($165 USD a year for “Professional”, or $500 USD for 5 years if you choose the “Believer” package… Hmmm)</li>
<li>Notes taken with it don’t actually look that good (but that’s just personal preference, they don’t look terrible)</li>
<li>It doesn’t offer me anything that other free options don’t have (or at least anything that I’d find useful for the kind of notes I’m taking)</li>
</ol>

<p>And now the options that actually worked. One common pro for all of these options is they are free, or at least offer a free tier which I fall under.</p>
<h3 id="obsidian"><a href="#obsidian" aria-label="obsidian permalink"></a><a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Obsidian</a></h3>
<p>I actually started taking notes with Obsidian, since it had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlink" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">backlinks</a> which I thought would be useful, especially if I wanted to organize my notes by topic rather than by lecture. However, I ended up switching to <a href="#Jupyter">Jupyter</a> in order to be able to have the notes be public, and in order to run Python code.</p>
<h4 id="pros-of-obsidian"><a href="#pros-of-obsidian" aria-label="pros of obsidian permalink"></a>Pros of Obsidian</h4>
<ol>
<li>Super easy to link between pages using the <code>[[Some other page]]</code> syntax. Can also use that syntax for images which is nice</li>
<li>Since Obsidian is just a file editor, you own the Markdown files it produces</li>
<li>Full latex math support</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="cons-of-obsidian"><a href="#cons-of-obsidian" aria-label="cons of obsidian permalink"></a>Cons of Obsidian</h4>
<ol>
<li>Limited by the fact it’s a Markdown editor in terms of formatting and syntax (also no way to format attached images so they aren’t full width)</li>
<li>Since it is a local application that uses a unique syntax for Markdown, you can’t easily share the notes</li>
<li>Even though I’m very proficient with Markdown (this blog is written in it!), it sucks to take bad Markdown-looking notes and have the actual nice notes in a different view</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="jupyter"><a href="#jupyter" aria-label="jupyter permalink"></a><a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jupyter</a></h3>
<p>I switched to Jupyter to share the notes publicly and to run Python algorithms in-line. However, it suffered from the same Markdown weaknesses as Obsidian, and was an even worse tool for actual note-taking. I ended up switching to <a href="#Notion">Notion</a>, but continue to use Jupyter for supplementary Python examples related to my notes. All in all this isn’t really Jupyter’s fault, since it was never really designed for heavy-duty multi-notebook note-taking. However in my dreams there will one day be a tool with the features of Notion but with the ability for running in-line code.</p>
<h4 id="pros-of-jupyter"><a href="#pros-of-jupyter" aria-label="pros of jupyter permalink"></a>Pros of Jupyter</h4>
<ol>
<li>Being able to run Python code in-line is by far the largest benefit of using Jupyter</li>
<li>You own the files</li>
<li>Full latex math support</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="cons-of-jupyter"><a href="#cons-of-jupyter" aria-label="cons of jupyter permalink"></a>Cons of Jupyter</h4>
<ol>
<li>Absolutely terrible for linking between files. Have to basically do <code>[Other page](./other_page.ipynd)</code> each time, and obviously that’s even worse if the path isn’t that simple. Jupyter definitely wasn’t made for that kind of note-taking. Same for images</li>
<li>Same cons as Obsidian with relation to being a Markdown editor, although Jupyter has a edit mode for blocks rather than persistent Markdown, so the experience is a bit better. Nonetheless, I still found myself constantly editing then “running” blocks which was slightly inconvenient</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="notion"><a href="#notion" aria-label="notion permalink"></a><a href="https://www.notion.so/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Notion</a></h3>
<p>Finally, I ended up trying out Notion and it stuck.</p>
<h4 id="pros-of-notion"><a href="#pros-of-notion" aria-label="pros of notion permalink"></a>Pros of Notion</h4>
<ol>
<li>Notes look immediately good, and there are more formatting options </li>
<li>Decent latex support. Slightly worse than Obsidian and Jupyter since it only has Katex support, but still good enough for my use cases so far</li>
<li>They just recently introduced backlinks which I’ve found to be quite nice</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="cons-of-notion"><a href="#cons-of-notion" aria-label="cons of notion permalink"></a>Cons of Notion</h4>
<ol>
<li>Takes a while to index new pages so linking to them can be slow for the first bit</li>
<li>A con that is specific to moving to Notion from Jupyter is I can no longer run in-line Python. However I still have Jupyter notebooks containing live Python code, and I link to them from the Notion notes so I still get the benefits of Notion and Jupyter</li>
<li>No support for tables that aren’t databases. A bit of a bummer if you just want to make a simple Markdown table to display some information (like a training set which comes up a lot in the machine learning course)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I’m very happy with Notion so far. It allows me to take notes quickly, and hits all the requirement checkboxes. Additionally, it’s easy to share as a public site for my notes, which is an added benefit.

<article>
  <p>Nearly a century ago, Alonzo Church invented the simple, elegant, and yet elusive lambda calculus. Along with Alan Turing, he then proved the Church-Turing thesis: that anything computable with a Turing machine can also be computed in the lambda calculus. However, nearly as soon as we had digital computers, we started inventing programming languages, and with them a vast treasure of features, beautiful and terrible, many of which seem very hard to relate to the fundamental nature of computability, let alone the lambda calculus specifically.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While it’s true that anything which can be computed, period, can be computed in the lambda calculus, you might not want to: it’s austere, to say the least, and was not designed with modern sensibilities regarding readability in mind. We developed all those languages and features for a reason! Still, Church demonstrated not just that it was possible to compute anything computable with the lambda calculus, but also <em>how</em> one might do so.</p>
<p>In this series, we’ll examine some ways to express common programming language features using the minimalistic tools of the lambda calculus. We begin with perhaps the most ubiquitous type: booleans.</p>
<h2 id="λ-is-blind">λ is blind</h2>
<p>The lambda calculus’s austerity is extreme: you don’t even have booleans. All you have are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Lambda abstractions;</p></li>
<li><p>Applications; and</p></li>
<li><p>Variables.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We’ll now review these in some detail; feel free to skip this section if you’re already familiar with the lambda calculus.</p>
<h3 id="lambda-abstractions">Lambda abstractions</h3>
<p>Lambda abstractions (“lambdas,” “abstractions,” and “functions” will also be used interchangeably) introduce a function of a single variable.</p>
<p>Abstractions are written <code>λ x . y</code>, for variable <code>x</code> and expression <code>y</code>, where <code>x</code> is now available as a bound variable in the body, and any enclosing definition of <code>x</code> is shadowed (i.e.&nbsp;<code>λ x . λ x . x</code> = <code>λ x . λ y . y</code> ≠ <code>λ x . λ y . x</code>). (We shall assume strictly lexical scoping for the time being.)</p>
<p>In Haskell, we would write <code>\ x -&gt; y</code> instead; in JavaScript, <code>function (x) { return y }</code> or <code>(x) =&gt; y</code>.</p>
<h3 id="applications">Applications</h3>
<p>Applications (“function application” and “function call” will be used interchangeably) apply the result of the expression on the left to the expression on the right.</p>
<p>Applications are written as <code>x y</code>, for expressions x and y, and left-associated, i.e.&nbsp;<code>a b c</code> = <code>(a b) c</code> ≠ <code>a (b c)</code>. Function application binds tighter than lambda abstraction, i.e.&nbsp;<code>λ x . λ y . y x</code> = <code>λ x . λ y . (y x)</code> ≠ <code>λ x . (λ y . y) x</code>.</p>
<p>The syntax is the same in Haskell; in JavaScript, we would write <code>x(y)</code> or <code>a(b, c)</code>. Note however that since lambda calculus functions are all single-argument functions, a more direct (though less idiomatic) equivalent for the latter would be <code>a(b)(c)</code>.</p>
<h3 id="variables">Variables</h3>
<p>Variables introduced by enclosing lambdas.</p>
<p>Variable are written as more or less arbitrary names, typically alphanumeric (e.g.&nbsp;<code>x</code> or <code>y0</code> or <code>thing</code>); however, we will feel free to include non-alphanumeric characters in names as we see fit, since the paucity of syntax means there’s little risk of ambiguity.</p>
<p>Since the only available variables are those bound by enclosing lambdas, we can also infer that there are no <code>let</code> bindings for local variables, and no globals of any sort; the lambda calculus doesn’t come with a standard library.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>In quasi-BNF, the grammar for the lambda calculus is extremely minimal:</p>
<figure>
<p><em>e</em> <strong>:=</strong> <code>λ</code> <em>x</em> <code>.</code> <em>e</em> <strong>|</strong> <em>e</em> <em>e</em> <strong>|</strong> <em>x</em> <strong>|</strong> (<em>e</em>)</p>
</figure>
<p>And finally, this table gives a side-by-side comparison of the syntax of the lambda calculus with the corresponding syntax in Haskell &amp; JavaScript:</p>

<h2 id="unconditional-λ">Unconditional λ</h2>
<p>Lambdas are the only way to introduce values—they’re the only “literal” syntax in the language. We can therefore infer that the only kinds of runtime values must be closures. In an interpreter for the lambda calculus, closures might consist of the name of the introduced variable, the body of the lambda, &amp; a map relating the names and values of any variables it closed over when constructed (again, we assume strict lexical scoping). There are no bits, bytes, words, pointers, or objects in the language’s semantics; only this runtime representation of lambdas.</p>
<p>Likewise, lambdas are also the only way to introduce variables—there’s no standard library, built-ins, primitives, prelude, or global environment to provide common definitions. We’re truly baking the apple pie from scratch.</p>
<p>All of this raises the question: how do you <em>do</em> anything when you don’t even have <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>? Lambdas and variables don’t <em>do</em>, they merely <em>are</em>, so that leaves application. When all you have is application, everything looks like a lambda abstraction, so we’ll represent booleans using lambdas.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not <em>just</em> booleans we’re after; <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> aren’t much use without <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, <code>not</code>, <code>if</code>, and all the rest. To be useful, our representation of booleans should therefore suffice to define these, as well. But how do you define <code>if</code> without using <code>if</code>? In a lazy language like Haskell, we might define <code>if</code> as a function something like so:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>if_ ::</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb1-2">if_ cond then_ else_ <span>=</span> <span>if</span> cond <span>then</span> then_ <span>else</span> else_</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In a strict language like JavaScript, we’d instead take functions for the alternatives:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>function</span> <span>if_</span>(cond<span>,</span> then_<span>,</span> else_) {</span>
<span id="cb2-2">  <span>if</span> (cond) {</span>
<span id="cb2-3">    <span>then_</span>()<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4">  } <span>else</span> {</span>
<span id="cb2-5">    <span>else_</span>()<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-6">  }</span>
<span id="cb2-7">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Both these definitions use the language’s native booleans and <code>if</code> syntax (a tactic for implementing embedded DSLs known as “meta-circularity”), and thus aren’t viable in the lambda calculus. However, they do give us a hint: in both cases we have a function taking a condition, consequence, and alternative, and using the first to select one of the latter two. In the lambda calculus, we might start by writing:</p>
<pre><code>if = λ cond then else . ?</code></pre>
<p>(Note: there aren’t any keywords in the lambda calculus, so there’s nothing stopping me from naming variables things like <code>if</code>, a fact which I will take free advantage of.)</p>
<p>We’ve introduced a definition for <code>if</code>, as a function of three parameters; now what do we do with them? The lambda calculus’s stark palette makes it easy to enumerate <em>all</em> the things we can do with some variable <code>a</code>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Ignore it, whether by simply not mentioning it at all (as in <code>λ a . λ b . b</code>), or by shadowing it with another lambda which binds the same name (as in <code>λ a . λ a . a</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Mention it, whether on its own in the body of a lambda (as in <code>λ a . a</code> or <code>λ a . λ b . a</code>), somewhere within either side of an application (as in <code>λ a . λ b . a b</code> or <code>λ a . λ b . b a</code>), or some combination of both (as in <code>λ a . (λ b . a) a</code>).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We could for example simply return <code>then</code> or <code>else</code>:</p>
<pre><code>if = λ cond then else . then
if = λ cond then else . else</code></pre>
<p>But in that case the conditional isn’t conditional at all—the value in no way depends on <code>cond</code>. Clearly the body must make use of all three variables if we want it to behave like the <code>if</code>s we know and love from other languages.</p>
<p>Taking a step back for a moment, let’s examine the roles of <code>if</code>’s arguments. <code>then</code> and <code>else</code> are passive; we only want to use or evaluate one or the other depending on the value of <code>cond</code>. <code>cond</code>, then, is the key: it takes the active role.</p>
<p>Thus, in the same way that our <code>if_</code> functions in Haskell &amp; JavaScript employed those language’s features to implement, we’re going to define <code>if cond then else</code> as the application of the condition to the other two parameters:</p>
<pre><code>if = λ cond then else . cond then else</code></pre>

<p>This feels strangely like cheating: surely we’ve only moved the problem around. Now instead of <code>if</code> making the decision about which argument to return, we’ve deferred it to <code>cond</code>. But <code>if</code> and <code>cond</code> aren’t the same, semantically; <code>if</code> takes a boolean and two other arguments and returns one of the latter, while <code>cond</code> <em>is</em> a boolean—albeit evidently a boolean represented as a function. Let’s make that precise by writing down <code>if</code>’s type:</p>
<pre><code>if : Bool -&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a</code></pre>
<p>Notwithstanding our use of the yet-to-be-defined name <code>Bool</code> for the type of the condition, this is the same type as we gave <code>if_</code> in Haskell; that’s a good sign that we’re on the right track! It takes a <code>Bool</code> and two arguments of type <code>a</code>, and it must return one of those because that’s the only way for it to come up with the <code>a</code> that it returns. But what <em>is</em> <code>Bool</code>?</p>
<p>Working backwards from the type and definition of <code>if</code>, we see that <code>cond</code> is applied to two arguments, and therefore must be a function of two parameters. Further, these are both of type <code>a</code>, and the value it returns must also be of type <code>a</code> for <code>if</code>’s type to hold. Thus, we can define the type <code>Bool</code> like so:</p>
<pre><code>Bool = ∀ a . a -&gt; a -&gt; a</code></pre>

<p>If a given <code>Bool</code> is a function of two arguments of arbitrary type, returning the same type, it must therefore select one of its arguments to return. There are only two distinguishable inhabitants of <code>Bool</code>, <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>, so we can therefore deduce that since <code>if</code> defers the selection of the result to the <code>Bool</code>, for <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> to actually differ they must make opposite selections. In other words, <code>true</code> must return the <code>then</code> parameter, while <code>false</code> must return the <code>else</code> one:</p>
<pre><code>true, false : Bool
true  = λ then else . then
false = λ then else . else</code></pre>
<p>We didn’t move the problem around after all; we solved it. What we noticed was a deeper insight: this encoding of booleans makes <code>if</code> redundant, since if we can apply <code>if</code> to a <code>Bool</code> and two arguments, we could equally apply the <code>Bool</code> to those arguments directly.</p>

<p>It’s frequently convenient to conflate booleans with bits, their minimal representation, but in truth they’re not the same at all. Practically, some programming languages define booleans as a byte in memory, perhaps clamping its values to 0 and 1; others define them as instances of some boolean class, or constructors of an algebraic datatype.

<p>Pikchr (pronounced "picture") is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pic_language">PIC</a>-like markup
language for diagrams in technical documentation.  Pikchr is
designed to be embedded in <a href="https://spec.commonmark.org/0.29/#fenced-code-blocks">fenced code blocks</a> of
Markdown or similar mechanisms of other documentation markup languages.</p>

<p>For example, the diagram:</p>

<p>Pikchr diagrams can appear in:</p>

<ul>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>Wiki pages</li>
<li>Tickets and bug reports</li>
<li>Forum posts</li>
<li>Check-in comments</li>
<li>Anywhere else that Markdown or similar markup languages are used</li>
</ul>

<p>Pikchr diagrams are easy to generate.  The language is simple.
There is lots of documentation and examples on-line (links below).
Anyone who is comfortable using Markdown should be able to pick up Pikchr
with minimal extra effort.</p>

<p>Pikchr is safe for use in internet-facing applications.  Hostile
Pikchr scripts cause no harm (apart from generating ugly diagrams).</p>

<h2>Demos</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pikchr.org/home/doc/trunk/doc/examples.md">Example Pikchr Scripts</a></li>
<li><a href="https://pikchr.org/home/pikchrshow">/pikchrshow</a> ← Enter Pikchr text and see the result on-line</li>
</ul>

<h2>Documentation Is A Work In Progress</h2>
<p>As of 2020-09-16, the Pikchr code is stable and is in active use.
However, documentation is still under development.
We are using Pikchr to write the Pikchr documentation (in Markdown),
hence it was necessary to deploy Pikchr into a working content
management system (<a href="https://fossil-scm.org/fossil">Fossil</a> in this case) prior to having
complete documentation available.  Volunteer assistance is welcomed!</p>

    <section>
<p>Printers are cool because they are, but I have friends that remind me at least weekly that hacking a printer is not useful. Every time it’s mostly the same thing all over again, find a 1990 type bug, write a stupid script, done.
Some months ago, I started a new project, a wild ride inside Google’s humongous codebase. While most of Google code, especially Android, is open source, some parts are not.
I’ll try to talk about one such case, the bootloader of a Pixel 3 phone.</p>

<p>What you are about to read mostly applies to Android 10 and later versions. Much has changed, but the exciting part for us is that now fastboot can run in userspace mode.</p>
<p><a href="https://source.android.com/devices/bootloader/fastbootd">Here</a> you can find the nitty-gritty details, the TL;DR is something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Recovery and Fastboot partitions are now the same thing. One less partition, more code reuse. Nice.</li>
<li>The mechanisms to start Recovery or Fastboot is now slightly different, but this is taken care of by the bootloader.</li>
<li>Userspace Fastboot can’t issue some types of commands, namely OEM.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because Userspace fastboot can’t issue OEM commands, we will have to dig into the bootloader code.</p>

<p>Ok, we got a binary, let’s see what’s inside.</p>
<pre><code>➜  strings -n 12 bootloader-sargo-b4s4-0.2-6066691.img | head

</code></pre><p>As soon as I saw that, I started wondering when phones started using UEFI. UEFI and EDK2 are cool, but when did they end up being used in phones?</p>
<p><a href="https://worthdoingbadly.com/qcomxbl/">Here</a> there are some notes on the history of why QC uses UEFI. If I understand it correctly, it’s because they want to support Windows on ARM.</p>
<p>Now that we know it’s UEFI, and we satisfied our curiosity on why it’s UEFI, we can start working on it.</p>

<p>Binwalk on the bootloader image will yield precisely zero. UEFI images are very structured, support compression, and allow for nested volumes. Ether, you know what you are looking at, or you are not going to get far.</p>
<p>Get uefi-firmware-parser from pip with</p>
<p><code>python -m pip install --user uefi-firmware-parser</code></p>
<p>uefi-firmware-parser it’s more of a framework and can be used in scripts. Fortunately, they provide a super nice and handy wrapper. The script can brute force <code>-b</code> any unknown image type, searching for known UEFI magic numbers.</p>
<pre><code>➜  uefi-firmware-parser -b bootloader-sargo-b4s4-0.2-6066691.img

        <section>
            <p>Mr. Jobs had a fascinating desire to make the internals of his Macintosh computer as aesthetically pleasing as the outside. There is something uniquely meaningful to us about this aim that at first thought one cannot describe. The affect of his aim lies in something we call "artisanship". That is: a perception of additional value that is orthogonal to the perceivable value that could have otherwise have been excavated if the producer had chosen to invest time in it.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.robsdomain.com/content/images/2020/05/Artboard-1.jpg"></figure><p>Perhaps because we realize time is finite and intrinsically meaningful we perceive the time invested into the intrinsic beauty of the totality of the object as aesthetic and are more willing to ascribe it a higher value. </p><p>Software is different from hardware in that a physical product is, in a way, an authoritative truth: it is materially in front of you as a "thing" that isn't easily transformed into something else. Software, on the other hand, &nbsp;suffers (and benefits) from the attribute of being an "iterable truth". It has little to no material cost besides time and due to its non-material anchoring is infinitely malleable. Unlike a physical good, software does not trigger the instinctive quality heuristic to "measure twice cut once". An incorrect cut may be metaphorically "undone" by throwing away the wood because the wood costs little to nothing. There is no penalty for the failure to prepare and measure it seems.</p><p>In the continued search for universal principles of application I often wonder whether the artisanal dimension of a product is applicable to the digital world. While that would be my hope – as there is little more satisfying than the comfort of a universal principle to justify your stubborn investment in perfection – evidence continues to suggest the contrary. </p><p>Perhaps the phenomenon of artisanal beauty is unique only to products that exist in material domains; however, at times I wonder if the contemporary technology myth of "moving quickly and allowing things to break" has become too saturated in the collective compass to see other approaches. Does real world artisanal software exist? Would the end customer even care?</p><p>Maybe artisanal software is produced for the joy in craft of the creator rather than the consumer. Comically a lot like life in a way.</p><hr><p>Kind thanks to <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/statue-inside-room-2661943/">Alex Y</a> of Pexels for the cover image</p>

  <p>Plastic is really bad for the environment. It takes 450 to 1000 years to degrade[1]. It affects marine life and litters our streets. Only around 9% of plastic is being recycled every year in the US. We are in Chicago. Everywhere we look, there's a piece of plastic stuck somewhere. We started an experiment to go plastic free grocery shopping for 1 month. These are our findings.</p>

<h4>1 - Our cost of food has gone down 70%.</h4>

<p>We are surprised. We thought we would have to pay more for our grocery. Here is a comparison of food prices with and without plastic packaging. The prices are from 5 popular grocery stores in Chicago.</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EixtvIGXgAEs5cY?format=jpg&amp;name=large" alt="Average food prices in Chicago (September 2020) Corn, red onion, potato and carrot."><br>
</p><p>Average food prices in Chicago (September 2020) </p>

<p>Interesting, right?</p>

<p>Another reason behind this result is that plastic wrap food usually comes in bulk. We end up buying more food than we need. Buying food per pound helps us think about how much we will eat. For a family of 2, we usually buy about 1-2 pounds of each produce. Here are the price differences.</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EixtUosXsAU8LjX?format=jpg&amp;name=large" alt="Food prices per pound vs per package in Chicago. September 2020 Corn, red onion, potato and carrot."><br>
</p><p>Food prices per pound vs per package (September 2020, Chicago)</p>

<p>We save so much if we go for zero packaging food. After all, people are paying a premium for the plastic package without thinking. We also don't waste as much of food. It's win-win!</p>

<h4>2 - We eat healthier</h4>

<p>We can't order food delivery anymore. It used to be a big chunk of our monthly bill. Most of the time we cook at home. We make homemade french fries instead of buying chips. It tastes better! We bring our own containers to restaurants when we order takeout.</p>

<h4>3 - Opt out a lot of options for shopping</h4>

<p>I don't know if it's only us feeling this way, but a lot of products have too many options.<br>
Opting out of plastic leaves only a handful of brands. Saves a ton of time for shopping.</p>

<h4>4 - We create a lot less trash</h4>

<p>Less packaging. Less trash.</p>

<p>Here are the cons.</p>

<h4>1 - It was difficult to find meat and bread that don't use plastic or styrofoam.</h4>

<p>Only 1-2 stores of the 5 have paper packaging for meat. For bread, we have to look for a local bakery for zero plastic options.</p>

<h4>2 - Food delivery is no longer an option.</h4>

<p>I put it as a pro and con in this section. Pro is that we saved a lot of money.<br>
Con is that we can only do takeout and bring our own food containers, which is not convenient.</p>

<p>Overall it has more pros than cons. <br>

                    <p>In a <a href="https://rolisz.ro/2020/06/10/playing-codenames-with-rust/">previous post</a> I implemented the game of Codenames in Rust, allowing a human player to interact with the computer playing randomly. Now let's implement a smarter computer agent, using word vectors. </p><p>Word vectors (or word embeddings) are a way of converting words into a high dimensional vector of numbers. This means that each word will have a long list of numbers associated with it and those numbers aren't completely random. Words that are related usually have values closer to each other in the vector space as well. Getting those numbers from raw data takes a long time, but there are many pretrained embeddings on the internet you can just use and there are also libraries that help you find other words that are close to a target word. </p><h2 id="word-vectors-in-rust">Word vectors in Rust</h2><p>Machine learning has embraced the Python programming language, so most ML tools, libraries and frameworks are in Python, but some are starting to show up in Rust as well. Rust's performance focus attracts people, because ML is usually computationally intensive. </p><p>There is one library in Rust that does exactly what we want: <a href="https://github.com/finalfusion/finalfusion-rust">FinalFusion</a>. It has a set of pretrained word vectors (quite fancy ones, with subword embeddings) and it has a library to load them and to make efficient nearest neighbor queries. </p><p>The pretrained embeddings come in a 5 GB file, because they pretty much literally have everything, including the kitchen sink, so the download will take a while. Let's start using the library (after adding it to our <code>Cargo.toml</code> file) to get the nearest neighboring words for "cat":</p><pre><code>use std::io::BufReader;
use std::fs::File;
use finalfusion::prelude::*;
use finalfusion::similarity::WordSimilarity;

fn main() {
    let mut reader = BufReader::new(File::open("resources/ff.fifu").unwrap());

    // Read the embeddings.
    let embeddings: Embeddings&lt;VocabWrap, StorageViewWrap&gt; =

    <p>Loading a 5GB file from disk will take some time. If you have enough RAM, it should be in the OS's file cache after the first run, so it will load faster. Also, compiling this program with --release (turning on optimizations and removing debug information) will speed it up significantly. 
    </p>
</div><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>One of the rules of Codenames is that hints can't be any of the words on the board or direct derivatives of them (such as plural forms). The <code>finalfusion</code> library has support for masking some words out, but to get plural forms I resorted to another library called <a href="https://crates.io/crates/Inflector"><code>inflector</code> </a>which has a method called <code><a href="https://docs.rs/Inflector/0.11.4/inflector/string/pluralize/index.html">to_plural</a></code>, which does exactly what's written on the box. </p><pre><code>use std::io::BufReader;
use std::fs::File;
use finalfusion::prelude::*;
use finalfusion::similarity::EmbeddingSimilarity;
use std::collections::HashSet;
use inflector::string::pluralize::to_plural;

fn main() {
    let mut reader = BufReader::new(File::open("resources/ff.fifu").unwrap());

    // Read the embeddings.
    let embeddings: Embeddings&lt;VocabWrap, StorageViewWrap&gt; =
        Embeddings::read_embeddings(&amp;mut reader)
            .unwrap();
    let word = "cat";
    let embed = embeddings.embedding(word).unwrap();
    let mut skip: HashSet&lt;&amp;str&gt; = HashSet::new();
    skip.insert(&amp;word);
    let pluralized = to_plural(word);
    skip.insert(&amp;pluralized);
    let words = embeddings.embedding_similarity_masked(embed.view(), 5, &amp;skip).unwrap();
    println!("{:?}", words);
}</code></pre><p>This is a slightly lower level interface, where we first have to obtain the embedding of the word, we build the set of words to skip and then we search for the most similar words to the vector that we give it. The output is:</p><pre><code>[WordSimilarityResult { similarity: NotNan(0.812261), word: "kitten" },
WordSimilarityResult { similarity: NotNan(0.7768222), word: "feline" },
WordSimilarityResult { similarity: NotNan(0.7760824), word: "kitty" }, 
WordSimilarityResult { similarity: NotNan(0.7667354), word: "dog" }, 
WordSimilarityResult { similarity: NotNan(0.7471396), word: "kittens" }]</code></pre><p>It's better. Ideally, we could also somehow remove all composite words based on words from the table, but that's a bit more complicated.</p><p>This can be wrapped in a function, because it's a common use case:</p><pre><code>fn find_similar_words&lt;'a&gt;(word: &amp;str, embeddings: &amp;'a Embedding, limit: usize) -&gt; Vec&lt;WordSimilarityResult&lt;'a&gt;&gt; {
    let embed = embeddings.embedding(&amp;word).unwrap();
    let mut skip: HashSet&lt;&amp;str&gt; = HashSet::new();
    skip.insert(&amp;word);
    let pluralized = to_plural(&amp;word);
    skip.insert(&amp;pluralized);
    embeddings.embedding_similarity_masked(embed.view(), limit, &amp;skip).unwrap()
}
</code></pre><h2 id="implementing-the-first-spymaster">Implementing the first spymaster</h2><p>Let's implement our first spymaster which uses word vectors! First, let's define a type alias for the embedding type, because it's long and we'll use it many times.</p><pre><code>type Embedding = Embeddings&lt;VocabWrap, StorageViewWrap&gt;;</code></pre><p>Our spymaster will have two fields: the embeddings and the color of the player. The <code>Spymaster</code> trait requires only the <code>give_hint</code> function to be implemented.</p><pre><code>pub struct BestWordVectorSpymaster&lt;'a&gt; {

    }
}</code></pre><p>This spymaster uses a simple greedy algorithm. It takes each word that has to be guessed and find's the most similar word to it, while keeping track of the similarity. It returns as hint the word that had the highest similarity to any of the words that belong to the opposite team. </p><p>How does it do? I drew some random boards with a fixed seed and ran this spymaster on them. If you hover over the hint, it shows what are the words it's based on. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div>

My Father Built these Planes During WWII, and He Always Loved Them.</p></div>
<p><span>The year is 1943 and America is deep in the desperate struggle to save the world from tyranny. The United States had entered World War II a little more than a year earlier following the December 7, 1941 attack by the Japanese on Pearl Harbor.</span></p>
<p><span>As the United States ramped up the war effort the government decided that to win this fight, in addition to brave soldiers and superior equipment, they would also need help from the brightest minds in the world. This lead to the founding of the Statistical Research Group (SRG). The SRG was located in Manhattan, just a block away from Columbia University, and before long many of the best mathematicians in the world were working there.</span></p>
<p><span>How smart were the people working at the SRG? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Milton Friedman</a>, a future winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, worked at the SRG and it was later joked that while he was there he was often only the fourth smartest person in the room.</span></p>
<p><span>And who was the smartest? That was widely recognized to be the brilliant mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Wald" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abraham Wald</a>, a Jew who had fled Europe prior to the start of the war.</span></p>
<p><span>The Air Force came to Wald with a problem. Too many of their planes were being shot down so they wanted to add extra armor to the vulnerable parts of the planes. Too much armor would make the planes too heavy to fly properly, so they couldn’t add extra armor over the entire plane. They asked Wald to tell them how much extra armor to add to the parts of the planes that were being hit most often.</span></p>
<p><span>To help Wald they had collected statistics on the bullet holes in planes returning from combat. They presented him the following statistics:</span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;<span><strong><span>Section of Plane</span></strong></span></td>
<td><span><strong><span>Bullet Holes Per Sq. Ft.&nbsp;</span></strong></span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Engine</span></td>
<td><span>1.11</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Fuselage</span></td>
<td><span>1.73</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Fuel System</span></td>
<td><span>1.55</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Rest of Plan</span></td>
<td><span>1.80</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><span>Given these statistics, what would you tell the Air Force?</span></p>
<p><span>The answer Wald came up with&nbsp;surprised&nbsp;them. He instructed the Air Force to put the extra armor not where the bullet holes were, but were they weren’t – on the engines! And how did Wald come up with this answer. Simple. He considered the missing bullet holes. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Air Force had presented him with statistics on planes that had returned safely from combat. Wald recognized this as biased sample that told a distorted and incomplete story. There were also a lot of planes at the bottom of the ocean, and Wald correctly guessed that these planes were full of bullet holes in the engines.</span></p>
<p><span>The Air Force followed his advice and the results were stunning. Immediately more planes started returning safely from combat saving the lives of countless pilots and crew members.</span></p>
<p><span>Wald correctly identified this as not so much a math problem but as a problem of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survivorship bias</a>, and once you understand this concept you start seeing it everywhere. Survivorship bias tells a lot of distorted and incomplete stories and looking for the missing bullet holes, as Wald had done, can save you from making bad decisions based on inaccurate and incomplete information. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Fortune Cookie Lottery Winners</strong></h2>
<p><span>On March 30, 2005 the Powerball lottery drawing produced 110 2<sup>nd</sup> prize winners who had picked 5 of the 6 numbers correctly. This entitled each of them to winnings of over $100,000. Lottery officials found this strange since, based on the number of tickets sold, there should have only been about 5 2<sup>nd</sup> prize winners.</span></p>
<p><span>Searching for an explanation the officials asked winners how they had picked their numbers. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/12/world/americas/as-the-cookie-crumbles-winners-galore-in-lottery.html?mcubz=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An article</a> in The New York Times described what happened next:</span></p>
<p><span><em>“Our first winner came in and said it was a fortune cookie,” said Rebecca Paul, chief executive of the Tennessee Lottery. “The second winner came in and said it was a fortune cookie. The third winner came in and said it was a fortune cookie.” </em></span></p>
<p><span>The fortune cookie with the lucky numbers was eventually traced to a factory in Long Island City, owned by Wonton Food, which produces four million fortune cookies a day.</span></p>
<p><span><em>“That’s ours,” said Derrick Wong, of Wonton Food, when shown a picture of a winner’s cookie slip. “That’s very nice, 110 people won the lottery from the numbers.”</em></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://awealthofcommonsense.com/2017/10/taking-financial-advice-from-a-lottery-winner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reporting</a> on the incident <a href="http://awealthofcommonsense.com/about-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ben Carlson</a> wrote cynically, but more truthfully than we care to admit, “If any of these 110 people worked in the investment business they probably would have started their own newsletter – </span><em><span>My Secret Formula for Winning the Lottery.”</span> </em></p>
<p><span>And they could have made the newsletter sound very convincing. After all, the author could have pointed to109 other people who also followed this formula and won big. But you wouldn’t fall for it, because you would look for the missing bullet holes, and you understand that there are thousands of planes piloted by fortune-cookie-lottery-number-picking pilots laying at the bottom of the ocean.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Other Examples of Survivorship Bias</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><span>Many investing companies start new mutual funds in what are known as “fund incubators.” These funds, employing various strategies, are kept small and are not available for public investing. After several years in the incubator the most successful ones are rolled out to the public touting their stellar investment records. The underperformers are discontinued in an attempt to keep the missing bullet holes hidden forever.</span></li>
<li><span>In the classic book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Millionaire-Next-Thomas-Stanley-Ph-D-ebook/dp/B00CLT31D6/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1509685860&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+millionaire+next+door" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Millionaire Next Door </em></a>authors <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_J._Stanley" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas J. Stanley</a> and William D. Danko state that business owners make up the largest group of millionaires next door. But this is not the same as saying that most business owners are millionaires. Most businesses fail and the ocean floor is littered with planes piloted by brave but ultimately unsuccessful entrepreneurs. So before jumping in and starting your own business, consider the missing bullet holes.</span></li>
<li><span>My wife and daughter love the real estate shows on HGTV. These shows make flipping houses look effortless and exciting. And there is no shortage of books and infomercials telling you how easy it is to make money buying real estate with little or no money down. While it is certainly possible to make money in real estate, it is not easy. Don’t forget to look for the missing bullet holes. They are not difficult to find. Lots of would-be real estate tycoons, including personal finance radio guru Dave Ramsey, have crashed in spectacular fiery fashion. Before you start flipping houses, consider the missing bullet holes.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>My purpose in discussing survivorship bias is not to talk you out of taking risks. Indeed, I believe that anything worth doing involves risk. I just don’t think you should take risks based on the distorted and incomplete picture that survivorship bias presents.</span></p>
<p><span>Speaking of this Ben Carlson said, “Every inspirational speech by someone successful should have to start with a disclaimer about survivorship bias.”</span></p>
<p><span>Instead, clear up the picture first by searching out the missing bullet holes and seeing what you can learn from them. They often tell the most interesting and useful part of the story. This won’t guarantee you success but it will increase your chances for a safe return by allowing you to put some extra armor on the vulnerable areas of your plane. After doing that, buckle your seat belt and prepare for takeoff!</span></p>
<p>Note: I read the story of the missing bullet holes in the excellent book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Not-Be-Wrong-Mathematical-ebook/dp/B00G3L6JQ4/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1509686186&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=how+not+to+be+wrong" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking</a>, </em>by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Ellenberg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jordan Ellenberg</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rust is a strange language.</p><p>It has modern and promising design idea, and good performance compared to C++. It's proved to be an alternative system language that can use for writing OS, although there's no product level rust OS yet, there're several implementations as the potential players. It's the highest expected, trying the whole bag of tricks to grow, gaining popularity in the young crowds...all these are very good to a novel and health community.</p><p>On the other hand, this language seems no idea where to go. No, I'm not talking about its dreaming goal, of course I know its goal is explicitly expressed: safety, speed, and concurrency. What I'm confusing is the way it choose towards its goal. Rust community choose an iterative model rather than waterfall model to develop Rust language. That is to say, the code and interfaces keeps changing while the design is still not confirmed. Although it's the popular development model in today's internet industry on business software, I doubt if it's the best way for a foundational foresight programming language. However, it's too early to say whether the development model is bad in nowadays' industry. We can see many companies are trying to use Rust even its design is still unstable. In the past, such kind of activity is insane to take risks in a serious product. But today's industry is in a rapid iterating, maybe our understand is too old for it, and maybe Rust's model is the brand new way to improve the industry. People can adapt the fast changing things even it's their fundamental langugage, and there could be stronger auto tools to rely on. Who knows, let's give it a try, warriors, the boss pays for it.</p><p>This article is about the Rust frontend on GCC. It's reasonable for me (or any potential contributors) to blame Rust's development model, since it's interfering the efforts of its own GCC frontend.</p><p>So far, the only reliable implementation is the officially supported LLVM front-end. I don't know if there're more, but I will not choose if it's not based on a mainstream compiler infrastructure. After all, it's system level language, once you choose, it's not expected to be changed in a decade. To my experiences to lead the software development in past decade, it's not so simple to change fundamental things, from libs to compilers to languages. It's not impossible, but why waste time to do it when you have lots of other workloads to deal with?</p><p>Stop, it's not a criticism article against Rust. So I'm not going to blame it more.</p><p>OK, that's enough, now that we're trying to work for the Rust front-end on GCC, it's reasonable to say we're interested in this language. And we hope to promote it better. As a perennial GNU hacker, it's natual for me to think about Rust on GCC. I have several experiences on writing language front-ends, the architecture is similar, and the theory is similar too. However, gcc-rust is a very hard project that couldn't be done successfully by one-man effort. In this article, I'll introduce the ideas and efforts around FOSS community. I hope all these information can help people to understand the situation, and help potential contributors to take part in.</p><p>Of course, Rust on LLVM has gone so far away, but what would I say?</p><p><img

Hydra Cave</h2><p>Rust on GCC is a Hydra. Why? Because there're at least 3 possible ways to go. Oh well, three heads of a dragon.</p><p>These 3 ways are originally mentioned by @redbrain who is one of the enthusiasts of Rust on GCC (<a href="https://github.com/redbrain/gccrs/issues/2#issuecomment-563255365" target="_blank">https://github.com/redbrain/gccrs/issues/2#issuecomment-563255365</a>). Unfortunately, he has dropped his efforts, but his work of Rust on GCC is still inspiring.</p><p>The first way is the most lightweight way. The original Rust compiler provides a IR (Intermediate Representation) named MIR, so the idea is really simple, we can take advantage of the front-end of Rust on LLVM then convert MIR to GENERIC which is the general IR in GCC. The pros is that we don't have to deal with the occasionally changing of Rust's grammar. This idea is achievable, since the original Rust compiler is in the similar architecture to convert MIR to LLVM-IR. The only problem is that this Rust on GCC frontend has to require the original rustc, and this may bring the LLVM dependencies chain. Then people may wonder why we still bother to implement Rust on GCC, it doesn't reduce the dependencies in the development environment nor likely to be widely accepted by GCC folks. No mention the license issue.</p><p>The second way is to use GCC JIT interface on top of the original Rust compiler. This architecture implies to add a new backend (libgccgit <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/cp/index.html" target="_blank">https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/cp/index.html</a>) to the original Rust compiler. So it's not the Rust on GCC as most people expected, it's a new feature request to Rust developer to support yet another compiler backend and maintain the code by Rust community. This is the perfect approach only if Rust developers accept it. However, the hard part would be license issue, and it all depends on the willing of Rust community.</p><p>The third way is the traditional way, full C++ implementation of Rust on GCC. There's an existing good example, gccgo, which is the Go language front-end on GCC. It's the hardest way to build a Rust compiler from scratch. The pros is that the developers can expect to do everything they like to build an efficient Rust compiler to challenge the orginal one, and it doesn't require LLVM as the prerequisite. Finally, no any license issue, we can make it GPLv3+. However, there must be a strong group to maintain this front-end. Gccgo has a strong team hired by Google. No mention you have to keep updating the volatile Rust grammar periodically.</p><p>All these approaches are independent from each other, so it's impossible to combine all these 3 forces. The MIR way is working by @sapir <a href="https://github.com/sapir/gcc-rust/tree/rust" target="_blank">https://github.com/sapir/gcc-rust/tree/rust</a>, and it's still in progress; The libgccjit way requires the connection to Rust community that is out of my reach, and I don't know who is working on it; as a GNU hacker, I think my prefered way is the third one. The third way was dropped by @redbrain, but there's some inspiring code left.</p><h2>What we've got so far?</h2><p>My plan is not to secretly working on it then throw a release suddenly to shock people. I have too many projects in my TODO, I do want to have gcc-rust, and I do want to have more friends on it. Let me emphersize it again, it's impossible to do it by one-man effort.</p><p>Fortunately, @SimplyTheOther have done fully-operational and working lexer, parser of a recent Rust syntax. It's great work. I have enough experiences to write parsers for practical languages, it's time consuming work. That's why I appreciate @SimplyTheOther's work so much. Of course, I agree with @SimplyTheOther that the most time consuming work would be the type checking part, at least for Rust, I'm afraid that it could be true.</p><p>After I helped to fix tiny bugs to make it work smoothly, I started to write an enhanced AST dumper. It's reasonable for us, first, I need to get familiar with @SimplyTheOther's AST design; second, we need to output a human-readable AST for debugging.</p><p>Let me show you a silly example:</p><pre spellcheck="false"><span><span>fn</span> <span>abc</span></span>(x:<span>u32</span>, y:<span>u32</span>) -&gt; <span>u32</span> {
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>return</span> x+y;
}

<span><span>fn</span> <span>main</span></span>() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>1</span>+<span>1</span>;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>println!</span>(<span>"Hello World!"</span>);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; abc(<span>1</span>, <span>1</span>);
}
</pre><p>Alright, it's silly meaningless code, let's see how the AST dump looks like.</p><p>Assuming you stored the source code to test.rs, then run AST dump:</p><pre spellcheck="false">rust1 -frust-<span>dump</span>-parse test.rs
</pre><p>The output could be:</p><pre spellcheck="false">Crate:
&nbsp;inner attributes: none
&nbsp;items:

<span>u32</span> abc(x : <span>u32</span>, y : <span>u32</span>)
BlockExpr:
{
&nbsp;outer attributes: none
&nbsp;inner attributes: none
&nbsp;statements:
&nbsp;ExprStmtWithoutBlock:
&nbsp; <span>return</span> ArithmeticOrLogicalExpr: x + y
&nbsp;final expression: none
}

void main()
BlockExpr:
{
&nbsp;outer attributes: none
&nbsp;inner attributes: none
&nbsp;statements:
&nbsp; ExprStmtWithBlock:
&nbsp;&nbsp; BlockExpr:
&nbsp;&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; outer attributes: none
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inner attributes: none
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; statements:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ExprStmtWithoutBlock:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ArithmeticOrLogicalExpr: <span>1</span> + <span>1</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; final expression: none
&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;ExprStmtWithoutBlock:
&nbsp; <span>println!</span>(<span>"Hello World!"</span>)
&nbsp;ExprStmtWithoutBlock:
&nbsp; outer attributes: none
&nbsp;&nbsp; StructExpr:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PathInExpr:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; abc(<span>1</span>, <span>1</span>)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inner attributes:none
&nbsp;final expression: none
}
</pre><p>It's good for us to debug or extend the parser. After all, if we can't make sure the parser is correct, how can we move forward to type checking and IR transformation?</p><p>The project repo is here, patches are welcome: <a href="https://github.com/philberty/gccrs" target="_blank">https://github.com/philberty/gccrs</a></p><h2>What's next?</h2><p>Before answer this question, I guess you may wonder why I used `rust1` rather than a traditional name `gccrust` or something else.</p><p>`rust1` is the Rust compiler, while `gccrust` is a collection that calling compiler, assembler, and linker like a chain. We haven't done the IR transformation yet, so there won't be anything can be assembled and linked except for the AST. Oh my poor Rust compiler!</p><p>It's not so hard to transform AST to GENERIC which is the current toplevel IR of gcc. However, it's meaningless to rush if we haven't made sure the parser work correctly for the Rust grammar. No mention the critical feature of Rust, the linear type system.</p><p>If you understand what I've said so far, then I can answer the question "what could be the next".</p><p>1. The type system, too big to talk about it here.</p><p>2. The static analysis.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the advantages of llvm-rust was that it used the static analysis of LLVM. Fortunately, David Malcolm finished his GCC static analysis framework recently <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/806099/" target="_blank">https://lwn.net/Articles/806099/</a>. I'm not sure if there could be any hook for front-end to interact with, or maybe we can't touch it once we pass the authority to the next level IR. Anyway, it's an exciting feature of GCC to research.</p><p>3. The new middle-IR for Rust specific pre-optimizing.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea is largely inspired by gccgo because they've inserted a specifically designed IR for Go language before transforming it to GENERIC. This IR was named GOGO. Gccgo will do some pre-optimizing with GOGO. From the compiler design perspective, it's reasonable to do so, since some information may lose after …</p></div></div>

      <p>Every developer needs access to some servers for example to check the application logs.</p>
<p>Usually, this is done using public-private key encryption where each developer generates their own public-private key pair.
The public keys of each developer are added to the <code>authorized_keys</code> file on each server they should have access to.</p>
<h2 id="painful-manual-changes">Painful manual changes</h2>
<p>So far so good. However, what happens when one developer leaves the company?</p>
<p>In that case, the public keys of that developer should be removed from all servers. This could be quite a bit of work depending on how many servers they had access to.
And even worse, if it’s done manually, there is quite some risk that the key is still forgotten on some server, so the access remains open.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-solutions">Alternative solutions</h2>
<p>There are some commercial and open source solutions out there which want to help out with this problem. The basic idea is that you add and maintain the keys and the access lists on that service and when you remove a key, they will remove it from all your servers.</p>
<p>Sounds good, but it has one very big disadvantage: it’s a potential single source of failure. If someone captures access to that service, they can gain access to all your servers. And if you lose access to that service, you also lose access to all your servers in the worst case.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution-signing-keys">The solution: signing keys</h2>
<p>When I was facing this problem, I asked on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24157180">HackerNews</a> how others are tackling this problem.</p>
<p>There were some great suggestions and insights from the community and the best solution to the problem seems to be the signing of keys which I will present to you here in detail.</p>
<h3 id="the-rough-idea">The rough idea</h3>
<p>The rough idea is this: You still generate a public-private key pair for each developer. However, you don’t upload the public keys to your servers.</p>
<p>Instead, you sign the public keys with a so-called certificate authority (CA) key which you generate before. This signing simply generates a third certificate file which you give back to the developer and they put it inside of their <code>.ssh/</code> folder next to the private and public key.</p>
<p>On the servers, you simply tell the server the public key of your CA and the server can detect if a user has a properly signed certificate and only allows access to the developers who have such a signed certificate.</p>
<h3 id="the-advantages">The advantages</h3>
<p>When you sign a certificate, you can determine how long that signing is valid. So if you sign it with a validity of 3 months and the developer leaves the company, then after 3 months they won’t have access to any of the servers for sure.</p>
<p>Now you say: well, but I don’t want to sign keys of everyone every 3 months which is a fair point.</p>
<p>One possibility is to automate the process for example by building a service where a user can automatically get a signed certificate when they authorize with their company e-mail and password, but that is beyond the scope of this article.</p>
<p>The simple alternative is that you issue certificates that are valid longer and then if someone leaves the company, you can revoke the certificate, i.e. invalidate it. You can put a list of invalid certificates on your servers and they will not accept the user any more.
This could for example be done by having this list on AWS S3 or some other storage and a cronjob on each server that regularly pulls this.</p>
<h3 id="show-me-how-to-do-this">Show me how to do this</h3>
<p>Glad that you asked!</p>
<p>It’s actually super simple once you know the drill.</p>
<p>First, you generate a certificate authority public-private key pair of which you should keep the private key very secure:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">umask <span>77</span>                        <span># you want it to be private</span>
mkdir ~/my-ca <span>&amp;&amp;</span> cd ~/my-ca
ssh-keygen -C CA -f ca -b <span>4096</span>  <span># be sure to use a passphrase and store it securely</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Then on your server you specify that all users signed by your CA are allowed to access the server:</p>
<ol>
<li>Upload the public key of your CA on your server, e.g. at <code>/etc/ssh/ca.pub</code></li>
<li>Tell the server to allow access to users signed by it by adding a line to <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">TrustedUserCAKeys /etc/ssh/ca.pub <span># Trust all with a certificate signed by ca.pub</span>
</code></pre></div><p>To make the changes effective, you should reload the ssh service: <code>sudo service ssh reload</code>.</p>
<p>Now if a developer generated their public-private key pair (e.g. <code>ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521</code>), they simply send you their public key (note that you never need to send any private keys around!).
Then you sign their public key to generate their certificate:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># Inside your ~/my-ca folder, sign their public key (here: id_ecdsa.pub)</span>
ssh-keygen -s ca -I USER_ID -V +12w -z <span>1</span> id_ecdsa.pub
</code></pre></div><p>Quick explanation for the different parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-s ca</code> - you want to use your CA to sign</li>
<li><code>-I USER_ID</code> - the id of your user / the username</li>
<li><code>-V +12w</code> - how long before the certificate expires - here valid for 12 weeks</li>
<li><code>-z 1</code> - the serial number of this certificate - can be used to make this particular certificate invalid later, should be unique</li>
<li><code>id_ecdsa.pub</code>: the public key of the developer which you want to sign</li>
</ul>
<p>It will generate the certificate <code>id_ecdsa-cert.pub</code> which you can send to the developer and they put it into their <code>~/.ssh</code> folder next to their public-private key pair.</p>
<h3 id="it-gets-even-better">It gets even better</h3>
<p>Sounds cool, right? But you can do even better!</p>
<p>You probably have developers with different experience and different teams and roles and not everyone accessing the same servers.</p>
<p>So let’s add roles into the signing process!</p>
<p>That way, on the server you specify which roles are allowed to access the server and during the signing process you specify the roles of the developer you are signing.</p>
<p>Then, that developer can access all servers matching to their roles.</p>
<p>When you on board a new developer, you only need to generate that one certificate and boom they have access to all relevant servers without adding anything on those servers.</p>
<p>Here is how this looks like schematically:</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="https://www.paepper.com/blog/posts/how-to-properly-manage-ssh-keys-for-server-access/ssh-keys-with-roles.png" alt="ssh certificate signing with roles">
    
      <figcaption>ssh certificate signing with roles</figcaption>
    
  </figure>


<p>This is how you configure roles on a server:</p>
<p>First, create the folder to configure access: <code>sudo mkdir /etc/ssh/auth_principals</code>
Inside that folder, you can create files with the name of the server user that someone could login as. For example to grant root access to some roles, add the file <code>/etc/ssh/auth_principals/root</code>.</p>
<p>Inside <code>/etc/ssh/auth_principals/root</code> you simply list all roles which should be able to login as root with one role per line:</p>
<p>Finally, configure on the server to use roles by again adding a line to <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">AuthorizedPrincipalsFile /etc/ssh/auth_principals/%u
</code></pre></div><p>To make the changes effective, you should reload the ssh service: <code>sudo service ssh reload</code>.</p>
<p>This is how you sign a key with roles (they are added to the certificate):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">ssh-keygen -s ca -I USER_ID -n ROLE1,ROLE2 -V +12w -z <span>2</span> id_ecdsa.pub
</code></pre></div><p>It’s the same as before, but with the <code>-n ROLE1,ROLE2</code> flag. Important: there can’t be spaces between the comma for different roles!</p>
<p>Now, that developer could log onto any server where <code>ROLE1</code> or <code>ROLE2</code> are in an auth_principals file for a user name they try to login as.</p>
<h3 id="revoking-keys">Revoking keys</h3>
<p>Finally, if you want to invalidate a certificate, you can do that by the user name or the serial number of the certicate (<code>-z</code> flag). It’s recommended to make a list of generated certificates in an Excel spreadsheet or have a database depending on the number of your peeps.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">ssh-keygen -k -f revoked-keys -u -s ca list-to-revoke
</code></pre></div><p>This is when you already have a <code>revoked-keys</code> list and want to update it (<code>-u</code> flag). For the initial generation, use it without the update flag.</p>
<p>The <code>list-to-revoke</code> needs to consist of usernames (ids) or serial numbers (<code>-z</code> flag during generation) like this:</p>
<pre><code>serial: 1
id: test.user
</code></pre><p>This would revoke access to the certificate with serial 1 and all certificates with id <code>test.user</code>.</p>
<p>To make the server respect revoked keys, you need to add the generated / updated <code>revoked keys</code> file to <code>/etc/ssh/revoked-keys</code> and configure it again in <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>:</p>
<p>Warning: make sure that the <code>revoked-keys</code> file is accessable and readable, otherwise you might lose access to your server</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">RevokedKeys /etc/ssh/revoked-keys
</code></pre></div><h2 id="summary-good-ssh-key-management">Summary: good ssh key management</h2>
<p>In my opinion, this solution is as good as it gets. You have the option to manage the access to your servers via ssh based on roles. You only need to configure your servers once (which roles are allowed to access it). For each new developer, you only need to generate a signed certificate and they immediately have access to all relevant machines matching their role / experience.
And when they leave the company, you can revoke their access also in a simple way.</p>
<p>And even if a mishap occurs and a developer leaves without having their access revoked, their certificate will expire after some time, so they also lose access automatically.</p>
<p>For small teams, you can do these steps manually as they are very fast to do; then as you grow, you can automate the certificate signing with a login service based on company authentication details.</p>
<p>Happy ssh-ing!</p>

<p>AWS Lightsail doesn’t usually show up in a list of AWS’ most popular services. However, Lightsail can be a great service to use especially if you are looking for a service that is easy to set up and has low maintenance. In this article, we will take a deeper look into Lightsail, when to use it and compare it to some of its competitors.</p>
<p>AWS Lightsail is a collection of building blocks that make it easy to get a web application up and running pretty quickly. These building blocks are:</p>

<h2 id="lightsail-instances">Lightsail Instances</h2>
<p>These instances are analogous to Virtual Private Servers (VPS) which are backed by EC2 instances (most likely the t2/t3 family) under the hood. AWS provides a lot of flexibility when it comes to choosing what kind of instance you want to run.</p>
<p>AWS Lightsail can be created in the following AWS Regions (as of September, 2020):</p>
<ul>
<li>US East (Ohio) (us-east-2)</li>
<li>US East (N. Virginia) (us-east-1)</li>
<li>US West (Oregon) (us-west-2)</li>
<li>Asia Pacific (Mumbai) (ap-south-1)</li>
<li>Asia Pacific (Seoul) (ap-northeast-2)</li>
<li>Asia Pacific (Singapore) (ap-southeast-1)</li>
<li>Asia Pacific (Sydney) (ap-southeast-2)</li>
<li>Asia Pacific (Tokyo) (ap-northeast-1)</li>
<li>Canada (Central) (ca-central-1)</li>
<li>EU (Frankfurt) (eu-central-1)</li>
<li>EU (Ireland) (eu-west-1)</li>
<li>EU (London) (eu-west-2)</li>
<li>EU (Paris) (eu-west-3)</li>
</ul>
<p>Lightsail also provides several options for the base image that you use for instance. You can choose from:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OS Only</strong>: You can choose from various Linux/Unix-based or a Windows-based OS</li>
<li><strong>Apps + OS</strong>: If you are planning to run a CMS like Wordpress or application on top of Django or Node, you can choose an image that installs these applications by default.</li>
</ul>
<p>More details about Lightsail instance images can be found <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/compare-options-choose-lightsail-instance-image">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/lightsail/instance-1.png" alt="instance-1" title="AWS Lightsail Instances"></p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/lightsail/instance-2.png" alt="instance-2" title="AWS Lightsail Instances"></p>
<p>One of the best features of Lightsail is its clear and transparent pricing. You can create an instance that best fits your needs and you can be confident of how much it will cost you at the end of the month. AWS is notorious for complex billing and this can put off a lot of new customers.</p>
<p>Lightsail instances come with generous data transfer limits which is definitely a big improvement.</p>
<p>AWS recently added <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-alarms">support for alarms in Lightsail</a>. This is a big improvement since previously there was no way to set up an alert for Lightsail system metrics such as CPU utilization.</p>
<p>You also have the flexibility of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/features/upgrade-to-ec2/">upgrading your instance</a> to EC2 in the future.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/lightsail/instance-3.png" alt="instance-3" title="AWS Lightsail Instances"></p>
<h3 id="loadbalancers">Loadbalancers</h3>
<p>Lightsail provides the option of adding a loadbalancer to your stack if you need to distribute traffic across your instances. Lightsail also lets you generate free SSL certificates from the UI itself and they work seamlessly with the loadbalancers.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/lightsail/loadbalancer-1.png" alt="loadbalancer-1" title="AWS Lightsail Loadbalancer"></p>
<h3 id="managed-database">Managed Database</h3>
<p>Lightsail lets you create a managed MySQL or PostgreSQL database easily. Lightsail makes certain database administration tasks much simpler:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automated database snapshots</li>
<li>Resize your database from a snapshot</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/lightsail/database-1.png" alt="database-1" title="AWS Lightsail Database"></p>
<h3 id="dns-management">DNS Management</h3>
<p>Lightsail makes it easy to direct traffic from your custom domain to your instances. This can be done by either creating a static IP or a DNS zone for your domain.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/lightsail/dns-1.png" alt="dns-1" title="AWS Lightsail DNS"></p>
<h3 id="lightsail-pros--cons">Lightsail: Pros &amp; Cons</h3>
<p>Like with any cloud service, Lightsail has its pros and cons. Some of the more obvious ones are:</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clear &amp; transparent pricing</strong>: Pricing is clear and you have a good idea of what your monthly expenses would be.</li>
<li><strong>Ease of use</strong>: Lightsail’s UI is straightforward and easy to use especially when compared to the AWS console.</li>
<li><strong>Low maintenance:</strong> Most of the lightsail services (DNS, Loadbalancers, Database) are managed and thus the operational burden of running your application in Lightsail is pretty low.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lightsail is missing some advanced features such as:
<ul>
<li>Security groups: there is no support for security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic. You need to use firewalls to achieve the same.</li>
<li>If the rest of your infrastructure is on Terraform, it might be hard to fully provision all Lightsail services using Terraform since some of the services <a href="https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+lightsail">aren’t yet supported</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Currently, it is not possible to upgrade your Lightsail database to RDS.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lightsail-alternative-lightsail-vs-digitalocean">Lightsail Alternative: Lightsail vs DigitalOcean</h2>
<p>DigitalOcean is LightSail’s main competitor. The target audience for both of these services are developers who want to be able to spin up their web services easily. We will try to compare these two offerings to get a better idea of how these services stack up against each other.</p>
<p>They’ve taken the relatively complex process of deploying servers to the cloud and simplified the entire process. Their UI is beautifully designed and cloud servers can be deployed within minutes. Pricing has always been transparent and you know what you’ll be paying each month upfront.</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<p>Lightsail and DigitalOcean are pretty comparable when it comes to the features they both offer. They both provide an easy-to-use interface for setting up as well as APIs for any programmatic setup. When it comes to choosing a server, they both provide a lot of choices. One can go with a The table below compares the two across various dimensions:</p>

<p><a href="https://joshtronic.com/2020/09/06/vps-showdown-digitalocean-lightsail-linode-upcloud-vultr/">The blog post</a> does a comprehensive performance comparion between various VPS providers. Lightsail and DigitalOcean performed comparably in these tests.</p>
<h3 id="when-to-use-lightsail">When to use Lightsail</h3>
<p>When it comes to choosing between Lightsail and DigitalOcean, there are a few factors to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are already using AWS, it makes sense to use Lightsail.</li>
<li>If you are planning to use other AWS services or you might upgrade from Lightsail to EC2, it makes sense to use LightSail.</li>
<li>If you haven’t used either of these services before, you are probably better off starting with DigitalOcean. DigitalOcean is simple and straightforward to use and this is their main business.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Lightsail is a service targeted towards developers who probably haven’t used AWS before or want a service that is easy to use with minimal maintenance overhead.</p>
<p>There are a lot of good reasons to use Lightsail:</p>
<ul>
<li>No need for prior AWS knowledge</li>
<li>Get a complete web service up &amp; running in less than an hour</li>
<li>Clear &amp; transparent pricing</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently <a href="https://jlelse.blog/thoughts/2019/09/vscode-remote-ssh/">rediscovered</a> the ability of Visual Studio Code to develop on remote machines. Just connect to a server via SSH and develop there.</p><p>Even though I’m using Git, I don’t have to commit everything immediately to continue development on another machine, I don’t have to take care to keep all my development tools up to date on all my machines, and I can continue working from my Surface Go with Windows exactly where I left off with my Ubuntu desktop. And I can, for example, start drafting a blog post on one computer, but finish it on another.</p><p>All I need is a cheap rented virtual private server and Visual Studio Code on every machine I want to code from.</p><hr><p>But first of all the reason why I got the idea in the first place:</p><p>To program in Go, I mainly used <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IDEA Ultimate</a> from JetBrains in the past. The best IDE a developer can wish for. Excellent for Java, Kotlin, Go and a lot of other programming languages. And pretty cool: As a student you can get the full IDE for free.</p><p>However, since I won’t be a student forever and IDEA Ultimate or as an alternative just <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoLand</a> from JetBrains <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/store/#personal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren’t very cheap</a> (at least for hobby projects), I thought I might get used to a different workflow now that will cost me less money later.</p><p>The second best option for developing Go is probably <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visual Studio Code</a>. The Go team took over the development of <a href="https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Go extension</a> not too long ago, which will hopefully make it more and more pleasant to develop Go programs with VS Code in the future.</p><p>VS Code is free, partly even <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open source</a> and I already use it for quite a lot of things anyway, be it for writing longer blog articles or if I need to write some JavaScript. In itself it is just a text editor, but there are quite a few extensions that add all kinds of functionality. And VS Code is fast and available for all three major computer operating systems.</p><p>For VS Code there is an extension called “Remote - SSH” (documentation is available <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>) with which it is possible to connect to another computer or server via SSH. On the remote computer VS Code installs a remote server to provide almost all functionality that is possible locally. It’s like running VS Code directly on the remote computer and developing from there.</p><p>As a server I use the cheapest option from <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hetzner Cloud</a>. With just a few clicks I created a VPS with Ubuntu 20.04, two Gigabytes of RAM and 20 GB SSD storage. I also use Ubuntu 20.04 on my desktop computer and laptop, the environment I am used to. And if the server should be too weak for certain tasks, I can scale it up with a few clicks, even temporarily. The costs are 2,89 € per month. If I don’t need the server for a longer period of time, I could also create an image of the hard drive, delete the server and create a new one later based on the image. That would cost only a few cents per month.</p><p>This way I only have to install all the tools I need on the server. Like Go for the programming of various private projects or Hugo for this blog and my website. But I don’t have to install these tools on all my devices anymore, namely my desktop computer, my Ubuntu-ThinkPad and my Surface Go. There I only need Visual Studio Code with the “Remote - SSH” extension.</p><p>It definitely takes some getting used to in order to adapt to the less comfort you might be used to through the JetBrains IDE. But once you have found the right settings of the Go extension (for example that the Go language server <code>gopls</code> is used), then programming with this setup works quite well.</p><p>My favorite feature is definitely the ability to forward ports from the server to the local machine.</p><p>The only possible negative point is that I need an internet connection to develop so that I can connect to the server. But so often I am not without internet and even in Germany the mobile network should be sufficient for SSH. And when I am offline, I will just have to do something else.</p></div></div>]]>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6682ce0e9be9292fb093d16e4b89a6cbec481554/1fe8d/images/uploads/sign-up-buttons.png" alt="SaaS Startups Using Sign Up Buttons"></p>

<p>The fate of many&nbsp;startups depends almost entirely on one&nbsp;conversion point: When a visitor becomes a user.</p>

<p>All too often, this pivotal role&nbsp;falls on the shoulders of a pitifully generic “sign up” button that’s lucky to get even a minute of consideration during development.</p>

<p>If you take a moment to consider the wording of your signup button, you can drastically increase how many of your visitors turn into users.</p>

<p><em>(What happens after the conversion is important, too, but things get significantly easier once you have someone’s email and opt-in.)</em></p>
<h2>Why "Sign Up" buttons don't work.</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>They're&nbsp;ignored.&nbsp;</strong>When visitors see common elements repeated on many sites, they begin unconsciously ignoring those elements (aka "habituation").&nbsp;Doesn't matter if they're blue or green or hell-fire-orange.</li>
  <li><strong>You're asking for blind commitment.</strong>&nbsp;Don't&nbsp;assume visitors&nbsp;know what you're asking them to sign up for. People don't read pages, they skim. They could've easily missed the part where you mention a&nbsp;free trial or key benefits.</li>
  <li><strong>You're not offering any value.</strong> Asking someone to "sign up" offers no help in changing the visitor's thinking from "Why should I?" to "I want this!"</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to get more signups&nbsp;from your signup button:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Tie it to your product.</strong> If you have a SaaS for trading bitcoins: "Start Trading Bitcoins." If&nbsp;you have a marketplace for artists: "Start Selling Art." This helps prevent the button from being overlooked.</li>
  <li><strong>Give, don't take.</strong> "Get Access" and "Sign Up" both lead to the same thing, but one makes the visitor feel they're getting something, while the other doesn't.</li>
  <li><strong>Compel people to act.</strong> Use action verbs such as <em>get</em>, <em>start</em>, and <em>try</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples from startups that get it right:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/a5e786dc725cdf0d2cc7d265cf2130fd5e785f5e/09f83/images/uploads/sign-up-buttons-2.png" alt="Startups with Good Signup Buttons"></p>

<p>(I especially like gliffy’s “Start Drawing,” which implies how quickly you can get started, and directly relates to&nbsp;their product: <a href="http://www.gliffy.com/">an app for easily drawing diagrams</a>.)</p>
<h2>Case study: Getting 3x more clicks by changing two words.</h2>
<p>Take this example from one of my clients. Like many software companies, Scalyr—a <a href="https://www.scalyr.com/">log aggregation and monitoring tool</a>—asked its visitors to “sign up.” I suggested that we test a version of the button that <em>gives</em> and <em>compels</em>: “Try it Free”. Here’s what happened:</p>

<p><strong>Asking visitors to <em>Try it Free</em> <span>increased clicks by 212%</span>.</strong></p>

<p>Complete obliteration of the old “Sign Up” button, and a&nbsp;huge win for a test that took two minutes to set up.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7562f9ce9e08b024e6c838126e1d6f54e24e07ed/7465d/images/uploads/scalyr-test-result.png" alt="A/B test on Scalyr resulted in 212% increase in clicks."></p>
<h2>Now try it yourself...</h2>
<p>Test a variation of your “sign up” button with something that <em>gives</em>,&nbsp;<em>compels</em>, and is <em>tied to your product</em>. It’s one of the easiest things to test, and could have a huge effect on your conversion rates. If you follow my advice then you’re almost certain to do better than asking visitors to “sign up.”</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This is a followup to my post about a year ago, <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/ui/druid/2019/11/22/reactive-ui.html">Towards a unified theory of reactive UI</a>. It is a deeper exploration of the question: “what is the best way to express reactive UI in Rust?”</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>There is an astonishing diversity of “literature” on reactive UI systems. I put “literature” in quotes here, because, with some exceptions, the best primary sources are the code of open source projects. Some of the diversity comes from differences in goals, but some of it is accidental. In many cases, it’s simply because the designers didn’t have insight at the time about better solutions. My post last year attempted to put some order to this diversity, by discovering common patterns.</p>

<p>I believe it’s likely that the answer to “the best way to express reactive UI in Rust” is to be found in the existing literature, at least by combining major themes, if not in a single existing system to copy. It seems unlikely we’ll have to invent something completely new. But sorting through it is not easy. It is not the intent of this post to provide a comprehensive review of the literature (though I think such a thing would be interesting), it is to guide inquiry into the most promising avenues. I want to do mining, not stamp collecting. Where is the richest vein of ore?</p>

<p>To focus the inquiry, I will start by listing some goals. While in general these goals all seem like good things, it’s important to understand them as tradeoffs. Prioritizing different goals will lead you to different places, and not everyone has the same needs. Take overall system complexity, for example. If you’re a trillion dollar corporation, then a complex system is merely a question of allocating resources, and may even be strategically useful as a moat to discourage competition. But if you’re an indie game developer trying to integrate basic UI, you have a very different perspective.</p>

<p>Each goal will be presented primarily as a way to introduce design decisions made by existing reactive systems, and filter the ones that seem most promising as sources and inspiration.</p>

<p>Then I will go into deeper into three principles, which I feel are critically important in any reactive UI framework: whether to use “observable objects,” how to express the mutation of the render object tree (or trees in general), and the notion of stable identity of nodes in that tree.</p>

<p>Finally, I will introduce <a href="https://github.com/raphlinus/crochet">Crochet</a>, a research prototype built for the purpose of exploring these ideas.</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<h3 id="concise-expression-of-application-logic">Concise expression of application logic</h3>

<p>The main point of a reactive UI architecture is so that the app can express its logic clearly and concisely, and the results can drive the rest of the UI stack in a reasonable way.</p>

<p>A central feature of reactive UI is for the app to declaratively express the current state of the view tree. In traditional object-oriented UI, it’s more common to specify the initial state (often as a static document, not even code), plus additional logic for state changes. I think the debate is now essentially over, the reactive approach is winning.</p>

<p>SwiftUI has gained considerable attention due to its excellent ergonomics in this regard. But other approaches are also worth studying. In particular, immediate mode GUI (<a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui">imgui</a>) is nearly as declarative, it just achieves it in a very different way (about which more below). And React and its many derivatives are also “good enough.” <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> is another example from the JS world that deserves praise, though considerably more difficult to adapt to Rust because of its reliance on a sophisticated compiler.</p>

<p>It’s very popular in Rust GUI land to adapt <a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/">Elm</a> patterns; we see clear influence in <a href="https://github.com/antoyo/relm">relm</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hecrj/iced">Iced</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bodil/vgtk">vgtk</a>, and others. But I think much of the conciseness and friendliness of Elm comes from the language itself, particularly its facility with higher-order composition. When adapting to a more pragmatic language such as Rust, I consider each subtask of view building and dispatching messages to components as each a half-lens, requiring the writing out of two pieces of logic to integrate a component. For this reason, I find Rust UI code adapted from Elm to be not as clear and concise as possible.</p>

<p>A great resource for comparing the concision of different toolkits is <a href="https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/">7GUIs</a>. We don’t have these ported to Crochet yet, except for counter, but plan to. For reference, here’s the <code>run</code> method for that:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>fn</span> <span>run</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>cx</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>Cx</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>Label</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>format!</span><span>(</span><span>"current count: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>self</span><span>.count</span><span>))</span><span>.build</span><span>(</span><span>cx</span><span>);</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>Button</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"Increment"</span><span>)</span><span>.build</span><span>(</span><span>cx</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>self</span><span>.count</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="actually-being-incremental">Actually being incremental</h3>

<p>While imgui can express UI concisely, it cheats somewhat by not being incremental. Generally, it makes up for this by being able to repaint the world very quickly (using GPU acceleration), but there are downsides, including power consumption. In the context of a game which is actively using the GPU anyway, it’s fine, but is a good reason not to choose imgui outside that context.</p>

<p>The documentation of <a href="https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/conrod">Conrod</a> expresses a goal fairly well: “Conrod aims to adopt the best of both worlds by providing an immediate mode API over a hidden, retained widget state graph.” And once you have that, doing efficient incremental updates in the retained widget graph is a solved problem, though the details can be intricate. Unfortunately, I do not believe Conrod delivers on this promise, because app logic does an awful lot of explicit graph construction and juggling of node id’s, neither of which you would find in an actual immediate mode API.</p>

<p>On the other side, <a href="https://github.com/hecrj/iced">Iced</a>, while having many desirable properties, does not satisfy the “actually incremental” goal: while there is caching in the renderer, it builds a full view tree every 16ms (actually twice when there are incoming events). This is fine when the view tree is relatively small, but is a serious problem at scale.</p>

<p>The popularity of “virtual DOM” approaches requires a discussion of diffing, which I feel is (modulo escape hatches for lower level direct tree mutation) a form of half-incrementality. The idea is that it should be cheap to produce a full view tree, then a reconciliation engine computes a minimal diff between that and the old tree, which is then be applied, through DOM mutation or some other means. Because DOM is slow, it’s certainly faster than ham-handed direct DOM mutation (which is difficult to make truly minimal), but still creates performance problems as the view tree grows. React programmers should be well familiar with this issue.</p>

<p>When escape hatches are provided, are they a reasonably principled way to achieve lower level access to tree mutation, simply shifting some tracking of state to the component (often a list view or similar collection), or are they a dirty hack to work around fundamental architectural decisions that limit performance? Both are represented in the literature.</p>

<h3 id="tab-focusing">Tab focusing</h3>

<p>It seems like a relatively simple feature, but proper implementation of tab focusing requires fairly deep architectural support (or, in the case of Web-based UI, it is punted to the browser). Basically, it requires the toolkit to maintain state of which widget is focused, and to query enough of the entire view tree to determine which is the next in tab focus order. Proponents of imgui have suggested a very hacky partial solution (see <a href="http://www.johno.se/book/imgui.html">johno on IMGUI</a>), but I find such things unsatisfying.</p>

<p>Again, Iced is an example of an existing Rust GUI toolkit that is lacking this feature, and I think would require nontrivial architectural work to address, at least in a systematic way that would satisfy similar future needs. Down the line, those needs include accessibility, a serious Achilles heel for imgui-flavored designs in particular.</p>

<p>I believe a proper approach to this problem involves stable identity of widgets, about which much more below.</p>

<h3 id="simple-types">Simple types</h3>

<p>Now we get into more controversial goals. One that I personally am finding increasingly important is expressing the interface between app logic and UI toolkit using simple types.</p>

<p>Rust in particular invites the use of complex types, largely because it has a rich type system that is capable of expressing many concepts as types. By contrast, it’s traditional in object oriented UI to have very loosely coupled dynamic typing; a lot of the values being passed around have a type which is some variant of “any.”</p>

<p>A great example of complex types is SwiftUI, in which a component returns a statically-known type implementing the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view"><code>View</code></a> protocol. As a consequence, the concrete return type of a component generally encodes its entire view hierarchy, including special conditional and looping combinators; this is explained well in the <a href="https://www.objc.io/blog/2019/11/05/static-types-in-swiftui/">Static Types in SwiftUI</a> blog.</p>

<p>There are advantages to such a scheme, but also serious downsides. Error messages from the compiler get… interesting. And it also has a serious impact on compile times, as (at least in Rust) the compiler has to monomorphize the types before even starting to generate code.</p>

<p>To me, one of the most serious drawbacks to the complex type approach is that scripting languages can’t easily play, as the types must be known at compile time.</p>

<p>Again, imgui is an example of an architecture that avoids complex types, by drawing the UI directly rather than constructing an intermediate tree of view objects. But imgui is not the only such; another compelling example to learn from is <a href="https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/under-the-hood-of-jetpack-compose-part-2-of-2-37b2c20c6cdd">Jetpack Compose</a>.</p>

<h3 id="simple-control-flow">Simple control flow</h3>

<p>It is very tempting to use complex control flow patterns: putting significant logic in callbacks, using higher order composition techniques, or using a compiler to significantly transform the code. Yet, such techniques have downsides.</p>

<p>The first is simply that this complexity leaks out into the app. In current Druid, we use some higher order composition techniques such as lenses. While fairly simple by Haskell standards, and our users with Haskell background tend to like them, a lot of people coming to Druid find them confusing.</p>

<p>We turned a coffee maker into a dangerous machine asking for ransom by modifying the maker’s firmware. While we could, could someone else do it too? As you might expect, the answer is: Yes. Follow us on a journey where we show you that firmware is the new software.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Some research is so fun that it confirms why I do this work. I was asked to prove a myth, call it a suspicion, that the threat to IoT devices is not just to access them via a weak router or exposure to the internet, but that an IoT device itself is vulnerable and can be easily owned without owning the network or the router. I also bet that I could make that threat persist and present a true danger to any user. We often say that your home network, thought of as a chain of trust, is only as strong as its weakest link, but what if the same were true at the device level? What would that mean?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s say you have an IoT device that is well protected with functions that can be accessed through a well-defined API; even if you can control the device through the API, you probably can’t do too much harm. Firmware, the programming inside the device has logical constraints that don’t allow you, for example, to close garage doors while someone is in the way of them or overheat a device so that it combusts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We used to trust that hardware, such as a common kitchen appliance, could be trusted and could not be easily altered without physically dismounting the device. But with today’s “smart” appliances, this is no longer the case.</p>



<p>My colleagues often hear me say that&nbsp; “firmware is a new software.” And that software is very often flawed. We see it everywhere. CPU flaws, and cryptographic chips generating weak keys that can be easily broken. The weakened state of IoT security is due in large part to the fact that, nowadays, it is more convenient and cheap to place a processor inside a device which controls and orchestrates all hardware parts, motors, sensors, heating elements, etc. based on a short program called firmware. This solution is not only cheap, but has also one important property – it can be updated</p>



<p><br>Back in the day, if there was a so-called design flaw in a piece of hardware, the rigid design (often hardwired) meant the vendor would need to replace the whole component or logic board or even replace the entire device. Manufacturers would have to change the manufacturing process and at potentially great financial losses. In the era of firmware, this can be easily mitigated just by issuing a firmware update.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The process of updating firmware can vary greatly, from connecting to the special device using a special tool (which still requires the vendor’s physical interaction) to the more and more popular way of OTA (over the air) updates. In this case, a vendor doesn’t have to be physically present and the whole process is done either automatically over the internet or semi-automatically after a user’s notification and approval of the update.&nbsp;</p>







<p>So let’s see what we have. We have a coffee maker that allows you to make coffee the old fashioned way by pressing a few buttons or via a mobile phone or tablet using an app. The maker operates with Wi-Fi and when unboxed you have to connect it to your network through a companion app on your mobile phone. When turned on for the first time, the coffee maker works in a local mode and it creates its own Wi-Fi network that the hopeful coffee drinker first connects to in order to set up the device.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we downloaded the companion app, we saw that it allows you to create a network of any&nbsp; devices of this particular vendor and connects these devices to the&nbsp; home network and then allows you to control all the functions of your coffee maker or smart kettle. It also allows you to check the firmware version of the device and update it if needed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The protocol that this device speaks has already been documented on the internet by <a href="#references">several other researchers</a>. As expected, it’s a simple binary protocol with hardly any encryption, authorization or authentication. Communication with machines takes place on <code>TCP</code> port <code>2081</code>. The format of the command is very simple:</p>

<p>In response (if there is a response) the coffee maker sends back:</p>

<p><code>response_type</code> differs based on the command, but the general rule is: If the response contains data <code>response_type = command + 1</code>, if it’s just a status then <code>response_type=3</code> and then there is only one <code>data</code> byte which contains resulting status, where <code>1</code> means success. The complete list of commands is in the  <a href="https://github.com/avast/ioc/tree/master/SmarterCoffee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub repository</a>.<br></p>



<p>&nbsp;So just for illustration, by issuing this command:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="396" height="78" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-8.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-8.png 396w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-8-300x59.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px"><figcaption><em>making a nice cup of coffee with “default” settings</em></figcaption></figure></div>







<p>You’ll make yourself a nice cup/cups of coffee based on the default settings of the coffee maker. As you can see, there is no security, so anyone who has access to the network and is able to reach the IP address of the coffee maker can control it. What is more interesting, is that all these commands are also available through that default opened Wi-Fi network when the device is not joined to a home network yet.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Let’s return to our main goal of hijacking the coffee maker for nefarious purposes. How secure is the updating process? Can we break into it? Can we even change the firmware to do something else than was originally intended? Can we turn the device into a physically dangerous device? Can we do it remotely? As I said in the beginning, the weakest link always compromises the whole system. Either it’s a network or a device. The goal is answering all the above questions and prove that IoT devices could be also compromised at the firmware level.</p>



<p>To start, we wanted to learn how the update process works. We have several options to do this, but we already have a recipe for this based on similar past research we have done. The general rule is to make it as simple as possible; here is our to-do list when trying to reverse the update process of a piece of firmware.</p>



<ol><li>Get it (the file with the firmware)</li><li>Unpack it (if it is packed/encrypted)</li><li>Reverse engineer it (translate those zeroes and ones into meaningful code)</li><li>Modify it (add the malicious content)</li><li>Upload it (and push it back to the device)</li></ol>



<p>It’s simple right?</p>







<p>First, we need to get the firmware somehow, and again there are several options. Let’s stick to the rule, the simplest option first:</p>



<ol><li>Google it – as obvious as it seems,&nbsp; sometimes security researchers omit this step which could save them a lot of work. Firmware is often available on the internet to be downloaded.</li><li>Capture and analyze network traffic – if the protocol is unencrypted the easiest way is to just capture the network traffic, in that case, we have three more options where to look<ul><li>traffic between the device and the internet</li><li>traffic between device and companion app, if there is any</li><li>traffic between the companion app and the internet</li></ul></li><li>Analyze and reverse engineer the companion app. Before we dive deeply into the device, it’s advisable to first peek into the device’s companion app, it’s usually the easiest solution for grabbing the communication protocol and commands.

It’s time to dismount the device, trace the board to identify all the components, get datasheets to find debugging ports, and possibly dump the firmware directly from the chip. This is really an adventure in hardware and not for everyone.</li></ol>



<p>Life is not so simple, and neither is reverse engineering IoT devices. It turned out that we had to use a combination of all the aforementioned techniques. First, we googled it, and as the commands have already been documented, we found a command that says <code>“update the firmware.”</code> But the command itself (its parameters and format) had not been documented. So by issuing:</p>







<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-9.png" alt="" width="396" height="78" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-9.png 396w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-9-300x59.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px"><figcaption>t<em>his simple (two bytes) command switches coffee maker into update mode</em></figcaption></figure></div>







<p>the coffee maker goes into an update mode (on the newer firmware you have to push a button to actually start the update, but this is not the case with older versions !)</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/zt-eEhReRyN8xe20y_NoBwNR_TCZ02Y87hyXVZDDiU6WtGGW2s4bmTBy37tdaIS9TBm5hLoBKwqcc1iE0tHjhC4HzVqqhSX_DB1bRUvGy9QTeuwGiYuSRVXTuoWxnkGFwOn57tVX" alt=""></figure></div>







<p>Hmm nice, but nothing happens. By analyzing network traffic, we concluded that there is nothing to analyze, as there is no traffic coming out of the coffee maker at this stage. So we tried the Android companion app.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-02-at-9.30.47-AM.png" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is Screen-Shot-2019-08-02-at-9.30.47-AM.png"><figcaption><em>Android application for smart coffee maker, right picture shows an update screen</em></figcaption></figure></div>







<p>You can see the update button is grayed out, so obviously, the firmware is up-to-date and there is no easy option to push the firmware update to be able to see what’s in the network traffic. What’s interesting here is what’s missing. There was no communication to the internet neither from the coffee maker nor from the app. So how is it possible that the app knows that the coffee maker has the latest firmware? The only packets of data that went through were those between the machine and app when the app had been asking the machine for the version of the firmware.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="677" height="177" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-4.png 677w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-4-300x78.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 677px) 100vw, 677px"><figcaption>Typical traffic analysis of IoT with companion app: we are interested in traffic between app and internet and app and device.</figcaption></figure></div>







<p>This is strange, and it seemed to tell us that the firmware is probably not on the internet and must be part of the app. So we opened the .apk file as easy as a .zip file. What we found there, proved our assumption.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/reUvllV7KNcZW0e9A4E_XljR0jknTZL-CLUbS3vJx0uiyArpgKdEVSpK1vEUUG0Q6Tu00I0wUlZMdQ8nG1w_Mdxz611TUCxA2DozEy0wftaC0qynZhhx8_pKNc6VeST1djzBgVti" alt=""><figcaption><em>Files inside the apk: You can see firmware for both products are contained in the two files with suffix .bin&nbsp;</em></figcaption></figure></div>







<p>The firmware is part of the Android app and it also means that new versions of the firmware always come with new versions of the app. This makes perfect sense if you think about it for a second. The new firmware usually adds new functionality, which has to be reflected somehow inside the user interface of the app, and it allows us to find a file containing the firmware without even touching the device. That’s nice and not very common.</p>







<p>In the next step of my research we try to figure out …</p></div></article></div>

<p>We turned a coffee maker into a dangerous machine asking for ransom by modifying the maker’s firmware. While we could, could someone else do it too? As you might expect, the answer is: Yes. Follow us on a journey where we show you that firmware is the new software.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Some research is so fun that it confirms why I do this work. I was asked to prove a myth, call it a suspicion, that the threat to IoT devices is not just to access them via a weak router or exposure to the internet, but that an IoT device itself is vulnerable and can be easily owned without owning the network or the router. I also bet that I could make that threat persist and present a true danger to any user. We often say that your home network, thought of as a chain of trust, is only as strong as its weakest link, but what if the same were true at the device level? What would that mean?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s say you have an IoT device that is well protected with functions that can be accessed through a well-defined API; even if you can control the device through the API, you probably can’t do too much harm. Firmware, the programming inside the device has logical constraints that don’t allow you, for example, to close garage doors while someone is in the way of them or overheat a device so that it combusts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We used to trust that hardware, such as a common kitchen appliance, could be trusted and could not be easily altered without physically dismounting the device. But with today’s “smart” appliances, this is no longer the case.</p>



<p>My colleagues often hear me say that&nbsp; “firmware is a new software.” And that software is very often flawed. We see it everywhere. CPU flaws, and cryptographic chips generating weak keys that can be easily broken. The weakened state of IoT security is due in large part to the fact that, nowadays, it is more convenient and cheap to place a processor inside a device which controls and orchestrates all hardware parts, motors, sensors, heating elements, etc. based on a short program called firmware. This solution is not only cheap, but has also one important property – it can be updated</p>



<p><br>Back in the day, if there was a so-called design flaw in a piece of hardware, the rigid design (often hardwired) meant the vendor would need to replace the whole component or logic board or even replace the entire device. Manufacturers would have to change the manufacturing process and at potentially great financial losses. In the era of firmware, this can be easily mitigated just by issuing a firmware update.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The process of updating firmware can vary greatly, from connecting to the special device using a special tool (which still requires the vendor’s physical interaction) to the more and more popular way of OTA (over the air) updates. In this case, a vendor doesn’t have to be physically present and the whole process is done either automatically over the internet or semi-automatically after a user’s notification and approval of the update.&nbsp;</p>







<p>So let’s see what we have. We have a coffee maker that allows you to make coffee the old fashioned way by pressing a few buttons or via a mobile phone or tablet using an app. The maker operates with Wi-Fi and when unboxed you have to connect it to your network through a companion app on your mobile phone. When turned on for the first time, the coffee maker works in a local mode and it creates its own Wi-Fi network that the hopeful coffee drinker first connects to in order to set up the device.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we downloaded the companion app, we saw that it allows you to create a network of any&nbsp; devices of this particular vendor and connects these devices to the&nbsp; home network and then allows you to control all the functions of your coffee maker or smart kettle. It also allows you to check the firmware version of the device and update it if needed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The protocol that this device speaks has already been documented on the internet by <a href="#references">several other researchers</a>. As expected, it’s a simple binary protocol with hardly any encryption, authorization or authentication. Communication with machines takes place on <code>TCP</code> port <code>2081</code>. The format of the command is very simple:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="593" height="111" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-6.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-6.png 593w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-6-300x56.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px"></figure></div>







<p>In response (if there is a response) the coffee maker sends back:</p>

<p><code>response_type</code> differs based on the command, but the general rule is: If the response contains data <code>response_type = command + 1</code>, if it’s just a status then <code>response_type=3</code> and then there is only one <code>data</code> byte which contains resulting status, where <code>1</code> means success. The complete list of commands is in the  <a href="https://github.com/avast/ioc/tree/master/SmarterCoffee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub repository</a>.<br></p>

<p>You’ll make yourself a nice cup/cups of coffee based on the default settings of the coffee maker.

<p>This is strange, and it seemed to tell us that the firmware is probably not on the internet and must be part of the app. So we opened the .apk file as easy as a .zip file. What we found there, proved our assumption.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The firmware is part of the Android app and it also means that new versions of the firmware always come with new versions of the app. This makes perfect sense if you think about it for a second. The new firmware usually adds new functionality, which has to be reflected somehow inside the user interface of the app, and it allows us to find a file containing the firmware without even touching the device. That’s nice and not very common.</p>

<p>"Everyone gets the experience. Some get the lesson." T.S. Eliot</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Contributing to a project is not an easy task, especially if you're new to the project, new to coding in general, or
just not an active contributor.</p>
<p>I have been on both sides, the contributing side and the reviewing side. I've made mistakes on both. The mistakes I
regret the most are the ones I've made on the reviewing side. Some are obvious, some are not. All of them could have
made the contributor's life, whether a developer on the team, or a contributor in an open source project, much easier.</p>
<p>A critical point to make, and something that I personally do not accept as a manager or as a developer, are actions
taken on either side which are made with bad intent. So while innocent mistakes are fine, we all make them, knowingly or
not, doing bad by intent is not acceptable behavior at all. Following up on the previous point,
by making intentional mistakes, I mean following imperfect guidelines, or having a
false perception of what's important or how to convey it, in contrast with having malicious intentions with your
actions.</p>
<h2 id="insignificant-factors"><a href="#insignificant-factors" aria-label="insignificant factors permalink"></a>Insignificant factors</h2>
<p>There is a big waste of time and energy in trivial, non-significant feedback. This complies perfectly with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality">Parkinson's Law of Triviality</a>. People spend a disproportional amount
of time bothering with trivial details that have almost nothing to do with code semantics. From arguing about style,
function names, property names, names in general, spaces (or tabs), indentation (or lack of), braces, splitting code to
modules (or joining separate modules), extracting constants (almost religiously).</p>
<p>People also love premature optimizations (Which are known to be the
<a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization">root of all evil</a>). They do or suggest using LRU, sets instead of lists and
so many other factors, without any proven significant performance benefits, or that those are even needed. In general,
the program complexity seems to matter less than program correctness (or assumed correctness).</p>
<p>Why do we bother with such things?</p>
<ol>
<li>We underwent similar scrutiny when we were less experienced, and think it's great, or the correct path to becoming
better. Maybe it's simply something new trainees have to do.</li>
<li>People tend to spend less time thinking about the global effects of a change, and spend more time on the micro level.
This means reading and writing comments on a review as they process it. This prevents the reader from "Seeing the big
picture". Instead, we focus on tiny improvements, as if they were the important factor. "Improve this function's
name", "Extract this number as a constant.", all things we write that have almost no significant semantic code
impact. Why do we do them? They're easier to come up with, and they're also sometimes more obvious.</li>
<li>We didn't take the time removing any manual decisions about style from the review. Both the contributor and the
reviewer need to spend effort on reviewing style and this both wears them down, and simultaneously prevents them from
focusing on what matters. This is a key point I'll discuss later in <a href="#removing-obstacles">Removing obstacles</a>.</li>
<li>We find it hard to believe that
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/devops-at-microsoft/code-reviews-not-primarily-finding-bugs#code-reviews-rarely-find-functional-bugs">code reviews rarely catch bugs</a>.
Yes, it's kind of shocking, we were all taught that code reviews are an effective tool for this kind of things.
They're not. They are effective for other things, discussed later in <a href="#the-important-stuff">The important stuff</a>. The
overall theme of thinking too highly about code reviews is basically science fiction. We should be spending our
energy elsewhere.</li>
<li>It's a form of control. This is a bit sad to say, and I've been there myself. Teams tend to be overly defensive about
their code and apply harsh review to external (to the team) contributors. They also sometimes apply this to more
junior developers, partly as a training tool and partly a control tool. Software code control is mostly a virtual
dance around a code repository. The alleged last defense (besides code quality tooling and deployment) is the code
review. Teams really believe it is their job to "protect the code", whatever that means, and their belief is
reinforced when they have to wake up at night due to changes done by external team members. One can say they should
have built better protective measures, or that they also wake up at night to their own changes, but it's very easy to
fall into this "guardian" trap after the n-th time they get a pager from an external person's change.</li>
<li>A form of control, but the bad kind. A person or persons are either taking care of their job security, or making sure
you know who is the owner (boss). This is a form of territorial battle, where someone who has the last word wins and
thus receives virtual fame and confidence, at least on paper. This happens a lot more than one would think it
happens, but in the end, code is written (at least in present day) by humans, who are a talking animal, but still an
animal, with a social ladder and animal-like behavior. I've been there, it's ugly. If you're in a company that has
this kind of stuff going on a lot, I suggest you run away.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-important-stuff"><a href="#the-important-stuff" aria-label="the important stuff permalink"></a>The important stuff</h2>
<p>What should we use code-reviews for? To be perfectly honest, I'm not a big believer in pre-merge code-reviews (To be
explained later in <a href="#the-road-less-traveled">The road less traveled</a>). I've seen them weigh down development speed so
much, the added benefits might not be worth it. That said a code-review can be important when:</p>
<ol>
<li>The developer is new. Either entirely to the code-base or to coding. That developer is going to need feedback on both
how to code, how "we" code, and what's important to the team. In these regards, the code-review is being used as a
training class, and less than a device to add features. In a way, this is the asynchronous alternative to pair
programming or coding together.</li>
<li>Someone wanting to familiarize themselves with the code-base or changes made to it. That someone can be another
developer that you want to be aware of your new feature or changes, your tech lead or a senior engineer in the team.
A code-review helps them learn the inner-details of your new feature, that specific part of code that they don't
know, or just get better acquainted with the code-base. This means the code review is meant as an FYI to them, and in
most cases it shouldn't be blocking.</li>
<li>Reviewing system critical changes. Sometimes you do need or want an extra eye-ball on system critical changes.
Anything that can have a drastic effect on the system, from changing the way you run tests, to changing service
infrastructure, to super-hot code which is very performance oriented, to sensitive billing code. Those areas might be
worth the added blocking review, but I also assume those areas are less frequently edited.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a side, a lesser known point is that sometimes code-review are required as part of regulation policy the company is
complying with, such as SOC2. This makes code-reviewing changes required, though it doesn't make the insignificant
factors significant all of a sudden, so don't let that get in the way.</p>
<h2 id="removing-obstacles"><a href="#removing-obstacles" aria-label="removing obstacles permalink"></a>Removing obstacles</h2>
<p>As obvious as it may sound, you should be investing as much as you can in automating anything that can be automated in
code-reviews. This includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Code formatting should be done automatically when developing and checked automatically on code-reviews. Not by a
human.</li>
<li>Automatic code linting (and any static analysis applied) should represent most of your style guide. In fact, I would
go further and say that if you can't build an automatic rule to at least warn about a style violation, you shouldn't
bring it up in code-reviews, ever. It's just not worth it. (This lesson I learned from a very smart friend who
enlightened me on this).</li>
<li>Testing, and quality assurance should both ease the pains for contributors, and increase confidence for maintainers.
If they don't - you should either delete or fix them. I've worked on code-bases where the tests would just slow down
the developer, never actually giving valid input. What are they useful besides wasting our time (or making it harder
to contribute)? Adding useful tests improves development speed and confidence, not slow it down. It also lowers the
blast radius, making errors less deadly in production (By allowing less brutal errors to pass through,
unintentionally).</li>
<li>Extending the previous points, I would go further and argue that any non-semantic review comments should be kept to a
minimum, preferably non-existent. Contributors should feel safe contributing, and know that even if they poorly named
their variable, everything is going to be ok, assuming their code still works. This can also be fixed in retrospect
(supporting post-merge workflows), as it has no semantic difference.</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite all the above, it is in my experience that developers find it very hard to let go of old practices. I know I
did. Once you understand the enormous negative side-benefits of focusing on the trivial stuff, you understand they are
waste of time and energy. To all sides.</p>
<p>A question I get asked sometimes is why should you allow bad code practices to slip through to your code, especially if
you're the owner of it, and a contributor is just passing through. My answer is simple.
You want the code review to be effective and focus <strong>only on what's important</strong>. Critical stuff you
might have missed. Everything else is a distraction meant to make the code prettier, but probably not better.</p>
<p>If you have concerns about code style add a linter. Add static rules that prevent adding this bad change. Better yet,
prefer automatic fixing of code style (when possible). Style should be a solved problem,
and I don't care what style it is - as long as I don't have to actively think about it
when contributing (or reviewing).</p>
<p>A thought that I always try to propagate is to treat others (contributors) as a reviewer the same as you would like to
be treated when contributing.</p>
<h2 id="harmful-stuff"><a href="#harmful-stuff" aria-label="harmful stuff permalink"></a>Harmful stuff</h2>
<p>Review comments have a style of their own. A lot has been written on reviewer hostility, and I'd like to assume you
understand how comments should be styled.</p>

The following are benefits I've identified so far.</p><h3 id="heading-it-lessens-the-need-for-a-client-to-process-the-response">It lessens the need for a client to process the response<a href="#heading-it-lessens-the-need-for-a-client-to-process-the-response"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>In most situations, we have a client to request the data from the GraphQL server and transform it into the required format.</p><p>For instance, a website on the client-side can process the data with JavaScript, as to transform fields <code>title</code> and <code>date</code> into a description:</p><pre><code><span><span>const</span> desc <span>=</span> <span><span>`Post </span><span><span>${</span> response<span>.</span>data<span>.</span>title <span>}</span></span><span> was published on </span><span><span>${</span> response<span>.</span>data<span>.</span>date <span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span></span></code></pre><p>However, in some situations we may need to retrieve the data for a service that we do not control, and which does not offer tools to process the results.</p><p>For instance, a newsletter service (such as Mailchimp) may accept to define an endpoint from which to retrieve the data for the newsletter. Whatever data is returned by the endpoint is final; it can't be manipulated before being injected into the newsletter.</p><p>In these situtations, the query could use embeddable fields to manipulate the response into the required format. This could be particularly useful when accessing <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http">GraphQL over HTTP</a>.</p><h3 id="heading-it-can-help-declutter-the-schema">It can help declutter the schema<a href="#heading-it-can-help-declutter-the-schema"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>The use case above could also be satisfied by adding an extra field <code>Post.descriptionForNewsletter</code> to the schema. But this solution clutters the schema, and embeddable fields could be considered a more elegant solution.</p><h3 id="heading-it-improves-the-development-experience">It improves the development experience<a href="#heading-it-improves-the-development-experience"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>Embeddable fields could be compared to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/Js/js_arrow_function.asp">arrow functions</a> in JavaScript, which is syntactic sugar over a feature already available in the language.</p><p>Arrow functions are not really needed, but they provide benefits:</p><ul><li>they shorten the amount of code needed to achieve something</li><li>they simplify the syntax</li></ul><p>As such, the feature becomes a welcome-to-have in the language, producing a better development experience.</p><h3 id="heading-the-if-condition-in-@skip-and-@include-can-become-dynamic">The <code>if</code> condition in <code>@skip</code> and <code>@include</code> can become dynamic<a href="#heading-the-if-condition-in-@skip-and-@include-can-become-dynamic"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>Currently, argument <code>"if"</code> for the <code>@skip</code> and <code>@include</code> directives can only be an actual boolean value (<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>) or a variable with the boolean value. This behavior is pretty static.</p><p>Embeddable fields would enable to make this behavior more dynamic, by evaluating the condition on some property from the object itself.</p><p>There is an issue to address: <code>if</code> is a <code>Boolean</code>, not a <code>String</code>, so to avoid type conflicts the GraphQL syntax may also need to accept the embedded field on its own, not wrapping it between string quotes:</p><pre><code><span><span>query</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  posts <span>{</span></span><br><span>	  id</span><br><span>    title <span>@skip</span><span>(</span><span>if</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><span>{</span> hasComments <span>}</span><span>}</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>  <span>}</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>Removing the need to wrap <code>{{ }}</code> between quotes <code>" "</code> would solve this issue for every scalar type other than <code>String</code>, not just <code>Boolean</code> (check the example below with <code>droid</code>, using embeddable fields to resolve an <code>ID</code>).</p><h3

permalink</span></a></h3><p>Embeddable fields enable to embed a template within the GraphQL query itself, which would render the GraphQL service more configuration-friendly.</p><p>For instance, combined with the <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/174">flat chain syntax</a> and <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/252">nested mutations</a> (two other

      <article role="main">
        <p>This is going to be a painfully cliched, but imagine that the American science and technology system is an engine. It’s just not performing as well as it used to. It’s making a lot of noise and when we push the accelerator it’s sluggish. This bill assumes the solution is STEP ON THE ACCELERATOR HARDER. That is, it wants to slam more money through a system shot through with friction and bad incentives. Slamming on the accelerator when your engine has problems doesn’t often fix the problem. I’ve tried it, and it ended up with my car ‘<a href="https://www.cartalk.com/content/what-does-it-mean-throw-rod#:~:text=The%20motion%20of%20that%20piston,one%20of%20two%20things%20occurs.">throwing a rod</a>.’</p>

<p>Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.), Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Congressman Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), and Congressman Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) introduced “The Endless Frontier Act” a bipartisan bill to spend $100B to super-charge the National Science Foundation at the end of May. You can read an official announcement <a href="https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-schumer-unveil-endless-frontier-act-to-bolster-us-tech-leadership-and-combat-china">here</a> and Noah Smith’s summary on Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-06-01/the-u-s-gets-serious-about-catching-up-to-china-in-r-d">here</a>.</p>

<p>Some thoughts after reading through the actual text of the bill. (My eyes will bleed so yours don’t need to.)</p>

<p>This bill is proposing to give money with risk-averse restrictions to a risk-averse organization (the NSF) to be dispersed among other risk-averse organizations (Universities) into a system with increasingly risk-averse incentives.  Note that I’m not saying “it’s all fubar’d lets burn it to the ground!” but I am suggesting that instead of slamming on the accelerator, we should be asking “what would a tune-up and an oil change look like instead? “</p>

<h3 id="the-bill">The Bill</h3>
<p>The bill comes back to its  <code>Key Technology Focus Areas</code> throughout the document:</p>

<p>(i) artificial intelligence and machine learning;
(ii) high performance computing, semiconductors, and advanced computer hardware
(iii) quantum computing and information systems
(iv) robotics, automation, and advanced manufacturing
(v) natural or anthropogenic disaster prevention
(vi) advanced communications technology
(vii) biotechnology, genomics, and synthetic biology
(viii) cybersecurity, data storage, and data management technologies;
(ix) advanced energy
(x) materials science, engineering, and exploration relevant to the other key technology focus areas described in this subparagraph.</p>

<p>That list is pretty uncontroversial.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> And that should raise a flag. In other words, this is a list of “what are the top 10 hot technologies right now?” What if there is suddenly a huge opportunity in airship technology? Or underground construction? Or wormholes? It wouldn’t be too much of a problem but this list can only be changed <em>every four years</em>.  You could make the argument that these definitions are so broad that anything could fit in them - ok, then what’s the point of having the list in the first place?</p>

<p>The bill is heavy on bureaucratic requirements and light on science or organizational structure (“we’ll figure that out later.”)  Which reports need to be given to whom and when, how money can and can’t be spent, etc. I agree that this is the job of lawmakers, but it doesn’t feel like opening up an endless frontier, it feels like “here are the walls of your sandbox.”</p>

<p>We are very clear that the grant awards are going to happen on a competitive basis. The bill is shot through with the term <code>award grants, on a competitive basis</code> . This is code for “to get this money, amazing scientist, are going to need to spend a good chunk of your life writing grants” and interacting with websites that look like <a href="https://www.research.gov/research-web/">this.</a> or <a href="https://www.grants.gov/">this</a>.  Competition is good <em>when the output is valuable no matter who wins.</em> Failed grants are basically worthless except as the basis for other grant applications. Economist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=XwBP_pqkGJA">Mike Munger does a great job explaining how grants can often end up burning more value than they create</a>.  Months of grant writing is one of the things that makes people think twice about academia.</p>

<p>The bill specifies exactly what the money can be used for <code>may be used for the purchase of equipment, the support of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and the salaries of staff. </code> Like the key areas, this sounds eminently reasonable. However, it means that grant money, unlike normal money, is not fully fungible. You need to track all of it and where it goes in case you are audited. It also means that if the project runs into an expense that doesn’t fall into one of these buckets - say you need a specialized service from a company to do an experiment - you’re stuck. Chilling effects are hard to measure, but my research experience has been shot through with being forced to pay more for an inferior product through a web portal that made your eyes bleed because we had to prioritize “approved vendors” for accounting reasons tied to restrictions like these.</p>

<p>I don’t think it matters for this discussion but <code>$20B/year</code> is misleading - the actual bill specifies that the $100B will be backloaded: $2B in 2021, $8B in 2022, $20B in 2023, and $35B in 2024 and 2025.</p>

<h3 id="nstf">NS(T?)F</h3>
<p><code>“I share your feeling about this point,” I said with the fervor of conviction, “but then why not do something about the retardation of scientific progress?”</code></p>

<p><code>“That I would very much like to do,” Mark Gable said, “but how do I go about it?”</code></p>

<p><code>“Well,” I said, “I think that shouldn’t be very difficult. As a matter of fact, I think it would be quite easy. You could set up a foundation, with an annual endowment of thirty million dollars. Research workers in need of funds could apply for grants, if they could make out a convincing case. Have ten committees, each composed of twelve scientists, appointed to pass on these applications. Take the most active scientists out of the laboratory and make them members of these committees. And the very best men in the field should be appointed as chairmen at salaries of fifty thousand dollars each. Also have about twenty prizes of one hundred thousand dollars each for the best scientific papers of the year. This is just about all you would have to do. Your lawyers could easily prepare a charter for the foundation. As a matter of fact, any of the National Science Foundation bills which were introduced in the Seventy-ninth and Eightieth Congresses could perfectly well serve as a model.”</code></p>

<p><code>“I think you had better explain to Mr. Gable why this foundation would in fact retard the progress of science,” said a bespectacled young man sitting at the far end of the table, whose name I didn’t get at the time of introduction. It should be obvious,” I said. “First of all, the best scientists would be removed from their laboratories and kept busy on committees passing on applications for funds. Secondly, the scientific workers in need of funds would concentrate on problems which were considered promising and were pretty certain to lead to publishable results. For a few years there might be a great increase in scientific output; but by going after the obvious, pretty soon science would dry out. Science would become something like a parlor game. Some things would be considered interesting, others not. There would be fashions. Those who followed the fashion would get grants. Those who wouldn’t would not, and pretty soon they would learn to follow the fashion, too.”</code>
From <a href="https://judgestarling.tumblr.com/post/619829573132107776/a-short-story-by-martian-physicist-le%C3%B3-szil%C3%A1rd">The Marla Gable Foundation</a> by Nobel Prize winning Physicist Leo Szilard, published in 1948.</p>

<p>The core idea of the bill is to increase the National Science Foundation’s funding and expand its mandate to include technology development as well as science.</p>

<p>Roughly, the National Science Foundation - NSF (and the NIH) decide what to work on by getting some of the ‘top people’ in a field together in a room and asking them “what programs should we pursue?” This process depends first on being able to identify the top people in a field and convincing them to stay in a shitty hotel in Washington. So the agenda is being set by ‘the top people in a field who are willing to come to Washington and stay in a shitty hotel.’ Additionally, who entails the ‘top people’ is up to the program officers and since professors have long term relationships with their NSF program officers, chances are that the professors who have put the work into those relationships are going to be the most salient.</p>

<p>All the incentives are set up so people probably push for their lines of research. Even if they are being completely intellectually honest, researchers probably think that their area of research is the most important thing to fund. If they are slightly less intellectually honest, they realize that they’re more likely to be funded if their priorities line up with the NSF’s.</p>

<p>The process is inherently conservative because if you’re consulting the top people in a field on what to fund, the chances they’ll suggest the weird new thing are low.</p>

<h4 id="but-will-be-like-darpa">But will be like DARPA!</h4>

<p>DARPA has a great track record of enabling paradigm shifting technology - it had its fingers in the creation of personal computing, the internet, modern robotics, gps, and autonomous cars, to name a few. Riffing on DARPA’s model to emulate its success is a worthy goal. However, there is only one section in the entire bill that gives a head nod to the DARPA model:</p>

<p><code>The Director shall have the authority to carry out a program of personnel management authority for the Directorate in the same manner, and subject to the same requirements, as the program of personnel management authority authorized for the Director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under section 1599h of title 10, United States Code, for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.</code>
<code>(B) PROGRAM MANAGERS.—The employees of the Directorate may include program managers for the key technology focus areas, who shall perform a role similar to programs managers employed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency for the oversight and selection of programs supported by the Directorate. </code></p>

<p>DARPA’s program managers work because they are embedded in an organizational structure and culture that is tuned to empower them to explore high-risk opportunities. DARPA has ~125 staff and three layers of hierarchy while the NSF …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

After 10 months of effort within the open-source community, Chaos Mesh is now ready in terms of functionality, scalability, and ease of use. Here are some highlights.</p><h2>Powerful chaos support</h2><p><a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Mesh</a> originated in the testing framework of <a href="https://pingcap.com/products/tidb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TiDB</a>, a distributed database, so it takes into account the possible faults of a distributed system. Chaos Mesh provides comprehensive and fine-grained fault types, covering the Pod, the network, system I/O, and the kernel. Chaos experiments are defined in YAML, which is fast and easy to use.</p><p>Chaos Mesh 1.0 supports the following fault types:</p><ul><li>clock-skew: Simulates clock skew</li><li>container-kill: Simulates the container being killed</li><li>cpu-burn: Simulates CPU pressure</li><li>io-attribution-override: Simulates file exceptions</li><li>io-fault: Simulates file system I/O errors</li><li>io-latency: Simulates file system I/O latency</li><li>kernel-injection: Simulates kernel failures</li><li>memory-burn: Simulates memory pressure</li><li>network-corrupt: Simulates network packet corruption</li><li>network-duplication: Simulates network packet duplication</li><li>network-latency: Simulate network latency</li><li>network-loss: Simulates network loss</li><li>network-partition: Simulates network partition</li><li>pod-failure: Simulates continuous unavailability of Kubernetes Pods</li><li>pod-kill: Simulates the Kubernetes Pod being killed</li></ul><h2>Visual chaos orchestration</h2><p>The Chaos Dashboard component is a one-stop web interface for Chaos Mesh users to orchestrate chaos experiments. Previously, Chaos Dashboard was only available for testing TiDB. With Chaos Mesh 1.0, it is available to everyone. Chaos Dashboard greatly simplifies the complexity of chaos experiments. With only a few mouse clicks, you can define the scope of the chaos experiment, specify the type of chaos injection, define scheduling rules, and observe the results of the chaos experiment—all in the same web interface.</p><p><img alt="Chaos Dashboard" src="https://chaos-mesh.org/assets/images/chaos-dashboard-0a1e48c54968d276f174801a1364ce21.gif"></p><h2>Grafana plug-in for enhanced observability</h2><p>To further improve the observability of chaos experiments, Chaos Mesh 1.0 includes a Grafana plug-in to allow you to directly display real-time chaos experiment information on your application monitoring panel. Currently, the chaos experiment information is displayed as annotations. This way, you can simultaneously observe the running status of the application and the current chaos experiment information.</p><p><img alt="Chaos status and application status on Grafana" src="https://chaos-mesh.org/assets/images/chaos-status-460b054f3e2ee0898d2236a5137bc30e.png"></p><h2>Safe and controllable chaos</h2><p>When we conduct chaos experiments, it is vital that we keep strict control over the chaos scope or “blast radius.” Chaos Mesh 1.0 not only provides a wealth of selectors to accurately control the scope of the experiment, but it also enables you to set protected Namespaces to protect important applications. You can also use Namespace permissions to limit the scope of Chaos Mesh to a specific Namespace. Together, these features make chaos experiments with Chaos Mesh safe and controllable.</p><h2>Try it out now</h2><p>You can quickly deploy Chaos Mesh in your Kubernetes environment through the <code>install.sh</code> script or the Helm tool. For specific installation steps, please refer to the <a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/docs/installation/installation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Mesh Getting Started</a> document. In addition, thanks to the <a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/interactiveTutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Katakoda interactive tutorial</a>, you can also quickly get your hands on Chaos Mesh without having to deploy it.</p><p>If you haven’t upgraded to 1.0 GA, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/releases/tag/v1.0.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.0 Release Notes</a> for the changes and upgrade guidelines.</p><h2>Thanks</h2><p>Thanks to all our Chaos Mesh <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/graphs/contributors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contributors</a>!</p><p>If you are interested in Chaos Mesh, you’re welcome to join us by submitting issues, or contributing code, documentation, or articles. We look forward to your participation and feedback!</p></section></div>]]>

<p>However when talking about async iteration syntax in Rust one question has
come up repeatedly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Should async iteration be parallel or sequential by default?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this post I'd like to cover the challenges I see with parallel async
iteration, and make the case for, spoilers, defaulting to sequential
iteration semantics.</p>
<hr>
<p>However before we continue, the usual disclaimers: <strong>I'm not on the lang
team. I do not hold any direct decision making power about the Rust language.
I am a member of the Async Foundations WG, but I do not speak for anyone on
the team other than myself.</strong> This post is from my perspective only.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-space">The problem space</h2>
<p>So the core question we're trying to answer is: "should async iteration
default to sequential or parallel?" Putting this into code, it's a question
of what some hypothetical future "async iteration" syntax should compile down
to, and which semantics are provided:</p>
<pre><span>// This code...
</span><span>for</span><span> event.await in channel {
    dbg!(event);
}

</span><span>// ... should it lower into this? (sequential)
</span><span>while let </span><span>Some(event) = channel.</span><span>next</span><span>().await {
    dbg!(event);
}

</span><span>// ... or should it lower into this? (parallel)
</span><span>channel.</span><span>into_par_stream</span><span>().</span><span>for_each</span><span>(async |event| dbg!(event));
</span></pre>
<p>The "lowering" we're describing here is not the <em>precise</em> code we'd expect
the compiler to output. But hopefully it gets the point across. In the
"sequential" case we'd expect async iteration loops to behave much the same
as async <code>while let Some()</code> loops do today. And in the parallel case, we'd
expect something to work with semantics similar to those of
<a href="https://docs.rs/parallel-stream/2.1.1/parallel_stream/">parallel-stream</a>.</p>
<p>The main argument I've heard in favor of parallel async iteration semantics
is that in most cases it's what people want anyway. For example take the
following code:</p>
<pre><span>use </span><span>async_std::io;
</span><span>use </span><span>async_std::net::TcpListener;
</span><span>use </span><span>async_std::prelude::*;

</span><span>let</span><span> listener = TcpListener::bind("</span><span>127.0.0.1:8080</span><span>").await?;

</span><span>for</span><span> stream.await? in listener.</span><span>incoming</span><span>() {
    io::copy(&amp;stream, &amp;stream).await?;
}
</span></pre>
<p>Under sequential iteration semantics this loop would process at most 1 TCP
connection at the time, irregardless of system resources available. But under
parallel iteration semantics, this will have access to all resources
available. The idea is that parallel iteration semantics provide a language
level solution to this problem.</p>
<h2 id="control-flow-operators">Control flow operators</h2>
<p>The first issue that arises with parallel async iteration is that the <code>break</code>
and <code>continue</code> control flow operators will have different semantics, or need
to be disallowed altogether. Take the following code:</p>
<pre><span>use </span><span>async_std::io;
</span><span>use </span><span>async_std::net::TcpListener;
</span><span>use </span><span>async_std::prelude::*;

</span><span>let</span><span> listener = TcpListener::bind("</span><span>127.0.0.1:8080</span><span>").await?;

</span><span>// Let's pretend this is valid syntax..
</span><span>for </span><span>(i, stream?).await in listener.</span><span>incoming</span><span>().</span><span>enumerate</span><span>() {
    </span><span>if</span><span> i === </span><span>1000 </span><span>{
        </span><span>break</span><span>;
    }
    io::copy(&amp;stream, &amp;stream).await?;
}
</span></pre>
<p>Say we have a few dozen parallel requests open when we hit <code>break</code>. We should
probably stop accepting new requests. What should happen to the still open
connections?</p>
<p>There is no right answer. We may want to drop them. We may want to keep them
running. More likely the desired behavior may depend on what you're doing.
But the semantics will <em>always</em> be different than in regular for loops
<em>because</em> of parallelism.</p>
<p>Adding new semantics to a well-established concept is tricky, and may
actually lead to subtle translation issues when converting existing
algorithms to async Rust. The safest option will be to disallow these
keywords in this context altogether.</p>
<h2 id="consistency-with-non-async-rust">Consistency with non-async Rust</h2>
<p>We may want to think of "parallel iteration semantics" as something unique to
async Rust, but in fact non-async Rust faces very similar challenges. To
give a very literal example, the TCP example we used earlier would not be
parallelized in non-async Rust as well:</p>
<pre><span>use </span><span>std::io;
</span><span>use </span><span>std::net::TcpListener;

</span><span>let</span><span> listener = TcpListener::bind("</span><span>127.0.0.1:8080</span><span>").await?;

</span><span>for</span><span> stream in listener.</span><span>incoming</span><span>() {
    </span><span>let</span><span> stream = stream?;
    </span><span>let </span><span>(reader, writer) = &amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>(&amp;stream, &amp;stream);
    io::copy(reader, writer)?;
}
</span></pre>
<p>Networking in non-async Rust is not the best match, but for example a data
processing pipeline would be. And if we forget to parallelize at the right
points there, we'll face very similar issues.</p>
<p>The point being: I don't think "parallelism" is a problem unique to async
Rust. And because of that I don't think we should look for a solution that's
specific to async Rust, but instead look for a solution that can be applied
across domains. I think <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2930">RFC
2930 (<code>buf_read</code>)</a> is a great example of an
issue that was found in async Rust, but was determined to apply to non-async
Rust as well, and for which a solution was found that can be applied to both
domains.</p>
<h2 id="how-would-tasks-be-spawned">How would tasks be spawned?</h2>
<p>In order for tasks to be parallelized, they would need to be spawned on a
thread pool somehow. Which means a crucial step in enabling parallel
iteration at the language level is to have a notion of an executor as part of
the language.</p>
<p>C++ is <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0761r2.pdf">in the process of
adding</a>
to the language (estimate is C++23), so it's not unthinkable for Rust to do
the same. In fact Boats <a href="https://without.boats/blog/global-executors/">has written about adding a <code>#[global_executor]</code>
before</a>.</p>
<pre><span>// The lowered code from the previous example...
</span><span>channel.</span><span>into_par_stream</span><span>().</span><span>for_each</span><span>(async |event| dbg!(event));

</span><span>// ... would in turn lower into this
</span><span>while let </span><span>Some(event) = channel.</span><span>next</span><span>() {
    task::spawn(async </span><span>move </span><span>{
        dbg!(event);
    });
}
</span></pre>
<p>As you can see we're calling <code>task::spawn</code> for each event. That functionality
would need to come from somewhere, and because async iteration is a language
level concern this would mean that functionality would need to become part of
the language.</p>
<p>I think having a way to perform parallel iteration at the language level is a
<em>great</em> idea. And having a <code>#[global_executor]</code> hook with a default
implementation would solve a lot of issues the ecosystem currently has.</p>
<p>But if history is any indicator this would all take quite a while to shake
out. And I think making async iteration syntax depend on this landing (even
if unstable) would mean it might take a lot longer.</p>
<h2 id="parallelizing-send-streams">Parallelizing !Send streams</h2>
<p>Not all streams are <code>Send</code>, and async iteration should be able to work with
this as well. We can't <em>quite</em> propagate <code>!Send</code> the way we do for async
blocks; the global executor would need to support spawning <code>!Send</code> futures as
well. This is not a major hurdle as for example async-stc provides
<a href="https://docs.rs/async-std/1.6.3/async_std/task/fn.spawn_local.html"><code>spawn_local</code></a>
function. But it's part of the design space to consider.</p>
<h2 id="backpressure-concurency-control">Backpressure &amp; concurency control</h2>
<p>For all its warts something that Node.js streams got right was
<em>backpressure</em>. If for example writing to a file is slower than reading from
a file, the pipeline won't keep reading data if the writer isn't available.
This ensures your RAM doesn't fill up with bytes that are waiting to be written.</p>
<pre><span>const </span><span>fs = </span><span>require</span><span>('</span><span>fs</span><span>');

</span><span>const </span><span>reader </span><span>= fs.</span><span>createReadStream</span><span>('</span><span>file.txt</span><span>');
</span><span>const </span><span>compress </span><span>= zlib.</span><span>createGzip</span><span>();
</span><span>const </span><span>writer </span><span>= fs.</span><span>createWriteStream</span><span>('</span><span>file.txt.gz</span><span>');

</span><span>reader</span><span>.</span><span>pipe</span><span>(</span><span>compress</span><span>).</span><span>pipe</span><span>(</span><span>writer</span><span>);
</span></pre>
<p>In Rust sequential async iteration applies backpressure by default. A
translation of the above Node.js code would be somewhat like this:</p>
<pre><span>let</span><span> reader = fs::open("</span><span>file.txt</span><span>").await?;
</span><span>let</span><span> writer = fs::open("</span><span>file.txt.gz</span><span>").await?;

</span><span>for</span><span> buf in GzipEncoder::new(reader) {
    writer.</span><span>write</span><span>(buf).await?;
}
</span></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.rs/async-compression/0.3.5/async_compression/stream/struct.GzipEncoder.html#impl-Stream"><code>async-compression</code>'s <code>Stream</code>
types</a>
already work somewhat like this. Because we're performing sequential async
iteration here, reading data from the stream is constrained by the speed at
which we can write. But also vice-versa: the stream is paused if no new data
is available to be read.</p>
<p>If async iteration syntax was parallel by default we would lose backpressure
by default. Which means if no constraints are specified, <strong>by default
parallel async iteration will keep reading data even if there is no consumer
ready to process the data</strong>. Instead limits will always need to be manually
set:</p>
<pre><span>for</span><span> buf in GzipEncoder::new(reader).</span><span>limit</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>) {
    writer.</span><span>write</span><span>(buf).await?;
}
</span></pre>
<p>There is a third solution to backpressure we haven't discussed yet: set
<em>some</em> limit by default. Instead of async iteration having unbounded
parallelism by default, we could say, enable <code>1000</code> items by default. This
limit will however almost always be wrong, and really should be set with
knowledge of the workload.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>name</th><th>max throughput</th><th>backpressure?</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>sequential</td><td>1</td><td>yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>bounded</td><td>n</td><td>yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>unbounded</td><td>unlimited</td><td>no</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h2 id="how-common-is-parallel-iteration">How common is parallel iteration?</h2>
<p>A large part of the argument in favor of parallel semantics by default for
async iteration is that it is the most commonly desired semantics. Perhaps
that may be true today within certain domains; but how true do we expect that
to be in the future for across all domains async Rust will cover?</p>
<p>If we want to get a sense of where async Rust might be headed we can take a
look at Node.js streams: they've been around for a decade longer than Rust
streams have. A common kind of stream in the Node.js ecosystem is the
<a href="https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_transform">transform
stream</a>: a
stream that takes an input stream and produces an output stream. Take for
example the <a href="https://github.com/mafintosh/csv-parser">csv-parser package</a>: it
takes a stream of CSV text, and produces an output stream of parsed elements:</p>
<pre><span>NAME,AGE
Daffy Duck,24
Bugs Bunny,22
</span></pre><pre><span>const </span><span>csv </span><span>= </span><span>require</span><span>('</span><span>csv-parser</span><span>')
</span><span>const </span><span>fs = </span><span>require</span><span>('</span><span>fs</span><span>')
</span><span>const </span><span>results </span><span>= [];

fs.</span><span>createReadStream</span><span>('</span><span>data.csv</span><span>')
  .</span><span>pipe</span><span>(</span><span>csv</span><span>())
  .</span><span>on</span><span>('</span><span>data</span><span>', (data) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>results</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>))
  .</span><span>on</span><span>('</span><span>end</span><span>', () </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>{

through the direct equivalent of a fine Convolutional network example in Keras.
</p>

<p>
Good News: <a href="https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond">Deep Diamond</a>() preview release is in Clojars, and is already quite useful! And fast!
It is yet to be fully polished, but you can try it now and, I hope, you'll like it.
</p>

<p>
It now covers the functionality that is being explained from scratch in the <a href="http://aiprobook.com/">books that I'm writing</a>.
Convolutions work, too; at the speed of Road Runner!
</p>

<p>
In accordance with my philosophy, "less talk, more walk", I introduce Deep Diamond

The blueprint is a Clojure function that can instantiate the network
object that holds the parameter tensors that the network should learn by using
one of the built-in optimization algorithms. In this case, I'll use adaptive moments,
<code>:adam</code>. Xavier initialization is, again, a plain function that initializes
the network with appropriate weights.

The original MNIST data is distributed through four binary files that
you can download <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">here</a>. To demonstrate how nice Clojure is, I'm not
using any special MNIST-specific code that is magically imported
from the framework's model Zoo. The complete code, from scratch, is at the
end of the article (I'm just pushing it there so it doesn't steal the spotlight :).

<p>
The network learns in mini-batches of 128 images of the total of 60000,
with adaptive moments, through 12 full epochs. That makes 5625 forward/backward
update cycles.
</p>

<p>
The total time for that on my old 2013. i7-4790k CPU is: <b>368</b> seconds.
<b>6 minutes for 6000 cycles. A thousand cycles per minute.</b>
</p>

<p>
Isn't that a lot? You should try and run this in Keras with TensorFlow, and
see that we got a pretty nice performance! (I'll publish some comparisons soon,
and in the meantime you can try for yourself!).

September 26, 2020 | https://paedubucher.ch/articles/2020-09-26-arch-linux-setup-with-disk-encryption.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://paedubucher.ch/articles/2020-09-26-arch-linux-setup-with-disk-encryption.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been using Arch Linux since 2016. I got to understand the system better
since then, and installing Arch nowadays is rather a strain on my fingers than
on my brain. I automated my personal setup procedure to some extent with a
couple of shell scripts, which I'm adjusting as time goes and hardware changes.
I collect those scripts and setup instructions in a <a href="https://github.com/patrickbucher/docs/tree/master/arch-setup">GitHub
repo</a>.</p>
<p>Even though I've often taken my laptop with me, especially for
university, I never made the effort to encrypt my disk or a single partition
thereon. Sensitive data, such as passwords, are stored encrypted using GPG. And
my GPG private key is protected with a strong passphrase; so strong, that I
mistype it once in a while.</p>
<p>Having stored SSH keys on my laptop, however, is a risk in terms of data
protection. I do not protect most of my SSH keys with passwords. (<em>Not</em> having
to use passwords is one of the conveniences SSH gives you, after all.) But some
of those SSH keys are gateways to quite some important data, and therefore I
need to re-consider my security practices.</p>
<p>Protecting SSH keys with a passphrase is very inconvenient, especially if you do
a lot of <code>git push</code> operations via SSH. It's possible to use a password
protected SSH key for <code>git</code> only, but having to deal with multiple SSH keys is
inconvenient, too. (My rule is to use one SSH key per client machine.) So
encrypting the hard disk or at least some partitions of it might be the better
solution, because it only requires me to enter an additional password once
during startup, which is once or twice a day.</p>

<p>The Arch wiki provides an article on <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system">how to encrypt an entire
system</a>.
Such a setup is based on LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup), a disk encryption
specification, and dm-crypt, the Linux kernel's device mapper for encrypted
devices.</p>
<p>The wiki mentions different
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#Overview">scenarios</a>
for disk encryption. The first option, <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#LUKS_on_a_partition">LUKS on a
partition</a>,
is very simple, but not ideal for me, because I'm not just using one giant root
partition, but separate partitions for <code>/var</code>, <code>/tmp</code> and <code>/home</code>. With this
setup, a process filling up my <code>/var/log</code> directory won't prevent me from
writing to <code>/home</code> or the root partition, which might be necessary to deal with
the issue.</p>
<p>One could argue that it's sufficient to just encrypt the <code>/home</code> partition,
which contains the most sensitive data, after all. However, it's possible that
some program logs sensitive data to <code>/var/log</code> or stores it under <code>/opt</code>, so
that an encrypted <code>/home</code> partition won't prevent sensitive data from being
leaked. An unencrypted root partition also makes it possible to tamper
programs, so that data is leaked later.</p>
<p>It's also possible to encrypt the partitions mentioned seperately, which would
require me to enter my password upon booting for every single partition. This is
highly impractical, and therefore I won't do it that way.</p>
<p>The second option, <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#LVM_on_LUKS">LVM on
LUKS</a>,
is a better fit for my purpose. Here, LUKS provides one single block device, on
top of which the encrypted partitions are created. The other, arguably more
sophisticated scenarios, are mostly useful when dealing with multiple disks, or
if an encrypted boot partition is required. So let's stick to scenario two: LVM
on LUKS.</p>

<p>My Lenovo Thinkpad X1 has a SSD with roughly 475 GB and 16 GB memory. This is
important when considering partition sizes. I usually create my partitions as
follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>A 256 MB <code>/boot</code> partition for the bootloader (FAT 32).</li>
<li>A 16 GB (the size of my memory) swap partition.</li>
<li>A 128 GB <code>/</code> (root) partition (ext4).</li>
<li>A 64 GB <code>/var</code> partition (ext4).</li>
<li>A 8 GB <code>/tmp</code> partition (ext4).</li>
<li>And a <code>/home</code> partition with the remainder of the space, i.e. roughly 260 GB
   in my case (ext4).</li>
</ol>
<p>The choice of partition sizes is subject to debate. Some prefer to have a swap
partition with twice the size of the physical memory. Some prefer to make the
root, <code>/var/</code>, and <code>/tmp</code> partitions smaller or bigger. But the above
partitioning scheme was never the cause of any trouble for me, so far.</p>
<p>With those decisions taken, let's proceed to the setup.</p>

<p>So let's go through the setup step by step.</p>
<h2>Prepare the Installation Medium</h2>
<p>First, I download the latest Arch amd64 image via BitTorrent <a href="magnet:?xt=urn:btih:db56a13a6555179990837759ca27274d0be49aca&amp;dn=archlinux-2020.09.01-x86_64.iso">Magnet
link</a>
from the <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/download/">download</a> page and verify its
checksum against the one on the website:</p>
<pre><code>$ sha1sum archlinux-2020.09.01-x86_64.iso
95ebacd83098b190e8f30cc28d8c57af0d0088a0
</code></pre>
<p>Then I copy the image on a USB dongle with a capacity of at least 700 MB:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo dd if=archlinux-2020.09.01-x86_64.iso of=/dev/sda bs=4M
$ sync
</code></pre>
<p>Then I unplug my USB dongle and plug it into the Thinkpad X1 I'd like to setup,
and boot from it (UEFI boot). Once the installation environment is loaded, let's
continue with the setup.</p>
<p>My Thinkpad X1 has a US keyboard, which I <a href="https://paedubucher.ch/articles/2020-09-16-compose-key-on-x.html">prefer to
use</a> nowadays.
However, it's possible to change the keyboard layout as follows (for Swiss
German), if wanted:</p>
<pre><code># loadkeys de_CH-latin1
</code></pre>
<p>Next, I establish a WiFi connection with <code>frzbxpdb5</code> being my network SSID, 
<code>wlan0</code> being my WiFi device, and <code>[topsecret]</code> being my password:</p>
<pre><code># iwctl --passphrase '[topsecret]' station wlan0 connect frzbxpdb5
</code></pre>
<p>Let's continue with the partitioning of the disk.</p>
<h2>Partitioning</h2>
<p>In order to partition the hard disk, one first needs to know the device name,
which can be found using <code>lsblk</code>:</p>
<pre><code># lsblk
</code></pre>
<p>This lists <code>sda</code>, the USB dongle, and <code>nvme0n1</code>, the 475 GB solid state drive
aforementioned.</p>
<h3>Filling the Disk with Junk Data</h3>
<p>As a first step, the disk shall be overwritten with random data.  Even though I
haven't used this laptop productively yet, and so there's no sensitive data
stored on it, it is still a good practice to fill it up once with random data.
This makes it harder for an attacker to distinguish between encrypted data and
random junk.</p>
<pre><code># shred --random-source=/dev/urandom --iterations=1 /dev/nvme0n1
</code></pre>
<p>In my case, using only one single iteration is sufficient. If there was actual
data stored on the disk, multiple iterations should be considered.</p>
<h3>Creating a Boot Partition</h3>
<p>Next, I create a new GPT partition scheme on that disk:</p>
<pre><code># parted -s /dev/nvme0n1 mklabel gpt
</code></pre>
<p>I'm not going to encrypt my boot partition, so I create it as I do for a regular
setup without encryption (as a FAT 32 boot partition, that is):</p>
<pre><code># parted -s /dev/nvme0n1 mkpart boot fat32 1MiB 257MiB
# parted -s /dev/nvme0n1 set 1 esp on
# mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/nvme0n1p1
</code></pre>
<p>I leave a gap of 1 MB at the beginning, so no matter what block size my SSD
uses, the boot partition will always be properly aligned. The <code>esp</code> flag
identifies the partition as a UEFI system partition.</p>
<h3>Creating a Partition for Encryption</h3>
<p>Now comes the crucial part. All the encrypted data is put into a single big
partition (<code>nvmen1p2</code>), taking up all of the remaining disk space, which is then
partitioned using a volume manager:</p>
<pre><code># parted -s /dev/nvme0n1 mkpart cryptlvm 257MiB '100%'
</code></pre>
<p>The encryption is set up on this partition:</p>
<pre><code># cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/nvme0n1p2
</code></pre>
<p>Enter "YES" if asked for confirmation, and pick a strong passphrase to be
entered twice. (At this point, remember exactly which keyboard layout you're
on!).</p>
<p>To further work with the encrypted partition, let's open it, which requires to
enter the password chosen before:</p>
<pre><code># cryptsestup open /dev/nvme0n1p2 cryptlvm
</code></pre>
<p>Now a physical volume for the volume mapping needs to be created:</p>
<pre><code># pvcreate /dev/mapper/cryptlvm
</code></pre>
<p>The partitions are going to be managed in a volume group, which I simply call
<code>volgrp</code> for the sake of brevity:</p>
<pre><code># vgcreate volgrp /dev/mapper/cryptlvm
</code></pre>
<p>Now everything is set up to create the remaining, i.e. the encrypted partitions.</p>
<h3>Creating the Remaining Partitions</h3>
<p>Those are created using <code>lvcreate</code> by setting a size (<code>-L</code>/<code>-l</code> parameter) and a
name (<code>-n</code> parameter):</p>
<pre><code># lvcreate -L 16G volgrp -n swap
# lvcreate -L 128G volgrp -n root
# lvcreate -L 64G volgrp -n var
# lvcreate -L 8G volgrp -n tmp
# lvcreate -l '100%FREE' volgrp -n home
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: As the user <em>fra-san</em> <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/611421/arch-linux-setup-with-encryption-lvm-on-luks">pointed
out</a>
in a comment on StackExchange, leaving some space open rather than using <code>-l
'100%FREE'</code> for the <code>/home</code> partition is useful when partition sizes should be
increased later.  Shrinking partitions requires to unmount them, whereas growing
them can happen with the affected partition still being mounted. (Check out
<code>lvresize</code> for details.)</p>
<p>The partitions are going to be formatted using the <code>swap</code> and <code>ext4</code> format,
respectively:</p>
<pre><code># mkswap /dev/volgrp/swap
# mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/volgrp/root
# mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/volgrp/var
# mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/volgrp/tmp
# mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/volgrp/home
</code></pre>
<p>For the actual setup, those partitions (and the <code>/boot</code> partition created
before) need to be mounted to <code>/mnt</code>:</p>
<pre><code># mount /dev/volgrp/root /mnt

# mkdir /mnt/boot
# mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/boot

# swapon /dev/volgrp/swap

# mkdir /mnt/var
# mount /dev/volgrp/var /mnt/var

# mkdir /mnt/tmp
# mount /dev/volgrp/tmp /mnt/tmp

# mkdir /mnt/home
# mount /dev/volgrp/home /mnt/home
</code></pre>
<p>Now the partitions are ready for a regular bootstrap installation. (Setting up
the boot loader will require some more specific instructions to disk encryption
later on.)</p>
<h2>Bootstrap Installation</h2>
<p>Now let's install the base system, together with the <code>lvm2</code> package:</p>
<pre><code># pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware lvm2
</code></pre>
<p>In order to get the mounting done automatically upon restart, let's save it in
the <code>fstab</code> file:</p>
<pre><code># genfstab -U /mnt &gt;&gt; /mnt/etc/fstab
</code></pre>
<p>When this is done, let's switch into the installed environment:</p>
<pre><code># arch-chroot /mnt
</code></pre>
<p>A password needs to be set for the <code>root</code> user:</p>
<pre><code># passwd
</code></pre>
<p>In order to have a WiFi connection after rebooting, let's install a couple of
networking packages (some of those specific to my Intel hardware):</p>
<pre><code># pacman -S iw wpa_supplicant dialog intel-ucode netctl dhcpcd
</code></pre>
<p>I set the time zone to Zurich (Europe), update and save the system time:</p>
<pre><code># ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Zurich /etc/localtime
# timedatectl set-ntp true
# hwclock --systohc
</code></pre>
<p>For language and locale, I simply use <code>en_US.UTF-8</code> and <code>en_US-UTF-8 UTF-8</code>,
respectively:</p>
<pre><code># echo 'en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8' &gt;&gt; /etc/locale.gen
# locale-gen
# echo 'LANG=en_US.UTF-8' &gt; /etc/locale.conf
</code></pre>
<p>Due to the lack of imagination, I call my laptop simply <em>carbon</em>:</p>
<pre><code># echo carbon &gt; …</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Soumyabrata Roy/NurPhoto via AP</p></div><div data-component="BodyComponentRenderer"><p><span data-component="TextBlock"></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>CORK, Ireland â€” Facebook has threatened to pack up its toys and go home if European regulators donâ€™t back down and let the social network get its own way.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>In a court filing in Dublin, Facebook said that a decision by Irelandâ€™s Data Protection Commission (DPC) would force the company to pull up stakes and leave the 410 million people who use Facebook and photo-sharing service Instagram in the lurch.</p>
</span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>If the decision is upheld, â€œit is not clear to [Facebook] how, in those circumstances, it could continue to provide the Facebook and Instagram services in the EU,â€� Yvonne Cunnane, who is Facebook Irelandâ€™s head of data protection and associate general counsel, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/yngcdv99irbm5sr/Facebook%20DPC%20filing%20Sept%202020-rotated.pdf?dl=0">wrote in a sworn affidavit</a>.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The decision Facebookâ€™s referring to is <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/v7gkgy/europe-ordered-facebook-to-stop-sending-user-data-to-the-united-states">a preliminary order handed down last month</a> to stop the transfer of data about European customers to servers in the U.S., over concerns about U.S. government surveillance of the data.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Facebook hit back by filing a lawsuit challenging the Irish DPCâ€™s ban, and in a sworn affidavit filed this week, the company leveled some very serious accusations about the Irish data-protection commissioner, including a lack of fairness and apparent bias in singling out Facebook.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Cunnane points out that Facebook was given only three weeks to respond to the decision, a period that is â€œmanifestly inadequate,â€� adding that Facebook wasnâ€™t contacted about the inquiry prior to judgment being handed down.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>She also raises concerns about the decision being made â€œsolelyâ€� by Helen Dixon, Irelandâ€™s data protection commissioner.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>â€œThe fact one person is responsible for the entire process is relevant to [Facebookâ€™s] concerns, in respect of the inadequacy of the investigative process engaged in and independence of the ultimate decision-making process,â€� Cunnane wrote.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Cunnane also complains that Facebook is being singled out, noting no other big tech company using similar methods to transfer data to the U.S. from the EU is under the same scrutiny.</p>
</span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>â€œThis gives rise to an apprehension that [Facebook] is not being treated equally,â€� Cullinane wrote. â€œIf [Facebook] alone is being investigated and subject to a suspension of data transfers to the U.S., this would be liable to create a serious distortion of competition.â€�</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The Irish DPC declined to comment to VICE News. Facebook denies that it is trying to force the regulator to change its decision with a threat with withdraw its services.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>â€œFacebook is not threatening to withdraw from Europe,â€� a Facebook spokesperson said, adding that the court filing simply lays out how â€œFacebook, and many other businesses, organisations and services, rely on data transfers between the EU and the US in order to operate their services.â€�</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>A judge last week allowed Facebookâ€™s challenge to go ahead and put a stay on the DPCâ€™s ban on data transfers â€” though the DPC can challenge that decision.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Besides threatening to close down Facebook and Instagram completely, Cunnane also points out that Facebook is an important tool for the freedom of expression of its 410 million EU users â€” it also reportedly generated â‚¬208 billion in sales for companies who use the platforms.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>What she failed to mention, though, is that the service has also been weaponized to sow disinformation and conspiracy theories, as well as being used to influence the results of votes across the region, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/cambridge-analytica-leave-eu-ukip-brexit-facebook/">including the U.K.â€™s decision to leave the EU</a>.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Facebookâ€™s entire business model relies on being able to easily and quickly transfer data across the globe so that it can better target users with ads. By disrupting that flow of data, the EU is threatening Facebookâ€™s revenue potential, and as this lawsuit shows, that is something the company takes very seriously indeed.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>But Facebookâ€™s ultimatum is little more than an empty threat, according to privacy experts.</p>

You'd like to have time to code, but nobody else is onboarding the junior engineers, updating the roadmap, talking to the users, noticing the things that got dropped, asking questions on design documents, and making sure that everyone's going roughly in the same direction. If you stop doing those things, the team won't be as successful. But now someone's suggesting that you might be happier in a less technical role. If this describes you, congratulations: you're the glue. If it's not, have you thought about who is filling this role on your team?</p><p>Every senior person in an organisation should be aware of the less glamorous - and often less-promotable - work that needs to happen to make a team successful. Managed deliberately, glue work demonstrates and builds strong technical leadership skills. Left unconscious, it can be career limiting.

September 25, 2020 | https://w3c.studio24.net/updates/on-not-choosing-wordpress/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://w3c.studio24.net/updates/on-not-choosing-wordpress/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div tabindex="0"> <div>  <div class="page"> <div id="main-content" role="main">  <p> <span>Updates</span> <span>CMS</span> </p>  <hr> <p>The W3C redesign project is an incredibly exciting one for us at Studio 24, it’s an honour to be working with an organisation we have looked up to for our whole career. But it’s also challenging, with many aspects coming under more scrutiny than we’re normally used to. It’s also made harder in this time of pandemic, with increased anxiety and challenges working effectively during this “new normal” we’re all living in.</p> <p>We’re happy to rise to this challenge. Yesterday a well written article was published by WordPress Tavern on <a href="https://wptavern.com/w3c-drops-wordpress-from-consideration-for-redesign-narrows-cms-shortlist-to-statamic-and-craft">W3C dropping WordPress from consideration</a> which I’d like to respond to.</p> <h2 id="in-context-of-the-project"> <a href="#in-context-of-the-project"></a> In context of the project </h2> <p>We’ve tackled a huge variety of work so far from initial Discovery, User Research, Information Architecture, Content Design and UX Design that has helped move the project forward.</p> <p>The CMS platform decision is just part of this and for the end website is one of the less visible aspects. As you can read from <a href="https://w3c.studio24.net/docs/cms-selection-report/">Marie’s report on the work we did to choose Craft CMS</a> you can see the steps we went through to help shortlist and choose a CMS.</p> <p>For us, and the requirements from W3C, the delivery of accessible HTML/CSS pages that meet user needs is the most important part of this project - and where we are focussing our time. All in, we spent around 15 days on the CMS platform choice. Enough to help evaluate a limited number of options, but not enough to do a thorough review of the state of accessibility in a wide range of CMSs.</p> <p>We were surprised by the accessibility issues that cropped up in CMS platforms after our <a href="https://w3c.studio24.net/docs/w3c-cms-selection-process-update/">initial CMS review</a>. This prompted us to prioritise accessibility above other requirements due to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/mission#principles">principles and values of W3C</a>.</p> <h2 id="challenges-of-gutenberg-for-now"> <a href="#challenges-of-gutenberg-for-now"></a> Challenges of Gutenberg (for now) </h2> <p><a href="https://www.studio24.net/">Studio 24</a> is a firm supporter of open source software and we use <a href="https://www.wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> extensively for our client work. For this project we had committed to not selecting a CMS until we’d had the chance to better understand client requirements.</p> <p>An important consideration for WordPress was accessibility concerns with the new Gutenberg editor. Many have written about the <a href="https://www.marcozehe.de/my-thoughts-on-gutenberg-accessibility/">accessibility issues</a> the project has had as well as the positive <a href="https://www.marcozehe.de/whats-new-for-accessibility-in-gutenberg-7-2/">steps to improve accessibility in Gutenberg</a>.</p> <p>Gutenberg is an exciting and really interesting development. Many CMS vendors are looking at ways to allow editors to create more flexible content from compontents or blocks. However, this comes with huge challenges on how to make innovative user interfaces accessible. WordPress decided to use the JavaScript framework <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> to meet these needs.</p> <p>We <a href="https://medium.com/studio24/we-tried-converting-a-bespoke-website-design-in-wordpress-with-gutenberg-42e11986b05a">tested Gutenberg</a> six months before it was released in WordPress 5. Recently we worked on a project for the University of Cambridge creating a site for their <a href="https://magazine.alumni.cam.ac.uk/">Alumni magazine</a>. This launched in April 2020 and uses Gutenberg to manage content. This gave us a good idea of how Gutenberg works. In June, we reviewed the current accessibility issue backlog (<a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/labels/Accessibility%20%28a11y%29">issues</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/projects/25">a11y project</a>) and had some feedback from users with accessibility needs who had difficulties using the current user interface. This was a contributing factor in our decision that WordPress was not a good fit for this project.</p> <p>Given the importance the WordPress project has put on Gutenberg as the future of WordPress we did not feel it was reasonable to recommend using the Classic Editor if there is a good chance this will not be supported in the future. At present <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/11/07/classic-editor-plugin-support-window/">Classic Editor is slated for end of life in Dec 2021</a>.</p> <p>We look forward to the continued development of Gutenberg and applaud efforts to make it more accessible. We appreciate improvements have been made since our review and we’re very glad to see the <a href="https://wpaccessibilityday.org/">WordPress Accessibility Day</a> on 2nd October.</p> <h2 id="front-end-complexity"> <a href="#front-end-complexity"></a> Front-end complexity </h2> <p>From a business perspective I also believe Gutenberg creates a complexity issue that makes it challenging for use by many agencies who create custom websites for clients; where we have a need to create lots of bespoke blocks and page elements for individual client projects.</p> <p>The use of React complicates front-end build. We have very talented front-end developers, however, they are not React experts - nor should they need to be. I believe front-end should be built as standards-compliant HTML/CSS with JavaScript used to enrich functionality where necessary and appropriate.</p> <p>As of yet, we have not found a satisfactory (and profitable) way to build custom Gutenberg blocks for commercial projects. We won’t stop trying though and plan to do more R&amp;D with Gutenberg in the future. The W3C project, however, did not feel like the right place to do this. On a project as wide-ranging as this one, development time does become a factor.</p> <p>Drupal also has this complexity issue which makes developing sites harder than it needs to be, and is why we didn’t consider that platform either. I’ve talked to <a href="https://torchbox.com/blog/torchbox-has-dropped-drupal/">other agencies who have decided to drop Drupal</a> due to its complexity.</p> <h2 id="the-question-of-open-source"> <a href="#the-question-of-open-source"></a> The question of open source </h2> <p>The W3C embraces and supports the open web. However, as an agency we also have to be practical when it comes to the tools we use to build sites. From our review, which was focussed on PHP-based CMSs, Craft and Statamic came out as meeting all the key requirements and are both very developer-friendly platforms. An important consideration for a tool that we need to hand over to W3C to maintain in the future.</p> <p>While their <a href="https://github.com/craftcms/cms">source code</a> is open, they do have commercial licenses and cost money (though a modest sum). Charging money enables small teams to develop good software, so we’re not ideologically against this business model. Both platforms are well respected in the community and well-used by professionals, running sites such as <a href="https://media.netflix.com/en/">Netflix</a> and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/">Big Commerce</a> in Craft, <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/plus/">Spiegel Plus</a> and <a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/">FreshBooks</a> in Statamic.</p> <p>We are using open source technology in the majority of this project (HTML/CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Symfony). While Craft is a proprietary CMS, this has given us the advantage of direct access to the team developing the CMS which has helped improve accessibility in these CMSs. We hope this helps move accessibility forward in the CMS industry.</p> <p>Open tools will continue to be used to publish the standards of the web. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/">Technical Reports</a> page is powered by <a href="https://symfony.com/">Symfony</a> and specifications will continue to be published to <a href="https://github.com/w3c">GitHub</a> to facilitate open discussion. Nothing’s changing with how the W3C work in the open.</p> <h2 id="a-note-on-front-end-delivery"> <a href="#a-note-on-front-end-delivery"></a> A note on front-end delivery </h2> <p>One final note. We are currently considering a <a href="https://www.studio24.net/blog/what-is-a-headless-cms/">Headless CMS</a> option for front-end page delivery. This means using the CMS in a decoupled way to manage content but use a separate system to deliver front-end pages. Please note this solution would not be reliant on JavaScript (e.g. a single page app which is common with headless). Under this option we’d use Symfony to deliver front-end pages which is an established technology W3C already use across a lot of the site.</p> <p>This may give W3C better flexibility for the future, though comes at a cost of added complexity. The W3C site is already made up of a lot of different systems, the CMS is just one part of the what makes up the varied content on <a href="https://www.w3.org/">w3.org</a>.</p> <p>I hope this helps explain the thought process behind our decision a little more and addresses some of the valid concerns highlighted in the WordPress Tavern post.</p> <hr>  </div> </div> </div> </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Is the C runtime and library a legitimate part of the Unix API?</h2>

	<p><small>December 31, 2017</small></p>
</div><div><p>One of the knocks against Go is, to quote from <a href="https://marcan.st/2017/12/debugging-an-evil-go-runtime-bug/">Debugging an evil
Go runtime bug</a> (partly
<a href="https://zaitcev.livejournal.com/240821.html">via</a>):</p>

<blockquote><p>Go also happens to have a (rather insane, in my opinion) policy of
reinventing its own standard library, so it does not use any of the
standard Linux glibc code to call vDSO, but rather rolls its own calls
(and syscalls too).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ordinary non-C languages on Unixes generally implement a great many
low level operations by calling into the standard C library. This
starts with things like making system calls, but also includes
operations such as <code>getaddrinfo(3)</code>. Go doesn't do this; it implements
as much as possible itself, going straight down to direct system
calls in assembly language. Occasionally there are problems that
ensue.</p>

<p>A few Unixes explicitly say that the standard C library is the
stable API and point of interface with the system; one example is
Solaris (and now Illumos). Although they don't casually change the
low level system call implementation, as far as I know Illumos
officially reserves the right to change all of their actual system
calls around, breaking any user space code that isn't dynamically
linked to <code>libc</code>. If your code breaks, it's your fault; Illumos
told you that dynamic linking to <code>libc</code> is the official API.</p>

<p>Other Unixes simply do this tacitly and by accretion. For example,
on any Unix using <code>nsswitch.conf</code>, it's very difficult to always
get the same results for operations like <code>getaddrinfo()</code> without
going through the standard C library, because these may use arbitrary
and <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/SystemdResolvedNotes">strange</a> dynamically loaded
modules that are accessed through <code>libc</code> and require various random
<code>libc</code> APIs to work. This points out one of the problems here; once
you start (indirectly) calling random bits of the <code>libc</code> API, they
may quite reasonably make assumptions about the runtime environment
that they're operating in. How to set up a limited standard C library
runtime environment is generally not documented; instead the official
view is generally 'let the standard C library runtime code start
your <code>main()</code> function'.</p>

<p>I'm not at all sure that all of this requirement and entanglement
with the standard C library and its implicit runtime environment
is a good thing. The standard C library's runtime environment is
designed for C, and it generally contains a tangled skein of
assumptions about how things work. Forcing all other languages to
fit themselves into these undocumented constraints is clearly
confining, and the standard C library generally isn't designed to
be a transparent API; in fact, at least GNU libc deliberately
manipulates what it does under the hood to be more useful to C
programs. Whether these manipulations are useful or desired for
your non-C language is an open question, but the GNU libc people
aren't necessarily going to even document them.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://marcan.st/2017/12/debugging-an-evil-go-runtime-bug/">Marcan's story</a> shows
that the standard C library behavior would have been a problem for
any language environment that attempted to use minimal stacks while
calling into 'libc', here in the form of a kernel vDSO that's
designed to be called through libc. This also shows another aspect
of the problem, in that as far as I know how much stack space you
must provide when calling the standard C library is generally not
documented. It's just assumed that you will have 'enough', whatever
that is. C code will; people who are trying to roll their own
coroutines and thread environment, maybe not.)</p>

<p>This implicit assumption has a long history in Unix. Many Unixes
have only really documented their system calls in the form of the
standard C library interface to them, quietly eliding the distinction
between the kernel API to user space and the standard C library API
to C programs. If you're lucky, you can dig up some documentation
on how to make raw system calls and what things those raw system
calls return in unusual cases like <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/SocketReturnAPIDesign"><code>pipe(2)</code></a>.
I don't think very many Unixes have ever tried to explicitly and
fully document the kernel API separately from the standard C library
API, especially once you get into cases like <code>ioctl()</code> (where there
are often C macros and <code>#define</code>s that are used to form some of the
arguments, which are of course only 'documented' in the C header
files).</p>

    <p>The Maersk Triple-E Class container ship is 1,300 feet long, carries over 18,000 containers across 11,000 miles between Europe and Asia, and… Its entire crew can fit inside a passenger van.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e84e2eff3c5307ee69a77b3313684a5a90aa0981/d7909/images/uploads/maersk-container-ship.jpg" alt="Maersk container ship"></p>

<p>As a former naval architect and a current <a href="https://www.gkogan.co/">marketing consultant to startups</a>, I found that the same principle that lets a 13-person crew navigate the world’s largest container ship to a port halfway around the world without breaking down also applies to startups working towards aggressive growth goals:</p>

<p><strong>Simple systems have less downtime.</strong></p>

<p>Ships contain simple systems that are easy to operate and easy to understand, which makes them easy to fix, which means they have less downtime. An important quality, considering that “downtime” for a ship could mean being stranded thousands of miles from help.</p>

<p>Take the ship’s steering system, for instance. The rudder is pushed left or right by metal rods. Those rods are moved by hydraulic pressure. That pressure is controlled by a hydraulic pump. That pump is controlled by an electronic signal from the wheelhouse. That signal is controlled by the autopilot. It doesn’t require a rocket scientist or a naval architect to find the cause of and solution to any problem:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the autopilot fails, steer the ship manually from the wheelhouse.</li>
  <li>If the electronic signals fail, go to the rudder control room to control the pump by hand, while talking with the bridge through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound-powered_telephone">simple sound-powered phone</a>.</li>
  <li>If the hydraulics fail, use the mechanically linked emergency steering wheel.</li>
  <li>If the mechanical linkage fails, hook a chain to both sides of the rudder and pull in the direction you want!</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/4676c41bcb0133d35827e62d044f82c9511ffd21/bb56a/images/uploads/174.jpg" alt="Cartoon about redundancy"></p>

<p>Startups, like ships, can’t afford to stall from system downtimes. Extended downtime in sales, marketing, web, customer support, hiring, product, and other systems may cause irreparable damage to the growth rate.</p>

<p>(Although automation is prevalent on modern ships, it only affects the time it takes to do things and the attention required to monitor everything. The propulsion and auxiliary systems are more simple than ever, thanks to modern diesel and electric propulsion systems that replaced pipe-laden steam plants.)</p>

<h2 id="why-simplicity-leads-to-less-downtime">Why Simplicity Leads to Less Downtime</h2>

<h3 id="1-proficiency-takes-less-time">1. Proficiency takes less time.</h3>

<p>If the person responsible for the system leaves, falls overboard, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">gets hit by a bus</a>, or gets pulled into another project, another person can take over without much learning or training. That means more people are able to step in to troubleshoot and fix issues.</p>

<p>For example, an analytics dashboard built with Tableau is likely to have more qualified people to fix it than one built with a patchwork of custom scripts and APIs. Nobody should have to pull data scientists or product developers away from their work to fix a bar chart.</p>

<h3 id="2-troubleshooting-takes-less-time">2. Troubleshooting takes less time.</h3>

<p>In a system where the behavior of each component and its relationship to other comments is easily understood, ruling out issues and finding the broken component—the root cause—is more intuitive.</p>

<p>For example, if a company has many downloadable whitepapers on their website, and they’re all gated behind a single form—as opposed to a custom form for each one—then they need only troubleshoot one form and one automation workflow if the whitepaper downloads stop working.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/495bdd177c0618760025c9d94dcfc8129aa117f5/ec606/images/uploads/91.jpg" alt="Cartoon about a ship being stuck in Nebraska"></p>

<h3 id="3-more-alternative-solutions">3. More alternative solutions.</h3>

<p>When each part of the system has a clear function, alternatives are easier to find.</p>

<p>For example, imagine a Salesforce process that uses a mishmash of automation and third-party tools to score, filter, classify, and assign new sales leads. If that fails then there is no obvious replacement. Everything will be put on hold until the process is fixed or replaced with a similarly complex solution.</p>

<p>Now imagine a sales process in which the sales team is simply notified of each new sales lead along with pertinent details, letting them decide whether or not to follow up with the lead. If the Salesforce notification step fails, it’s easy to come up with a hundred other ways of getting that information to the sales team: Reports, Slack notifications, list exports, manual observation, or using Zapier to send an alert through virtually any medium. The downtime would last a few minutes, at most.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/26ba2a1619df8df60c6a56e3ec07a7b81478f644/75961/images/uploads/77.jpg" alt="Cartoon about boats grounding because of a broken lighthouse"></p>

<h2 id="startup-story">Startup Story</h2>

<p>One of my clients was using a legacy enterprise marketing automation platform (Marketo) with 629 automated processes built up over several years. When something broke or needed tweaking, there was only one person among the 150+ employees who could do it. Each issue took several days or even weeks to fix, all the while marketing campaigns stalled. And with each patch, the overall system only grew more complex.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/c25f453aa08d83e439b8d4ad5240ea4842ff286f/421d6/images/uploads/127.jpg" alt="Cartoon about a sailor coming home drunk"></p>

<p>When that person left the company, there was nobody left to operate the system. With every passing week a new issue would come up, faster than we could find and fix them.</p>

<p>To keep the marketing operation from coming to a standstill, I rushed to migrate the company from Marketo to HubSpot, a more simple platform that would be easier to operate and troubleshoot.</p>

<p>The migration took just one week. Along the way, however, another complex system reared its head: Salesforce. There were 10 automated processes in Salesforce with over 100 combined operations, all dependent on various delicately timed automations in Marketo. It took two weeks—twice as long as the migration—to understand and integrate those processes with the new marketing platform.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/169a7904b8e2c26fd693968dbb2250d75eba25f3/7e08a/images/uploads/193.jpg" alt="Cartoon about being stranded on an island"></p>

<p>Overall, these two complex systems (in Marketo and in Salesforce) resulted in six weeks of downtime for the marketing team and three weeks of downtime for the sales team. That’s not counting the many weeks of downtime they experienced throughout the past few years, nor the many weeks of downtime they would experience in the future if we did not overhaul the underlying systems.</p>

<p>In the end, the system I put in place had 97% fewer processes (from 629 to 20) while providing all the same capabilities. A bug that was found a few days later got resolved in four minutes.</p>

<p>This experience made me wonder what principles startups can adopt to avoid the pitfalls of complex systems.</p>

<h2 id="principles-for-simple-systems">Principles for Simple Systems</h2>

<p>Rip-and-replace projects are painful and disruptive, even when the long-term benefits are worth it. Many startups—as with ships—don’t have the luxury of time and resources to perform overhauls once they’re underway.</p>

<p>Here are my three principles to follow when evaluating or implementing new systems:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Features don’t justify complexity.</strong> What good is a complicated flight control system if it grounds an entire fleet of aircraft, or an enterprise marketing platform like Marketo if nobody can run a marketing campaign? Choose tools that are simple to operate over those that promise the most features. A frequent recommendation I give to startups is to choose HubSpot for their marketing platform instead of an enterprise platform like Marketo, Eloqua, or Pardot.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Complex ideas lead to complex implementations.</strong> If it takes too long to explain or grasp an idea, then its implementation will be complex, and it will take too long to fix when something inevitably breaks. For example, a proposed sales process that requires an hour-long presentation will be a nightmare to maintain, regardless of how clever it seems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Modifications before additions.</strong> When new requirements come up, the tendency is to add layers on top of the existing system—by way of additional steps or integrations. Instead, see if the system’s core can be modified to meet the new requirements. The change may cause (planned) downtime upfront, as with my Marketo-to-HubSpot migration example, but less (unplanned) downtime over the long term.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="smooth-sailing">Smooth Sailing</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“… the more simple any thing is, the less liable it is to be disordered, and the easier repaired when disordered.” — Thomas Paine, Common Sense, 1776</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s no question things will break along the startup journey, just as surely as they do on a ship crossing the globe. However, if the onboard systems are simple, those issues won’t leave the startup drifting helplessly in the middle of the ocean.</p>

			<p><strong>Libreture is a direct response to the dodgy, monopolistic practices of the large e-book retailers, publishers and distributors.</strong></p>
		</div>
		

		
		<p><strong>Launched in 2017, Libreture is an alternative e-book &amp; comic storage service for readers who want the benefits of an online platform, without the dodgy practices of the large retailers.</strong></p>
		<p>Owned and run by <strong>Kevin Beynon</strong>, its goal is to balance the monopolistic platforms of Amazon, Google, and Apple, with a service that is designed NOT to be tied to its own bookshop or e-reader (not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_integration" target="_blank">vertically-integrated</a>). In effect, supporting independent bookshops, publishers, and self-publishing authors, by providing readers with the same book management tools they would normally only get from big companies.</p>
		
		<h2>Why I built Libreture</h2>
		<p><strong>I'm an avid e-book reader and was once a Kindle-owner. After news of Amazon's UK tax-avoidance broke I decided to boycott them and look for alternative e-bookshops.</strong></p>

		<p>I concentrated on finding bookshops that sold DRM-free e-books, to ensure I could read them on any device. I also wanted to support small and independent publishers and bookshops. With this in mind, I compiled a list of <a href="https://www.libreture.com/bookshops">DRM-free bookshops</a>. The list is still growing and is now a key component of Libreture - readers record where they bought their DRM-free books, helping others discover new bookshops.</p>

		<p>A big part of Amazon's service is its book storage and management tools. To avoid these, I began using <em>Shelfari</em>, a library management website. Shelfari was a great tool, but in 2008, the owners <a href="http://shelfari.typepad.com/my_weblog/2008/08/shelfari-joins-the-amazoncom-family.html" target="_blank">sold Shelfari to Amazon</a>. So I moved to <em>Goodreads</em>.</p>

		<p>When the owners of Goodreads also <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/413-exciting-news-about-goodreads-we-re-joining-the-amazon-family" target="_blank">sold their business to Amazon</a> in 2013, I had finally had enough. Many others felt the same way.</p>

		<blockquote>"What terrible news. Loss of an independent reader community, now another channel for the faceless machine to leech reader data to withhold from suffering publishers &amp; booksellers. If through this account Amazon has a record of my reading habits I will be deleting the account. Very sad."<br>
		<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/413-exciting-news-about-goodreads-we-re-joining-the-amazon-family#comment_70824525" target="_blank">Laura - 28/03/2013</a>
		</blockquote>

		<p>At that point I began building my own stable platform to store e-books, record reading activity, and promote DRM-free bookshops and publishers.</p>
		<p>I built the first version myself, and for myself. It soon became clear that others may find it useful too. Working with an external development company, we re-built Libreture from scratch.</p> 
		<p><strong><a href="https://www.libreture.com/blog/libreture-open-business/" target="_blank">Libreture launched to the public in March, 2017</a></strong></p>
		<p><strong>So far, readers are storing 8,069 e-books with Libreture.</strong></p>
		
		


		<h2>Price</h2>
		<p><strong>You can use Libreture absolutely free to store a limited amount of e-books, and you can upgrade to a paid plan to store much, much more.</strong></p>
		<p>Libreture doesn't offer a discounted annual rate that only saves money for those that can afford to pay up front. The fee is set for each plan and covers the cost of development, infrastructure, storage for your books, as well as a small profit margin. I believe each plan is as reasonable as possible while keeping Libreture sustainable (which means keeping me in tea and biscuits).</p>
		<p>Free and Paid plans ensure that costs are covered as soon as they happen, such as when readers upload large book collections. It also gives you the flexibility to switch plans to whatever suits you, or cancel whenever you want and only pay for the remainder of the month.</p>

Downsizing the multi-boot image</h2>

<p>If the multi-boot image doesn't fit your 8GiB uSD card, because it's&nbsp;a tad
too big, you can downsize it a bit by using this script:</p>

<pre><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

<span>set -e -x</span>

<span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> m
L<span>=</span><span>`losetup -P --show -f multi.img`</span>
mount <span>-o</span> <span>compress</span><span>-force</span><span>=</span>zstd <span>${L}</span>p2 m
btrfs filesystem resize <span>7000</span>M m
<span>echo</span> <span>",7000M"</span> <span>|</span> sfdisk <span>-N</span> <span>2</span> <span>${L}</span>
umount m
losetup <span>-d</span> <span>"</span><span>$L</span><span>"</span>

truncate <span>-s</span> <span>$((128+7000)</span><span>)</span>M multi.img
</pre>

<p>If something fails in the middle, you may need to recover by calling
<code>umount</code> and <code>losetup -d</code> yourself.
<code>losetup -l</code> can tell you if the image is still exported as a loop
device, and which&nbsp;one.</p>

<p>The image will have the size of 7128&nbsp;MiB after resize and this should fit
more „8“ giga something uSD cards, as there are obviously some other giga
units than gigabyte and gigibyte used by some manufacturers.</p>

<h2 id="toc-2020-09-20-some-ways-to-improve-pinephone-safety">2020–09–20:
Some ways to improve Pinephone safety</h2>

<p>This is a follow up on some issues from the previous article. On surface,
solutions to some of the previously presented issues can seem simple. Toggle a
few registers in PMIC, and we're mostly done. Trouble is that safety mechanisms
are barely ever triggered, by definition. Safety events occur rarely. That means
that the mechanisms are not regularly tested, and it is not known that
they&nbsp;work.</p>

<p>Also it's&nbsp;not clear which code's&nbsp;responsibility fixing the issues should
be. Bootloader, or kernel, or userspace? Finally, there are a bunch of devils in
the details, that complicate the upstreamability of any solution. And having
fixes upstream is necessary to make sure they reach the most&nbsp;users.</p>

<h3 id="toc-necessary-minimum">Necessary minimum</h3>

<p>Nevertheless, at least enabling some pre-existing PMIC functionality blindly
is better than nothing, so that's&nbsp;precisely what I&nbsp;decided to do <a href="https://megous.com/git/p-boot/commit/?id=db73ff85c60944207b7f7368e554003494148a05">in
p-boot</a>. It's&nbsp;the easiest place to start resolving these issues for me
personally, and for other p-boot&nbsp;users.</p>

<p>I&nbsp;fixed two issues:</p>

<ul>
	<li>I&nbsp;enabled the battery temperature monitoring and charging regulation based
	on temperature thresholds defined in the Pinephone battery specification.</li>

	<li>I&nbsp;enabled emergency shutdown when crossing the critical temperature
	of&nbsp;PMIC.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&nbsp;didn't measure the 3kOhm NTC used in Pinephone battery and third party
batteries I&nbsp;bought. I&nbsp;just used a table from some random 3kOhm NTC spec on The
Internet, that seemed like it could match. Hopefully it's&nbsp;close enough.</p>

<p>Trouble with the second fix is that it's&nbsp;a hard power cut-off, so data loss
may occur when PMIC overheats. There are three fixed temperature levels in
AXP803. On level 1&nbsp;the charging is limited, on level 2&nbsp;the interrupt is sent
to SoC, on level 3&nbsp;the PMIC shuts down if configured to do so (by default it
keeps running, and this is what my p-boot fix changes). Ideally, the crossing of
level 2&nbsp;would be handled by Linux to make it safely shut down the system, and
level 3&nbsp;forced power cut-off would never happen. Arguably, if charging was
source of the heating, crossing level 1&nbsp;will lead to resolving the issue, so
the next level will not be reached.</p>

<h3 id="toc-suggested-fixes-elsewhere">Suggested fixes elsewhere</h3>

<p>These fixes will reach a very limited audience. It would be nice to have
these fixes in U-Boot too, but that's&nbsp;not possible at the moment, because
U-Boot doesn't have access to&nbsp;PMIC.</p>

<p>Other places to put the fix is to ATF or Linux kernel. That can reach more
people faster, but there would have to be some generic mechanism to make the fix
upstreamable, otherwise it will not reach people using the mainline Linux kernel
or mainline&nbsp;ATF.</p>

<p>There are some ways to approach this:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Use battery description in DT from <a href="https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware">ATF</a> to set up
	thresholds in PMIC (ATF has access to&nbsp;PMIC).</li>

	<li>Use battery description in DT from Linux's&nbsp;battery charger driver for
	AXP803 to set up thresholds in PMIC and stop disabling temperature
	monitoring.</li>

	<li>Use <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/supply/charger-manager.txt">charger
	manager</a> in Linux, but that looks like it's&nbsp;a completely software solution,
	that will be inferior to PMIC handling the regulation. And it seems it would not
	work in system suspend, anyway, because Linux is not running&nbsp;then.</li>

	<li>Detect Pinephone compatible string in either ATF or Linux and set up the
	thresholds to ad-hoc values for 3kOhm NTC. (easiest, unlikely to be acceptable
	upstream)</li>
</ul>

<p>First, the most generic solution would be to have a description of the
battery in DT describing the Pinephone. Sadly, the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9-rc5/source/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/supply/battery.yaml">current
bindings</a> don't include battery temperature limits.</p>

<p>Also converting from temperature to NTC resistance (which is necessary to
determine the code word from ADC for the limits used by the temperature monitor
logic in PMIC) is not straightforward. It is usually defined in NTC datasheet as
a table. Do I&nbsp;have NTC datasheet? No. I&nbsp;bought the batteries online from some
mobile phone service&nbsp;shop.</p>

<p>There are also equations that approximate the temperature&nbsp;– resistance
relationship for the NTC, which could be used instead of a fixed table, if one
knows the relevant coefficients. These can be calculated after measuring the
NTC's&nbsp;resistance at a few temperature points when we lack the datasheet.</p>

<p>So generic solution may look like this:</p>

<ul>
	<li>DT contains battery temperature limits from the battery&nbsp;spec</li>

	<li>DT contains NTC coefficients (perhaps also on the battery&nbsp;node)</li>

	<li>some routine would use all this info from DT to calculate code words used by
	AXP803 ADC and program them to PMIC (either in ATF, or&nbsp;Linux)</li>
</ul>

<p>Kernel also has support for NTC devices, so maybe NTC can be described
outside of the battery node (even though it's&nbsp;part of the battery).</p>

<p>This may all fail to be upstreamed on one thing: the battery is user
swappable, so it's&nbsp;arguably not part of the Pinephone, and describing it inside
the pinephone DT will not be appropriate.</p>

<p>I&nbsp;don't have any plans implementing any of the above, atm. Maybe with the
exception of adding a 4th approach to the fix to my Linux kernel (the easiest
one ;)). I'd like to work on my multi-boot image. So these are mostly pointers
for somebody else who'd like to tackle&nbsp;this.</p>

<h3 id="toc-other-issues">Other issues</h3>

<p>Fast charging is not necesary in many situations, so having it as a default
is not great. User should be able to decide if he wants to trade off slower,
safer charging and battery longetivity over speed. This tradeoff can be realized
in many&nbsp;ways.</p>

<p>All this is already controllable from userspace via sysfs. Ideally there
would be some charging monitoring daemon that would take into account
users's&nbsp;wishes and select proper strategy for charging, based on preference for
battery longetivity or&nbsp;speed.</p>

<p>There are several trade offs the deamon would be able to handle:</p>

<ul>
	<li>0.2C charging all the way (slow, but safer)</li>

	<li>0.5C charging to 40% and 0.2C charging to 100% (middle ground)</li>

	<li>0.5C charging all the way to 100%</li>
</ul>

<p>All this is decision making that doesn't belong to the kernel.</p>

<p>Similar daemon could monitor power usage of the phone and try to limit it to
safer levels, or warn the user if that's&nbsp;not possible.</p>

Let's&nbsp;talk about safety of Pinephone</h2>

<p>My gf read me some articles about exploding phones today. :) I&nbsp;think there
needs to be some serious conversation about Pinephone safety. Safety needs to
become an important concern now, when more and more people are getting their
Pinephones every month. It's&nbsp;just a matter of time before the first major
safety incident hits this community, and it may be more than just a hacked
store. It's&nbsp;just a numbers&nbsp;game.</p>

<p>Pinephone is an interesting device in one way. You can run whatever software
you like on it (and you do!), and this software comes almost universally with
<strong>zero</strong> guarantees. Read the license to any of the program you run
on your Pinephone and it will almost certainly tell&nbsp;you:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ``AS IS'' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
	WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
	MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A&nbsp;PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY &lt;COPYRIGHT HOLDER&gt; AS IS AND ANY EXPRESS
	OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
	MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A&nbsp;PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED. IN NO
	EVENT SHALL &lt;COPYRIGHT HOLDER&gt; BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
	INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>

	ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS
	FOR A&nbsp;PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more
	details.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>In case of Pinephone you have to take these warnings <strong>very
seriously</strong>, because this software is not provided by the manufacturer
(Pine64), and as far as I&nbsp;know, there's&nbsp;no software related safety testing
going on at&nbsp;all.</p>

<h3 id="toc-some-skeletons-hiding-at-the-lower-levels">Some skeletons, hiding at
the lower levels…</h3>

<p>I'll give you a few reasons why things may not be so rosy, when it comes to
safety.</p>

<p>There's&nbsp;no unchangeable well tested guardian angel management engine that
safely manages battery, power supplies, thermal behavior, that is provided by
the manufacturer, and that is independent of the operating system.</p>

<p>Pinephone's&nbsp;SoC is quite bare when it comes to software/firmware
(that's&nbsp;why FOSS enthusiasts like it, no blobs, you know!). This has a dark</p></article></div>

		<p>KansasFest 2019 presentation, “Ready Player Two”</p>
<p><span><iframe type="text/html" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T3Qj0vnZx7Y?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
<p>One of the first games I ever played on my family’s Apple IIe was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karateka_(video_game)">Jordan Mechner master work, Karateka</a>. Fight the bad guys, save the princess – it’s a simple but classic formula. My brother and I would take turns making our way through Akuma’s fortress. Even then, we wanted a two player version.</p>
<p>Fast forward more than 30 years, and I’ve taught myself 6502 assembly after getting back into the Apple II, through the thriving community online. The idea of a two player version of Karateka came back to me while at <a href="http://kansasfest.org/">KansasFest</a> a couple of years ago. I noodled a little on it back then, getting distracted by finding the code that created the <a href="https://github.com/option8/ksynth">unique music</a> in the game.</p>
<p>Long story short: I finally found the places in the game code that needed patching to allow a second player to control the enemies in the game, and create a functioning two player version of Karateka. The resulting patch is only 42 bytes long. <a href="https://archive.org/details/karateka-two-player">A DSK image is downloadable and playable online at the Internet Archive.</a></p>
<p><strong>[Update, August 20, 2018]:</strong> Some people seem to think I had access to the Karateka source code to make my edits. As far as I know, that source code is unreleased, still in Jordan Mechner’s archives somewhere. Instead, I fired up the game in my Apple II emulator of choice, <a href="http://virtualii.com/">Virtual ][</a>&nbsp;and froze the game state. Stepping through instructions, I followed the assembly as it built up each frame of animation, triggered events and eventually found where the player and enemy performed their attacks. By comparing memory states from before and after the enemy attacks, I found a handful of zero-page variables that, when I changed them manually, would trigger a punch or kick.</p>
<p>From there, it was a matter of finding the routines that read and wrote to those memory locations, and inserting my own code to listen instead for the keyboard to trigger each action.</p>
<p><strong>[Update, August 23, 2018]:</strong> Robin Harbron has ported the two-player patch over to the Commodore 64 port of Karateka. <a href="http://psw.ca/robin/?p=271">You can read Robin’s write-up here:&nbsp;http://psw.ca/robin/?p=271</a></p>
<p>Digging a little deeper than my original patches, Robin added the ability for the second player to move backward as well as forward. I’ll have to back-port that to my version.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrnCRkPLoXXzTtWX9dBJsnA">Chris Torrence</a>, for helping spelunk the game’s memory layout; to <a href="https://www.brutaldeluxe.fr/">Antoine Vignau</a> for his clean DSK crack and a patch to skip the intro and get right into fighting; <a href="https://twitter.com/a2_4am">4AM</a>&nbsp;for inspiration and helping test.</p>
<h3>Patch Details:</h3>
<p>Addresses are locations in memory after the game finishes loading.</p>
<p>Before the enemy fighter punches, code loads the Accumulator with D7 then jumps to $6540. A kick is similar, but loads A with C5. I patched those pieces at $6C11 (punch) and $6C20 (kick) instead to read the keyboard buffer and load the appropriate byte into the Accumulator. Otherwise, it goes along to $6540 with 00, which does nothing.</p>
<ul>
<li>$6C11: D0 1C C5 21 D0 18 A9 00 85 29 A9 D7 -&gt; AD 00 C0 C9 CD D0 02 A9 D7 8D 10 C0 (M to punch, clears strobe)</li>
<li>$6C20: 20 95 6C C5 D7 B0 08 20 71 6C A9 C5 -&gt; AD 00 C0 C9 CE D0 02 A9 C5 8D 10 C0&nbsp; (N to kick, clears strobe)</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Code at $6B9B seems to check if the distance between fighters ($33) is too far, trigger the enemy to move closer. This happens with a JMP to 6C52. I read the keyboard ($C000) and check for the comma/less-than.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>$6B9B: A6 33 E0 0C 90 03 4C 52 6C E0 07 B0 02 -&gt; AD 00 C0 EA EA EA C9 AC D0 03 4C 52 6C&nbsp; (&lt;&nbsp; to move player 2)</li>
</ul>
<p>To be able to check the keyboard while the game is usually busy animating the enemy fighter, I had to find where the keyboard strobe ($C010) was cleared, and NOP it. This happens several places in the main loop, but patching at $6EA9 kept the keyboard buffer long enough for me to check it.</p>
<ul>
<li>$6EA9: 8D 10 C0 -&gt; EA EA EA (keep from clearing keyboard strobe)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the second player controls were working, I modified the first player controls so both players could huddle around the keyboard and not cross over each other:</p>
<ul>
<li>$6e8e: 88 -&gt; C3 (C to move left instead of ctrl-H/left arrow)</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1601004858557_6995"><div><h3>Why I turned down a million dollar job to code and do Lambda School</h3><p>I have this habit of writing emails to myself to structure my thinking. This is one of those emails with some adjustments for sharing publicly. </p><p>Let me be honest right off the bat; this won’t be one of those “coding rules! anyone who doesn’t code shouldn’t be listened to!” cult pieces. Quite the contrary.</p><p>There is something deeply satisfying about creating things that solve a problem -any problem- in a better way. I mean there’s something deeply satisfying about creating things period. I don’t know exactly what it is -and we can argue forever about the existential anxiety roots of craving problem solving as a form of meaning for life- but it’s definitely there. I personally find building technology that simplifies complex problems or streamlines unnecessarily convoluted processes to be the most satisfying flavor of that.</p><p>That’s why despite not having a lot of savings (long story), having a 1 Million dollar job at my hands (thus finally comfort and building “wealth”) and against the advice of everyone I know (well except my brother) I decided it’s time to build computer science skills. To code.</p><h2>The backstory</h2><p>I started out my career on the “business” side of things on the other side of the world (America being “this side”). Landed a couple of decent -and excruciatingly boring- corporate jobs at Fortune 500 companies’ local offices for a couple of years before I quit without a plan. I had to. If I had stayed one more day I would have walked into the office and started banging my head against a wall screaming “None of us has a real job” on repeat. I kept applying to jobs I thought at the time would be intellectually challenging and that can be a gateway to get me into the “technology space” in America (more on why later). By some whiff of good luck I got into management consulting at its most sought after name; McKinsey. A couple of years later I transferred to their New York office, started a full-time MBA at Columbia and was well on my way to do what I wanted to do. A few years after that I had founded a -failed- startup, advised on some very interesting technology &amp; strategy topics (when I went back to McKinsey) and worked at a leadership role at a dream company of mine; Amazon. I was super lucky.</p><p>Until October 2019 I had a great job at Amazon. I led a big team doing product management, marketplace growth &amp; data science for one of the e-commerce businesses. It had been 3 years in that role during which the business grew ~800% into multi-billion dollars of revenue which was super exciting. I loved my team, my boss and the company culture. We built things many people wanted. In short, many real -not vanity- metrics were checked for me. In addition, my Amazon stock compensation had skyrocketed in value so I was making great money.</p><p>Ironically, I started getting the “walk in and bang my head against the wall” urge again. This time I knew what the issue was though so I made a plan. In fact I had known one of the issues for quite a long time but the time to act on it hadn’t come -for many personal reasons- until now.</p><p>While I was finalizing that plan -it involved quitting the large corporate world at least for a while- a headhunter reached out about a very senior role at a Fortune 100. After some back and forth, I agreed to talk because “there’s nothing to lose and it would be good networking anyway”. They quickly made me an offer. Self delusion kicked in.</p><p>The three delusion flavors of that week were: 1. “You can’t pass on landing a C-level job at a Fortune 100 in your damn 30s! Remember where you started!” 2. “You can still build stuff. After all they are a technology company -albeit old school- and you’ll lead a turn-around there” and the world champion of delusions: 3. “I’ll do this for a couple of years then I can do my plan and take all the risk I want”.</p><p>Long story short, I took the offer and put my plan on hold.</p><p>This job was very different from my previous jobs which have all been in either tech (Amazon &amp; the startup I founded and ran for a few years out of New York) or management consulting (McKinsey). It was much more “cushy”, focused a lot more on corporate politics and was not as intellectually challenging. My compensation would have added up to more than $1 Million per year, I was leading a large organization with hundreds of people, etc. It <strong>checked a lot of “vanity metrics”.</strong> <strong>None of that matters and never should. </strong>Misery often comes out of comfort without purpose.</p><p><strong>8 weeks into this new cushy job I quit (most of the comp is in equity that vests over time so I didn’t make much of those big bucks 🤷🏻‍♂️) to go back to what I had originally intended to do.</strong> It sounds crazy because of the opportunity cost but that is actually sort of the point.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1600965088871_5937"><div><h3>The why: Florence</h3><p>I immigrated to the US 10 years ago because I wanted to be part of building technology that solves problems and -as naive or cliche as this sounds I don’t care- builds the future. There are many many other reasons to love America but “technology &amp; entrepreneurship paradise” was the main one for me. I moved my entire life for that despite having a flourishing career that would have been even much more financially lucrative -if you think short to medium term- elsewhere (for starters I would have paid literally zero taxes the last 10 years while making very similar money 😂). For someone who did not grow up rich by any stretch of the word this was not an easy string of decisions.</p><p>Here’s how I found myself describing it to a close friend who’s in very similar shoes a while back: “I’m not entirely sure why but I feel like we have a role in Florence during the renaissance. It’s almost impossible to put a price on that”</p><p>Back to that “plan” that this post is all about. As I sat down to think about what I want to do towards the end of my time at Amazon I followed a simple framework:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1600968647285_7975"><div><p>I had known for a long time that if I want to truly build things that make a dent in some problems (i.e. #2 on the list above) I need to learn how to code properly. After all <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">software is -truly- eating the world</a>. But it quickly hit me how interconnected the answers to all 4 questions are. <strong>Layering skills</strong> that help you <strong>become a builder</strong> of things and <strong>taking the risks that come with that</strong> in the process are (or lack thereof) the answer to all 4 questions.</p><p>A couple of years ago I watched Marc Andreessen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8QHeAv4_XE&amp;t=1442s" target="_blank">talk</a> about the best career advice he heard. He heard it from the creator of Dilbert; Scott Adams (who wrote it <a href="https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/career-advice.html" target="_blank">here</a>). Layering and combining skills. I can’t overstate how much I think this is spot on. If you’re a business person who knows data science you can accomplish 10x more than any other business person. If you’re an engineer who understands business &amp; customers you can be 10x more effective than any other engineer. Etc.</p><p>I layered quite a bit of “business” skills over the years. Yet all these things fall under what I call the Business Generalist umbrella (I wrote about this <a href="https://rightalot.com/blog/2020519-the-generalist-dilemma" target="_blank">here</a>). I believe that in order to make meaningful contributions to solving hard problems in technology you need some level of participation in computer science (actually it could be participation in any kind of physics and engineering). Being able to build (hence coding) yourself not just manage others to do so vastly expands your ability to experiment, spot good ideas, develop stronger intuition and most importantly it makes you have skin in the game (see <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075HYVP7C/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">Nassim Taleb</a>).</p><p>I dabble in coding (although I am far from a professional developer) and when I do -for work or fun- it doesn’t feel like work most of the time. It feels like a hobby. Like you’re actually rolling up your sleeves and <strong>making</strong> the idea in your head. I also never felt like I’m working while I worked on small teams with people I really like that are solving something with a missionary rather than a mercenary mindset. It was definitely the case when I started my own company where a team of 5 survived for 2 years on just $200K of funding because we all were focused on building. But I’ve had this experience in other situations too.</p><p>The things I’d regret the most (work-wise) when I’m 80 are risks I did not take. And as -Jeff Bezos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwG_qR6XmDQ" target="_blank">puts it</a>- minimizing regret is something I believe many of us should aim for. The only real risk is taking no risks. Failure isn’t the worst outcome. Mediocrity is.</p><h3>What’s next</h3><p>I just got into <a href="http://www.lambdaschool.com/" target="_blank">Lambda School</a> and I haven’t been this excited about something in a long time. I chose Lambda over other programs including a Masters in CS for many reasons but the main one was simply that they have what I believe to be the best approach. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1600968647285_11960"><div><p>I’ll be writing a separate post on the quest for how to study CS properly and why I think Lambda is the best option.</p><p>I’m going full in. I’m starting Lambda full-time to build CS skills, I’m talking with a few small teams about ideas and I am starting to put all what I’ve learned about business skills into online courses/newsletter. My first goals are finishing Lambda School with a skillset that enables me to build products and to build a side part-time profitable business that enables me to have the peace of mind to continue experimenting with big ideas.</p><p>I tweet<a href="http://twitter.com/byadham" target="_blank"> @byadham</a>&nbsp;. You can follow me there as I document what I learned from my previous journey and what I’m learning from what I’m doing now. </p><blockquote><p>There’s an Arabic saying attributed to<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahlil_Gibran">&nbsp;Khalil Gibran</a>; the brilliant author of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prophet_%28book%29">&nbsp;The Prophet</a>&nbsp;that roughly translates to: “For they should learn that the rich man is not who owns more but who needs less”.</p></blockquote><p>Cheers</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><img alt="Chaos-Mesh-1.0 - Chaos-Engineering-on-Kubernetes-Made-Easier" src="https://chaos-mesh.org/assets/images/chaos-mesh-1.0-22c3415bc75bde8501087d6c7c154cd5.png"></p><p>Today, we are proud to announce the general availability of Chaos Mesh® 1.0, following its entry into CNCF as a <a href="https://pingcap.com/blog/announcing-chaos-mesh-as-a-cncf-sandbox-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sandbox project</a> in July, 2020.</p><p>Chaos Mesh 1.0 is a major milestone in the project’s development. After 10 months of effort within the open-source community, Chaos Mesh is now ready in terms of functionality, scalability, and ease of use. Here are some highlights.</p><h2>Powerful chaos support</h2><p><a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Mesh</a> originated in the testing framework of <a href="https://pingcap.com/products/tidb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TiDB</a>, a distributed database, so it takes into account the possible faults of a distributed system. Chaos Mesh provides comprehensive and fine-grained fault types, covering the Pod, the network, system I/O, and the kernel. Chaos experiments are defined in YAML, which is fast and easy to use.</p><p>Chaos Mesh 1.0 supports the following fault types:</p><ul><li>clock-skew: Simulates clock skew</li><li>container-kill: Simulates the container being killed</li><li>cpu-burn: Simulates CPU pressure</li><li>io-attribution-override: Simulates file exceptions</li><li>io-fault: Simulates file system I/O errors</li><li>io-latency: Simulates file system I/O latency</li><li>kernel-injection: Simulates kernel failures</li><li>memory-burn: Simulates memory pressure</li><li>network-corrupt: Simulates network packet corruption</li><li>network-duplication: Simulates network packet duplication</li><li>network-latency: Simulate network latency</li><li>network-loss: Simulates network loss</li><li>network-partition: Simulates network partition</li><li>pod-failure: Simulates continuous unavailability of Kubernetes Pods</li><li>pod-kill: Simulates the Kubernetes Pod being killed</li></ul><h2>Visual chaos orchestration</h2><p>The Chaos Dashboard component is a one-stop web interface for Chaos Mesh users to orchestrate chaos experiments. Previously, Chaos Dashboard was only available for testing TiDB. With Chaos Mesh 1.0, it is available to everyone. Chaos Dashboard greatly simplifies the complexity of chaos experiments. With only a few mouse clicks, you can define the scope of the chaos experiment, specify the type of chaos injection, define scheduling rules, and observe the results of the chaos experiment—all in the same web interface.</p><p><img alt="Chaos Dashboard" src="https://chaos-mesh.org/assets/images/chaos-dashboard-0a1e48c54968d276f174801a1364ce21.gif"></p><h2>Grafana plug-in for enhanced observability</h2><p>To further improve the observability of chaos experiments, Chaos Mesh 1.0 includes a Grafana plug-in to allow you to directly display real-time chaos experiment information on your application monitoring panel. Currently, the chaos experiment information is displayed as annotations. This way, you can simultaneously observe the running status of the application and the current chaos experiment information.</p><p><img alt="Chaos status and application status on Grafana" src="https://chaos-mesh.org/assets/images/chaos-status-460b054f3e2ee0898d2236a5137bc30e.png"></p><h2>Safe and controllable chaos</h2><p>When we conduct chaos experiments, it is vital that we keep strict control over the chaos scope or “blast radius.” Chaos Mesh 1.0 not only provides a wealth of selectors to accurately control the scope of the experiment, but it also enables you to set protected Namespaces to protect important applications. You can also use Namespace permissions to limit the scope of Chaos Mesh to a specific Namespace. Together, these features make chaos experiments with Chaos Mesh safe and controllable.</p><h2>Try it out now</h2><p>You can quickly deploy Chaos Mesh in your Kubernetes environment through the <code>install.sh</code> script or the Helm tool. For specific installation steps, please refer to the <a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/docs/installation/installation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Mesh Getting Started</a> document. In addition, thanks to the <a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/interactiveTutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Katakoda interactive tutorial</a>, you can also quickly get your hands on Chaos Mesh without having to deploy it.</p><p>If you haven’t upgraded to 1.0 GA, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/releases/tag/v1.0.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.0 Release Notes</a> for the changes and upgrade guidelines.</p><h2>Thanks</h2><p>Thanks to all our Chaos Mesh <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/graphs/contributors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contributors</a>!</p><p>If you are interested in Chaos Mesh, you’re welcome to join us by submitting issues, or contributing code, documentation, or articles. We look forward to your participation and feedback!</p></section></div>]]>

September 25, 2020 | https://www.causal.app/blog/calculus-in-saas | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.causal.app/blog/calculus-in-saas">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Note:&nbsp;this was originally published at </em><a href="https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/" target="_blank"><em>https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/</em></a>‍</p><p>I have been studying the SaaS model in depth for almost 7 years now. Since the day <a href="https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/p/harry-2d5d1af6bf">Harry Weller</a> walked into my office with a stack of materials and told me to study it and then SaaS build models and bring them to portfolio companies, I don't think a day has gone by where I have not thought about the conceptual and operational nuances of the recurring revenue business model.</p><p>Somewhere around mid 2015 I had my "aha" moment in my research when I tied my academic training in mechanical engineering to the startup business models I was building: it's all calculus. The integral-derivative relationship applies incredibly well to the ARR and Recognized Revenue relationship. Making this connection between engineering math and financial math gave me a feeling that only a true nerd could appreciate: the joy of putting integral symbols and accounting terms on the same slide.</p><p>The simplest way to illustrate this mathematical parallel is with a car:</p><figure id="w-node-2abd43418357-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5f649b33c9e3271323643b3d_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F42d5ef92-52d9-49fe-8be7-16028bee1ff4_884x306.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>If a car is moving at 60mph, then in one hour it will travel 60 miles (assuming its speed does not change). That is the definition of "miles per hour." ARR is very similar: if a company is "moving" at $10M ARR, then in one year it will recognize $10M of revenue (assuming everything stays consistent). Recognized revenue is the distance, ARR is the speed. It's critical to recognize that ARR is a rate at a specific point in time used to imply something (here, expected recognized revenue in the future period).</p><p>For the more accounting oriented, another analogy can be made to the balance sheet:</p><figure id="w-node-9fc87f218c80-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5f649b3392b0138c4e64006b_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F6c06ddcc-de3e-4d96-960a-22b4b39e334e_842x455.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>While revenue is the top line metric on the income statement, ARR works more like a balance sheet metric: it is taken at a single point in time rather than over a period of time. This can make income statements confusing and misaligned - another example of the divergence of accounting in economics in subscription businesses.</p><p>Now back to calculus... if the ARR function was actually a mathematical equation, you could integrate it. If y = 10x where y = ARR and x = time in months, then after two months ARR = $20. After 12 months, ARR = $120 (assuming we start from $0 of ARR). So at the end of a year, the business has grown from $0 to $120 in ARR. But what is the recognized revenue? The complex answer is that it's the integral of 10x from 0 to 12 months. (Apologies in advance if this triggers a high school calculus flashback.)</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5f649b337d3c7911d7362b81_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252Ff7fcb57f-644b-490c-bfa8-6d0c986d2fda_305x80.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>You could also chart this out and see that it is a right triangle with the area of 1/2*base*height. Where the base is 12 months and the height is $120: $1,440/2 = $720).</p><p>Pretty cool relationship and calculation conceptually, but in real businesses ARR growth doesn't fit a simple equation (or any equation at all), so it's not inherently practical to start breaking out the power rule and your old textbooks to predict ARR growth.</p><p>If we switch back to the car analogy, it takes on a little more of a nuanced meaning. Just like a business doesn't grow on a smooth curve, car speeds do not either. Just like the gas pedal makes the car go faster and the brake pedal &amp; friction make it go slower, so too in a SaaS company, <a href="https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/p/thin-slicing-arr">the new sales are making the speed/ARR increase and the churned customers are making the speed/ARR decrease</a>. I will dive into more details in later posts, but the goal in a car is to go as far and fast as you can while burning the least amount of fuel. So too in a SaaS company, the goal is to have the highest ARR you can, recognize the most revenue and burn the least cash. You can think about SaaS Magic Number like the fuel efficiency of a SaaS business - looking forward to diving into why this is actually helpful in building a company.</p></div></div>]]>

The comments suggested that there's something odd in Japanese copyright law about taking screenshots of films, and that Studio Ghibli might have furnished these to help keep people talking about their films in reviews and whatnot.</p>

<p>A more useful comment gave a nice tip for scraping the images in a single <code>wget</code> command:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>wget</span> --random-wait --timestamping http://www.ghibli.jp/gallery/<span>{</span>ged,chihiro,karigurashi,ponyo,kokurikozaka,marnie,kaguyahime,kazetachinu<span>}</span><span>{</span>001<span>..</span>050<span>}</span>.jpg</code></pre></div>
<p>This uses the nice shell trick of using curly braces <code>{}</code> to expand commands and <code>..</code> to expand in a numerical or alphabetical series. I first encountered this technique in the MIT course for <a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/">The Missing Semester of your CS Education</a>, which I highly recommend checking out.</p>
<p>For example, <code>echo foo.{png,jpg}</code> will expand to <code>echo foo.png foo.jpg</code>, and <code>echo {1..10}</code> will expand to <code>echo 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10</code>. </p>
<p>Perhaps this might prove useful in your terminal travels.</p>
<p>Back to Ghibli. So, now that I've got all these screenshots downloaded, what can I do with them?</p>
<h2>My little Raspberry Pi server</h2>
<p>I've got a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08C4SK5C3/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=whatrocks09-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B08C4SK5C3&amp;linkId=6371e9a8ce20a36236014adee9eaa56e">Raspberry Pi 4 with 8GB RAM</a> on my home network that I can connect to via <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a>. Usually, I like to SSH in there and <code>sudo apt-get update</code> and <code>sudo apt-get upgrade</code> just to feel alive. But I also have a few other use-cases.</p>
<p>I run a <a href="https://www.plex.tv/">Plex</a> server on the Pi. For a while, I also experimented with running <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a> on the Pi, but I just don't have that many internet of things devices (yet). I'm also planning to set up Minecraft server on the Pi, but I haven't found a non-sketchy tutorial yet.</p>
<p>Finally, I also occasionally VNC in using VNC Viewer to check out the latest magazines in the awesome Raspberry Pi magazine app, where they have free subscriptions all these awesome "maker" magazines. This alone is worth the price of a Pi, IMHO.</p>
<p>But, I was getting pretty tired of looking at the same stock desktop background everytime I VNC'ed in.</p>
<h3>Using the Ghibli images as the Pi's desktop background</h3>
<p>There's a neat command to change your Pi's desktop background from the terminal:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>pcman --set-wallpaper /home/pi/Pictures/ghibli/ged009.jpg</code></pre></div>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/static/555d1ff4e6dce7d4942dff1af03b1745/0f98f/ged009.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

<p>Make sure that you've given the proper directory location for your Ghibli images, which, of course, you can get with the <code>pwd</code> print working directory command.</p>
<p>Now, I've already admit that I enjoy manually running apt-get updates, but I definitely don't want to be manually changing the background, so how about some automation?</p>
<h3>Automating a rotating background with a cron job</h3>
<p>We can use a simple cron job for this! First, let's write a one-liner command to randomly set the background from an image in our folder:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>ls</span> /home/pi/Pictures/ghibli <span>|</span> <span>shuf</span> -n <span>1</span> <span>|</span> <span>xargs</span> -I<span>{</span><span>}</span> pcmanfm --set-wallpaper /home/pi/Pictures/ghibli/<span>{</span><span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It looks kinda hairy, but it's pretty simple. First, we list the contents of our directory, then we used <code>shuf</code> to randomly select one of the files. In fact, if you just stopped there, your output would look like this:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>ls</span> /home/pi/Pictures/ghibli <span>|</span> <span>shuf</span> -n <span>1</span>
karigurashi024.jpg</code></pre></div>
<p>But we want to pipe this randomly selected file to the <code>pcmanfm</code> command! I'm using <code>xargs</code> to do that in the next part of the command. There's probably an easier way, but this works for me.</p>
<p>So, now that we have our command to randomly select a background, we just need to write a cron job to run this command every... let's say, ten minutes. First, open up your computer's crontab file:</p>

<p>And add this to the bottom:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>*/10 * * * * ls /home/pi/Pictures/ghibli | shuf -n 1 | xargs -I{} pcmanfm --set-wallpaper /home/pi/Pictures/ghibli/{}</code></pre></div>
<p>Save the file, and you're done. Right? No. That didn't work for me. Let's look at the cron logs with this command: <code>grep CRON /var/log/syslog</code></p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>raspberrypi CRON[3870]: (pi) CMD (DISPLAY=:0.0 &amp;&amp; ls /home/pi/Pictures/ghibli | shuf -n 1 | xargs -I{} pcmanfm --set-wallpaper /home/pi/Pictures/ghibli/{})
raspberrypi CRON[3866]: (CRON) info (No MTA installed, discarding output)</code></pre></div>
<p>Not super helful. It does confirm that job ran, which is good, though. That rules out cron syntax errors. This <code>info</code> log is interesting. Discarding output. I don't like the sound of that. Googling reveals that we need to install a local mail server, so here we go.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>sudo</span> <span>apt-get</span> <span>install</span> postfix</code></pre></div>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/static/5af659ddcc5a54584ababc4499e3448d/bff4e/postfix.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    <span></span>
  <img alt="postfix" title="postfix" src="https://www.charlieharrington.com/static/5af659ddcc5a54584ababc4499e3448d/a6d36/postfix.png" srcset="https://www.charlieharrington.com/static/5af659ddcc5a54584ababc4499e3448d/222b7/postfix.png 163w,

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>You should choose a "Local" installation. Once we have a mail server, we can now inspect the cron job "mail" logs:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>sudo tail -f /var/mail/pi</code></pre></div>
<p>After a bunch of email header jargon, we finally see the error:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Cannot open display: 

--1332E5E8FA.1601069882/raspberrypi--</code></pre></div>
<p>Awesome! I mean, the cron job still doesn't work, but at least we have some more info. That's a win. So, what have we learned? It seems like our cron job can't "open" the display. Some more Googling suggests that I need to add an env var for the display, so I add this <code>export DISPLAY=:0.0</code> to the beginning on my cron job right after the cron syntax.</p>
<p>Did that fix it? No. But we get a new error message:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Message: x-terminal-emulator has very limited support, consider choose another terminal</code></pre></div>
<p>Cool. Okay, so, what does this one mean? This <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45873124/pcmanfm-set-wallpaper-fails-on-raspbian-stretch-in-cron">stack overflow answer</a> suggests that I may need to add another env var to my command. Here goes:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>*/10 * * * * export DISPLAY=":0.0" XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/usr/1000  ls /home/pi/Pictures/ghibli | shuf -n 1 | xargs -I{} pcmanfm --set-wallpaper /home/pi/Pictures/ghibli/{}</code></pre></div>
<p>Yes! Our cron job works!</p>

<p>What are these <code>DISPLAY</code> and <code>XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</code>? According to <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/872792/what-is-xdg-runtime-dir">this other Stack Overflow answer</a>, <code>DISPLAY</code> is an address for your display and <code>XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</code> is a place to store temporary files for your user. Probably some more to dig into here, but for now, I'm just going to stare at my VNC Viewer and watch the background change.</p>
<p>After all this Googling and debugging, we've now got all these cute images keeping our computer happy, even when we're not there.</p>
<p>Automating stuff like this is part of the magic of computers. And that's why I think it goes so well with these magical Studio Ghibli images.</p>
<h2>Watching the Studio Ghibli films</h2>
<p>But, now I've got a ticking clock... </p>
<p>I hate spoilers, and I'm sad to say that I've only seen Howl's Moving Castle (after reading the book earlier this year). I loved it, much more so than book. Which means I need to watch all the Ghibli films <em>fast</em>, before I spoil my way through them with my desktop backgrounds.</p>
<p>In our first episode of the <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/escaping-web-season-one-retrospective">Escaping Web podcast</a>, Oz and I chatted with Felix Tripier who brought up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave_of_the_Fireflies">Grave of the Fireflies</a>. I didn't know about the film during our conversation, but I've just discovered that it's available on Hulu. I'll be watching it very soon. As for the rest of films, I've heard they're on HBO GOMAXPROPLUS in the US and Netflix everywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>For now, I'm just glad to have these images on my little server whenever I log in. It's a nice happy thing in my life, and I thank the orange website for the tiny dose of inspiration.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk showed the road to 56% cheaper batteries in the near future. This would be achieved with Tesla’s breakthrough innovations in cell chemistry and materials, simplifying and speeding up the cell manufacturing processes, a <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/09/23/model-y-giga-casting-structural-battery-innovations-battery-day-part-1/#structural-battery">structural battery</a>, and the new 4680 form factor.</p>

<h2>4680 cell-based battery architecture</h2>



<p>Vehicle teardown expert Sandy Munro has further analyzed how much this new cell form factor can help Tesla achieve its battery goals. According to his calculations, in the same space of the current 74 kWh <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-y/">Tesla Model Y</a> battery pack, a 130 kWh battery can be accommodated — that’s about double the energy storage.</p>

<p>2170 cell is 5000 mAh and Munro’s analysis says the 4680 new Tesla cell will be around ~9000 mAH. Currently, 4,416 (2170) cells are placed inside a <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-3/">Tesla Model 3</a> and Model Y Long-Range battery packs, there will only be 960 cells required to fill the same space (see Fig 2 above).</p>



<p>The 4680 cell-based battery pack will be much simpler and cheaper to build. The 2170 based battery pack architecture is made of cells divided into 4 modules and further into bricks of 46 cells each and every module requires is own controller circuit. </p>

<p>This complexity will be eliminated by using the new 4680 cell design and coupled with the tabless cell construction, the manufacturing process becomes even simpler requiring fewer parts.</p>



<p>Sandy Munro even showed one of the Model Y module spaces filled with his 5070 dummy cells which he predicted before the Battery Day, pretty close idea and the size estimate (see Fig 4).</p>

<p>During the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/09/23/model-y-giga-casting-structural-battery-innovations-battery-day-part-1/#presentation">Battery Day presentation</a>, Elon Musk presented a slide that shows the dissection of 2170 vs. 4680 battery pack. If we look closely (see Fig 6 below), the cooling tubes we see in Fig 5 above are at the bottom of the battery pack.</p>



<figure data-amp-lightbox="true"><amp-img src="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4680-Battery-Cooling-Bottom-1024x576.jpg" alt="4680 cell-based battery pack to have the coolant tubes under the cells not on the sides like the current 2170 cell-based batteries." srcset="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4680-Battery-Cooling-Bottom-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4680-Battery-Cooling-Bottom-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4680-Battery-Cooling-Bottom-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4680-Battery-Cooling-Bottom.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" width="1024" height="576" data-amp-lightbox="" lightbox="" layout="intrinsic" disable-inline-width="" i-amphtml-layout="intrinsic"><img src="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4680-Battery-Cooling-Bottom-1024x576.jpg" alt="4680 cell-based battery pack to have the coolant tubes under the cells not on the sides like the current 2170 cell-based batteries." srcset="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4680-Battery-Cooling-Bottom-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4680-Battery-Cooling-Bottom-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4680-Battery-Cooling-Bottom-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4680-Battery-Cooling-Bottom.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" width="1024" height="576" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyBoZWlnaHQ9JzU3Nicgd2lkdGg9JzEwMjQnIHhtbG5zPSdodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZycgdmVyc2lvbj0nMS4xJy8+"></amp-img><figcaption>Fig 6: 4680 cell-based battery pack to have the coolant tubes under the cells, not on the sides like the current 2170 cell-based batteries.</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to Sandy Munro, the right way to cool down the batteries is from top and bottom. Currently, in the 2170 battery packs, the cells are cooled from the sides but in the future, Tesla is planning to do it the right way, installing a cooling plate underneath the batteries.</p>



<h2>Rigidity &amp; safety</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/09/23/model-y-giga-casting-structural-battery-innovations-battery-day-part-1/#structural-battery">Tesla Structural Battery</a> with new formation of the 4680 cells will be as rigid as a brick you could ever imagine, says Sandy Munro. With single-piece front and rear castings and the structural battery in the middle, Tesla cars will be virtually twist-proof in an accident.</p>



<p>In Elon Musk’s words at the Battery Day event, this formation will reduce the impact of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_moment_of_inertia#:~:text=Simply%20put%2C%20the%20polar%20moment,material%20composition%20or%20shear%20modulus." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">polar moment of inertia</a>, making Tesla vehicles even safer than they already are.</p>

</amp-ad>
</figure>



<h2>Weight &amp; cost reductions</h2>



<p>Sandy Munro measured the length of the steel case cover of the 2170 battery cells and found out that with lesser number of 4680 cells, Tesla will alone be able to reduce around 30-40% use of steel in the battery pack (see Fig 7 below).</p>



<figure data-amp-lightbox="true"><amp-img src="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Steel-Case-4680-vs-2170.-1024x576.jpg" alt="Usage of steel reduces about 30-40% with the new 4680 battery cells (infographic)." srcset="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Steel-Case-4680-vs-2170.-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Steel-Case-4680-vs-2170.-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Steel-Case-4680-vs-2170.-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Steel-Case-4680-vs-2170..jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" width="1024" height="576" data-amp-lightbox="" lightbox="" layout="intrinsic" disable-inline-width="" i-amphtml-layout="intrinsic"><img src="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Steel-Case-4680-vs-2170.-1024x576.jpg" alt="Usage of steel reduces about 30-40% with the new 4680 battery cells (infographic)." srcset="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Steel-Case-4680-vs-2170.-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Steel-Case-4680-vs-2170.-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Steel-Case-4680-vs-2170.-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Steel-Case-4680-vs-2170..jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" width="1024" height="576" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyBoZWlnaHQ9JzU3Nicgd2lkdGg9JzEwMjQnIHhtbG5zPSdodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZycgdmVyc2lvbj0nMS4xJy8+"></amp-img><figcaption>Usage of steel reduces about 30-40% with the new 4680 battery cells (infographic).</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another cost and time savings with the usage of new 4680 cells will come from reducing the number of connections between the cells. With a significant number of fewer cells, the new battery pack will require around 1,800 connections compared to the current packs with ~8,800 wire tabs.</p>



<p>Sandy Munro then goes on to praise the brilliant idea of the single-piece front and rear underbody castings. A concept he has been promoting since 2017 but no automaker adopted it except for Tesla.</p>

                <p><strong>14 August 2020</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dear Prime Minister, </strong></p>

<p><strong>Dear Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice,</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dear Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dear Home Secretary,</strong></p>





<p>We write to you as legal practitioners and legal academics to express our collective concerns about the violations of Mr. Julian Assange’s fundamental human, civil and political rights and the precedent his persecution is setting.</p>



<p>We call on you to act in accordance with national and international law, human rights and the rule of law by bringing an end to the ongoing extradition proceedings and granting Mr. Assange his long overdue freedom – freedom from torture, arbitrary detention and deprivation of liberty, and political persecution.</p>



<ol>
	<li><strong>ILLEGALITY OF POTENTIAL EXTRADITION TO THE UNITED STATES</strong></li>
</ol>



<p><strong>Extradition of Mr. Assange from the UK to the US would be illegal on the following grounds: </strong></p>



<ol>
	<li><strong>Risk of being subjected to an unfair trial in the US</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Extradition would be unlawful owing to failure to ensure the protection of Mr. Assange’s fundamental trial rights in the US. Mr. Assange faces show trial at the infamous “Espionage court” of the Eastern District of Virginia, before which no national security defendant has ever succeeded. Here, he faces secret proceedings before a jury picked from a population in which most of the individuals eligible for jury selection work for, or are connected to, the CIA, NSA, DOD or DOS.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><sup><sup>[i]</sup></sup></a></p>



<p>Furthermore, Mr. Assange’s<strong> </strong>legal privilege, a right enshrined in Art. 8 European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and long recognised under English common law, was grossly violated through<strong> </strong>constant and criminal video and audio surveillance at the Ecuadorian embassy carried out by the Spanish security firm, UC Global. This surveillance was, according to witness testimony, ordered by the CIA and has triggered an investigation into the owner of UC Global, David Morales, by Spain’s High Court, the Audiencia Nacional.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a> The surveillance resulted in all of Mr. Assange’s meetings and conversations being recorded, including those with his lawyers. The Council of Bar and Law Societies of Europe, which represents more than a million European lawyers, has expressed its concerns that these illegal recordings may be used – openly or secretly – in proceedings against Mr. Assange in the event of successful extradition to the US. The Council states that if the information merely became known to the prosecutors, this would present an irremediable breach of Mr. Assange’s fundamental rights to a fair trial under Art. 6 of the ECHR and due process under the US Constitution.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><sup><sup>[iii]</sup></sup></a> Furthermore, the prosecuting state obtained the totality of Mr. Assange’s legal papers after their unlawful seizure in the Embassy. Upon hearing that the Government of Ecuador was planning to seize and hand over personal belongings of Mr. Assange, including documents, telephones, electronic devices, memory drives, etc. to the US, the UN Special Rapporteur on Privacy, Joseph Cannataci, expressed his serious concern to the Ecuadorian government and twice formally requested it to return Mr. Assange's personal effects to his lawyers, to no avail.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><sup><sup>[iv]</sup></sup></a> <strong>The UN Model Treaty on Extradition prohibits extradition if the person has not received, or would not receive, the minimum guarantees in criminal proceedings, as enshrined in Art. 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).</strong><a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><sup><sup>[v]</sup></sup></a></p>



<ol start="2">
	<li><strong>The political nature of the offence prohibits extradition</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>The US superseding indictment issued against Mr. Assange on the 24 June 2020 charges him with 18 counts all related solely to the 2010 publications of US government documents. The publications, comprising information about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, US diplomatic cables and Guantanamo Bay, revealed evidence of war crimes, corruption and governmental malfeasance.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><sup><sup>[vi]</sup></sup></a></p>



<p>Charges 1-17 are brought under the Espionage Act 1917, which, in name alone, reveals the political and antiquated nature of the charges.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><sup><sup>[vii]</sup></sup></a><strong> </strong>Furthermore, the essence of the 18 charges concerns Mr. Assange’s alleged intention to obtain or disclose US state “secrets” in a manner that was damaging to the strategic and national security interests of the US state, to the capability of its armed forces, the work of the security and intelligence services of the US, and to the interests of the US abroad. Thus, the conduct, motivation and purpose attributed to Mr. Assange confirm the political character of the 17 charges brought under the Espionage Act (‘pure political’ offences) and of the hacking charge (a ‘relative political’ offence). In addition, several US government officials have at various times ascribed motives “hostile” to the US to Mr. Assange, an Australian citizen.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><sup><sup>[viii]</sup></sup></a> <strong>The UK-US Extradition Treaty, which provides the very basis of the extradition request, specifically prohibits extradition for political offences in Art. 4(1). </strong>Yet the presiding judge and prosecution wish to simply disregard this article by referring to the Extradition Act 2003 (“EA”) instead, which does not include the political offence exception. This blatantly ignores the fact that the EA is merely an enabling act that creates the minimum statutory safeguards, but it does not preclude stronger protections from extradition as expressly provided in subsequently ratified treaties such as the UK-US Extradition Treaty. <strong>Furthermore, there is broad international consensus that political offences should not be the basis of extradition.<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><sup><strong><sup>[ix]</sup></strong></sup></a> This is reflected in Art. 3 of the 1957 European Convention on Extradition, Art. 3 ECHR, Art. 3(a) of the UN Model Treaty on Extradition, the Interpol Constitution and every bilateral treaty ratified by the US for over a century.</strong></p>



<ol start="3">
	<li><strong>Risk of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in the US</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“the UN Rapporteur on Torture”), Professor Nils Melzer, has expressed with certainty that, if extradited to the US, Mr. Assange will be exposed to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Similar concerns have also been raised by the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, and Amnesty International has recently restated its concerns in relation to the unacceptable risk of mistreatment.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><sup><sup>[x]</sup></sup></a></p>



<p>The detention conditions, and the draconian punishment of 175 years, in a maximum security prison, which Mr. Assange faces under the US indictment, would constitute torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, according to the current UN Rapporteur on Torture and according to the<strong> </strong>consistently expressed opinion of his predecessor, as well as of NGOs and legal authorities.<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><sup><sup>[xi]</sup></sup></a></p>



<p>If extradited, Mr. Assange would, by the US government’s own admission, likely be placed under Special Administrative Measures. These measures prohibit prisoners from contact or communication with all but a few approved individuals, and any approved individuals would not be permitted to report information concerning the prisoner’s treatment to the public, thereby shielding potential torture from public scrutiny and government from accountability.<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><sup><sup>[xii]</sup></sup></a></p>



<p><strong>Under the principle of non-refoulement, it is not permissible to extradite a person to a country in which there are substantial grounds for</strong> <strong>believing that they would be subjected to torture. This principle is enshrined in the 1951 UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, specifically Art. 33(1) from which no derogations are permitted. Also relevant are Art. 3(1) UN Declaration on Territorial Asylum 1967, Art. 3 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT)</strong>,<strong> and Art. 2 of the Resolution on Asylum to Persons in Danger of Persecution, adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in 1967. As an obligation arising from the prohibition of torture, the principle of non-refoulement in this area is absolute and also takes on the character of a peremptory norm of customary international law, i.e. jus cogens.<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""><sup><strong><sup>[xiii]</sup></strong></sup></a></strong></p>



<p><strong>Mr. Assange, who was accepted as a political asylee by the Ecuadorian government owing to what have proved to have been wholly legitimate fears of political persecution and torture in the US, should clearly have been accorded protection of this principle, firstly by Ecuador and secondly by the UK. Ecuador violated its human rights obligations by summarily rescinding Mr. Assange’s asylum in direct contradiction of the ‘Latin American tradition of asylum’<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""><sup><strong><sup>[xiv]</sup></strong></sup></a> and the Advisory Opinion </strong><strong>OC-25/18 of 30 May 2018 of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights affirming the principle of non-refoulement in cases of persons who have entered an embassy for protection.<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""><sup><strong><sup>[xv]</sup></strong></sup></a> The entry of the Ecuadorian Embassy by UK police and the arrest of Mr. Assange were thus based on an illegal revocation of his nationality and asylum, which can only be rectified by the UK upholding its own duty to protect the principle of non-refoulement by denying extradition to the US.</strong></p>



<p><strong>B) VIOLATIONS OF THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS AND THE RIGHT TO KNOW</strong></p>



<p>Counts 1-17 of the indictment under the Espionage Act violate the right to freedom of expression, the right to freedom of the press and the right to know. These counts present standard and necessary investigative journalistic practices as criminal.<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""><sup><sup>[xvi]</sup></sup></a> Such practices include indicating availability to receive information, indicating what information is of interest, encouraging the provision of information, receipt of information for the purpose of publication, and publication of information in the public interest.</p>



<p>Under the charge of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, the initial indictment criminalised also Mr. Assange’s alleged attempt at helping his source to maintain their anonymity while providing the documents in question, which falls squarely under the standard journalistic practice and duty of protecting the …</p></div></div>

September 25, 2020 | https://tpaschalis.github.io/casio-f91w/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tpaschalis.github.io/casio-f91w/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Here’s a picture of my Casio F-91W.</p>

<center>
<img src="https://tpaschalis.github.io/images/casio-f91w.png">
</center>

<p>It’s not fancy, expensive or impressive, but it’s one of my most beloved material possessions (as in, I’d be a little bummed if it was lost or stolen).</p>

<p>I’ve had it for around a year now, and the impulse to get one came from <a href="https://dvt.name/2019/06/03/hacking-the-casio-f-91w-to-handle-1000-psi/">this</a> article about hacking one to handle 1000+ PSI (or ~700m deep). It’s not the most fashionable accessory, has been touted a <a href="https://reaperfeed.com/how-did-the-casio-f91w-become-a-terrorist-icon/">terrorist icon</a>, but as David mentioned above, it’s probably the only watch worn by both Obama and Osama so it’s got <em>that</em> going for it.</p>

<p>Jokes aside, I feel that it is an excellent piece of hardware, and the reason I love it is that it embodies many of the things I actually love about technology, and how it can empower humanity.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Great Design<br>
It’s actually not that common to find modern interfaces with <em>three</em> buttons. Most toasters or fridges nowadays have more. I’m not sure whether it’s state of the art, but I feel that Dan Norman would be happy to use one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Simplicity, Discoverability <br>
Its entire functionality can fit in <del>four</del> <a href="https://twitter.com/tpaschalis_/status/1309453292011958273">three tweets</a>, and the manual (not that you need one, but available <a href="https://www.instructionsmanuals.com/sites/default/files/2019-06/Casio-qw415_587_590_593_595_596-en.pdf">here</a>) fits in one page, including pictures. The physical interface and ‘software’, if you can call it that, are seamlessly connected, and I believe anyone could figure how it works even if she hasn’t seen a digital watch in her life.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Less is More<br>
There is the place for a fourth button, but designers said <em>scratch that</em>, we don’t need it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Affordability<br>
Its price (around €10 or less for clones), makes it accessible for nearly everyone in the globe.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Robustness, Build Quality<br>
Battery life is about 7 years. The watch itself doesn’t feel too cheap, is water-resistant, and I don’t ever think about taking it off when getting my hands dirty.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Disassembly and Repairability<br>
It’s quite easy to disassemble the watch; there are no constructs in place to actively discourage you from doing so. Want to replace the battery? Just remove 4 screws on the back! Want to silence the beeping sound? Easy as well. Don’t like the strap? Grab your tools! This simplicity also contributes to its resiliency and trustworthiness.<br>
People have built <a href="http://casiomod.club/">businesses</a> and communities around <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/casio/comments/f9ugyu/the_bestworst_casio_f91w_modifications_awards/">modding</a> F91Ws; from adding NFC and SD-card holders, to changing the light color or inverting the screen colors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Timelessness <br>
Introduced back in 1989, it has inspired a whole family of variants and still produces over 3 million pieces per year. Ιt’s not that often that digital devices maintain their relevance 30+ years in the future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Limitations<br>
Sure, it’s not perfect. It doesn’t adjust itself for leap years, the light could be brighter, the stopwatch can only count up to one hour, and its accuracy is ±30 seconds per month (~6 minutes per year). But there aren’t any ‘clever’ workarounds to ‘hide’ or make up for them; they’re part of the deal.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="so-what">So, what?</h2>

<p>I’m not sure if you agree, but these are qualities that are hard to find condensed into one product.</p>

<p>I long for the day we can construct F91W-equivalent smartphones, power generators or vehicles for everyone on the planet, and wish for more F91W-like command-line prompts or websites.  I’m talking about tools that are more than fashion statements of brag material, but useful in their own right without having to constantly remind us of their relevance.</p>

<p>But that’s what technology is about, right? Combining art (techne) and skill (-logia) to build things that can make our world a better place™.</p>

The Casio F91W is amazing in many ways. 

One of the most interesting is how its _entire_ functionality can fit in two^H^H three tweets.

Just remember, there are 3 buttons counting anti-clockwise (L), (C) and (A).

~~~
Button (C) always cycles through 'modes'.
- Timekeeping mode; (L) turns the light on. (A) toggles between 12/24-hours view. Long press (A) for an authenticity check.
- Alarm mode; (L) highlights fields (hour/minute) to set, and (A) advances them.
~~~
In alarm mode, press (C) to toggle the alarm, the hourly beep or both. Long pressing (A) sound-tests the alarm.
- Setup Mode; (L) highlights fields to set, from hours, minutes, month, day-of-month, day of week. Use (A) to advance the fields or long press (A) to advance quickly 
~~~
- Stopwatch mode; Press (C) to start/stop the stopwatch. If the timer is stopped, (A) clears the timer. 
If the timer is running, (A) records laptimes, while the timer continues running in the background.
If you stay idle for a minute you'll return in timekeeping mode.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Florin Moldoveanu researches the foundation of quantum mechanics with emphasis on quantum mechanics reconstruction and solving the measurement problem. After getting his PhD in theoretical physics at the University of Maryland at College Park in 1999, he pursued a career in industry. Three years ago he started the transition back from industry to academia and became an adjunct professor at George Mason University. His earlier graduate student research papers in theoretical physics received 267 citations to date.</p><hr><p>More than two years ago, on February 26<sup>th</sup> 2018, I was contacted by the <strong>Royal Society Open Science Journal</strong> to referee a submitted manuscript. Two prior referees had accepted the paper and two had rejected it, and I was the tiebreaker. The manuscript, <em>Quantum Correlations are Weaved by the Spinors of the Euclidean Primitives</em> by Joy Christian, basically claims that Bell’s theorem is incorrect. If true, this would be a game changer in the foundation of quantum mechanics. Bell’s theorem shows that it is impossible to construct a local realistic model of the theory.</p><p>Bell’s result is an impossibility proof; it attracts such passion as the impossibility of perpetual motion machines that were so popular some 100 years ago. A manuscript claiming the invention of a working perpetual motion device, proof that Earth is flat (yes, there is such a thing as an annual conference of Flat-Earth-ers), or that the sun circles Earth would be rejected by any respectable journal right away.</p><p>So, what if someone managed to “disprove” Bell’s theorem and, better yet, to publish that “discovery”? This would create lots of debates and excitement – certainly, notoriety and free publicity for the journal who published your claim. In other words, good business.</p><p>But who is claiming to have “disproven” Bell theorem? Enter Joy Christian, who has been asserting this claim for 13 years. It was debunked by many scientists and scientific panels over the years, yet Christian is not having any of it. Basically, he alleges to have found a method for obtaining the quantum correlation of a Bell pair of particles, by using a Bell “loophole”. In the no-mans-land at the intersection of physics, mathematics, and philosophy, experts in all three fields are scarce. Christian’s ‘method’ is based on a mathematical error, which is ultimately adding apples and oranges, but the error is hard to spot if you are not a genuine expert in geometric algebra. Add to this the language and structure of a well-written physics paper and you might convince an unsuspecting referee to approve your manuscript.</p><p>I had found Christian’s mistake again in the manuscript and I recommended to reject the paper. Certain that it would never be published, I went about my daily business. Imagine my surprise when I heard Christian had somehow managed to publish his nonsense. I thought this impossible; the vote had been 3 to 2 for rejection. I checked and found that indeed, the paper had gotten accepted after submitting a revision. <strong>However,</strong><strong>I was not contacted by the journal to review the revision. </strong>I started contacting colleagues who had to deal with Joy’s claims before, and together with Philippe Grangier, Richard Gill, Howard Wiseman, Brukner Časlav, Gregor Weihs, and Scott Aaronson, in a letter to the journal on July 28<sup>th</sup> 2018, we asked that the article be withdrawn:</p><p><em>Dear Editor-in-Chief,</em></p><p><em>We are writing to you about the publication of the paper “Quantum Correlations are weaved by the spinors of the Euclidean primitives” by Joy Christian in your journal on May 30 2018&nbsp;</em><a href="http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/5/5/180526" target="_blank"><em>http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/5/5/180526</em></a></p><p><em>The result of this paper conflicts with an established scientific fact (Bell’s theorem) well known in the foundations of quantum physics and a basis of modern quantum information science; moreover, the subject of recent high-profile experiments (“loophole free tests of Bell’s theorem”). The paper contains numerous errors in elementary algebra, calculus, and logic. The manuscript was rejected by three of the five reviewers,&nbsp;but the editorial process as stated to the reviewers by your journal was not followed:&nbsp;the manuscript was accepted without informing the reviewers&nbsp;and giving them a chance to rebut the misleading statements made by the author (see review history on the link above).</em></p><p><em>The claims made by the author are well known from 2007 and they were disproven in the past (</em><a href="https://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/1577" target="_blank"><em>https://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/1577</em></a><em>&nbsp;). From time to time Joy Christian attempts to publish his faulty claims and recently a similar paper was withdrawn by Annals of Physics&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003491616300975" target="_blank"><em>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003491616300975</em></a></p><p><em>The journal did extend an invitation to write a rebuttal paper but stated that Joy Christian would be a reviewer to the rebuttal. This is not an acceptable course of action from an ethical point of view because it legitimizes scientific dishonesty on behalf of Joy Christian who is well aware of the issues with his arguments for more than 10 years and yet continues to obfuscate the truth.</em></p><p><em>Considering this, we are respectfully asking your journal to withdraw the paper.</em></p><p><em>Sincerely,</em></p><p><em>Florin Moldoveanu&nbsp;- George Mason University (reviewer 5)</em></p><p><em>Richard Gill – Leiden University</em></p><p><em>Howard Wiseman – Griffith University (reviewer 3)</em></p><p><em>Scott Aaronson - University of Texas</em></p><p><em>Philippe Grangier - Institute of Optics, Charles Fabry Laboratory</em></p><p><em>Brukner Caslav - IQOQI - Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information Vienna</em></p><p><em>Gregor Weihs – Innsbruck University</em></p><p>This was about two years ago. We kept asking for updates, and when not stonewalling us, the journal kept pushing one roadblock after another.</p><p>The <strong>Royal Society Open Science Journal had more than two years to get their act together. By now, their silence speaks louder than words.</strong></p><p>It is unconscionable that instead of putting extra checks in place for authors with a history of inaccurate publications, the journal violated their own peer review policy and chose to maintain a faulty paper instead of withdrawing it.</p><p>We gave the journal the benefit of the doubt for two years. The passing of time made it clear that the decision to maintain the faulty paper is no accident and no mistake.</p><p>Perhaps this is a symptom of a larger systemic problem with open journals who are paid by the authors to get their papers (usually rejected elsewhere) published. When your salary and livelihood depend on the people you are supposed to enforce rules upon, the temptation to bend those rules is high.</p><p>I grew up in a former communist country of the eastern bloc. At the time of communism, a rule supposed to be enforced by the traffic police was that if you pay for a traffic ticket on the spot, you will be charged with half the fine. You might guess that most officers pocketed that money. The rule only solidified endemic corruption.</p><p>In our case, the author is well known for making the same incorrect argument over and over again. However, <strong>the root of the problem seems to be with the journal</strong>. After all, had they followed their own policy, the problem would not have arisen in the first place. And in case the mistake was genuine (as sometimes mistakes do happen), is two years enough time to get the record straight? It makes me wonder: just how often did the editors turn a blind eye to publication issues to secure revenue? <strong>Is it really a good idea that those in charge of rule enforcement are financially dependent on the rule violators? </strong></p></div></div>]]>

<p>Microsoft has been increasingly supporting Linux, and the latest application coming to Linux is the Microsoft Edge web browser. About a year ago we saw <a href="https://build5nines.com/microsoft-teams-first-office-app-linux/">Microsoft Teams released as the first Office app for Linux</a>, and now we’re seeing Microsofts Edge web browser too.</p>



<p>Starting in October 2020, Microsoft Edge on Linux will be available to download from the Dev preview channel. Once available, you will be able to go to the <a href="https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/?form=MO12HB&amp;OCID=MO12HB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Edge Insiders site</a> to download the preview channel of Microsoft Edge on Linux. Alternatively, you will be able to download the application from the native Linux package manager.</p>



<blockquote><p>Starting in October 2020, Microsoft Edge on Linux will be available for download.</p></blockquote>



<p>Once Microsoft Edge on Linux is made available, you will be able to follow the link below to download the application. The Beta, Dev, and Canary Microsoft Edge Insider Channels will be made available for Microsoft Edge on Linux; just as they are for the Windows and macOS platforms.</p>







<p>Also, just as with other platforms, Microsoft will be open to feedback on their new Microsoft Edge browser release for Linux. This builds on their goal to serve customers the best way possible.</p>

		<p>Researchers from St&nbsp;Petersburg University have developed the NeuroPrint soft neuroprosthesis 3D&nbsp;printing technology. In&nbsp;the long term, this can help paralyzed people after spinal cord injury. The new development has already shown its effectiveness in&nbsp;studies on&nbsp;mammals and zebrafish. The results are published in&nbsp;<!--noindex--><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-020-00615-7" target="_blank" rel="1">Nature Biomedical Engineering</a><!--/noindex-->.</p>
<p><img src="https://english.spbu.ru/images/news/2020/09/hybrid_3%D0%94_printing.jpg" alt="hybrid 3Д printing"></p>
<p>According to&nbsp;the World Health Organization, more than a&nbsp;billion people, that&nbsp;is, about&nbsp;15% of&nbsp;the world’s population, have various forms of&nbsp;disability. Every year, up&nbsp;to&nbsp;half a&nbsp;million people receive spinal cord injuries, which are often accompanied by&nbsp;paralysis, and disorders of&nbsp;autonomic functions. To&nbsp;find ways to&nbsp;restore health to&nbsp;people with disabilities, researchers are developing invasive neuroprostheses that can transmit electrical signals to&nbsp;the spinal cord and brain and recover lost functions.</p>
<p>One of&nbsp;the main challenges faced by&nbsp;doctors and scientists is&nbsp;the adjustment of&nbsp;neuroprostheses to&nbsp;the surrounding nerve tissues of&nbsp;a&nbsp;person. Despite the biocompatible elastic materials, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not always possible to&nbsp;adapt quickly the device to&nbsp;the anatomical and age characteristics of&nbsp;the patient. The solution to&nbsp;this problem has been proposed by&nbsp;a&nbsp;research team headed by&nbsp;Professor Pavel Musienko from the Institute of&nbsp;Translational Biomedicine at&nbsp;St&nbsp;Petersburg University and Professor Ivan Minev from the University of&nbsp;Sheffield (the Department of&nbsp;Automatic Control and Systems Engineering, the University of&nbsp;Sheffield). They have developed a&nbsp;new 3D&nbsp;printing technology that makes it&nbsp;possible to&nbsp;rapidly customise muscular and neural implants for monitoring and restoring of&nbsp;motor and autonomic functions.</p>
<p>This patient-specific approach is&nbsp;now possible thanks to&nbsp;NeuroPrint hybrid 3D&nbsp;printing technology. First, the printer creates the geometry of&nbsp;the future implant made of&nbsp;silicone, which also serves as&nbsp;an&nbsp;insulating material. Then microparticles of&nbsp;platinum or&nbsp;another electrically conductive element of&nbsp;the implant are applied to&nbsp;the framework. Then the surface is&nbsp;activated by&nbsp;cold plasma. Moreover, the number and configuration of&nbsp;electrodes in&nbsp;the neural implant can be&nbsp;changed, producing devices for implantation in&nbsp;the tissue of&nbsp;the spinal cord, brain or&nbsp;muscles. The average production time from project creation to&nbsp;prototyping can be&nbsp;just 24&nbsp;hours.</p>
<p>‘By the developed technology, the process of&nbsp;creating implants can become a&nbsp;lot faster and cheaper,’ said Professor Pavel Musienko, Head of&nbsp;the Laboratory of&nbsp;Neuroprosthetics at&nbsp;the Institute of&nbsp;Translational Biomedicine, St&nbsp;Petersburg University. ‘Considering the compactness of&nbsp;the equipment and the versatility of&nbsp;the approach, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;quite likely that in&nbsp;the future it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;possible to&nbsp;produce patient-specific neural implants right in&nbsp;the hospital. This follows the principles of&nbsp;personalized medicine and will minimise the cost and delivery time as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;possible.’</p>
<p><img src="https://english.spbu.ru/images/news/2020/09/nbme_cover_for_NeuroPrint.jpg" alt="nbme cover for NeuroPrint"></p>
<p>Neuroscientists have already exploited the NeuroPrint technology to&nbsp;carry out research on&nbsp;various model objects&nbsp;— mammals and zebrafish. It&nbsp;has shown that the new neural implants have a&nbsp;high level of&nbsp;biointegration and functional stability. Also, they are as&nbsp;good as&nbsp;their counterparts when they are used to&nbsp;restore motor functions of&nbsp;the limbs and monitor the bladder activity. Additionally, the scientists have been able to&nbsp;print soft implants similar in&nbsp;shape and mechanical characteristics to&nbsp;the dura mater&nbsp;— outer connective tissue membrane of&nbsp;the brain. This is&nbsp;an&nbsp;important achievement, since many scientific experiments cannot be&nbsp;carried out due to&nbsp;too rigid neuronal implants that are not suitable for the soft structures of&nbsp;the nervous tissue. Moreover, this limits their use in&nbsp;clinical practice.</p>
<p>‘We have tested our development in&nbsp;experiments on&nbsp;freely moving rats for chronic recording of&nbsp;the electrocortical signals of&nbsp;the cerebral cortex, that is&nbsp;a&nbsp;necessary element of&nbsp;the brain-computer interface,’ said Pavel Musienko. ‘The experiments on&nbsp;paralysed animals have shown that electrical stimulation of&nbsp;neural networks effectively restores locomotor function. Thus, the NeuroPrint technology opens up&nbsp;new opportunities both for basic research into the central nervous system and for neuroprosthetics when people suffer from various diseases and injuries.’</p>
<p>Among the participants of&nbsp;the research are scientists from: St&nbsp;Petersburg University; Pavlov Institute of&nbsp;Physiology of&nbsp;the Russian Academy of&nbsp;Sciences; Granov Russian Research Centre of&nbsp;Radiology and Surgical Technologies; St&nbsp;Petersburg State Research Institute of&nbsp;Phthisiopulmonology of&nbsp;the Ministry of&nbsp;Health of&nbsp;the Russian Federation; Ural Federal University; Technische Universität Dresden (Germany); and the University of&nbsp;Sheffield (the UK).</p>
<p><strong>For reference:</strong></p>
<p>The research has been supported by&nbsp;grants from: St&nbsp;Petersburg University; European Research Council; Technische Universität Dresden; the Russian Foundation for Basic Research; the German Research Foundation (the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft); and Volkswagen Foundation.</p>

<p>What is the <strong>Fediverse</strong>, or <strong>federated social media</strong>? This is a condensed, simplified, plain English guide to understanding the Fediverse, why it’s awesome, and how to join. You can read the whole article, or skip to <em><a href="#getting-started">Getting started</a></em>.</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="explanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>The Fediverse (federated + universe) is essentially a decentralised social media network of independent &amp; interconnected servers. <em>Federated social media</em>? This definition will make sense once we clear up some concepts.</p>
<p>The best analogy is email. Consider this: Alice makes an email account on the email service provider <code>gmail.com</code>, which is <code>alice@gmail.com</code>. Her friend Bob makes an email account on <code>gmail.com</code> too, which is <code>bob@gmail.com</code>. Alice and Bob can send emails to each other, no problem. Their friend Charlie also makes an email account, but on another email service provider <code>yahoo.com</code>, which is <code>charlie@yahoo.com</code>.</p>
<p>Even though Charlie <code>charlie@yahoo.com</code> uses a different server, he can still communicate via email seamlessly with Alice <code>alice@gmail.com</code>. This is because the two email servers use an underlying “email protocol” to send and receive email. To Alice, it makes no difference whether she’s emailing Bob or Charlie. Why aren’t social media services like that?</p>
<p>Contrast that to Twitter, for example. There’s one “tweet service provider” <code>twitter.com</code>, and you can make accounts only on <code>twitter.com</code> (<code>@alice</code>, <code>@bob</code>, <code>@charlie</code>). While convenient, what if you don’t like how Twitter is handling things? What if they abuse their power and one day arbitrarily delete all of your tweets and account? What if <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21326200/elon-musk-bill-gates-twitter-hack-bitcoin-scam-compromised">Twitter is hacked</a> and leaves everyone vulnerable? You can’t sign up to some other “tweet service provider”.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/93qydOh.png" alt="A centralised vs.&nbsp;decentralised network.">
</figure>
<p>Twitter is <strong>centralised</strong>, whilst email is <strong>decentralised</strong>. The Fediverse is like a “decentralised Twitter”. There exists hundreds of various Fediverse <strong>instances</strong> (imagine <code>tweet.com</code>, <code>toot.net</code>, <code>social.org</code>), all of which act as independent Twitters (which we’ll see shortly). Users on these instances can tweet/post to any other user on any instance, and do all the usual things like following, liking, and resharing posts. Imagine Alice tweeting from her account on one instance <code>@alice@toot.net</code> to Charlie’s account on another instance <code>@charlie@social.org</code>. This is the power of the Fediverse.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zdG7B0k.png" alt="A post and reply on Mastodon, a Fediverse instance. Notice the handles in red.">
</figure>
<p>What’s more, the Fediverse is not limited to short “tweet/note” posts, but other forms of media and “activities” posts too. Consider YouTube, basically a centralised social media for video posts and comment posts. Imagine if your Twitter account could “follow/subscribe” a YouTube channel, and “like” and “reply/comment” to their video posts. This experience <a href="https://framatube.org/videos/watch/da2b08d4-a242-4170-b32a-4ec8cbdca701">actually exists</a> in the Fediverse!</p>

<p>In the same way email servers use the “email protocol” (SMTP) to share emails, Fediverse instances use the <strong>ActivityPub</strong> protocol to share activities (creating and liking posts, commenting on videos, resharing images, etc.). There are other protocols, but ActivityPub is the most used. To <em>federate</em> means for two instances to interconnect. Hence, the <strong>Fediverse</strong> is the entire network of federated instances. And it’s pretty big.</p>
<h2 id="overview-of-the-fediverse">Overview of the Fediverse</h2>
<p>By now you understand that the Fediverse isn’t some company or product or service, but a network of <em>independently hosted</em> services. Here are a list of popular federated services that people host on their own websites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> - Microblogging. The most popular service and Twitter alt.</li>
<li><a href="https://pleroma.com/">Pleroma</a> - Microblogging. A more lightweight, customisable Twitter alt.</li>
<li><a href="https://joinpeertube.org/">PeerTube</a> - Video streaming. YouTube alt.</li>
<li><a href="https://joinplu.me/">Plume</a> - Federated blogging.</li>
<li><a href="https://write.as/">Write.as</a> - Federated blogging.</li>
<li><a href="https://dev.lemmy.ml/">Lemmy</a> - Link aggregator. Reddit alt.</li>
<li><a href="https://beta.joinpixelfed.org/">Pixelfed</a> - Photo sharing. Instagram alt.</li>
<li><a href="https://friendi.ca/">Friendica</a> - Microblogging+. Facebook alt.</li>
<li><a href="https://funkwhale.audio/">Funkwhale</a> - Audio streaming. Spotify alt.</li>
<li>And many more. See <a href="https://fediverse.party/">Fediverse.party</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse#Fediverse_software_platforms">Wikipedia list</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are <a href="https://fediverse.space/">thousands of instances</a> running these services, hosted by everyday people!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What else can I say? I think that fact that a fast Pleroma instance can be hosted on a $3 server speaks for itself<br>
– <a href="https://medium.com/we-distribute/blushy-crushy-fediverse-idol-a-chat-with-lain-about-pleroma-4ff578b99752#5444"><em>Lain</em></a>, creator of <a href="https://pleroma.com/">Pleroma</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Incredibly, all of these services are interconnected and work pretty much seamlessly. Users can interact with others users and content across the entire network. They are truly free to roam, unlike the walled gardens of Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MDoyecc.png" alt="Mastodon, Pleroma, and PeerTube on mobile. All interconnected.">
</figure>
<p>Instances provide common activities such as liking, following, boosting/forwarding/resharing, commenting/replying, attachments, and polls, as well as extra features such as <em>content warnings</em>, <em>local &amp; global timelines</em>, custom emoji, and more. #Hashtags and <span data-cites="mentions">@mentions</span> are also supported.</p>
<p>Servers aren’t the whole story. While you can always access your Fediverse account in your web browser, <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/apps">various mobile and desktop apps</a> exist as Fediverse clients, so users can post and browse from wherever they please. Since these apps all talk the same ActivityPub protocol, they can be used to log into any pretty much any Fediverse server, with minor differences.</p>
<p>Because of the decentralised nature, instances feel like small towns (or big cities), and you’re free to travel the universe anytime. This homely feel allows for the flourishing of communities, while avoiding feeling like your voice is anchored to one place.</p>
<p>Some instances are international and generic like <a href="https://mas.to/public">mastodon.xyz</a>. Some are focused around a region or language, like Swedish <a href="https://fikaverse.club/public">fikaverse.club</a>, or Japanese <a href="https://mstdn.jp/public">mstdn.jp</a>. Some are topic based, like Free software <a href="https://floss.social/public">floss.social</a>, fan culture, gaming, art, activism, lgbt+, cat pics, etc. Some are big and bustling, while others are small and cozy. There’s probably one suited to you. If choosing an instance is overwhelming, start out with a generic one. They’re all interconnected after all, so there’s no huge commitment.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>Want a glimpse of the Fediverse? Don’t know where to start? You can’t go wrong with a creating an account on a <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> instance. It’s the most popular and de facto service. If you’re feeling adventurous, <a href="https://fediverse.network/">Fediverse.network</a> has a list of other known Fediverse instances. I recommend signing up to an instance running either Mastodon or Pleroma, since those will be familiar, Twitter-like microblogging instances.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/EIlnJXc.png" alt="Pick a Mastodon instance and browse the Fediverse.">
</figure>
<p>Once you’ve created an account, you may want to access your feed on your mobile. If so, I recommend the <a href="https://huskyapp.dev/"><em>Husky</em></a> app for Android, or the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/toot/id1220921451"><em>Toot!</em></a> app for iOS. Simply choose your instance when prompted, then sign into your account.</p>
<p>Time to explore! Most instances split feeds into three categories or timelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Home - Posts from users you follow.</li>
<li>Local, public - All public posts from users on the instance.</li>
<li>Federated, global - All public posts, from all users, from anywhere the instance has ever come across.</li>
</ul>
<p>When starting out, checking out the local or global timeline is a good place to find users to follow. Be sure to say hi too, since even without any followers, others will see you pop up on their local timeline. Fediverse users are always friendly and welcoming to newcomers on their instance.</p>

<h3 id="moderation">Moderation</h3>
<p>There are other benefits to a federated social network. Big centralised networks tend to suffer from a lack of moderation and supervision. Spam, trolls, bots, malicious agents, and vulgar content can overwhelm such a network, and leave an admin paralysed by decision, trying to please everyone.</p>
<p>The Fediverse generally handles spam much more gracefully and is more resilient by nature. Instance admins can react more quickly to spam. They can set what ever moderation policies they like, and choose which other instances to <em>not</em> federate with (essentially block) if they don’t find their content appropriate. This gives users more of a choice as to where they feel most comfortable. Everybody wins.</p>
<h3 id="privacy-and-trust">Privacy and trust</h3>
<p>Of course, big centralised networks are heavily criticised for abusing users’ trust and naïvety, collecting and selling private data (searches, images, friends, location) without consent from family and children, and calculating their behaviour patterns, sexual orientation, and vulnerable biases and insecurities to target with ads. The incentive to monetize your private data is so strong, companies will do anything, pass the threshold of creepy.</p>
<p>Most Fediverse servers run on <strong>Free and Open Source</strong> software, meaning that anyone’s nerdy friend can glance at the code and verify that no such nefarious data-harvesting business is going on. It’s very rare to see ads on the Fediverse, since running a server often isn’t too expensive to do. Hosters even tend to crowdfund (successfully so) instead of selling your data. As such, people feel much more comfortable and open on the Fediverse.</p>
<h3 id="manipulation-and-fake-news">Manipulation and fake news</h3>
<p>Arbitrary banning, harmful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shadowban">shadowbanning</a>, and of course targeted ads, all create a web of distrust and disorientation. It’s well known that big corporations and governments use their money and influence to obfuscate narratives for their own benefit, at the expense of users. This even happens internally within the big tech giants.</p>
<p>Posts and conversations on the Fediverse are guaranteed to spread and grow organically, free from manipulation, since no instance governs, controls, or is dependent on another. It’s also much harder for a “foreign power” to successfully abuse every instance of the entire network and target people with fake news. The Fediverse culture is therefore much more critical and fruitful.</p>
<h3 id="discoverability">Discoverability</h3>
<p>One thing centralised networks have an advantage over the Fediverse is that they can provide easy search for users, since they have all the data in one place. Fediverse users can capably search over their local instance, but need more patience when searching over the entire network. A side effect is a weaker set of “overview” features like “trending” or “hashtags”.</p>
<p>Some, however, like it that way. On big central networks, you never know …</p></article></div></div>

<p>Roughly speaking, the merge associativity law states that having extra "rungs" in the history "ladder" between two branches ought not to make a difference in the final result.</p><p>There are still some people who still think nothing is wrong with git; that it is okay for the result of a merge to depend on how things are merged rather than on only what is merged; that is it okay for two git repositories that pull the same patches to have different contents depending on how they pulled those patches.  I don’t know what to say to those people.  Such a view seems like insanity to me.

<p>Everyone needs something fun to do in their spare time. And digging deep into curl internals is mighty fun!</p>



<p>One of the things I do in curl every now and then is to run a few typical command lines and count how much memory is allocated and how many memory allocation calls that are made. This is good project hygiene and is a basic check that we didn’t accidentally slip in a malloc/free sequence in the transfer path or something.</p>



<p>We have extensive memory checks for leaks etc in the test suite so I’m not worried about that. Those things we detect and fix immediately, even when the leaks occur in error paths – thanks to our fancy “torture tests” that do error injections.</p>



<p>The amount of memory needed or number of mallocs used is more of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog">boiling frog problem</a>. We add one now, then another months later and a third the following year. Each added malloc call is motivated within the scope of that particular change. But taken all together, does the pattern of memory use make sense? Can we make it better?</p>



<h2>How?</h2>



<p>Now this is easy because when we build curl debug enabled, we have a fancy logging system (we call it <em>memdebug</em>) that logs all calls to “fallible” system functions so after the test is completed we can just easily grep for them and count. It also logs the exact source code and line number.</p>



<pre>cd tests
./runtests -n [number]
egrep -c 'alloc|strdup' log/memdump</pre>



<h2>Let’s start</h2>



<p>Let me start out with a look at the history and how many allocations (calloc, malloc, realloc or strdup) we do to complete test 103. The reason I picked 103 is somewhat random, but I wanted to look at FTP and this test happens to do an “active” transfer of content and makes a total of 10 FTP commands in the process.</p>



<p>The reason I decided to take a closer look at FTP this time is because I fixed an issue in the main ftp source code file the other day and that made me remember the <code>Curl_pp_send()</code> function we have. It is the function that sends FTP commands (and IMAP, SMTP and POP3 commands too, the family of protocols we refer to as the “ping pong protocols” internally because of their command-response nature and that’s why it has “pp” in the name).</p>



<p>When I reviewed the function now with my malloc police hat on, I noticed how it made two calls to aprintf(). Our printf version that returns a freshly malloced area – which can even cause several reallocs in the worst case. But this meant <em>at least </em>two mallocs per issued command. That’s a bit unnecessary, isn’t it?</p>



<h2>What about a few older versions</h2>



<p>I picked a few random older versions, checked them out from git, built them and counted the number of allocs they did for test 103:</p>



<pre>7.52.1: 141<br>7.68.0: 134<br>7.70.0: 137<br>7.72.0: 123</pre>



<p>It’s been up but it has gone down too. Nothing alarming, Is that a good amount or a bad amount? We shall see…</p>



<h2>Cleanup step one</h2>



<p>The function gets printf style arguments and sends them to the server. The sent command also needs to append CRLF to the data. It was easy to make sure the CRLF appending wouldn’t need an extra malloc. That was just sloppy of us to have there in the first place. Instead of mallocing the new printf format string with CRLF appended, it could use one in a stack based buffer. I landed that as a <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/0548ecaf6ac6fd8d81d63048d09ece8dbb715666">first commit</a>.</p>



<p>This trimmed off 10 mallocs for test 103.</p>



<h2>Step two, bump it up a notch</h2>



<p>The remaining malloc allocated the memory block for protocol content to send. It can be up to several kilobytes but is usually just a few bytes. It gets allocated in case it needs to be held on to if the entire thing cannot be sent off over the wire immediately. Remember, curl is non-blocking internally so it cannot just sit waiting for the data to get transferred.</p>



<p>I switched the malloc’ed buffer to instead use a ‘dynbuf’. That’s our internal “dynamic buffer” system that was <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/ed35d6590e72c23c568af1e3b8ac6e4e2d883888#diff-8990ac09ce8abcb4f5e90a8f210ae11c">introduced earlier this year</a> and that we’re gradually switching all internals over to use instead of doing “custom” buffer management in various places. <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/docs/DYNBUF.md">The internal API for dynbuf is documented here</a>.</p>



<p>The internal API <code>Curl_dyn_addf()</code> adds a printf()-style string at the end of a “dynbuf”, and it seemed perfectly suitable to use here. I only needed to provide a <code>vprintf()</code> alternative since the printf() format was already received by <code>Curl_pp_sendf()</code>… I created <code>Curl_dyn_vaddf()</code> for this.</p>



<p>This single dynbuf is kept for the entire transfer so that it can be reused for subsequent commands and grow only if needed. Usually the initial 32 bytes malloc should be sufficient for all commands.</p>



<h2>Not good enough</h2>



<p>It didn’t help!</p>



<p>Counting the mallocs showed me with brutal clarity that my job wasn’t done there. Having dug this deep already I wasn’t ready to give this up just yet…</p>



<p>Why? Because <code>Curl_dyn_addf()</code> was still doing a separate alloc of the printf string that it then appended to the dynamic buffer. But okay, having <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/lib/mprintf.c">our own printf() implementation</a> in the code has its perks.</p>



<h2>Add a printf() string without extra malloc</h2>



<p>Back in <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/ed35d6590e72c23c568af1e3b8ac6e4e2d883888#diff-8990ac09ce8abcb4f5e90a8f210ae11c">May 2020</a> when I introduced this dynbuf thing, I converted the aprintf() code over to use dynbuf to truly unify our use of dynamically growing buffers. That was a main point with it after all.</p>



<p>As all the separate individual pieces I needed for this next step were already there, all I had to do was to add a new entry point to the printf() code that would accept a dynbuf as input and write directly into that (and grow it if needed), and then use that new function (<code>Curl_dyn_vprintf</code>) from the Curl_dyn_addf().</p>



<p>Phew. Now let’s see what we get…</p>



<p>There are 10 FTP commands that previously did 2 mallocs each: 20 mallocs were spent  in this function when test 103 was executed. Now we are down to the ideal case of one alloc in there for the entire transfer.</p>



<h2>Test 103 after polish</h2>



<p>The code right now in master (to eventually get released as 7.73.0 in a few weeks), now shows <strong>a total of 104 allocations</strong>. Down from 123 in the previous release, which not entirely surprising is 19 fewer and thus perfectly matching the logic above.</p>



<p>All tests and CI ran fine. <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/675eeb1c941706070381faaad8ee1a5d75cff4a4">I merged it</a>. This is a change that benefits all transfers done with any of the “ping pong protocols”. And it also makes the code easier to understand!</p>



<p>Compared to curl 7.52.1, this is a 26% reduction in number of allocation; pretty good, but even compared to 7.72.0 it is still a 15% reduction.</p>



<h2>More?</h2>



<p>There is always more to do, but there’s also a question of diminishing returns. I will continue to look at curl’s memory use going forward too and make sure everything is motivated and reasonable. At least every once in a while.</p>



<p>I have some additional ideas for further improvements in the memory use area to look into. We’ll see if they pan out…</p>



<p>Don’t count on me to blog about every such finding with this level of detail! If you want to make sure you don’t miss any of these fine-tunes in the future, follow <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl">the curl github repo</a>.</p>

<p>In his bestselling book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens">Sapiens</a>, Yuval Harari argues that humans became the dominating species of planet earth because we are the only animal that can cooperate in large numbers. This, he claims, is due to humans’ ability to believe in purely imaginative things and concepts. A company like Google, for example, doesn’t <em>really</em> exist. Sure, there’s the Google.com website and physical Google offices with real Google employees – but the idea of Google as a company is just a fictional concept. It only exists because multiple people believe in it. The same is true for legal systems, nations, religion or money. Every large human cooperation system is based on a fictional idea that only lives in our collective minds.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/qanon.gif" media="min-width: 600px">What Harari doesn’t discuss in his book is the extreme other end of this cognitive ability: Conspiracy theories. I’ve been fascinated by <a href="https://reallifemag.com/this-is-not-a-game/">Jon Glover’s recent essay on QAnon</a>, in which he compares conspiracy theorizing to alternate-reality games. Participating in QAnon conspiracies, he says, feels like playing a real-life multiplayer game based on secret insider knowledge.</p>



<p>Social media has made conspiracy theorizing so addictive and immersive that the line between story and reality can become incredibly blurry. </p>



<p><i>“A lot of these groups are like cults […] They have beliefs that border on religiosity … And when you contradict them, it’s like telling them Jesus isn’t real.”</i></p>



<p>The religion analogy is interesting because it’s a perfect example of why fact checking as a countermeasure is useless. <a href="https://toolbox.google.com/factcheck/about">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/programs/third-party-fact-checking">Facebook</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-factcheck/with-fact-checks-twitter-takes-on-a-new-kind-of-task-idUSKBN2360U0?il=0">co</a> have all introduced fact checks and fake news labels to combat conspiracy theories. It’s naive to think that they will work.</p>



<p>Think about it: Science (which, you could argue, is also a form of fact checking) has been around for centuries trying to debunk most religious beliefs – and yet religion still plays a major role in Western society. If entire education systems teaching millions of people about science haven’t worked, why do you think adding a small fact check disclaimer below a YouTube video would?</p>



<p>In fact – as you would expect from a perfect alternate-reality game – fact checks (and how to circumvent them) have <a href="https://twitter.com/elisethoma5/status/1303630697567928320">actually long been part of the game</a>.</p>



<p>It’s worth pointing out that science is also just another belief system. We laugh about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_flat_Earth_societies">flat earthers</a>, but how many people can actually explain why the world is round in a scientifically correct way? Most of us don’t <em>know</em> science, we <em>believe</em> in science.</p>



<center><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/reality.gif"></center>



<p>What should give us hope though is the fact that many people believe in *both* science and religion despite their contradictions. This means that multiple realities can co-exist even when they are at odds with each other.</p>



<p>We don’t live in just one reality – we switch between different realities (and play different characters within them). It’s a bit like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westworld_(TV_series)">Westworld</a>, where guests can explore different theme parks: Westworld, Shogunworld, Warworld, etc.</p>



<p>Similar to Westworld, it’s increasingly becoming more difficult to distinguish between what’s real and what isn’t. As Aaron Z. Lewis points out in his brilliant essay <a href="https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2019/05/29/you-can-handle-the-post-truth/">You Can Handle the Post-Truth</a>, we have created a fragmented reality with hyper-realistic CGI influencers, bots, deepfakes, AI pretending to be humans and humans pretending to be AI. We don’t live in a single timeline with a single history, but in a variety of “<em>contradictory reality bubbles</em>“.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/narrativeviolations.png"></p><p>Bruno Maçães paints a similar picture in his excellent book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52914599-history-has-begun">History Has Begun</a>. America, he believes, is in the process of transforming into a new, post-liberal society, distinct from current Western civilization. It’s a society that has not only been heavily shaped by television but one where reality and fantasy overlap.</p>



<p>This transformation has been in the making for a while: Kennedy had the aura of a movie star and leveraged his image through the medium of television. Nixon created the first political soap opera with the Watergate scandal. And with Reagan an actual movie star moved into the White House.</p>



<p>Trump is the ultimate culmination of this trend. His entire presidency feels scripted. His tweets end with <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1265819308699070464?lang=en">cliffhangers</a>. A House of Cards screenwriter would not have been able to come up with a better story.</p>



<p>Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger used the social capital and entertainment skills they acquired as actors to appear more likable and competent as politicians, but at least they tried to be politicians. Trump, on the other hand, uses politics as another stage for his acting performance.</p>



<p><em>“Americans see the world as an action movie”</em> Maçães writes. I think this became especially apparent during the current covid-19 crisis and the most recent wildfires in California. People in my social media timelines seemed only superficially worried. Instead, their posts contained an underlying sense of excitement about real life finally catching up with the science fiction aesthetics of Blade Runner and Akira.</p>



<p>Perhaps this is Hollywood’s greatest achievement: It gets us excited about our dystopian future. The world might be ending, but at least it’s an ending that’s entertaining to watch.</p>



<p><iframe width="100%" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x_m9TUP_t_Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>If Hollywood created the fantasy worlds that reality is catching up with today, who is creating the fantasy worlds of tomorrow?</p>



<p>Maçães thinks the answer is Silicon Valley, which he describes as <em>“a fantasy land where engineering talent and capital come together to power the serious project of creating new worlds out of nothing”</em>. It’s one of the most idiosyncratic descriptions of how startups work that I have read. VCs are the new Hollywood studios; founders are the directors and actors.</p>



<p>A founder’s job is essentially to create the most compelling narrative of what their company will look like in 10 to 20 years time. <a href="https://alexdanco.com/2020/09/17/are-founders-allowed-to-lie/">It’s not lying, it’s telling pre-truths</a>. Being contrarian just means that you came up with a novel fantasy plot no one else had thought of yet.</p>



<p>Sometimes founders are able to re-create the fantasy narratives of their pitch decks. Sometimes you end up with Theranos.</p>



<p>And even when you do end up with Theranos, at least you get material for an exciting new Netflix series. Perhaps VCs should buy the movie rights to the startups they invest in as a hedge against their biggest portfolio failures?</p>



<p>The concept of the tech industry as a creator of fantasy worlds immediately reminded me of a conversation I had with my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/cutler_max">Max</a> recently. His theory is that it’s not the lack of tech talent or venture capital that explains why Europe hasn’t been able to create a tech ecosystem on par with the US. It’s the absence of religiosity that has kept Europe from creating its own Google or Facebook. The US is able to create larger companies because it’s able to believe in larger and more ambitious narratives.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/escher.png"></p><p>Silicon Valley is not just creating new fantasy worlds, it is building tools that allow others to create their own fantasy worlds. Enter social media.</p>



<p>If TV has taught us to think of ourselves as characters in the story of our lives, then social media has allowed us to actually write and edit the script and build fictional characters. Social media is essentially the democratization of virtual world building.</p>



<p>As I wrote in <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling-as-a-Service</a>, Twitter, Snapchat and Facebook are just massive virtual status arenas that allow us to build social capital through signaling. Some of that social capital might be built on top of real stories and actual achievements, but most of it is not based on reality. Every time you are applying an Instagram filter, you are already changing reality.</p>



<p>It’s not just that we bend reality in our social media narratives, we also play different characters. As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3Zs74IH0mc">Chris Poole already pointed out</a> years ago, we all have multiple (online) identities. There is not just one reflection of yourself – identity is prismatic. Twitter-Julian (armchair intellectual) is not the same as Instagram-Julian (hobby photographer) or Facebook-Julian (high-school drinking buddy). Google Circles and Facebook Lists always got this wrong: They let us change who we shared <em>with</em>, but not who we shared <em>as</em>.</p>



<p>This is why social networking is not a winner-take-all market. We need different channels for our different, contradicting online personas. </p>



<p>The problem is not that we live in multiple realities or that these realities are sometimes at odds with each other. What’s problematic is that we sometimes get so immersed in one virtual world, that we forget about all the other realities – which brings us back to the problem of online conspiracies.</p>



<p>In Christopher Nolan’s Inception, Dom Cobb uses <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQPy88-E2zo">a spinning tractricoid top that tells him if he is awake or still dreaming</a>. You can think of the mechanisms I describe in <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/08/06/proof-of-x/">Proof of X</a> as social media’s equivalent of the spinning top. As <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/10/you-can-rent-a-grounded-private-jet-to-take-instagram-photos.html">influencers rent grounded private jets</a> to pretend living a billionaire lifestyle, social networks introduce new proof-of-work hurdles to make sure our status games remain grounded in truth. Proof of reality.</p>



<p>It feels like some of the new virtual realities we have created need more than that. A kill switch that automatically brings us back to base reality.</p>



<p>So if you have reached this point of my essay, perhaps now would be a good time to close your browser window and enjoy real life. Or at least <a href="https://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html">the closest simulation you have thereof</a>. </p>

<![CDATA[Creating an Entity-Component-System in C#]]>

<br/>
September 25, 2020 | https://matthall.codes/blog/ecs/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://matthall.codes/blog/ecs/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>For one of my game programming classes at Ohio State I decided to implement an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system">Entity-Component-System (ECS)</a>. A widely used pattern in game design, an ECS allows for a simpler gameobject pattern then polymorphism would. The reasons for this are discussed elsewhere<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>, this blog post is solely for implementation.</p>
<h2>Component</h2>
<p>I'm covering Components before Entities as this is where the entire game is implemented.Components describe any behavior shared between many Entities. Examples include <code>Transform</code>, <code>Collider</code>, <code>Sprite</code>, <code>Script</code>, etc. I modelled my implemetation off of the <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.GetComponent.html">Unity</a> style of ECS, as that's what many game programmers are used to. The implementation of the <code>Component</code> base class is exceedingly simple:</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Component</span>
{
    <span>public</span> Entity entity;

    <span><span>public</span> <span>virtual</span> <span>void</span> <span>Update</span>(<span>GameTime gameTime</span>)</span> { }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Each component type subclasses <code>Component</code>. I'll include a <code>Transform</code> type below as an example:</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Transform</span> : <span>Component</span>
{
    <span>public</span> Vector2 position = Vector2.Zero;
    <span>public</span> Vector2 scale = Vector2.Zero;
    <span>public</span> <span>float</span> layerDepth = <span>0</span>;
    <span>public</span> <span>float</span> rotation = <span>0</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Entity</h2>
<p>Entities are the class for any given "thing" in the scene. Your player, their weapon, the enemies, the walls, all are "entities" in this model. My <code>Entity</code> class starts with the properties below:</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Entity</span>
{
    <span>public</span> <span>int</span> ID { <span>get</span>; <span>set</span>; }

    List&lt;Component&gt; components = <span>new</span> List&lt;Component&gt;();

    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>The ID could be a string or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">UUID</a>, but an <code>int</code> will work just fine for the 2D sprite-based game I'm making in this class. The <code>components</code> property references all the behaviors an entity has. Let's add some methods to this class to add a <code>Component</code> to the <code>Entity</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Entity</span>
{
    ... 

    <span><span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>AddComponent</span>(<span>Component component</span>)</span>
    {
        components.Add(component);
        component.entity = <span>this</span>;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This method is pretty self-explanatory, the tricky (generics) part is what comes next- retrieving components. But first, why would we need to retrieve components?</p>
<h3>Sidebar: Example Character Entity</h3>
<p>If we are implementing a normal character, we'd subclass the <code>Entity</code> class and register components on it like so:</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>MyAwesomeCharacter</span> : <span>Entity</span> 
{
    <span><span>public</span> <span>MyAwesomeCharacter</span>(<span>Texture2D tex</span>)</span> 
    {
        
        Transform transform = <span>new</span> Transform();
        transform.position = <span>new</span> Vector2(<span>100</span>, <span>100</span>);
        AddComponent(transform);

        
        Sprite sprite = <span>new</span> Sprite();
        sprite.texture = tex;
        AddComponent(sprite); 
    }
}

</code></pre>
<p>Cool! Now we have a character that stores both a <code>Sprite</code> and a <code>Transform</code>. Now wouldn't it be cool if the <code>Sprite</code> could know where on the screen to draw by accessing the value of <code>Transform</code>? This is where generics come in.</p>
<h3>Retrieving Components</h3>
<p>In our implementation of the <code>Sprite</code> component above, we'd like to be able to access the values of the attached Entity's <code>Transform</code> component. It is pertinent to mention that each <code>Entity</code> should have <em>only one of each type</em> of <code>Component</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Sprite</span> : <span>Component</span>
{
    Texture2D texture;

    <span><span>public</span> <span>virtual</span> <span>void</span> <span>Update</span>(<span><span>float</span> gameTime</span>)</span> {
        
        Transform t = entity.GetComponent&lt;Transform&gt;();
        GameEngine.DrawSprite(texture, t.position); 
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>How would we implement this generic <code>GetComponent</code> call? It's actually not too bad using C# <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/generics/">generics</a>. See below:</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Entity</span>
{
    ... 

    <span><span>public</span> T <span>GetComponent</span>&lt;<span>T</span>&gt;(<span></span>) <span>where</span> T : Component</span>
    {
        <span>foreach</span> (Component component <span>in</span> components)
        {
            <span>if</span> (component.GetType().Equals(<span>typeof</span>(T)))
            {
                <span>return</span> (T)component;
            }
        }
        <span>return</span> <span>null</span>;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This just magically <em>works</em>. Well, it's not magic, C# just has nice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(computer_programming)">reflection</a> capabilities built in. This will allow <em>any component</em> to access <em>any other component</em> on the same Entity.</p>
<h3>Component Conclusion</h3>
<p>We now have a class <code>Component</code> that we can use to make endless reusable components that may be useful for our entities, and these components can interact with each other seamlessly.</p>
<h2>System</h2>
<p>There's one more part of ECS- the S. All game run in what's called a <a href="https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html">game loop</a>, usually implemented as some sort of infinite while loop that runs every frame, updating the entire game logic then rendering to the screen. The <code>System</code> in ECS refers loosely to calling <code>Update</code> on each and every <code>Component</code> on each <code>Entity</code> in the scene. We could simply do the following:</p>
<pre><code><span>foreach</span>(Entity entity <span>in</span> scene) 
{
    <span>foreach</span>(Component component <span>in</span> entity.components)
    {
        component.Update(deltaTime)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This works, but is <em>slow</em>. You of course won't run into any issues with this in a small game with 1000 objects or so but on a larger project with a couple extra orders of magnitude and this will begin to crawl.</p>
<h3>Sidebar: CPU Cache Misses</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache#Cache_miss">cache miss</a> can occur when the data referenced by an instruction isn't found in the CPU cache, so it has to be loaded from memory (this is sloooow). There are plenty<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> of excellent presentations on why this is bad and how to address this issue, but the jist of it is that we need to store each type of <code>Component</code> in its own system. For example, when processing many collider components, the CPU can have them all in cache at once, instead of having the whole entity.</p>
<h3>System Class</h3>
<p>To address the performance concerns of an ECS, we can do some object-oriented trickery. I created a <code>BaseSystem</code> class then subclassed said class for each type of <code>Component</code> I wish to support.</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>BaseSystem</span>&lt;<span>T</span>&gt; <span>where</span> <span>T</span> : <span>Component</span>
{
    <span><span>protected</span> <span>static</span> <span>List</span>&lt;<span>T</span>&gt; components</span> = <span>new</span> List&lt;T&gt;();

    <span><span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>Register</span>(<span>T component</span>)</span>
    {
        components.Add(component);
    }

    <span><span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>Update</span>(<span>GameTime gameTime</span>)</span>
    {
        <span>foreach</span> (T component <span>in</span> components)
        {
            component.Update(gameTime);
        }
    }
}

<span>class</span> <span>TransformSystem</span> : <span>BaseSystem</span>&lt;<span>Transform</span>&gt; { }
<span>class</span> <span>SpriteSystem</span> : <span>BaseSystem</span>&lt;<span>Sprite</span>&gt; { }
<span>class</span> <span>ColliderSystem</span> : <span>BaseSystem</span>&lt;<span>Collider</span>&gt; { }
</code></pre>
<p>Now, if we make a change to our component implementations:</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Transform</span> : <span>Component</span>
{
    ... 

    <span><span>public</span> <span>Transform</span>(<span></span>)</span> {
        TransformSystem.Register(<span>this</span>);
    }

    ... 
}
</code></pre>
<p>... we've allowed for the CPU to pull only the components it is processing. In our main game loop we can run the following for any types of components we are using:</p>
<pre><code>TransformSystem.Update(gameTime);
SpriteSystem.Update(gameTime);
ColliderSystem.Update(gameTime);
</code></pre>
<p>This will still update all our components but with better performance then the naive solution. As an added benefit, we can now be sure we update all colliders before we render all sprites, and ensure other gameplay-critical orderings remain intact.</p>
<h2>Addendum</h2>
<p>The complete code for this Entity-Component-System can be found on <a href="https://github.com/MH15/blog-examples/tree/master/ecs">Github</a>.
Please let me know if there's anything I can do to improve this ECS implementation!</p>

<p><span>On day two of the Virtual </span><a href="https://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/"><span>Heidelberg Laureate Forum</span></a><span> (HLF) 2020, Robert Endre Tarjan and Donald Ervin Knuth engaged in a freewheeling conversation about mathematics, computer science, and art.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/laureate/donald-ervin-knuth.html"><span>Donald Knuth</span></a><span> was the 1974 </span><a href="https://amturing.acm.org/"><span>ACM A.M. Turing Award</span></a><span> winner for “for his major contributions to the analysis of algorithms and the design of programming languages, and in particular for his contributions to the “art of computer programming” through his well-known books in a continuous series by this title,” while </span><a href="https://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/laureate/robert-endre-tarjan.html"><span>Robert Tarjan</span></a><span>, won the </span><a href="https://www.mathunion.org/imu-awards/rolf-nevanlinna-prize"><span>Nevanlinna Prize</span></a><span> in 1982 “for devising near-optimal algorithms for many graph-theoretic and geometric problems for the development and exploitation of data structures supporting efficient algorithms, and for contributing several algorithmic analyses of striking profundity and elegance” and the Turing Award in 1986 “with </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hopcroft"><span>John E. Hopcroft</span></a><span>, for fundamental achievements in the design and analysis of algorithms and data structures.”</span></p>
<p><span>Tarjan was a student of Knuth’s at Stanford, and their history together was on display in their dynamic banter. The conversation produced a number of entertaining anecdotes, such as Knuth’s concern for Tarjan’s health when he was an assistant professor. Knuth said of Tarjan, “as I sort of remember…I was very worried about you because you were proving theorems in your head as you were driving the freeways and I was afraid you would get into a wreck.” Remember kids, don’t do math and drive.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Knuth also discussed his time as the manager of the </span><a href="https://ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Case_Institute_of_Technology"><span>Case Institute of Technology</span></a><span> basketball team while he was an undergraduate. During his junior year he created a process to keep better statistics on each basketball player during practices and games. Then, using punch cards, he fed this data into an </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_650"><span>IBM 650</span></a><span> to generate strategic recommendations for the coach of the team. This system seems to have been a success — Case won more games the year they began to use Knuth’s system than they did the year before. IBM even recorded a short film about Knuth’s system called </span><i><span>The Electronic Coach</span></i><span>, which you can watch on Youtube </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhh8Ao4yweQ"><span>here</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Knuth was ahead of his time — modern NBA teams rely on detailed data analytics to better understand their players and the competition; in fact during the 2013-2014 season the NBA </span><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-09-07-nba-stats-llc-motion-tracking-sportvu.html"><span>installed SportVu motion tracking cameras</span></a><span> in every NBA stadium. These SportVu cameras monitor the movements of every player and the basketball at 25 frames per second, generating data about everything that happens in every basketball game. NBA teams, </span><a href="https://digital.hbs.edu/platform-digit/submission/moreyball-the-houston-rockets-and-analytics/"><span>most famously the Houston Rockets</span></a><span>, have used these analytics to redefine how the game is played. While three point shots are the toughest shot to make, they have a higher expected value than a long two point shot (because the difference in shooting percentage between the two is marginal), increase the spacing between players (which makes it harder to play defense), and increases the likelihood of getting an offensive rebound (because missed three point shots tend to bounce further away from the basket). Realizing this, NBA teams consistently shoot more and more threes every season. In the 1979-1980 season, the first year the three point line was introduced to the NBA, the San Diego Clippers </span><a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1980.html"><span>led the league</span></a><span> with 6.6 three point attempts (3PA) per game. Last year the Houston Rockets smashed that number, attempting the most threes in NBA history with </span><a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2019.html"><span>45.4 attempts per game</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This is all to say that Knuth was really onto something when he had the novel idea of using a computer to better understand a basketball game. You can learn more about the work of a NBA modern data scientist in this video from </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpLHMKTolVw"><span>Bloomberg</span></a><span> that profiles </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivana-seric-503b4731/"><span>Ivana Seric</span></a><span>, a senior researcher with the Philadelphia 76ers.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Knuth’s application of math and computer science to other fields doesn’t stop there. Knuth is also an accomplished pipe organ player and a few years ago he composed, </span><a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/fant.html"><i><span>Fantasia Apocalyptica</span></i></a><span>, a multimedia work for pipe organ. In </span><i><span>Apocalyptica </span></i><span>Knuth used a few mathematical and algorithmic methods to generate melodies. </span><a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/fant.html"><span>On his webpage</span></a><span> Knuth says:</span></p>
<p><span>“At one point I thought I might have time to understand music theory well enough that I could try to teach that theory to a computer. But eventually I concluded that it would be better to create this piece almost entirely by hand, using my desktop machine only to help organize the work. Thus it’s definitely </span><i><span>not</span></i><span> “computer music”, although I do profess to be a computer scientist.</span></p>
<p><span>On the other hand, I did apply some algorithms manually in a few places. For example, a haunting melody, taken from one of the earliest surviving instances of ancient Greek music, occurs ten times. I harmonized it differently each time, using the algorithm of David Kraehenbuehl that’s described in Chapter 22 of </span><a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/fg.html"><span>Selected Papers on Fun &amp; Games</span></a><span>. (See </span><a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/papers/randomness.ps.gz"><span>“Randomness in Music”</span></a><span>.)</span></p>
<p><span>Mathematical methods were also used to generate the changeringing patterns that appear briefly, as well as certain melodies used for the twelve tribes of Israel and for the twelve precious jewels below the “pearly gates” of the New Jerusalem. If those methods hadn’t been successful, I would have changed the results by hand. Fortunately, I didn’t have to do that; the algorithmic approach did give a pleasing result in those cases.”</span></p>
<p><span>Knuth’s diverse interests led Tarjan to ask a compelling question: “It’s been said that any field that has science in its name is not a science, so I might ask you is computer science a science, a branch of engineering, a branch of mathematics, an art — but let me ask it in a more personal way….do you see yourself as an artist, a scientist, a mathematician, an engineer, a philosopher, some combination?”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Knuth replied that he realized art stands not only for fine art but also for things that are artificial or made by human beings (as opposed to nature). He defined science as “what we understand well enough to explain to a computer” while “art is everything else.” He went on to say that as we learn more science about something our brains “keep a few jumps ahead, and that’s the art.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, Knuth was asked if he had advice for students. Knuth’s response was to echo the </span><a href="https://scilogs.spektrum.de/hlf/have-fun-life-and-career-advice-from-sir-c-antony-r-hoare-and-leslie-lamport/"><span>advice of Leslie Lamport</span></a><span> from earlier in HLF, which was to write often. However, Knuth cautioned to not be “too influenced by trendy stuff. Don’t write a paper because you have to write a paper or because you think you have to impress people about something that you aren’t personally really interested in…that’s the worst reason to write a paper.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Tarjan added to this and said, “You have to figure out what your own path is and follow it. The best students I’ve had came in with or ended up with their own idea that they developed.” Clearly both men have had success finding and following their own path. </span><b>Watch the full conversation between Tarjan and Knuth on Youtube </b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5g4Zl8ppQA"><b>here</b></a><b>. </b></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In my job as a scientific software developer, I tend to write a lot of code. And most people who haven’t been through a Computer Science degree tend to think that CS is “just” about slinging code at the screen and then running it. I have a good working relationship with many of my colleagues and co-workers with other backgrounds… Physics, Climate Science, Biology, etc. But when it comes to developing software, I get the distinct impression that people think, “Hey, how hard could this be?! We just write down a few instructions about what we want the computer to do, hit the execute button and the, ‘Blamo!’, we get our answer!”</p>

<p>The problem with that line of thinking is that it’s incredibly easy to write instructions that don’t mean what you think they mean. For example, your program could be completely uninterpretable by the computer. Furthermore, there is literally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">no way to tell whether your program will ever actually terminate</a> without actually executing it. And there are many, many, <em>many</em>, ways to write a program which make it “slow” to execute. “Slow” being… like <em>really</em> slow. Like it would take your entire lifetime or more to actually execute it. This final problem is one that I see most often when reading software written by people without a CS education. And fixing that is my job.</p>

<p>The thing about CS that people don’t realize is that it teaches you about the theory of computation, computability (i.e. can we actually compute something? We often take for granted that we can!), algorithm complexity, and all of the knowledge, logic and analysis techniques and help you compose a program that will run in the minimum amount of time or using the minimum amount of space.</p>

<p>Allow me to show you an example of a huge optimization that I made to a simple script written by a colleague.</p>

<p>In climate science we do a lot of downscaling. We take temperature and precipitation readings from a coarse scale Global Climate Model grid and map them to a fine scale local grid. Let’s say the global grid is 50x25 and the local grid is 1000x500. For each grid cell in the local grid, we want to know to which grid cell in the global grid it corresponds.</p>

<p>A simple way to think about this is that we want to minimize the distance between L[n] and G[n]. So a simple way to do the search would be:</p>

<pre><code>for each Local cell L[i]:
  for each Global cell G[j]:
     compute distance between L[i] and G[j]
  find the minimum distance in the set L[i] * G
  return the index of the minimum
</code></pre>

<p>It seems simple enough. However, if you look closely, you’ll notice that you have to do a <em>lot</em> of extra work. Look at the algorithm in terms of the size of the input.</p>

<pre><code>for each Local cell L[i]:                        # Do this L times
  for each Global cell G[j]:                     # Do this L x G times
     compute distance (d) between L[i] and G[j]  # Do this L x G times
  find the minimum distance in the set d[i*j]    # Read G cells L times (cost L x G)
  find the index whose cell matches the minimum  # Read G cells L times (cost L x G)
</code></pre>

<p>The code for this looked something like this:</p>

<pre><code>obs.lon &lt;- ncvar_get(nc.obs, 'lon')
obs.lat &lt;- ncvar_get(nc.obs, 'lat')
n.lon &lt;- length(obs.lon)
n.lat &lt;- length(obs.lat)

obs.lats &lt;- matrix(obs.lat, nrow=n.lon, ncol=n.lat, byrow=TRUE)
obs.lons &lt;- matrix(obs.lon, nrow=n.lon, ncol=n.lat)
obs.time &lt;- netcdf.calendar(nc.obs)

gcm.lon &lt;- ncvar_get(nc.gcm, 'lon')-360
gcm.lat &lt;- ncvar_get(nc.gcm, 'lat')
gcm.lats &lt;- matrix(gcm.lat, ncol=length(gcm.lat), nrow=length(gcm.lon),
                   byrow=TRUE)
gcm.lons &lt;- matrix(gcm.lon, ncol=length(gcm.lat), nrow=length(gcm.lon))
gcm.lons.lats &lt;- cbind(c(gcm.lons), c(gcm.lats))

# Figure out which GCM grid boxes are associated with each fine-scale grid point
# Confine search to 10 deg. x 10 deg. neighbourhood

dxy &lt;- 10
mdist &lt;- function(x, y)
    apply(abs(sweep(data.matrix(y), 2, data.matrix(x), '-')), 1, sum)
nn &lt;- list()
for (i in seq_along(obs.lons)) {
    if((i %% 500)==0) cat(i, '')
    gcm.lims &lt;- ((gcm.lons.lats[,1] &gt;= (obs.lons[i]-dxy)) &amp;
                 (gcm.lons.lats[,1] &lt;= (obs.lons[i]+dxy))) &amp;
                ((gcm.lons.lats[,2] &gt;= (obs.lats[i]-dxy)) &amp;
                 (gcm.lons.lats[,2] &lt;= (obs.lats[i]+dxy)))
    gcm.lims &lt;- which(gcm.lims)
    nn.min &lt;- which.min(mdist(c(obs.lons[i], obs.lats[i]),
                        gcm.lons.lats[gcm.lims,]))
    nn[[i]] &lt;- gcm.lims[nn.min]
}
nn &lt;- unlist(nn)
</code></pre>

<p>So, it seems like a simple algorithm. “Just” compute the distances and then find the minimum. But the way it was written, as the size of the number of local cells grows, our cost of computation grows by its product with the number of global grid cells. For Canadian ANUSPLIN data, there are 1068 x 510 cells (for a total of 544,680) and let’s say that our GCM has 50 x 25 cells (for a total of 1,250 cells). So the cost of the inner loop in “some computational unit” is:</p>



<p>where the  terms are constants that correspond to the cost of computing a distance between two points, finding the minimum point, and finding an array index. Really, we don’t care (much) about the constant terms, because they are not affected by the size of the input. So we can just clump them together and call the cost;</p>



<p>So for this set of input, our cost is </p>

<p>680 million.</p>

<p>That <em>seems</em> like a lot, but is it? Computers are fast, right? If we run the naive implementation that’s something like this:</p>

<p>it ends up taking 1668 seconds which is a little less than half an hour.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; source('BCCA/naive.implementation.R')
500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 ... 543000 543500 544000 544500 [1] "Elapsed Time"
    user   system  elapsed 
1668.868    8.926 1681.728 
</code></pre>

<p>But do we <em>need</em> for it to take 30 minutes? Here’s the thing. We’re comparing two grids together, both of which have tons of structure that we haven’t taken advantage of. For example the latitudes and longitudes in both the coarse and the fine grid are in sorted order. So if you want to search for a number, you don’t have to look at every single number. You can use a bisect algorithm where you look at the point in the middle and then decide which half of the array you want to search. Then searching the full space only costs you the log (base 2) of the search space.</p>

<p>The other major structure that we haven’t taken advantage of is the fact that the latitudes repeat themselves in the  dimension and the longitudes repeat themselves in the  dimension. So instead of doing an operation  times, we can do it  times. That’s a <em>huge</em> optimization.</p>

<p>What does that look like in pseudo-code?</p>

<pre><code>For each local[x]:
    bisect_search(local[x], Global[x])

For each local[y]:
    bisect_search(local[y], Global[y])

return a 2d grid of the search results for each dimension
</code></pre>

<p>In code:</p>

<pre><code>## Perform a binary search on the *sorted* vector v
## Return the array index of the element closest to x
find.nearest &lt;- function(x, v) {
    if (length(v) == 1) {
        return(1)
    }
    if (length(v) == 2) {
        return(which.min(abs(v - x)))
    }
    mid &lt;- ceiling(length(v) / 2)
    if (x == v[mid]) {
        return(mid)
    } else if (x &lt; v[mid]) {
        return(find.nearest(x, v[1:mid]))
    }
    else {
        return((mid - 1) + find.nearest(x, v[mid:length(v)]))
    }
}

regrid.one.dim &lt;- function(coarse.points, fine.points) {
    return(sapply(fine.points, find.nearest, coarse.points))
}

## Take a fine scale (e.g. ANUSPLINE) grid of latitudes and longitudes
## and find the indicies that correspond to a coarse scale (e.g. a GCM) grid
## Since the search is essentially a minimizing distance in 2 dimensions
## We can actually search independently in each dimensions separately (which
## is a huge optimization, making the run time x + y instead of x * y) and
## then reconstruct the indices to create a full grid
regrid.coarse.to.fine &lt;- function(coarse.lats, coarse.lons, fine.lats, fine.lons) {
    xi &lt;- regrid.one.dim(gcm.lon, obs.lon)
    yi &lt;- regrid.one.dim(gcm.lat, obs.lat)
    ## Two dimensional grid of indices
    xi &lt;- matrix(xi, ncol=length(fine.lats), nrow=length(fine.lons), byrow=F)
    yi &lt;- matrix(yi, ncol=length(fine.lats), nrow=length(fine.lons), byrow=T)
    return(list(xi=xi, yi=yi))
}

</code></pre>

<p>The cost for every bisection search is the log of the input size. Our input size is divided into X and Y space this time, so we’ll use , and  for Global, Local, X and Y.</p>



<p>Plugging in our numbers this gives us a cost estimate of 553,076. 553 thousand sounds a lot better than 680 million. Do we see that in the run time?</p>

<pre><code>&gt; ptm &lt;- proc.time(); rv &lt;- regrid.coarse.to.fine(gcm.lat, gcm.lon, obs.lat, obs.lon); print('Elapsed Time'); print(proc.time() - ptm)[1] "Elapsed Time"
   user  system elapsed 
  0.117   0.000   0.117 
&gt; str(rv)

 $ xi: num [1:1068, 1:510] 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 ...
 $ yi: num [1:1068, 1:510] 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 ...
&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>0.117 seconds. What took us almost half an hour before, now takes us a little over  of a second.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; 1668.868 / .117
[1] 14263.83
</code></pre>

<p>Soooooo… I know that I’m trained to do this kind of work and it’s my job to know how to do these types of things. But even <em>I’m</em> surprised and self-impressed at how significant that speedup is. That’s a <em>14 thousand times</em> speedup.</p>

<p>This script used to take so long that it had to save its output to disk and be manually checked by a scientist before proceeding. Now you can compute it in the blink of an eye. This is a computation that we have to do hundreds of times, and this saves us days to weeks of computation time. And it increases the ability to interact with the system, helping us to get more value out of our scientists’ time… they’re not sitting around waiting for a computation to finish. It just does it.</p>

<p>I should emphasize that these epic performance improvements come without buying any larger computer systems, no parallelization or increase in complexity… in fact the code for the faster algorithm is actually simpler and more reusable! It’s pretty much an all around win, just by reading the code and having …</p></div></div>

<p>This week we continue our four-part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/18/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-mining/">I</a>, II, III, IV) look at pre-modern iron and steel production.  Last week we prospected our iron ore and extracted it from the ground and did some initial mechanical processing (washing, sorting, crushing).  This week, we’re going to make our way from just rocks to an actual mass of <em>metal</em> rather than just some metal-bearing ore.  As we’ll see, we are going to do this by applying <em>heat</em> and (more importantly) <em><strong>chemistry</strong></em>:</p>

<p>The reader may be pardoned for having gotten to this point expecting to begin with exciting furnaces, bellowing roaring flames and melting all and sundry.  <strong>The thing is, all of that energy has to come from somewhere and that somewhere is, by and large, wood</strong>.  Now it is absolutely true that there are other common fuels which were probably frequently experimented with and sometimes used, but don’t seem to have been used widely.  Manure, used as cooking and heating fuel in many areas of the world where trees were scarce, doesn’t – to my understanding – reach sufficient temperatures for use in iron-working.  Peat seems to have similar problems, although my understanding is it can be reduced to charcoal like wood; I haven’t seen any clear evidence this was often done, although one assumes it must have been tried.</p>



<p>Instead, the fuel I gather most people <em>assume</em> was used (to the point that it is what many video-game crafting systems set for) was coal.  The problem with coal is that it has to go through a process of <em>coking</em> in order to create a pure mass of carbon (called ‘coke’) which is suitable for use.  Without that conversion, the coal itself both does not burn hot enough, but also is apt to contain lots of sulfur, which will ruin the metal being made with it, as the iron will absorb the sulfur and produce an inferior alloy (sulfur makes the metal brittle, causing it to break rather than bend, and makes it harder to weld too).  Indeed, the reason we <em>know</em> that the Romans in Britain experimented with using local coal this way is that analysis of iron produced at Wilderspool, Cheshire during the Roman period revealed the presence of sulfur in the metal which was likely from the coal on the site.</p>



<p>We have records of early experiments with methods of coking coal in Europe beginning in the late 1500s, but the first truly successful effort was that of Abraham Darby in 1709.  Prior to that, it seems that the use of coal in iron-production in Europe was minimal (though coal might be used as a fuel for other things like cooking and home heating).  In China, development was more rapid and there is evidence that iron-working was being done with coke as early as the eleventh century.  But apart from that, by and large the fuel to create all of the heat we’re going to need is going to come from <strong>trees</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>And, as we’ll see, really quite a lot of trees.  Indeed, a <em>staggering</em> number of trees, if iron production is to be done on a major scale</strong>.  The good news is we needn’t be <em>too </em>picky about what trees we use;  ancient writers go on at length about the very specific best woods for ships, spears, shields, or pikes (fir, cornel, poplar or willow, and ash respectively, for the curious), but are far less picky about fuel-woods.  Pinewood seems to have been a consistent preference, both Pliny (<em>NH</em> 33.30) and Theophrastus (<em>HP</em> 5.9.1-3) note it as the easiest to use and Buckwald (<em>op cit</em>.) notes its use in medieval Scandinavia as well.  But we are also told that chestnut and fir also work well, and we see a fair bit of birch in the archaeological record.  So we have our trees, more or less.</p>



<h2>Forests and Fellers</h2>



<p>The bad news is that while ancient sources are often <em>very</em> interested in trees (entire books about them, in fact), they are generally interested in trees used to make things like ships, buildings, furniture and weapons; essentially, elite products.  They are <em>not</em> interested in trees used as fuel.  Indeed, Latin marks this distinction, where wood for building was <em>materia</em> whereas wood for burning (but also, it seems, bulk wood being transported overseas) was <em>lignum</em>; our sources care greatly about the former and only minimally about the latter.  And so as soon as we get very far into the question of the harvesting and preparation of fuel woods, our evidence just about drops away entirely, save for a few poor mentions of this or that tree being good for charcoaling (a crucial process we’ll get to in a moment).</p>

<p>Consequently, our ability to see the fellows felling the forests (say <em>that</em> five times fast) is limited.  Medieval ‘foresters’ are often more visible, but much like we noted last time that when Georgius Agricola says ‘miner’ he means ‘mine owner,’ my understanding is that foresters in the Middle Ages were something closer to <em>administrators</em> of the forest (responsible for letting out contracts, catching poachers, etc.; essentially a sheriff but in the woods) rather than simple tree-fellers.</p>



<p>So who did the actual tree-cutting?  I must confess, I have found relatively little evidence for the social standing of ancient tree-fellers. <strong> In quite a lot of cases, they must not have been meaningfully distinct from the local peasantry or other sources of unskilled rural labor.</strong>  Clearly a lot of woodcutting was done by the rural population that bordered the forests to clear spaces for fields, gather fuel and firewood and so on, and consequently it seems like the basic skills of tree-felling may have been relatively common. The Latin word for a wood-cutter was a <em>lignator</em> (or sometimes a <em>caesor</em>, which meant ‘cutter’ but could mean of wood (<em>lignorum caesores</em>) or of stone), but that word most often appears in military contexts to mean soldiers tasked with cutting wood for fuel, not full-time lumberjacks.  Evidence for the medieval period is somewhat better and also generally suggests that the local peasantry was employed in the wood-cutting itself (for this, note J. Birrell, “Peasant Craftsmen in the Medieval Forest” <em>Agricultural History Review</em> 17.2 (1969): 91-107).  <strong>As we will see below, often wood cut for charcoaling was cut by the colliers themselves</strong>, who we will discuss below.  It seems hard to imagine that there wasn’t some division of labor in larger operations (like on Elba or at Populonia), but how that might have been structured is not clear from the limited evidence.</p>



<p>Not all timber works were so easily acquired, of course.  While ancient wood-cutters are hard to see in the evidence, ancient sawyers and carpenters are more visible; records from building programs in Athens and Delphi suggest that skilled sawyers (seemingly always assisted by at least one unskilled worker) were paid at least as well as citizen oarsmen in the Athenian navy and in some cases rather better.  The presence of English surnames like Carpenter, Cooper, Fletcher, Bowyer, Turner, Sawyer and Wheeler speak to the fact that these were specialized crafts in medieval England; the absence of wood-<em>cutting</em> surnames further suggests that the bulk labor of felling was mostly done by the local rural workforce.  <strong>Consequently, the social status of the average timber-cutter seems to have been about the same as that of a local peasant, serf or small-farmer, because by and large these seem to have been the same people</strong>; while the work done once the tree was down and barked might be done by specialists (but is far less important for trees that are going to be charcoaled).  There were also clearly specialist timber merchants, even in the ancient world, and the degree of their visibility, especially in timber-rich regions suggests that they could do quite well for themselves (although, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/08/21/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-iv-markets-and-non-farmers/">like most merchants</a>, we effectively never see them penetrate into the ruling class), but again, these merchants were likely working with building timbers because, as we’ll see, charcoal wood doesn’t tend to travel very far.</p>

<p><strong>The largest stock of forest-land was typically owned by the state, but private landholders owning their own forests also played a role, albeit generally a small one</strong>.  In Macedon, the king owned the forests and controlled the supply of lumber, granting or revoking the authority for communities within his territory to take advantage of woodland resources; the practice seems to have been the same, Meiggs (<em>op cit</em>.) notes, in the Near East.

<p>I created several startups and one of them is profitable. My last one was a blockchain platform for the recruitment industry. We wanted to change recruitment and become a unicorn. It was a marketplace where we didn’t manage to acquire two types of target audiences – companies and job seekers. It was a very challenging time. However, I decided to move forward and focus only on the B2B market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After a long time, I decided to create a new product for team management space and now everything will be different. First, it’s an open startup. Second, I will publish our journey and share all pitfalls and challenges we overcome. That’s why it’s time for Hardcore Year.</p>



<p>Our goal is <strong>$100k ARR in 1 year</strong>. 2020 is a really unusual year and as they said crisis is the best time for the new opportunities. Let’s check it out. </p>



<h2><strong>What’s Hardcore Year?</strong></h2>



<p>Kick ass challenge to get out of the comfort zone. Hardcore Year is the public and ambitious goal with sharing all key details during the journey. You will see the main problems we solve (or not) and of course data (probably, the most interesting for you :)). I am going to publish results at the end of each month.</p>



<p>I was inspired by great entrepreneurs who have already had their Hardcore Years. Here are the few of them:</p>



<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Andrei Azimov (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/AndreyAzimov/status/1134472394091814912" target="_blank">Andrei Azimov</a> (Completed)&nbsp;</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Reilly Chaze (opens in a new tab)" href="https://rchase.com/hardcore-year/" target="_blank">Reilly Chaze</a> (Completed)&nbsp;</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Jon Yongfook (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/yongfook/status/1303861152603017223" target="_blank">Jon Yongfook</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://www.groovehq.com/blog/founders-journey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Alex Turnbull (opens in a new tab)">Alex Turnbull</a> from Groove (Completed)</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Why $100k ARR?</strong></h2>



<p>$100k ARR is a great milestone to validate an idea of the startup. It means ~8.3k MRR, which allows us to live and to develop the business. I want to build a profitable business that earns money without venture investments and has enough growth to make a successful company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a decent amount of interesting entrepreneurs who tell their story. Groove, Andrei Azimov, Reilly Chaze, and others. They have already had great results and some of them completed their Hardcore Year. This blog might be interested for you as I start from scratch now. I will share pitfalls, mistakes, and insights I get as a founder of the early-stage startup. I will show how we make a startup in 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each month I publish an update with key metrics. I hope it will help others to start their journey and make something valuable for the world.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>What is Focus?</strong></h2>



<p>My passion is simplifying complex things. We have a lot of different stuff every day. Different tools for work, challenges, goals, channels, news, and so on. That’s why I want to build a tool that helps companies to manage their team in a much better way than they have it now. To cut everything that is not important and focus on what really matters.</p>



<p>Focus is a team management software that helps to connect strategy with daily operations. It allows to get employees feedback and set the objectives. It’s not a usual project management tool. Because task managers don’t solve the real problem of management. They allow to do good task lists. However, many companies struggle with leadership and management. Employees don’t know how they affect the company’s goals. They even don’t know what are the main company’s goals in most cases. These issues and unskillful management directly impacts employees’ happiness and engagement. According the Gallup <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgenehuang/2019/04/26/most-employees-dont-hate-their-jobs/#59aa72ed573d">survey</a>, 66% of employees are disengaged in their job. I want to fix it and make it better by giving companies the best tool to manage their teams. </p>



<h2><strong>What’s next?</strong></h2>



<p>I will publish updates at the end of a month. Subscribe to the newsletter to get the latest news about our journey. Also, connect with me on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/_antoncherkasov" target="_blank">Twitter</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anton-cherkasov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="LinkedIn (opens in a new tab)">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Machine Learning models are getting bigger and expensive to compute. Embedded devices have
restricted memory, computation power and battery. But we can optimize our model to run smoothly on
these devices. By reducing the size of the model we decrease the number of operations that need to
be done hence reducing the computation. Smaller models also trivially translate into less memory
usage. Smaller models are also more power-efficient. One must think that a reduced number of
computations is responsible for less power consumption, but on the contrary, the power draw from
memory access is about 1000x more costly than addition or multiplication. <!--more--> Now since
there are no free lunches i.e. everything comes at a cost, we lose some accuracy of our models here.
Bear in mind these speedups are not for training but inference only.</p>

<h2>Pruning</h2>
<!--proof-read-->
<p>Pruning is removing excess network connections that do not hugely contribute to the output. Ideas of
pruning networks are very old dating back to 1990s namely <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/250-optimal-brain-damage.pdf"><em>Optimal Brain Damage</em></a> and
<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/749-optimal-brain-surgeon-extensions-and-performance-comparisons.pdf"><em>Optimal Brain Surgeon</em></a>. These methods use Hessians to determine the importance of
connections, which also makes them impractical to use with deep networks. Pruning methods use an
iterative training technique i.e. <em>Train <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>⇒</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\Rightarrow</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> Prune <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>⇒</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\Rightarrow</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> Fine-tune</em>. Fine-tuning
after pruning restores the accuracy of the network lost after pruning. One method is to rank the
weights in the network using the L1/L2 norm and remove the last x% of them. Other types of methods
which also use ranking use the mean activation of neurons, the number of times a neuron's activation
is zero on a validation set and many other creative methods. This approach is pioneered by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02626">Han
et.al.</a> in their 2015 paper.</p>

    </span> <em>Fig 1. Pruning in neural networks from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02626">Han et. al.</a></em></p>
<p>Even more recently in 2019, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635">Frankle et.al.</a> paper titled <em>The Lottery Ticket
Hypothesis</em> the authors found out that within every deep neural network there exists a subset of it
which gives the same accuracy for an equal amount of training. These results hold for unstructured
pruning which prunes the whole network which gives us a sparse network. Sparse networks are
inefficient on GPUs since there is no structure to their computation. To remedy this, structured
pruning is done, which prunes a part of the network e.g. a layer or a channel. The Lottery Ticket
discussed earlier is found no to work here by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05270">Liu et.al.</a> They instead discovered that it was
better to retrain a network after pruning instead of fine-tuning. Aside from performance is there
any other use of sparse networks? Yes, sparse networks are more robust to noise input as shown in a
paper by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11257">Ahmed et.al.</a> Pruning is supported in both TF (<code>tensorflow_model_optimization</code>
package) and PyTorch (<code>torch.nn.utils.prune</code>).</p>
<p>To use pruning in PyTorch you can either select a technique class from <code>torch.nn.utils.prune</code> or
implement your subclass of <code>BasePruningMethod</code>.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> torch<span>.</span>nn<span>.</span>utils <span>import</span> prune
tensor <span>=</span> torch<span>.</span>rand<span>(</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>)</span>
pruner <span>=</span> prune<span>.</span>L1Unstructured<span>(</span>amount<span>=</span><span>0.7</span><span>)</span>
pruned_tensor <span>=</span> pruner<span>.</span>prune<span>(</span>tensor<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To prune a module we can use pruning methods (basically wrappers on the classes discussed above)
given in <code>torch.nn.utils.prune</code> and specify which module you want to prune, or even which parameter
within that module.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>conv_1 <span>=</span> nn<span>.</span>Conv<span>(</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span>
prune<span>.</span>ln_structured<span>(</span>module<span>=</span>conv_1<span>,</span> name<span>=</span><span>'weight'</span><span>,</span> amount<span>=</span><span>5</span><span>,</span> n<span>=</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> dim<span>=</span><span>1</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This replaces the parameter <code>weight</code> with the pruned result and adds a parameter <code>weight_orig</code> that
stores the unpruned version of the input. The pruning mask is stored as <code>weight_mask</code> and saved as a
module buffer. These can be checked by the <code>module.named_parameters()</code> and <code>module.named_buffers()</code>.
To enable iterative pruning we can use just apply the pruning method for the next iteration and it
just works, due to <code>PruningContainer</code> as it handles computation of final mask taking into account
previous prunings using the <code>compute_mask</code> method.</p>
<h2>Quantization</h2>
<p>Quantization is to restrict the number of possible values a weight can take, this will reduce the
memory a weight can reduce and in turn reduce the model size. One way of doing this is changing the
bit-width of the floating-point number used for storing the weights. A number stored as a 32-bit
floating-point or FP32 to an FP16 or an 8-bit fixed-point number and more increasingly an 8-bit
integer. Bit width reductions have many advantages as below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Moving from 32-bit to 8-bit gives us a <em>4x</em> memory advantage straight away.</li>
<li>Lower bit width also means that we can squeeze me more numbers in registers/caches with leads to
less RAM access and in-turn less time and power consumption.</li>
<li>Integer computation is always faster than floating-point ones.</li>
</ul>
<p>This works because neural nets are pretty robust to small perturbations to their weights and we can
easily round off them without having much effect on the accuracy of the network. Moreover, weights
are not contained in very large ranges due to regularization techniques used in training, hence we
do not have to use large ranges, say ~ <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>3.4</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>1</mn><msup><mn>0</mn><mn>38</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">-3.4\times10^{38}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>3.4</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>1</mn><msup><mn>0</mn><mn>38</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">3.4\times10^{38}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> for a 32-bit
floating -point. For example, in the image below the weight values in MobileNet are all very close
to zero.</p>
<p><img src="https://amandeepsp.github.io/872dc46115677ed1c77ec3381764efde/mobilenet1-weight-distribution.svg"> <em>Fig 2. Weight distribution of 10 layers of
MobileNetV1.</em></p>
<p>A Quantization scheme is how we transform our real weights to quantized one, a very rudimentary form

is the value that maps to <code>0.0f</code>. This is also known as an <em>affine mapping</em>. Since <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>q</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">q</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is integer

A simple
method to achieve this is generating distributions of weights and activations and then taking their
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence"><em>KL divergences</em></a> with quantized distributions and use the one with min divergence from the
original. A more elegant way to do this is using <em>Fake Quantization</em> i.e. introduce quantization
aware layers into the network during training. This idea is proposed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05877"><em>Jacob et. al.</em></a>.</p>

<p>While training the <em>Fake quantization</em> node calculates the ranges for the weights and activations
and store their moving average. After training, we quantize the network with this range to get
better performance.</p>
<p>More drastic bit-width also explored in papers on XOR nets by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05279"><em>Rastegari et.al</em></a>, Ternary
nets by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02830"><em>Courbariaux et. al.</em></a> and Binary nets by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01064"><em>Zhu et. al.</em></a> In PyTorch 1.3,
quantization support was introduced. Three new data types are introduced for quantization operations
<code>torch.quint8</code>, <code>torch.qint8</code> and <code>torch.qint32</code>. It also offers various qunatization techniques
included in <code>torch.quantization</code> package.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Post Training Dynamic quantization</strong> : Replaces float weights with dynamic quantized versions
of them. Weight-only quantization by default is performed for layers with large weights size -
i.e. Linear and RNN variants.</li>
</ul>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>quantized_model <span>=</span> torch<span>.</span>quantization<span>.</span>quantize_dynamic<span>(</span>

<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Post Training Static quantization</strong> : Static quantization not only converts float weights to
int, but it also records the distribution of activations and they are used to determine the
scale of quantization at inference time. To support this calibration type quantization we add
<code>QuantStub</code> at the start of the model and <code>DeQuantStub</code> and the end of the model. It involves
steps mentioned below.</li>
</ul>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>myModel <span>=</span> load_model<span>(</span>saved_model_dir <span>+</span> float_model_file<span>)</span><span>.</span>to<span>(</span><span>'cpu'</span><span>)</span>

<ul>
<li><strong>Quantization Aware Training</strong> : Uses <em>fake quantization</em> modules to store scales while
training. For enabling QAT, we use the <code>qconfig</code> to be <code>get_default_qat_qconfig('fbgemm')</code> and
instead of <code>prepare</code> use <code>prepare_qat</code>. After this, we can train or fine-tune our model and at
the end of the training, get out the quantized model using <code>torch.quantization.convert</code> same as
above.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Post-training quantization in PyTorch currently only support operations on CPU.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For detailed code examples visit the PyTorch documentation <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/dynamic_quantization_tutorial.html"><em>here</em></a>. On Tensorflow side
of things quantization can be done using TFLite's <code>tf.lite.TFLiteConverter</code> API by setting the
<code>optimizations</code> parameter to <code>tf.lite.Optimize.OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE</code>. Fake quantization is enabled by
<code>tf.contrib.quantize</code> package.</p>
<p>In the next part of <em>Making models smaller!</em> we will discuss Low-rank transforms, efficient
modelling techniques and knowledge distillation.</p>

September 25, 2020 | https://underjord.io/live-server-push-without-js.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://underjord.io/live-server-push-without-js.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<small>2020-09-25</small><!-- RSS:2020-09-25T17:00:00Z -->
<p>
    So in my post <a href="https://underjord.io/is-this-evil.html">Is this evil?</a> I covered a way of tracking users with CSS. While
    thinking about those weird ways of using the web I also started thinking about pushing live data to clients
    without JS. Or at least maintaining a connection.
    So WebSockets requires JS. WebRTC requires JS. Even HLS (video streaming), which would otherwise
    be super cool, with captions for accessibility. But no. Or rather, maybe on Apple platforms. Eh. Not good enough.
</p>
<p>And then it hit me. From some old Nerves projects I'd seen, that there is a standard for just sending a stream of
    JPEG frames as a video. MJPEG. Did you know about MJPEG? Lots of people don't. It is used by lots of webcams and
    security cameras. Common option for Raspberry Pi hacks as well. MJPEG is super simple which is its big advantage.
</p>
<p>But video is what we expect. I was going for something else. So this could be used for a CI status light, showing
    any amount of visual status information. I use it for this:</p>
<p><img alt="live visual readership indicator" loading="lazy" src="https://count.underjord.io/"></p>
<p>That's live. Or dead if my server falls over.</p>
<p>So how does MJPEG work. Well, you take an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag and you shove an MJPEG URL into it. Done.</p>
<p>Okay, that's how you use it. Not how it works. I implemented it in Elixir, Elixir is quite good at keeping state and
    serving updates. Links are below. But basically the browser opens the connection, receives some headers and some
    chunks of data and then realizes it is dealing with MJPEG. It wil then just expect the chunks to keep coming.
    Indefinitely. Because this is live video. Frame by frame of JPEG.</p>
<p>The basic code for the MJPEG headers and chunking was lifted from a pi camera repo made by the Nerves team. It had a
    lot of Frank Hunleth and Connor Rigby in it so kudos to those guys as always. This is what I did with it: <a href="https://github.com/lawik/mjpeg/blob/master/lib/mjpeg.ex">lawik/mjpeg</a></p>
<p>My server implementation is here and uses the above code: <a href="https://github.com/lawik/mjpeg_example/blob/master/lib/mjpeg_example.ex">lawik/mjpeg_example</a></p>
<p>So I receive the connection and then that calls my MjpegExample GenServer to persist the connection and keep track of
    how to notify that connection about new data. It also triggers an update to notify everyone already connected.</p>
<p>This is not polished, it is hammered together and I'm curious to see if it falls over the next time I get a decent
    amount of traffic.</p>
<p>I really like this approach because it is a fun hack that simply happens to work across browsers and quite well at
    that. I like how it is just an img element and no frills. I added lazy loading because that works more nicely with
    things like Google Lighthouse scores and the loading experience (your browser doesn't spend a few seconds thinking
    about loading the image).</p>
<p>Unfortunately it is absolutely a poor choice to actually use aside from fun and hacky stuff. There is no good way of
    doing accessibility with it. You can update the pixels and that is it. Unless you can chunk-stream a txt-file in an
    iframe.
    Haven't tried that yet...</p>
<p>So, don't use it. But isn't it pretty neat?</p>
<p>Of course, much like the CSS tracking, this can be used for evilish things. You can absolutely keep track of how long
    someone keeps receiving your frames and use that for your analytics. I also find it neat that it lets me know
    concurrent users. I just log the number along with sending it out because I want to know at what number it breaks
    and out of curiosity but you can probably do some mildly untoward things with this. Oh.. Wait. You could serve
    rotating ads with this. You know what the last frame you sent was so if you get a click on it you can direct that
    particular user to the right thing. New title: Ad placement entirely without JS, ugh, no thanks. Moving on.</p>
<p>If you know how to make this more dirty, hacky and fun or even more useful or accessible feel free to get in touch at
    <a href="mailto:lars@underjord.io">lars@underjord.io</a> or on
    Twitter where I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/lawik">@lawik</a>.</p><p><img alt="live visual readership indicator" loading="lazy" src="https://count.underjord.io/"></p>

<p>Some of these are things I wish I knew at the beginning of my journey as a Software Developer so I could stress less.</p>
<p>Let’s get to it.</p>
<h2>All tutorials are not created equal.</h2>
<p>Imagine yourself as a lab rat. </p>
<p>As you learn and experiment, pay attention to the kinds of tutorials that work for you. Many will not work. That’s fine. In fact, that’s exactly how experiments work until you find a solution.</p>
<p>But the moment you strike gold, stick to it, consume it voraciously and then find similar tutorials like that to continue rapid growth.</p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@cgower">Christopher Gower</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a></em></p>
<p>When I started, I used to bang my head against <em>Head First Java</em>, the book. But after studying for many hours, I just wasn’t getting anywhere. Yet, everyone online said it was the best programming book ever. But <em>TheNewBoston</em> youtube tutorials did it for me back then even though people don’t recommend him anymore.</p>
<p>I wish I could say this stopped after my 1st year. </p>
<p>Fast forward 2 years down the line when I started learning algorithms and <em>ALL</em> the blog tutorials I followed just didn’t make sense until I watched Youtube videos on Hungarian folk dance teaching algorithms.</p>
<p>And it just clicked. </p>
<p>Since then, my approach to learning has been to <strong>learn the same thing from multiple places</strong> until I find the instructor and style that works for me.</p>
<h2>If you’re not practicing with a project, nothing goes into long term memory</h2>
<p>You’ll forget a lot of things.</p>
<p>Deeply understanding this will change how you learn. </p>
<p>I can’t count the number of times I took <em>Introduction to Python Programming</em> on Udacity, Coursera, etc and still forgot everything.</p>
<p>It’s so annoying. </p>
<p>But I’ve since learned that you’ll forget anything you learn in isolated exercises because they are stored in short term memory. Neuroscience research shows that this is just how the brain works. </p>
<p>If you don’t want to forget, test your knowledge using spaced repetitions. To do this, build projects. </p>
<p>I’ll give you a concrete example: <em>len(myList)</em> will give you the length of a list in Python. You’ll learn this in Udacity’s intro course. </p>
<p>Come back a month later and you might not remember if it’s <em>len, length( ) or myList.size( )</em>. </p>
<p>But with spaced repetition through a project, the outcome is different. For example, you work on a 2-month long Django app for new coders where you need to count multiple times the number of users, the number of exercises done, the number of chats, etc. Imagine doing this throughout the span of the project, for two months. it’s hard to forget what len( ) does.</p>
<p>This is a trivial example, but hopefully you get the idea. </p>
<p>New learners can start with simple, isolated examples. </p>
<p>But <strong>if you’re not practicing within the scope of a project that makes you use and reuse what you’ve learned, nothing is going into your long term memory</strong>; it’s all short-term. And you’ll forget.</p>
<h2>Work within fear; not against it.</h2>
<p>I’ll admit: this one is easier said than done. </p>
<p>But you have to master this if you want to last long.</p>
<p>There’s this temptation to fix your fear first before you continue to learn. Unfortunately, it doesn’t work like that.</p>
<p>In fact, you’ll spend a lot of time trying to make your fear disappear that it’ll only double your anxiety. You have to find a way – your way – to acknowledge that you’re afraid, and frankly will continue to be afraid for a long time, then work within that realization. No need to fight it.</p>
<p>Sometimes, this fear disappears as you become more proficient. </p>
<p>Other times, it vanishes for a while and comes back when you get into a new environment, work with smart software developers, or move to a completely new stack.</p>
<p>It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>This <em>IS</em> the life.</strong></p>
<p>It’s a sinusoidal wave – endlessly going up and down. Don’t take it too seriously or you’ll lose yourself.</p>
<h2>Consistency &gt; hard work.</h2>
<p>Consistency is king. </p>
<p>When you start learning,  you lay down neural pathways that make it easier to retrieve information. According to Neuroscience research, these pathways only get strong through frequency of use, not just intensity.</p>
<p>This means 30 minutes a day, for 5 days a week is way better than 2.5 hours one day, only once a week. </p>
<p>Same hours; Different impact.</p>
<p>Don’t just work hard, apply wisdom here.</p>
<h2>Talent = hidden practice.</h2>
<p>It’s easy to dismiss progress as talent.</p>
<p>My first programming class was in C++ and my classmates refused to believe I had never coded before because I was just-so-talented. </p>
<p>But what they also refused to accept was that right after class, I would spend five hours typing <em>cout &lt;&lt; “this is my first program”</em>, realize it didn’t run because I forgot a semicolon; retype it and realize it didn’t print out my statement on a new line because I didn’t add endl.</p>
<p> This deliberate practice built perceived talent.</p>
<p><strong>Talent is sexier than hustle</strong> so no one wants to hear that you worked hard and got here. Just tell me you were born this way - it’s more believable.</p>
<p>But becoming a proficient developer is like playing an instrument. </p>

<p>The majority can only get as good as the amount of practice they put in. And you can immediately tell a student hasn’t been practicing the moment they sit at the keyboard.</p>
<h2>You’ll meet a**holes!</h2>
<p>Every field has its dose of horrible people. </p>
<p>No doubt.</p>
<p>But I’m not sure what it is about software dev that attracts a**holes in droves. Maybe because coding gives the feeling of having a super-power or a rare skill. If you’re a newbie, you’ll meet those who’ve been coding for years and think no one else should come in.</p>
<p>A windows developer only? You’ll meet linux fanatics that think you’re mediocre. </p>
<p>If you’re a woman, you’ll immediately be dismissed because of your gender. I know this from personal stories from colleagues over the years.</p>
<p>If you’re a minority, you’ll meet people who think you should only fetch coffee; not code. </p>
<p>If you’re coming from another field (particularly not STEM), you’ll meet people who automatically make themselves gatekeepers of the programming community. </p>

<p><em>“We don’t want social scientists here; we’re purists!”</em> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>They’re online. </p>
<p>At work. </p>
<p>And sadly sometimes in your family. </p>
<p>It’s not <em>if</em> you’ll meet them, it’s <em>when</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Learn to move on.</strong></p>
<p>Things are getting better but there’s still a lot to do to educate people. </p>
<p>But don’t let this deter you. Build your resilience so you don’t quit after you meet these people. </p>
<p>And when you get to the top don’t be an a**hole!</p>
<h2>Master 1 thing.</h2>
<p>New developers tend to jump around learning a lot of things. </p>
<p>Okay, it’s not just new devs; it’s also experienced folks. </p>
<p>You learned React for one week.</p>
<p>Then JavaScript for two weeks.</p>
<p>Laravel for three. </p>
<p><strong>Stop.</strong></p>
<p>You need to wake up and realize that the harsh truth is that you’re simply extending the time it’ll take you to truly learn anything. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“If one is a master of one thing and understands one thing well, one has at the same time, insight into and understanding of many things.”</em> - Vincent Van Gogh</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pick one thing. </p>
<p>Stick with it for a few months – ideally 6 to 12 months before you move to something else. </p>
<p>This has two benefits: </p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll go deep enough and hit critical mass that moves you towards mastery.</li>
<li>After you master one domain, you can transfer knowledge to another. Learn Flask and you can easily walk into Django. Learn React deeply, and you can quickly identify the pros and cons of Laravel within a few days. </li>
</ul>
<p>This doesn’t mean learn HTML alone for six months then only CSS for 1 year; rather, it means don’t mix up learning Django, with Express, then React, some Gaming Development, and iOS. </p>
<p>You might get a lot done in a short time.</p>
<p>But you’ll master nothing!</p>

It’s intimidating.</p>

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>ButcherBox, a meat subscription and delivery service, recently moved the tech stack for <a href="https://www.butcherbox.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">their e-commerce site</a> from a PHP monolith to <a href="https://jamstack.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jamstack</a> to improve performance and agility while lowering costs. In this post, we will break down <a href="https://youtu.be/pGjEz9bVoos" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ButcherBox's journey to Jamstack</a>, as told by <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffgnatek" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jeff Gnatek</a>, their head of engineering.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>If you run a subscription-based e-commerce business and want to reduce technical debt while decreasing page load time and development time, their story will give you the direction you need for a successful migration. But first, for those who don't know: Jamstack stands for JavaScript, API, and Markup stack.</p>
<p>Jamstack is a web development approach focused on using client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup. This approach separates different concerns in different areas, allowing for faster development, easier maintenance, and reduced cost and complexity in comparison to monolithic PHP code.</p>

<h2 id="monolithic-code">Starting with a Monolith</h2>
<p>In 2015, ButcherBox started on Kickstarter and quickly brought their website to life with <a href="https://wordpress.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wordpress</a>. Non-technical people found it easy to work with, PHP and jQuery developers were easy to hire, and there were no expensive DevOps involved. All it took to publish a page was to press "Publish" in WordPress and specific behavior was added through plugins.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as the complexity of ButcherBox grew, their performance dropped. Working with Wordpress's PHP means having frontend and backend code in single files. Although this is a standard, it becomes problematic as the number of developers on a team grows.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, backend code is involved in the business logic and security of the system while frontend code is involved in presenting the information in a beautiful and intuitive way. Having both of them in a single file is okay for small teams, but not for when there are designated developers working explicitly on one of the two. Managing conflicts in the file edits on itself can double development time and time spent on related tasks.</p>
<p>Gnatek says that their bottleneck was their platform. Whenever they wanted to introduce some new features they needed to work on it for a long time in advance, which limited their ability to follow trends and implement new ideas on the fly.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the complexity of their website resulted in having page load times around 4 seconds, sometimes even as high as 7 seconds. This is a huge issue for an e-commerce website as <a href="https://resources.fabric.inc/blog/ecommerce-site-speed" rel="noopener">page load time has a great impact on conversion rates</a>. Realizing this, they decided to change how they developed and managed their website.</p>

<h2 id="decoupling-the-code">Decoupling the Code</h2>
<p>ButcherBox started separating their building blocks and concerns into different areas. The goal was to swap the engine out mid-flight—to change the system incrementally, moving it from the old, slow one to the new, faster one.</p>
<p>This method, known as the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerFigApplication.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Strangler Fig Pattern</a>, uses a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/reverse-proxy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reverse proxy</a> such as <a href="https://www.nginx.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nginx</a> to determine where each user's request should be handled. If the request accesses something that has been migrated to the new codebase it will be forwarded to that; otherwise the old website would be presented. ButcherBox started by routing the one-time purchase pages of their shop to a new website without affecting the old one.</p>
<p>The new website was created by separating frontend and backend code bases, using <a href="https://resources.fabric.inc/blog/rest-apis">APIs</a> to communicate between the two. This strategy on its own created a faster-perceived page load time. It also improved security since they no longer needed to expose a PHP server. They relied on <a href="https://auth0.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Auth0</a> to handle their authentication and authorization process and used <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Netlify</a> to build and serve their website over the internet.</p>
<h3 id="frontend">Frontend</h3>
<p>Frontend development was done using <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GatsbyJS</a>. This framework is based on <a href="https://reactjs.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">React</a> and allows for the reuse of components which reduces development time.</p>
<p>Gatsby, and React in general, is based on the idea of components that work independently of each other. As an example, your <em>recent article column</em> doesn't need to be aware of your footer, so by separating their code we allow for reusable components and faster development time. Besides, Gatsby relies on server-side rendering which improves page load time at the cost of static build time on the server every time the website is updated.</p>
<h3 id="backend">Backend</h3>
<p>After separating the frontend and backend, ButcherBox started separating backend components. They started by dividing the code into two parts: the core business logic and the ephemeral contents such as product catalog, inventory, merchandising, and promotional ads. All of these separations of previously entangled parts allowed for higher test coverage and reduced the risk that a single update to the website would crash everything. It also allowed for a more agile development.</p>

<h2 id="replacing-the-admin">Replacing the Admin</h2>
<p>To replace the WordPress admin they used <a href="https://nova.laravel.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Laravel's Nova</a>, a highly customizable admin panel written in PHP. Nova helped the non-technical members of the team work with the system without having to deal with direct database interfaces. To add food recipes—content that supports the selling of their meat products—the team moved to <a href="https://www.contentful.com/">Contentful</a> which provides a full-featured editor that automatically triggers a build on Netlify whenever there is new content to be served.</p>
<p>This proved to be problematic at first: having many different components and server side rendering together means that any small change requires a full rebuild of the website, taking as much as 20 minutes sometimes. To work around this issue, the team started creating different instances of frontend and backend, each working independently. This meant that adding a new food recipe wouldn't trigger a build for the Shop page.</p>
<p>To speed things up, they shared components among the instances wherever possible. For example, to reuse Gatsby's logic on the frontend, they used <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/themes/">Gatsby Themes</a>, a collection of reusable, shareable functionality to be used among different Gatsby instances.</p>
<p>This journey took their website from a slow monolith in PHP with increasing complexity and development costs to a fast, easily <a href="https://resources.fabric.inc/blog/scalable-commerce" rel="noopener">scalable e-commerce site</a>. The team reported that their website was about <strong>600% faster</strong> on average (going from 4000ms to under 600ms), and that the development team was able to launch a new part of the website within days.</p>

<h2 id="is-jamstack-right-for-you-">Is Jamstack Right for You?</h2>
<p>Jamstack is a great method for web development, but like all other methodologies, it is not for everyone. There are certain things to consider before choosing to work with Jamstack.</p>
<h3 id="considerations">Considerations</h3>
<p>First, consider the data you're presenting on it. Does it need to be dynamic, relying on different users? A typical example of this would be social media sites that show you your friends' activities. Having dynamic data is not necessarily bad, but it requires having a set of APIs to provide them. That said, I wouldn't recommend using Jamstack if more than a third of your data needs to be dynamic.</p>
<p>Second, consider how fast the updates to your website should go live. Can the changes wait a few minutes to propagate? This would be okay for a blog post or a food recipe, but not so much for stock count and pricing. Again, if your data falls into this category, you can deliver it to the client through an API. But that would be too much trouble if all or most of your data requires real-time updates.</p>
<p>Finally, do you already have an API or different sources of content? The data presented on your website will usually be propagated from different sources such as Contentful, a database, and an API. If you already have different sources of data, that's a plus. Otherwise, you have to create them as you go along. This is exactly what ButcherBox did.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Switching to Jamstack provides better security, better performance, reduced complexity in code, and low-friction hosting. The only apparent downside is the cost of migrating to such a system.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Jamstack relies on many third-party services, which is great for reducing costs and complexity of your codebase, but any downtime on those services could potentially affect you.</p>
<p>With all that said, are you ready to switch your monolithic e-commerce site to Jamstack? If so, <a href="http://fabric.inc/" rel="noopener">Fabric</a> can help simplify the process.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote>
<p>"Everyone gets the experience. Some get the lesson." T.S. Eliot</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Contributing to a project is not an easy task, especially if you're new to the project, new to coding in general, or
just not an active contributor.</p>
<p>I have been on both sides, the contributing side and the reviewing side. I've made mistakes on both. The mistakes I
regret the most are the ones I've made on the reviewing side. Some are obvious, some are not. All of them could have
made the contributor's life, whether a developer on the team, or a contributor in an open source project, much easier.</p>
<p>A critical point to make, and something that I personally do not accept as a manager or as a developer, are actions
taken on either side which are made with bad intent. So while innocent mistakes are fine, we all make them, knowingly or
not, doing bad by intent is not acceptable behavior at all. Following up on the previous point,
by making intentional mistakes, I mean following imperfect guidelines, or having a
false perception of what's important or how to convey it, in contrast with having malicious intentions with your
actions.</p>
<h2 id="insignificant-factors"><a href="#insignificant-factors" aria-label="insignificant factors permalink"></a>Insignificant factors</h2>
<p>There is a big waste of time and energy in trivial, non-significant feedback. This complies perfectly with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality">Parkinson's Law of Triviality</a>. People spend a disproportional amount
of time bothering with trivial details that have almost nothing to do with code semantics. From arguing about style,
function names, property names, names in general, spaces (or tabs), indentation (or lack of), braces, splitting code to
modules (or joining separate modules), extracting constants (almost religiously).</p>
<p>People also love premature optimizations (Which are known to be the
<a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization">root of all evil</a>). They do or suggest using LRU, sets instead of lists and
so many other factors, without any proven significant performance benefits, or that those are even needed. In general,
the program complexity seems to matter less than program correctness (or assumed correctness).</p>
<p>Why do we bother with such things?</p>
<ol>
<li>We underwent similar scrutiny when we were less experienced, and think it's great, or the correct path to becoming
better. Maybe it's simply something new trainees have to do.</li>
<li>People tend to spend less time thinking about the global effects of a change, and spend more time on the micro level.
This means reading and writing comments on a review as they process it. This prevents the reader from "Seeing the big
picture". Instead, we focus on tiny improvements, as if they were the important factor. "Improve this function's
name", "Extract this number as a constant.", all things we write that have almost no significant semantic code
impact. Why do we do them? They're easier to come up with, and they're also sometimes more obvious.</li>
<li>We didn't take the time removing any manual decisions about style from the review. Both the contributor and the
reviewer need to spend effort on reviewing style and this both wears them down, and simultaneously prevents them from
focusing on what matters. This is a key point I'll discuss later in <a href="#removing-obstacles">Removing obstacles</a>.</li>
<li>We find it hard to believe that
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/devops-at-microsoft/code-reviews-not-primarily-finding-bugs#code-reviews-rarely-find-functional-bugs">code reviews rarely catch bugs</a>.
Yes, it's kind of shocking, we were all taught that code reviews are an effective tool for this kind of things.
They're not. They are effective for other things, discussed later in <a href="#the-important-stuff">The important stuff</a>. The
overall theme of thinking too highly about code reviews is basically science fiction. We should be spending our
energy elsewhere.</li>
<li>It's a form of control. This is a bit sad to say, and I've been there myself. Teams tend to be overly defensive about
their code and apply harsh review to external (to the team) contributors. They also sometimes apply this to more
junior developers, partly as a training tool and partly a control tool. Software code control is mostly a virtual
dance around a code repository. The alleged last defense (besides code quality tooling and deployment) is the code
review. Teams really believe it is their job to "protect the code", whatever that means, and their belief is
reinforced when they have to wake up at night due to changes done by external team members. One can say they should
have built better protective measures, or that they also wake up at night to their own changes, but it's very easy to
fall into this "guardian" trap after the n-th time they get a pager from an external person's change.</li>
<li>A form of control, but the bad kind. A person or persons are either taking care of their job security, or making sure
you know who is the owner (boss). This is a form of territorial battle, where someone who has the last word wins and
thus receives virtual fame and confidence, at least on paper. This happens a lot more than one would think it
happens, but in the end, code is written (at least in present day) by humans, who are a talking animal, but still an
animal, with a social ladder and animal-like behavior. I've been there, it's ugly. If you're in a company that has
this kind of stuff going on a lot, I suggest you run away.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-important-stuff"><a href="#the-important-stuff" aria-label="the important stuff permalink"></a>The important stuff</h2>
<p>What should we use code-reviews for? To be perfectly honest, I'm not a big believer in pre-merge code-reviews (To be
explained later in <a href="#the-road-less-traveled">The road less traveled</a>). I've seen them weigh down development speed so
much, the added benefits might not be worth it. That said a code-review can be important when:</p>
<ol>
<li>The developer is new. Either entirely to the code-base or to coding. That developer is going to need feedback on both
how to code, how "we" code, and what's important to the team. In these regards, the code-review is being used as a
training class, and less than a device to add features. In a way, this is the asynchronous alternative to pair
programming or coding together.</li>
<li>Someone wanting to familiarize themselves with the code-base or changes made to it. That someone can be another
developer that you want to be aware of your new feature or changes, your tech lead or a senior engineer in the team.
A code-review helps them learn the inner-details of your new feature, that specific part of code that they don't
know, or just get better acquainted with the code-base. This means the code review is meant as an FYI to them, and in
most cases it shouldn't be blocking.</li>
<li>Reviewing system critical changes. Sometimes you do need or want an extra eye-ball on system critical changes.
Anything that can have a drastic effect on the system, from changing the way you run tests, to changing service
infrastructure, to super-hot code which is very performance oriented, to sensitive billing code. Those areas might be
worth the added blocking review, but I also assume those areas are less frequently edited.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a side, a lesser known point is that sometimes code-review are required as part of regulation policy the company is
complying with, such as SOC2. This makes code-reviewing changes required, though it doesn't make the insignificant
factors significant all of a sudden, so don't let that get in the way.</p>
<h2 id="removing-obstacles"><a href="#removing-obstacles" aria-label="removing obstacles permalink"></a>Removing obstacles</h2>
<p>As obvious as it may sound, you should be investing as much as you can in automating anything that can be automated in
code-reviews. This includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Code formatting should be done automatically when developing and checked automatically on code-reviews. Not by a
human.</li>
<li>Automatic code linting (and any static analysis applied) should represent most of your style guide. In fact, I would
go further and say that if you can't build an automatic rule to at least warn about a style violation, you shouldn't
bring it up in code-reviews, ever. It's just not worth it. (This lesson I learned from a very smart friend who
enlightened me on this).</li>
<li>Testing, and quality assurance should both ease the pains for contributors, and increase confidence for maintainers.
If they don't - you should either delete or fix them. I've worked on code-bases where the tests would just slow down
the developer, never actually giving valid input. What are they useful besides wasting our time (or making it harder
to contribute)? Adding useful tests improves development speed and confidence, not slow it down. It also lowers the
blast radius, making errors less deadly in production (By allowing less brutal errors to pass through,
unintentionally).</li>
<li>Extending the previous points, I would go further and argue that any non-semantic review comments should be kept to a
minimum, preferably non-existent. Contributors should feel safe contributing, and know that even if they poorly named
their variable, everything is going to be ok, assuming their code still works. This can also be fixed in retrospect
(supporting post-merge workflows), as it has no semantic difference.</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite all the above, it is in my experience that developers find it very hard to let go of old practices. I know I
did. Once you understand the enormous negative side-benefits of focusing on the trivial stuff, you understand they are
waste of time and energy. To all sides.</p>
<p>A question I get asked sometimes is why should you allow bad code practices to slip through to your code, especially if
you're the owner of it, and a contributor is just passing through. My answer is simple.
You want the code review to be effective and focus <strong>only on what's important</strong>. Critical stuff you
might have missed. Everything else is a distraction meant to make the code prettier, but probably not better.</p>
<p>If you have concerns about code style add a linter. Add static rules that prevent adding this bad change. Better yet,
prefer automatic fixing of code style (when possible). Style should be a solved problem,
and I don't care what style it is - as long as I don't have to actively think about it
when contributing (or reviewing).</p>
<p>A thought that I always try to propagate is to treat others (contributors) as a reviewer the same as you would like to
be treated when contributing.</p>
<h2 id="harmful-stuff"><a href="#harmful-stuff" aria-label="harmful stuff permalink"></a>Harmful stuff</h2>
<p>Review comments have a style of their own. A lot has been written on reviewer hostility, and I'd like to assume you
understand how comments should be styled.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="english-version">
                        <p>Lost in the fog of TikTok was an important announcement: Huawei open sourced its homemade mobile operating system, HarmonyOS, now dubbed OpenHarmony. This announcement flew under the radar, but has far-reaching implications to not just the future of mobile technology, but also how that landscape will influence the geopolitical chess match between the U.S. and China.</p><p>But like many things that come out of China, it’s less a game of chess, but more a game of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">Go</a>. </p><figure><img src="https://interconnected.blog/content/images/2020/09/huawei-oss-strategy_small-2.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://interconnected.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/huawei-oss-strategy_small-2.jpg 600w, https://interconnected.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/huawei-oss-strategy_small-2.jpg 1000w, https://interconnected.blog/content/images/2020/09/huawei-oss-strategy_small-2.jpg 1568w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="openharmony-the-technology">OpenHarmony: the Technology</h2><p>Let’s first get a handle on the technology that underpins OpenHarmony. Because the project started, first in 2012 and intensified in 2019, as a strategic initiative to reduce Huawei’s reliance on the Android operating system due to U.S. sanctions, many <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2020/08/28/what-is-huaweis-smartphone-operating-system--should-i-buy-into-it/#4ca0a8311fd7">mistakenly believe</a> it is based on either Android or Linux (of which Android is based). <strong>That’s not true.</strong></p><p>OpenHarmony is based on another open source operating system called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD">FreeBSD</a>. Interestingly, Apple’s macOS and iOS also leveraged FreeBSD indirectly from another operating system project called Darwin. So, on a bits and bytes level, Huawei’s OpenHarmony is more similar to iOS than Android.</p><p>This is a smart decision because if the whole point is to reduce reliance on Android, the most important thing to avoid is co-mingling code with either Android or Linux in case it triggers obscure licensing restrictions. And the last thing a development team wants is to have technology licensing lawyers checking every line of code the engineers write, especially when they need to develop quickly to avoid an existential crisis, which is what Huawei has right now.</p><p>Because the project is open sourced, there’s a lot one can do now to evaluate and verify OpenHarmony. In fact, I verified the <a href="https://openharmony.gitee.com/openharmony/kernel_liteos_a/blob/master/bsd/arm/autoconf.c">FreeBSD lineage by rummaging through</a> its codebase, which is all hosted on Gitee. For readers who had a chance to read my previous post “<a href="https://interconnected.blog/can-you-nationalize-open-source/"><strong>Can You ‘Nationalize’ Open Source?</strong></a>”, Gitee should sound familiar. It is a Git-based developer collaboration application that was recently anointed by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) as the domestic “national champion” to drive open source growth in China. <strong>What I didn’t know when I wrote the previous post was that Huawei also became a strategic investor in Gitee in early September via </strong><a href="https://media.qimingpian.cn/qmp/b131b66d760b6b900485a1e30c2762f5.html"><strong>its corporate venture arm, Habo</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>But as every open source technologist can attest, no project ever gets traction without a long period of steadfast community-building and credibility-building. That’s where the OpenAtom Foundation comes in.</p><h2 id="openatom-the-foundation">OpenAtom: the Foundation</h2><p>The OpenAtom Foundation is China’s first non-profit organization of its kind geared towards fostering open source technologies, much in the same way as the Linux Foundation or the Apache Software Foundation. <strong>Huawei drove the founding of this foundation, and OpenHarmony is its anchor project.</strong></p><p>But what is the point of a foundation anyway? As I’ve written in “<a href="https://interconnected.blog/covid-open-source-industrial-policy/"><strong>COVID, Open Source, Industrial Policy</strong></a>”, a foundation’s involvement can help open source technologies in two meaningful ways: <strong>accelerate development and vendor neutrality.</strong> In a nutshell, vendor neutrality is important because it allows other large companies to contribute in the development of an open source technology without fearing vendor lock-in by another company, thus leads to faster development of that technology. An example would be Kuberentes, an open source container orchestration software that was first created by Google but is now the anchor project for the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a> (CNCF); Kubernetes’s <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/kubernetes-and-containers-are-growing-up-fast-survey-shows/">fast growth</a> would not be possible if it still resides within Google.</p><p>While a foundation’s involvement is by no means necessary -- and many open source projects have become popular without a foundation’s support -- it does help. <strong>And that’s what the OpenAtom Foundation is trying to deliver for China’s technology ecosystem. </strong>Its model and value proposition is similar to that of the Linux Foundation: basically <strong>delivering foundation (thus neutrality) as a service</strong> to open source projects, including legal, IP trademark management, licensing, community building, joint marketing, etc.</p><p>An open source foundation is successful when it builds an ecosystem of technologies around the anchor project with a coherent theme. The Linux Foundation, of course, built an ecosystem around Linux with many ancillary and adjacent technologies around the “open source operating system” theme. &nbsp;The CNCF (a subsidiary foundation of the Linux Foundation) <a href="https://github.com/cncf/landscape/blob/master/README.md#trail-map">built an ecosystem</a> of technologies around Kubernetes and the “cloud-native” theme.</p><p>While the OpenAtom Foundation is <a href="https://www.openatom.org/#/projectList">already hosting seven projects</a> as part of its launch, with a lofty goal of fostering open source software, hardware, semiconductors, and content (I’m assuming documentation and technical education), the only theme seems to be that all projects were created by Chinese companies. And besides OpenHarmony, whose strategic value to Huawei is clear, the other technologies seem trivial to their original creators:</p><ul><li><strong>Xuperchain</strong>, a blockchain infrastructure project from <strong>Baidu</strong></li><li><strong>TKEStack</strong> (a container orchestration layer based on Kubernetes) and <strong>TencentOS</strong> (an energy-efficient IoT operating system) from <strong>Tencent</strong></li><li><strong>AliOS</strong> (a light-weight IoT operating system) from <strong>Alibaba</strong></li><li><strong>PIKA</strong> (a storage system based on the open source database, Redis) from <strong>Qihoo360</strong></li><li><strong>UBML</strong> (a Unified Business Modeling Language modeling system) from <strong>Netease</strong><br></li></ul><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/73XjJgCZnhJYxnCW4L8XjLFa9FHQbxAz7nYWTWmaGAsUVSW-L7TH7BurSGCj-H1sc2PnemuL2tuzm16EM7vxtBs8ydPAhQSHCHnsMidVpguJhBaU6hVavLasls45i76RPVNyGFbZ" alt=""></figure><p>If I have to surmise a future theme that is technology-focused and not nationality-focused, it would be IoT because when OpenHarmony was first unveiled in 2019 (as HarmonyOS), it was an IoT-focused operating system, like TencentOS and AliOS. But since then, its scope has broadened to include support for smartphones, watches, and smart TVs.</p><p>One other curious element about OpenAtom is that <strong>only two projects</strong> (OpenHarmony, TencentOS) are hosted on the “national champion”, <strong>Gitee</strong>, while <strong>four others</strong> (AliOS, PIKA, Xuperchain, TKE) are on <strong>GitHub</strong>. The remaining one, UBML from Netease, requires a developer to fill out a form to apply for access, which is a very developer-<em><strong>un</strong></em>friendly way to run an open source project.</p><h2 id="technology-foundation-developer-approval">Technology + Foundation = Developer Approval?</h2><p>That’s the hope anyway. The nirvana of an open source technology, with or without a foundation, is to achieve widespread participation and buy-in among developers, who will both make use of the technology at scale and contribute to its development. And if an <em>experienced</em> foundation gets involved to leverage its best practices in open source management, it can increase the success rate by reducing much of the messiness and common mistakes that often plague young open source projects.</p><p>In the case of Huawei though, <strong>OpenHarmony is a young project, and OpenAtom is an even younger foundation.</strong></p><p>The lazy and obvious conclusion here is to just dismiss all these efforts as a fool’s errand. <strong>But that’s not what you came to Interconnected for. </strong>The honest and nuanced conclusion is: <strong>it’s too early to tell and there are trends working both against and for Huawei’s open source strategy.</strong></p><h3 id="factors-against">Factors Against</h3><p>Huawei is infamous for its secretive ownership structure. Nobody knows exactly who or what owns Huawei. It’s a private Chinese LLC. It’s employee-owned, with 98.99% of company shares controlled by its employees via a “trade union committee”. Allegedly, this committee pays dues to more senior trade unions in an opaque bureaucracy that ultimately leads to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, which is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party (thus all the controversy). That’s why <a href="https://interconnected.blog/why-huawei-should-ipo-in-america/">I’ve advocated for Huawei to IPO in New York</a> -- a bold act that would bring some desperately-needed credibility to the company.</p><p>Along the same vein, the OpenAtom Foundation also needs transparent, credible governance of its projects <em>and itself</em>. It currently boasts a 16-member Technical Oversight Committee (TOC), a typical governing element of an open source foundation, with Chinese technologists who have had years of experience working on projects in the Apache Software Foundation and Mozilla Foundation -- a good start. Their decision making process will have to be public and transparent to earn credibility from the wide developer community, both within and outside of China. As a reference, the <a href="https://github.com/cncf/toc/">CNCF TOC’s every governing deliberation</a> is viewable and commentable on GitHub. Because OpenAtom is, after all, a China-registered entity, to what degree it can deliver pure transparency is questionable.</p><p>Lastly, OpenHarmony’s birthright as a Chinese creation makes building neutrality and credibility harder than just about any other birthright on the planet. <strong>This is an obvious yet important point that every Chinese company is struggling with right now. It is an element that every Chinese immigrant living abroad has been struggling with for much longer. </strong>For a young project, OpenHarmony does have reasonably good documentation in both English and Chinese -- an important first step that must be continued for the long haul. Maintaining a bilingual presence (much like this blog) requires lots of extra hard work -- work that an American-born, German-born, or French-born project does not have to do. <strong>None of us can pick where we are born, but we all have to deal with its uneven consequences. There is no point in pretending that doesn’t exist.</strong></p><h3 id="factors-for">Factors For</h3><p>It’s not all doom and gloom for Huawei; there are a couple of factors potentially working in its favor. For one, the U.S.’s own credibility and neutrality when regulating cross-border technology businesses is also deteriorating. The Trump administration’s wheeling and dealing of TikTok is nothing short of cronyism, so much so that it has been called out by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-tiktok-and-crony-capitalism-11600639766?mod=hp_opin_pos_2">none other than the WSJ editorial board</a>. Although this doesn’t mean Huawei will have an opening to re-enter the U.S. market, other parts of the world may be more receptive to its technology. Regions like Southeast Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa are all credible possibilities.

                    <p>If you have ever come across<a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/"> The Pragmatic Engineer</a>, you probably know the man behind it,<a href="https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz"> Gergely Orosz</a>. More than a simple blog, or newsletter, it is a treasure trove of knowledge on the ins and outs of Engineering, Engineering Management and, in general, all things leadership in tech. As the website name implies, Gergely is all about pragmatism and helping engineering leaders develop themselves, while delivering massive value to their companies and those around them.</p><figure><img src="https://evolutionarymanager.com/content/images/2020/09/orosz-resized-1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Gergely Orosz</figcaption></figure><p>Exploring the interface between Product and Engineering, and building world-class Engineering teams are two interrelated topics that we both share as interests. For that reason, I invited Gergely for a chat with me to continue the discussion I started here in an<a href="https://evolutionarymanager.com/chasing-agile-rainbow/"> earlier conversation</a> with my good friend<a href="https://twitter.com/kettiby"> Mohammed Rizwan</a>.</p><p><strong>Gergely, thanks for joining me. Tell us a little about yourself and your background.</strong></p><p>I've been in engineering for more than a decade, starting at smaller companies, but then joined JP Morgan where I worked for a year. JP Morgan was more an investment bank than a tech company but I learned a lot about finance. Then I moved to Skype, which had just been acquired by Microsoft and we were building Skype for Xbox One in London, collaborating with the Xbox team in Redmond. That was a really good experience, working with a US-based company but from Europe. Then I moved to Skyscanner, where I built a small mobile team, building a B2B travel tool.</p><p>Finally, I moved to Uber, which has been a really good learning so far. I joined the Amsterdam office when it was about 25 engineers, and three years later we were up to 150, essentially almost doubling every year. I actually joined as an engineer – which gave me the opportunity of knowing the codebase – did that for 6 months and then became a manager. Eventually, I started leading multiple teams and managed my first manager in a bigger group. Initially, my team owned everything payments in the Rider app but now we've transitioned to a platform based approach. I would call it a platform-focused team with product impact.</p><p><strong>That's actually a good segue into the first question. How do you think about understanding the value of what the teams build and deciding what to work on?</strong></p><p>When I joined Uber, we changed directions more frequently based on new priorities coming fromTravis Kalanick, like adding tipping to the app. This time was very much about growth and making bold decisions. Now, with Dara as CEO and the business environment maturing, I would actually compare it to how Amazon operates, with a focus on efficiency, getting to profitability and operational excellence.</p><p>At some point, I started to put my foot down on not starting to work on a project that did not have some sort of impact estimated. Uber is big on data driven decisions, with lots of data scientists, and PMs typically pair with them. So we'd estimate impact on everything and then just stack-rank it. This, by the way, doesn't necessarily have to be dollars. With tech debt work, engineers often say we should refactor this API, for example. Well, what's the impact? If it's a system that's going to be retired or has little to no users, then the impact will be meaningless. So you have to ask yourself: are we saving money? Is it about reliability? Is it reducing frustration? Often people will say, "You know what? You're right, it doesn't make sense". Or, "Holy Moly! This has impact on so many people".</p><p>One example of not using dollars to make business decisions was how a Developer Experience team made the case that 6-core Macbooks would compile the mobile app 30% faster, shaving off around a minute for each compilation. Multiply that by 400 engineers, each doing a few builds per day, and it adds up to a lot. This is how this team upgrading to better hardware for mobile engineers at the company. I found this data-driven approach eye-opening...</p><p><strong>A key element of high-performance in tech teams is visibility into how the team operates and therefore the ability to surface issues earlier. How do you think about this in the context of your teams?</strong></p><p>A lot of people are doing the whole JIRA thing, looking at story points and velocity. I personally am not a huge fan of deferring to these metrics. To me, first you need a spec that makes it clear what the work is and why it’s important. Not many things are formalized at Uber, but two things are: first, the product requirements specification, owned by the product managers, which also needs to be signed off by the business. In the past,I have seen projects built where legal later came in and stopped the launch. In that case, months of work went to waste. Another thing we do is an engineering plan, no matter how lightweight it may be.</p><p>My approach then is to think more in terms of milestones rather than sprints. For example, we had this massive project building Skype for Xbox from the ground up. We broke down a year-long project to four milestones: something like audio, video, chat and production-ready. And regardless of JIRA and boards, the question was always: what is the next milestone? And what can we do about it? So until audio calling were not working, we weren't doing anything on video. Everyone swarmed, helping get audio up and running first. I like to replicate this teamwork focused on finishing the current milestone.</p><p>Also for visibility, and because I believe in helping people grow into more leadership roles, I typically ask the teams to write up a weekly email update, including maybe one or two stakeholders, describing current progress. This pushes accountability on the teams, acting as a sort of contract I like to have. And it helps you stay focused on what the next milestone is.</p><p><strong>Love the clarity in that. Another aspect I find critical is the ability to change, both in terms of the code and the teams themselves. How do you look at maintaining "changeability" in the face of extreme growth?</strong></p><p>At Uber, where I've been for the past 4 years, a good chunk of time has been spent on<a href="https://lethain.com/migrations/"> migrations</a>, just because we grew so fast. For example, many of our old systems were built on the assumption that we'd be doing Rides only, and now you have Eats and Freight and other new businesses. In an environment like this you just have to get good at migrations. When you start doing it a lot, you learn what the costs are and how to do it well.</p><p>I think people sometimes <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-architecture-is-overrated/">overthink architecture</a>, and spend far too much time on this area, upfronts. You can try to build all these beautiful systems that are easy to customize and extend but that really is an unrealistic goal. My two cents is that infrastructure is more important than architecture: when it's easy to deploy, monitor, spin up a new service – and Uber is a good example of this – you end up with thousands of microservices because it's just so easy to do it. So you can build a service with monitoring and start moving things over. That's not possible if it's really hard to set things up with data included. So I would say, focus on infrastructure and worry less about maintainability.</p><p>The other thing about changeability is that struggling organizations usually have leaders who haven't gone through the “migration hell” of a fast-growing organization before. But if you don't act in tackling your tech debt, you'll start to have churn and you can lose your best engineers over a matter of years. So next time around, as a leader you're going to put your foot down and maybe you'll be at a VP or CTO level position. At Uber, I observed our CTO understanding this and creating time for engineering to tackle tech debt that was caused by the fast growth. For example, the whole company did Fixit Weeks - a week to tackle tech debt - and engineering foundations work was prioritized at the company level. You can, of course, do a lot of this bottom-up but if people at the top don't appreciate the importance of it, as an engineer, you're bound to get frustrated.</p><p><strong>Wade Chambers, a former VP Engineering at Twitter, once said the role of any Engineering Manager is to win and to increase your capacity to win. It resonated with me a lot in terms of continuous improvement. How do you promote that explicitly within your teams?</strong></p><p>I find that when a new team comes together, they learn really fast. If you just give them a basic framework, and you're solving new problems and you reflect on them and how you did it, you improve a lot. Autonomy helps greatly as well. Instead of getting a project manager who'll tell everybody what to do, I <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/a-team-where-everyone-is-a-leader/">give that autonomy to the engineers</a>, with some guardrails. So the people in my teams tend to eventually all become pretty decent project managers.</p><p>Continuous improvement comes from pushing teams to commit, giving them space to fail and then ensuring there's reflection on what happened and what we should change. So that's one way to grow. The second thing is being ruthless about not doing manual work. In most cases, either figure out how to automate it or don't do it, which might require thinking outside the box.</p><p>I tell people that I'm always accountable for what we do, and our projects, which means that if someone should get in trouble or get fired, that someone should be me, the engineering manager. And in return, I ask others to take on responsibility for their work. Hopefully, this creates an environment where failure is not a problem but something we can learn from. Whatever happens, as long as someone tells me what they've learned and how they're going to change things, I'm super happy. And, by the way, there's this great book about this mindset called<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Turn-Ship-Around-Turning-Followers/dp/1591846404"> <em>Turn the Ship Around!: A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders</em></a><em>. </em>I recommend this book for people to read.</p><p>So, in the end, continuous improvement boils down to "forcing" or encouraging people to think on their feet, come up with suggestions and have them follow through with it.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>During the covid-19 crisis, The birth of the first open source data enabled ventilator. </p><article>
      
<p>Back to March 20, 2020. <a href="https://twitter.com/waxzce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quentin Adam</a>, with some friends living in Nantes, is trying to build a ventilator prototype with 3D printing and Arduino, in response to a shortage of equipment. </p>



<p><strong>Project MakAir is started</strong>. </p>



<p>Quentin, a software expert, is struggling with the electronics part and looking for electronics engineers. Among his friends is Mathias, SenX CTO. That is how Mathias asked me to review the electronics part of the project. My first call with Quentin was to help him connect an old pressure sensor to an Arduino, during the late evening of March 20.</p>



<p><strong>The goal was clear: to mass-produce an open-source medical ventilator</strong>. Crazy! Looking at the project that day, it looked like an "amateur" project. So I did the first real schematics, the first BOM, the first Radiospares, and Farnell reference list during the weekend, discussing with more and more people on the MakAir Slack. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h3>Amateur? Not really...</h3>



<p>Next Thursday, I understood that the small "amateur" project is quickly getting big. Two electronics companies detached people, and a whole regulatory team was up. In this team, there were some experts in medical devices. We also knew that we were in a shortlist of projects that the French government is looking at closely.</p>



<p>I soon realized that in Nantes, there is no one able to actually make the prototypes. <a href="https://blog.senx.io/connecting-a-beertender-to-warp-10-using-mqtt-on-lorawan-with-thethingsnetwork/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Engineers with prototyping knowledge</a> are scarce, I just know a few of them like me. So, on the 25th during the evening, in a few minutes, I convinced Cherine, a former Renault Sport colleague living near Paris who has the same knowledge of prototyping as me, to join the project as well.</p>



<p><strong>On the 26th, I joined the MakAir core team, choosing to confine myself with 17 other people to make project MakAir a reality</strong>. Cherine came from Paris the same day I came from Brest. At the same time in France, 100 people were already helping us remotely. </p>



<p>I brought with me all my personal tools, from soldering iron to oscilloscope, and tons of components. </p>



<figure><blockquote><p>If I had been told this would last 25 days, I would have brought more than 3 days of clothing!</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>Three days later, <strong>the <a href="http://www.cea.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CEA</a></strong> (french government agency for atomic energy) is now supporting us. On the 31<sup>st</sup> of March, we all moved from Nantes to Grenoble CEA facility, traveling on a nearly empty motorway.</p>



<p>The first prototype had basic electronics: STM32 Nucleo, a small 4 lines screen, a few buttons, a good precision pressure sensor, and several servo outputs. <strong>This first prototype allows us to make a pig breath for 4 hours</strong> on the 3rd of April, only 2 weeks after the project started.</p>

<h2>Enters the Raspberry Pi</h2>



<p>What we learned from the first test on a pig:</p>



<ul><li>The ventilator did the job. The pig was alive and woke up correctly.</li><li><strong>There is a huge UX problem.</strong></li><li>The air flow measurement is really helpful.</li></ul>



<p>The experts from the medical world are now used to high-tech screens displaying curves with not only pressure, but real-time air volume blown into the patient lungs. Even in crisis time, we understand that our product does not meet their minimum UI/UX needs.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="418" src="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-4-1024x418.jpg" alt="difference of UX between first MakAir screen and a recent ventilator" srcset="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-4-1024x418.jpg 1024w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-4-300x123.jpg 300w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-4-768x314.jpg 768w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-4-1536x627.jpg 1536w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-4.jpg 1660w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Makair prototype on the left, a recent ventilator on the right. <br>Both can save life, but UX gap is huge!</figcaption></figure>



<p>Always listen to the users. Even if we succeed in mass production of an open-source ventilator, if doctors want curves and measure of the number of air liters entering the lungs, we must do it. </p>



<p>Since the beginning, this project is time driven. We never consider the price, but we always look at worldwide stocks. In a time where lots of plants are closed in Europe, <strong>the supply chain is leading the project.</strong></p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC_6374-edited.jpg" alt="inside the v1 of the MakAir" width="522" height="347" srcset="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC_6374-edited.jpg 1378w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC_6374-edited-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC_6374-edited-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC_6374-edited-768x512.jpg 768w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC_6374-edited-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 522px) 100vw, 522px"><figcaption>Scooter lead-acid batteries. Because these are the most available batteries in the word.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>So, what is the world's most available touch screen? </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-2.png" alt="farnell stocks" width="616" height="217" srcset="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-2.png 832w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-2-300x106.png 300w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-2-768x270.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 616px) 100vw, 616px"><figcaption>(and 18000 more at radiospares)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As I just said, the supply chain rules the project. MakAir will have a raspberry to display curves. Nice coincidence for an open-source project!</p>



<p>By the way, the mass flow meter sensor was a huge problem. Since the beginning, MakAir did not want to disturb the production of existing ventilators. But this component is on the air way, it should be approved for medical use. In April, it was impossible to source any Sensirion or Honeywell mass flow sensors... Anyway, the next test will be done with a raspberry connected to the STM32. </p>







<h2>Enter Warp&nbsp;10</h2>



<p>On the 17th of April, the first batch of ventilators built in the CEA clean-rooms was ready. This batch was used for the 1st clinical tests. </p>



<p><strong>The pressure switches from the technical team to the regulatory team, remotely working on the project since the beginning. </strong></p>



<p>To prepare the next batch, we came back to Nantes. After 25 days, we switched from commando mode (18h/day, 7 days a week) to a more standard week (14h/day, the weekends with the family).</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_5752-1024x768.jpg" alt="MakAir team in the CEA cleanroom with prototypes" width="521" height="390" srcset="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_5752-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_5752-300x225.jpg 300w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_5752-768x576.jpg 768w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_5752-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_5752.jpg 2016w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px"><figcaption>Tyvek sterile clothing in a cleanroom. Could not be better for medical device assembly. Thanks to the CEA.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>On the 30<sup>th</sup> of April, the prototype with a raspberry pi is ready for the next animal test. Two people had to fly to Grenoble CEA with this prototype, but the rest of us, and all the people remotely working on the project wanted to follow the experience. </p>



<p>So, the night before the test, I quickly deployed Warp&nbsp;10 on the raspberry and wrote a small script to copy data every 10s to another Warp&nbsp;10 server.</p>



<p>What is <a href="https://www.warp10.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warp&nbsp;10</a>? It is a time series platform. But unlike other TSDB (Time Series Database), there is a full analysis environment behind, and even a task scheduler. Compress time series, replicate to another server while managing network outage is really easy. Same tooling on the server and the connected object, that what I call easy IoT. To stream data, you just need a few WarpScript functions among <a href="https://www.warp10.io/doc/functionList" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the thousand available</a>.</p>



<p>Basically, the WarpScript pseudo code is:</p>



<pre><code>- Read the last value of makair.lastupload GTS
- take the last tick as start
- take now as end
- fetch locally all the makair GTS from start to end
- WRAP all the GTS
- build a script that UNWRAP and UPDATE the data
- do a remote execution of the script with REXEC 
- if the REXEC was a success, store end in makair.lastupload</code></pre>



<p>You can follow the <a href="https://www.warp10.io/content/04_Tutorials/01_WarpScript/30_Server_to_Server" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">server to server tutorial</a> to implement such a WarpScript, then save it as $WARP10HOME/warpscripts/makair/10000/upload_data.mc2 to schedule an execution every 10s.</p>



<p>To display data in real-time, <a href="http://studio.senx.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WarpStudio</a> did the job easily too. Autorefresh of the DataViz every 10s is a built-in function:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-3.png" alt="autorefresh settings of the MakAir test" width="522" height="385" srcset="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-3.png 575w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-3-300x221.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 522px) 100vw, 522px"><figcaption>In the dataviz tab of WarpStudio.</figcaption></figure></div>







<p>Around 30 lines of code to allow all the MakAir team to follow the pressure inside the pig lungs in real-time!</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC_6580-70pc-1024x683.jpg" alt="real time display" width="516" height="343" srcset="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC_6580-70pc-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC_6580-70pc-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC_6580-70pc-768x512.jpg 768w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC_6580-70pc-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC_6580-70pc-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC_6580-70pc-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 516px) 100vw, 516px"><figcaption>WarpStudio on a 60" 4k display, that's a nice dashboard.</figcaption></figure></div>







<h2>Next steps</h2>



<p>MakAir ventilators are designed to store everything in the <a href="https://warp10.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warp&nbsp;10</a> time series database. They also have built-in WiFi and LoRa. All these features are not yet available, because the priority is still to make an open-source approved ventilator. </p>

<p>Connected features + open-source software is an enabler for doctors and researchers to perform extensive data collection and try new algorithms in the machine. Warp&nbsp;10 is the best open source time series database to <a href="https://blog.senx.io/warp-10-for-iot-gdpr-compliant-before-gdpr-even-existed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">securely</a> store medical data and analyze it. It's not a walled garden.</p>



<p>If you need to connect medical devices to a time series database, <a href="mailto:contact@senx.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just ask us</a>.</p>



<p>MakAir is now entering the second phase of clinical tests. We can consider we are half way to the goal. Keep in mind that among all the projects of ventilators announced by big companies, MakAir is the only one to reach the clinical tests step. <a href="https://makair.life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">200 people, backed up by CEA and a few french companies</a> are about to make a commercially available open source ventilator... </p>



<p>That's crazy when you think about it!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>Exciting new enhancements in the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/whats-new-in-elastic-7-9-0-free-workplace-search-engine-endpoint-security">7.9 release</a> of <a href="https://www.elastic.co/enterprise-search">Elastic Enterprise Search</a> make it easier than ever for you to offer powerful, modern search experiences for your app users, workplace teammates, and website visitors. Elastic Workplace Search features added to our free distribution tier provide you with a powerful starting point for empowering your teams with relevant information, even in the face of tightening budgets.
</p><p><img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt262c603406aea4fd/5f3555d348d3b57cb974a5b8/enterprise-search-7-9-ws-thumbnails-blog.jpg" data-sys-asset-uid="blt262c603406aea4fd" alt="Elastic Workplace Search results screen with thumbnail preview"></p><p>Our 7.9 release continues to build on our recent efforts during a hectic 2020 to make Elastic Enterprise Search  available wherever you are, whether that’s via Elastic Cloud on Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, or AWS in <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-regions-templates-instances.html">dozens of regions</a> around the world, or with the self-managed download. Other new developments include Gmail content source integrations in Workplace Search, the introduction of Elastic Enterprise Search into Kibana, improvements in index management and logging, and intuitive UI updates. Let’s dive into a few of the details.
</p> <p><strong><h2>Features of Workplace Search added to our free distribution tier</h2></strong></p><p>
	The addition of Workplace Search features to our free distribution tier means that you can <a href="https://www.elastic.co/downloads/enterprise-search">download</a> and use the entire Elastic Enterprise Search solution to easily get started and boost productivity with modern search experiences. Whether it’s App Search for your apps and websites or Workplace Search for your internal teams, with the features included in the free distribution tier&nbsp;you can download and evaluate our full product suite. Workplace Search includes connectors to a host of popular collaboration, storage, and productivity tools, along with access to the Custom Source API for creating your own connectors. You also get group and user management tools, easily tunable content source prioritization by team, and much more. Then, as you need additional customization, integrations, granular access control, and single-sign-on (SSO) support, you’ll find it all in our <a href="https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions">Platinum subscription</a>.
</p><h2><strong>Introducing Elastic Enterprise Search in Kibana</strong></h2><p>In 7.9, Kibana rolls out the welcome mat to Elastic Enterprise Search, offering easy navigation to your search deployments right alongside all your other favorite analysis and visualization tools. As the window into the Elastic Stack, Kibana allows users to do everything from rich data visualization using Elasticsearch indices to administering and managing the whole of the Elastic Stack. With this release, Kibana admins can customize spaces to show or hide Enterprise Search in the main navigation menu, and give users the capability to quickly access deployments and in-app dashboards.
</p><p><img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltd64ad0cc9a899866/5f3599c5327a6201d7ebba32/enterprise-search-7-9-in-kibana-blog.jpg" data-sys-asset-uid="bltd64ad0cc9a899866" alt="Elastic Enterprise Search in Kibana"></p><p><strong><h2>Announcing the federated Gmail connector for Workplace Search</h2></strong></p><p>Gmail joins Google Drive, Microsoft 365, Salesforce, Confluence, and a number of other <a href="https://www.elastic.co/workplace-search/content-sources">prebuilt content source integrations</a> for Workplace Search. Google is obviously no slouch at search, of course, but Workplace Search offers a single search bar for not just the G Suite, but across a slew of sources, regardless of the origin, manufacturer, or ecosystem. Users can conduct search without needing to remember where that data lives, and they’ll see their own private <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/workplace-search/7.9/workplace-search-gmail-connector.html">Gmail content</a> right alongside all those other sources, with pretuned search relevance baked right in.&nbsp;
</p><p><img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltb8b3fc0b19a40778/5f3556811fe0e07eae8141bc/enterprise-search-7-9-gmail-connector-blog.jpg" data-sys-asset-uid="bltb8b3fc0b19a40778" alt="Gmail content source integration in Elastic Workplace Search "></p><p><strong><h2>Gleaning new insights from your knowledge landscape</h2></strong></p><p>Workplace Search tracks and logs document and record activity as it unfolds on third-party systems synchronized to the search experience, providing a centralized location for keeping track of organizational information shifts and hot spots. Over time, this provides businesses with critical insight into user behavior in third-party systems as well as auditing capabilities for information security purposes that often are not otherwise available. Combining this functionality with the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/security">Elastic Security</a> solution and our machine learning capabilities introduces a new and unique value for system administrators and IT teams.
</p> <p><strong><h2>Gaining more control over scale</h2></strong></p><p>Because Elastic Enterprise Search is built atop the Elastic Stack, powerful features can be pulled into App Search and Workplace Search based on user needs. In 7.9, App Search and Workplace Search inherit the index lifecycle management (ILM) policies feature from the Elastic Stack to automatically manage logs and analytics.
</p><p>The logs and analytics for Elastic Enterprise Search are now cycled automatically with ILM. Users can also change how long logs and analytics are retained with existing Elastic Stack tools, like the Kibana ILM policy management tool.&nbsp;
</p> <p><strong><h2>What else?</h2></strong></p><p>There are a few other Workplace Search updates in 7.9. You can use OpenSearch to quickly add a shortcut to your browser’s search bar to jump right to Workplace Search. There’s no need for tab switching just to conduct a quick search.
</p><p>Workplace Search also sports new document thumbnail previews, giving you snappy visual cues with robust document excerpts and metadata, for quickly finding just what you need.
</p><p>And rounding out the update are more personalized search results based on user behavior. The Search API inside Workplace Search now supports auto-filter detection as well as query-time boosting. This means authenticated user context on a page can be provided in the Search API to deliver a more customized search experience.
</p> <p><strong><h2>Try it today!</h2></strong>There’s a lot to like in 7.9, and we hope you’re as excited to try it as we are to introduce it. Existing Elastic Cloud customers can access Enterprise Search directly from the <a href="http://cloud.elastic.co/">Elastic Cloud console</a>. New to the Elastic Cloud? Start a <a href="https://cloud.elastic.co/registration">free 14-day trial of Elastic Enterprise Search</a>. Or <a href="https://www.elastic.co/downloads/enterprise-search">download</a> the self-managed versions of App Search or Workplace Search for free.</p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

It doesn’t matter where you’re coming from (Codegiant, Hacker News, Reddit, or some other place), I always appreciate every reader who lands on my articles.</em></p><p id="0d0f">Now that I’ve coaxed you into reading this article, let’s get down to brass tacks.</p><p id="fb09">Whenever you’re just starting out with <a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.codegiant.io/software-development-life-cycle-the-ultimate-guide-2020-153d17bb20fb">software development</a> or simply want to uplevel your programming skills, you’ll need the right info resources to achieve your goals.</p><p id="3284">In this article, I’ve listed 22 of the best YouTube channels for improving your programming skills. Some are geared towards beginners while others focus on advanced topics.</p><p id="993e">So, if you consider yourself an experienced programmer, you can jump over to the last section where you’ll find all the 22 YouTube channels.</p><p id="2c67">If you are a beginner developer, however, I recommend that you go through each section of this article as we’ll talk about coding in general, programming skills, your computer programming resume, job opportunities, and some of the most in-demand programming languages.</p><p id="65e3">Without further ado:</p><p id="359c">Coding is the end result of a specific set of actions triggered to create a tangible result, whether it is a web page, an app, a video, or just an image on your screen.</p><p id="c92e">The great thing about computer coding (or programming) is that you can have a big idea and actually code it out into reality. And it doesn’t cost much, barring some time and effort on your side.</p><p id="3e5a">Many non-tech people consider the definition of a computer programmer to be someone who just makes programs. Although that’s partly true, partly not, it’s a mistake. Managers believe that the more lines of code a programmer can produce a month, the more creative he will be — another mistake. You can’t put a <a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.codegiant.io/software-developer-vs-software-engineer-31e873e787bc">developer</a> into a cubicle, set a deadline, ask him to work for 8–9 hours straight, and expect a top-notch quality software at the end.</p><p id="9e66">Instead of thinking about the programs a developer composes, one should consider the possible computations evoked by the developed program. “Designing a set of computations” is a more accurate description of what programmers actually do.</p><p id="5647">One can also imagine programmers as writers that have to think and write carefully, because the readers (the computers) take what the programmers write literally.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2330/0*al-_-Anr6m8BIIIi" width="1165" height="805" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*al-_-Anr6m8BIIIi 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*al-_-Anr6m8BIIIi 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*al-_-Anr6m8BIIIi 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*al-_-Anr6m8BIIIi 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*al-_-Anr6m8BIIIi?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="f506">Many non-tech folks believe that programming is all about acquiring technical skills. I believe that being a developer requires more than just knowing how to code. To make it in the software development world, you’ll need to dig up some creativity and inject it into your coding skills. The ability to think analytically is highly valued among developers as well.</p><p id="1779">One of the most essential skills a developer can have isn’t actually technical, it’s social, and that is empathy. Lack of empathy inevitably leads to poor communication (barring you are a narcissist, sociopath, or psychopath and therefore can be charming as hell). On the other hand, being able to put empathy into practice will, without doubt, boost your career opportunities.</p><p id="9732">When it comes to <strong>planning software</strong>, developers should know how to use models and flowcharts to convey instructions clearly.</p><p id="c39f"><strong>Designing and creating applications</strong>. Depending on the project, this can take from a couple of weeks to months and sometimes even years to complete.</p><p id="9b77"><strong>Writing programs</strong>. As simple as that.</p><p id="9220"><strong>Update and expand existing programs</strong>. Most times, you’ll need to modify and update existing programs with extra features.</p><p id="e7df"><strong>Debugging code</strong>. Yup.</p><p id="5ef0"><strong>Simplify programming</strong>. Developers may also use software tools to automate a part of their development process in order to simplify and speed up the workflow.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2564/0*tJ40Go85DKYBw5cS" width="1282" height="869" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*tJ40Go85DKYBw5cS 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*tJ40Go85DKYBw5cS 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*tJ40Go85DKYBw5cS 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*tJ40Go85DKYBw5cS 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*tJ40Go85DKYBw5cS?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="8ced">Showing up and practicing your programming skills seem to be the main ingredients to getting better at programming and coding. You gotta be programming in your spare time; you gotta be obsessed with it. Load yourself with patience because becoming a skilled coder takes years. And anyone who is telling you that you can learn and become good at coding in a month is probably trying to sell you something.</p><p id="8e25">Senior developers have all adopted common traits and basic coding skills that have helped them to rise in the hierarchy during their programming careers. Here are some valuable skills needed for you to be a senior developer:</p><p id="3a2c">One, being able to easily explain tech stuff to non-technical people.</p><p id="b60e">Two, being able to come up with accurate estimates.</p><p id="8cdb">Three, willingness to roll up their sleeves and do some grunt work.</p><p id="49a8">Four, knowing when to raise an issue to upper management.</p><p id="ff3f">Five, the ability to mentor junior developers.</p><p id="eb41">Six, vast knowledge of the technicalities for their domain.</p><h2 id="5ec1">Understand how the language works</h2><p id="e035">Focus on one language while learning. Having your focus split between two or three languages will discombobulate you.</p><p id="c797">It becomes obvious when a programmer doesn’t have a good understanding of the programming language he’s using. He’ll try to solve problems by following the logic of other languages and thus litter the code with unnecessary statements that can otherwise be reduced to fewer lines.</p><p id="094c">Also, you must know how to organize code into a system that makes sense. Creating rigid classes, schemas, and hierarchies require you to first think them through. Design can be a broad topic so I won’t cover much, but if you wish to read more, head over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p id="e256">Poorly designed software lacks well-defined concepts, and its responsibilities are vague. Good software, on the other hand, comes with clear concepts and responsibilities. Take a look at mathematicians and physicists. They spend a huge amount of time trying to develop a clear definition of something because that will allow them to understand the truth about it. Developers should take a similar approach and spend a considerable amount of time brainstorming before writing code. Yes, this might be controversial to Agile but you gotta do what you gotta do.</p><p id="8ecf">It’s better to sit down with the dev team initially and outline all the required tasks than to go through 10 rounds of code reviews later.</p><p id="ea9f">Perhaps the best way to learn about design is to write and study many programs written by experienced programmers. As you gain more coding experience, you’ll, without doubt, enhance your design skills and expand your knowledge.</p><p id="0729">Good programmers ask questions like:</p><ul><li id="ff87">What’s the goal of this function?</li><li id="ee63">How can I explain this data structure to my teammates?</li><li id="771f">Can this function represent two standalone tasks?</li><li id="0e31">What’s the responsibility of this snippet of code?</li><li id="0f32">What should I include in the public interface?</li></ul><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2648/0*uR00-riTaFDc4QFt" width="1324" height="919" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*uR00-riTaFDc4QFt 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*uR00-riTaFDc4QFt 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*uR00-riTaFDc4QFt 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*uR00-riTaFDc4QFt 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*uR00-riTaFDc4QFt?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="d2d4">Most people think that you need a diploma from Harvard or universities alike to be considered for a job in big tech companies. Although that may be partially true (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/16/15-companies-that-no-longer-require-employees-to-have-a-college-degree.html" rel="noopener">not always though, it seems Apple and Google no longer require you to have a college degree</a>), some companies prefer the opposite, or at least don’t want you to be coming for Harvard, Oxford, Stanford, etc.</p><p id="3c6c">There are CEOs out there looking for developers that are qualified but not overly qualified… hard workers, being on time, but also leaving at the stroke of 5. Such CEOs consider Ivy League schools to be a red flag. Big resumes are also a red flag. That’s because developers coming from such schools can’t get off their high horse, question whether every decision is optimal, and are always hungry for praise, recognition, and “interesting work.”</p><p id="c97a">Instead, these CEOs are looking for loyal people who know how to take orders without questioning, and are ready to do the work, day in and day out, because they need the paycheck at the end of the month.</p><p id="6749">At a glance, this might seem quite controversial. Yet, there are developers out there who don’t want to become millionaire CTOs at the age of 30. Instead, they are satisfied with what they have on their plate: a steady job, fair pay, and that’s about it. Some companies with that kind of culture say that they have produced a 100% employee retention rate which means developers are happy with their work environment.</p><h2 id="11a4">Let’s talk about your resume now.</h2><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1964/0*P0TDzRLC7SaDQKzK" width="982" height="911" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*P0TDzRLC7SaDQKzK 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*P0TDzRLC7SaDQKzK 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*P0TDzRLC7SaDQKzK 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*P0TDzRLC7SaDQKzK 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*P0TDzRLC7SaDQKzK?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="2aa7">So, what should you list on your resume?</p><p id="8bab">Proficiency in programming languages is, ostensibly, a vital thing to include.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>I read a <a href="https://matklad.github.io/2020/09/20/why-not-rust.html">Why Not Rust?</a> article the other day that was quite good but dismissed the most important reason to use a language to me: <strong>security</strong>. After having worked on a Rust codebase for almost two years now, I thought I would chime in, even though I'll preface the post by saying that Rust is totally the right language you should use if you know what you're doing and are aiming for performance and security, yet I still have some pain points that will make me recommend <a href="https://golang.org/">Golang</a> over Rust sometimes. Keep in mind that I have also spent my whole career looking for bugs in applications written in dozens of different languages, so my post might be highly controversial but it has to be looked from these lenses.</p>
<h2>Shallow standard library</h2>
<p>Working with Rust is like working with Javascript in many ways. While the package manager Cargo is truly awesome, the fact that the standard library misses most features will have you import many third-party dependencies. These dependencies in turn import other third-party dependencies, that import other third-party dependencies, and so on. This blow up of dependencies can quickly become a nightmare, and this is of course a perfect vector of attack for backdoors, like we've seen happen before in javascript land (<a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2018/05/npm-getcookies-backdoor">https://www.infoq.com/news/2018/05/npm-getcookies-backdoor</a>/, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-backdoors-popular-javascript-library-to-steal-bitcoin-funds">https://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-backdoors-popular-javascript-library-to-steal-bitcoin-funds</a>/).</p>
<p>Not only this, but if you're a newcomer to Rust, how do you even pick the right library? I can't even fathom how anyone writing a project in Rust gets to pick a good library for generating cryptographic random numbers, or for doing any type of crypto like encrypting or hashing, or for decoding hex strings, or for decoding JSON, or for using TCP, or even for using TLS! On the other hand Golang has all of that in its standard library, that means that when you use Golang you:</p>
<ul>
<li>can't pick the wrong algorithm (e.g. DES instead of AES)</li>
<li>can't pick a bad implementation (the standard library is known to be high quality) </li>
<li>can't pick a dependency that ends up importing plenty of other third-party dependencies (unlike Rust, the Golang standard library never imports third-party libraries)</li>
<li>don't have to worry about version updates (you're just updating your version of Golang instead of the versions of many dependencies)</li>
<li>don't have to worry about transitive dependencies that you can't update (again, Golang standard library doesn't rely on third-party dependencies)</li>
</ul>
<p>For <a href="http://libra.org/">Libra</a> we've used a number of techniques in order to reduce the number of third-party dependencies we use. This included figuring out when we used different dependencies that did the same thing, or figuring out what obscure dependencies we should avoid, we even re-wrote a large number of dependencies to avoid dependencies that ended up exploding the number of transitive third-party dependencies we imported. One useful tool we used for some of that is <a href="https://github.com/mimoo/cargo-dephell">dephell</a> which is built on top of <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/cargo-guppy">guppy</a>.</p>
<h2>Rustfmt is imperfect</h2>
<p><code>rustfmt</code> is great, but <code>rustfmt</code> sucks. Why does it suck? Two reasons: </p>
<ul>
<li>it's not mandatory</li>
<li>it's configurable</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, Golang's compiler is very strict and will yell at you early on if you have dead code, unused dependencies, badly formatted code, and so on. It doesn't replace <code>gofmt</code>, but it's much more opinionated and is much more effective at making Golang's codebases more readable (especially if they forget to run <code>gofmt</code>). In addition, if you do use <code>gofmt</code>, you can't configure it! This is very apparent when you read Golang code, it always looks the same! And it is pretty fucking fantastic if you ask me, because not only Golang is easy to learn, but you can quickly get used to any Golang codebase due to the consistent formatting of the language.</p>
<h2>Too many ways to do things</h2>
<p>Rust has a somewhat different syntax from other languages of its genre, and you sometimes see things that you might not be used to see (statement as expression, match statements, lifetimes, etc.) I couldn't care less about these, these are things you can learn, and you end up getting used to them. What I can't get used to is the sheer number of ways to do something. There are so many keywords in Rust, and there's so many ways to end up bike shedding on the best way to write the exact same statement, that I consider it a waste of time. It's a waste of time for the developers, but also for the reviewers who will often run into keywords that they've never seen before. For example, there are too many ways to panic on purpose: <code>panic!()</code>, <code>unwrap()</code>, <code>except()</code>, <code>unreachable!()</code>, <code>todo!()</code>, <code>unimplemented!()</code>, <code>assert!()</code>, and so on. </p>
<h2>Generics and macros</h2>
<p>Rust is too expressive. This is of course great for some use-cases, but holy shit if a developer wants to be too clever, they can create the most unintelligible codebase that you'll ever seen. This is probably the most controversial point, but security is not just safety, it's also readability. As we say "complexity is the enemy of security", and generics undeniably add complexity. This is of course up to the developers to abuse them, but the great thing about Golang is that there aren't many things to abuse, codebases are often straight forward and you can quickly understand what is happening.</p>
<h2>Ok, you're being unreasonable David</h2>
<p>Sure, I'm omitting a lot of good Rust things in here, but this is a post about the security downsides of Rust, not the upsides, which let's be clear still make Rust the perfect language to write a sensitive application in. You just need to know what you're doing. This also means that Rust has a lot of room to mature, while generics are here to stay, there is no excuse to keep slipping the shallow stdlib under the rug.</p>

				<p>Either you love gorgeous typography or just don’t care. If you are the former read ahead on how to make the font rendering on your Linux look just as awesome as that on macOS, else read on to find out what beauty you have been missing.</p>
<p>I switched to a hackintosh for a while and fell in love with how beautiful the typography was. After returning to Linux and some fiddiling around I came across a not so ugly setup that looked close enough to macOS. So if you want to make your Linux Distro a tad bit typographically better, follow along.</p>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>This is how the fonts look on the default installation of Manjaro Linux.

<p>This is how they would look after we are done.

<h3 id="some-pointers">Some Pointers</h3>
<p>Rather than copy pasting everything on here, let’s try to understand why the fonts on macOS looks better than the ones we have on Linux.</p>
<p>Fonts belong to certain types.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sans-serif</code> : Well the sans fonts on your computer. The regular plain fonts.</li>
<li><code>serif</code> : The fonts that look like they came out of a 14th century Bible. You know with the curves and they look like showoffs.</li>
<li><code>monospace</code> : The typical code font. The ones where every character is the same width.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason fonts look way better on macOS is because Steve Jobs loved typography, and he went the extra mile and licensed some great typefaces for each font type, and recently Apple put in the extra effort to make their custom fonts even better. Well fret not Linux has some free fonts that are metric compatible(means they look awfully similar), and better that we can substitute for fonts.</p>
<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<p>Step one is installing the fonts that look similar or better than the ones on macOS.
All the fonts that are used here can be found on the Arch Repositories, and on Google Fonts. You are free to replace everything with the ones you find great.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sans-serif</code> : tex-gyre-fonts, free alternative to Helvetica and Arial and looks really really similar</li>
<li><code>serif</code> : Libertinus Serif, suprisingly looks really great</li>
<li><code>monospace</code> : DM Mono from Google Fonts, for monospace fonts that look great</li>
<li><code>emoji</code> : noto-fonts-emoji, get some colorful emojis</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are using Manjaro or Arch here is the command to get all fonts in one go.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">yay -S tex-gyre-fonts otf-libertinus noto-fonts-emoji
</code></pre></div><h3 id="font-setup">Font Setup</h3>
<p>Everything about fonts can be configured from a single file located at <code>/etc/fonts/local.conf</code> if the file doesn’t exist create it. You do require <code>sudo</code> for it.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">sudo nvim /et/fonts/local.conf
</code></pre></div><p>After you are editing the file copy paste everything here.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">&lt;?xml version='1.0'?&gt;

</code></pre></div><p>What this file does that is it creates aliases for the common fonts used on the web and uses the metric compatible fonts that we have. That way we have way better looking fonts.</p>
<p>After you have done all this, restart your computer to see the changes.</p>
<h3 id="chrome">Chrome</h3>
<p>If you are using chrome, you can do something more too.</p>
<ul>
<li>Goto Settings</li>
<li>Select Customize Fonts under Appearences</li>
<li>Set Standard to <code>Libertinus Serif</code></li>
<li>Set Serif to <code>Libertinus Serif</code></li>
<li>Set Sans-serif to <code>TeX Gyre Heros</code></li>
<li>Set Fixed-width to <code>Monospace</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="interface-text">Interface Text</h3>
<p>For Desktop Environments like Gnome and KDE, you could use Tex-Gyre-Heros for the overall Helvetica look. I use Gnome 3.36 and use <code>TeX Gyre Heros Regular 10</code> as my interface text.</p>
<p>That’s all set, and keep in mind this guide will be improved.</p>

    <p> <i>Dear Reader: although this post mentions Clojure as an example, it is not specifically about Clojure; please do not make it part of a language war. If you know other configurations which allow for a productive REPL experience, please describe them in the comments!</i></p><p> <img src="https://vvvvalvalval.github.io/img/repl.gif" width="100%"></p><p>Most comparisons I see of Clojure to other programming languages are in terms of its programming language <em>semantics</em>:  immutability, homoiconicity, data-orientation, dynamic typing, first-class functions, polymorphism 'à la carte'...  All of these are interesting and valuable features, but what actually gets me to <em>choose</em> Clojure for projects is its interactive  development story, enabled by <em>the REPL</em> (Read-Eval-Print Loop), which lets you evaluate Clojure expressions in an interactive  shell (including expressions which let you modify the state or behaviour of a running program).  </p><p>If you're not familiar with Clojure, you may be surprised that I describe the REPL as Clojure's most differentiating feature:   after all, most industrial programming languages come with REPLs or 'shells' these days (including Python, Ruby, Javascript, PHP, Scala,  Haskell, ...). However, I've never managed to reproduced the productive REPL workflow I had in Clojure with those languages;  the truth is that <strong>not all REPLs are created equal</strong>.</p><p>In this post, I'll try to describe what a 'good' REPL gives you, then list some technical characteristics which make some REPLs   qualify as 'good'. Finally, I'll try to reflect on what programming language features give REPLs the most leverage.</p><h2 id="what_does_a_good_repl_give_you?">What does a good REPL give you?</h2><p>The short answer is: by providing a <i>tight feedback loop</i>, and making your programs <i>tangible</i>,  a REPL helps you deliver programs with significantly higher productivity and quality.  If you're wondering why a tight feedback loop is important for creative activities such as programming, I recommend you watch  <a href="https://www.vimeo.com/36579366">this talk by Bret Victor</a>.</p><p>If you have no idea what REPL-based development looks like, I suggest you watch a few minutes of  <a href="https://vimeo.com/230220635" target="_blank">the following video</a>:</p><p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/230220635" width="640" height="359" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Now, here's the long answer: <i>A good REPL gives you...</i></p><h3 id="a_smooth_transition_from_manual_to_automated">A smooth transition from manual to automated</h3><p>The vast majority of the programs we write essentially automate tasks that humans can do themselves.  Ideally, to automate a complex task, we should be able to break it down into smaller sub-tasks, then gradually automate each of the subtasks until reaching a fully-automated solution.  If you were to build a sophisticated machine like a computer from scratch, you would want to make sure you understand how the individual components work before putting them together, right?  Unfortunately, this is not what we get with the typical write/(compile)/run/watch-stdout workflow, in which we essentially put all the pieces together blindly and pray it works the first time we hit 'run'.  The story is different with a REPL: you will have played with each piece of code in isolation before running the whole program,  which makes you quite confident that each of the sub-tasks is well implemented.</p><p>This is also true in the other direction: when a fully-automated program breaks, in order to debug it,  you will want to re-play some of the sub-tasks manually.</p><p>Finally, not all programs need be fully automated - sometimes the middle ground between manual and automated is exactly what you want.  For instance, a REPL is a great environment to run ad hoc queries to your database, or perform ad hoc data analysis, while leveraging  all of the automated code you have already written for your project - much better than working with database clients, especially when  you need to query several data stores or reproduce advanced business logic to access the data.</p><p>How's life without a REPL? Here's a list of things that we do to cope with these issues when we don't have a REPL:</p><ul><li>Experiment with interactive tools such as cURL or database clients, then reproduce what we did in code.  Problem: you can't connect these in any way with your existing codebase. These tools are good at experimenting manually,  but then you have to code all the way to bridge the gap between making it work with these tools and having it work in your project.</li><li>Run scripts which call our codebase to print to standard output our files. Problem: you need to know exactly what to output before writing the script; you can't hold on to program state and <em>improvise</em> from there, as we'll discuss in the next section.</li><li>Use unit tests (possibly with auto-reloading), which have a number of limitations in this regard, as we'll see later in this post.</li></ul><h3 id="a_repl_lets_you_improvise">A REPL lets you improvise</h3><p>Software programming is primarily and <i>exploratory</i> activity.  If we had a precise idea of how our programs should work before writing them, we'd be <i>using</i> code, not writing it.</p><p>Therefore, we should be able to write our programs incrementally, one expression at a time, figuring out what to do next at each step,  <i>walking the machine through</i> our current thinking. This is simply not what the  compile/run-the-whole-thing/look-at-the-logs workflow gives you.</p><p>In particular, one situation where this ability is critical is fixing bugs in an emergency.  When you have to reproduce the problem, isolate the cause, simulate the fix and finally apply it, a REPL is often the  difference between minutes and hours.</p><p>Fun fact: maybe the most spectacular occurrence of this situation was the fixing of a bug  of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gZK0tW8EhQ">Deep Space 1</a> probe in 1999,  which fortunately happened to run a Common Lisp REPL while drifting off course several light-minutes away from Earth.</p><h3 id="a_repl_lets_you_write_fewer_tests,_faster">A REPL lets you write fewer tests, faster</h3><p>Automated tests are very useful for expressing what your code is supposed to do,  and giving you confidence that it works and keeps working correctly.</p><p>However, when I see some TDD codebases, it seems to me that a lot of unit tests are mostly here to make the code more tangible while developing, which is the same value proposition as using a REPL. However, using unit tests for this purpose comes with its lot of issues:</p><ol><li>Having too many unit tests makes your codebase harder to evolve. You ideally want to have as few tests as possible capture as many properties of your domain as possible.</li><li>Tests can only ever answer close-ended questions: "does this work?", but not "how does this work?", "what does this look like?" etc.</li><li>Tests typically won't run in real-world conditions: they'll use simple, artificial data and mocks of services such as databases or API clients. As a result, they don't typically help you understand a problem that only happens on real-life data, nor do they give you confidence that the real-life implementations of the services they emulate do work.</li></ol><p>So it seems to me a lot of unit tests get written for lack of a better solution for interactivity,  even though they don't really pull their weight as unit tests.  When you have a REPL, you can make the choice to only write the tests that matter.</p><p>What's more, the REPL <i>helps you</i> write these tests. Once you have explored from the REPL, you can just copy and paste  some of the REPL history to get both example data and expected output. You can even use the REPL to assist you in writing  the fixture data for your tests by generating it programmatically (everyone who has written comprehensive fixture datasets  by hand knows how tedious this can get). Finally, when writing the tests require implementing some non-trivial logic  (as is the case when doing Property-Based Testing), the productivity benefits of the REPL for writing code applies to writing tests as well.</p><p>Again, do <i>not</i> take from this that a REPL is a replacements for tests. Please do write tests, and let the REPL help you  write the right tests effectively.</p><h3 id="a_repl_makes_you_write_accessible_code">A REPL makes you write accessible code</h3><p>A REPL-based workflow encourages you to write programs which manipulate values that are <strong><i>easy to fabricate.</i></strong>  If you need to set up a complex graph of objects before you can make a single method call, you won't be very inclined to use the REPL.  </p><p>As a result, you'll tend to write <strong><i>accessible code</i></strong> - with few dependencies, little environmental coupling, high modularity,   and tangible inputs and outputs.  This is likely to make your code more clear, easy to test, and easy to debug.  </p><p>To be clear, this <i>is</i> an additional constraint on your code (it requires some upfront thinking to make your code REPL-friendly,  just likes it requires some upfront thinking to make your code easy to test) - but I believe it's a very beneficial constraint.  When my car engine breaks, I'm glad I can just lift the hood and access all the parts - and making this possible  has certainly put more work on the plate of car designers.</p><p>Another way a REPL makes code more accessible is that it makes it easier to learn, by providing a rich playground for beginners to experiment.  This applies to both learning languages and onboarding existing projects.</p><h2 id="what_makes_a_good_repl?">What makes a good REPL?</h2><p>As I said above, not all REPLs give you the same power.  Having experimented with REPLs in various configurations of language and tooling,  this is the list of the main things I believe a REPL should enable you to do to give you the most leverage:</p><ol><li><strong>Defining new behaviour / modify existing behaviour.</strong> For instance, in a procedural language, this means defining new functions, and modify the implementation of existing functions.</li><li><strong>Saving state in-memory.</strong> If you can't hold on to the data you manipulate, you will waster a ton of effort re-obtaining it - it's like doing your paperwork without a desk.</li><li><strong>Outputting values which can easily be translated to code.</strong> This means that the textual representation the REPL outputs is suitable for being embedded in code.</li><li><strong>Giving you access to your whole project code.</strong> You should be able to call any piece of code written in your project of its dependencies. As an execution …</li></ol></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wrapper"><div id="container"><div><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>I dabbled in Phoenix for a while now, but never <em>really</em> got my hands dirty with it right up until now. Apart from the whole framework being surprisingly well thought through, there are a few things that strike me as being done <em>exceptionally</em> well in Phoenix, compared to the rest of modern web frameworks.</p><p><img src="https://scorpil.com/img/phoenix.png" alt="Phoenix Framework Logo"></p><h3 id="1-striking-a-balance-between-flexibility-and-strictness">1. Striking a balance between flexibility and strictness</h3><p>Modern web frameworks can be roughly divided into two camps:</p><ul><li>Flexible “DIY” frameworks are a little more than a set of utilities for the most common web-related tasks. Most Go frameworks are like this, as well as ExpressJS. They enforce little to no rules for the structure of your applications and rely on the community to come up with the extensions and best practices. As a result, they are very flexible; those with a large community have extensions to perform any task imaginable. On the flip side, apps built on such a foundation can, given poor governance, slowly evolve into an unsupportable mess of incompatible plugins and mismatched coding styles.</li><li>Strict “batteries included” frameworks bring with them a complete set of tools to perform common web development tasks, as well as a set of conventions to go with it. They guide the developer into optimal code structure and typically strive to provide a single favored way of doing things. Of course, these kinds of frameworks are also extendable, but built-in tools often get embedded so deep into the project that they are almost irreplaceable. In this category, the most popular examples are Django and Ruby on Rails.</li></ul><p>Of course, most frameworks are not on an extreme end of the scale, but the distinction is there. Worth noting that neither group is strictly better than the other – each has its usecases.</p><p>Phoenix Framework, in my mind, holds very close to the middle of this scale for these reasons:</p><ul><li>it builds upon Elixir’s functional philosophy, so it has a very clear idea how things <em>should</em> work (single request context passed around as the first argument to all components that participate in a response generation, avoiding side effects where possible, MVC-inspired architecture, etc.)</li><li>it does not hide its internal details in a “black box”, quite the opposite - it encourages you to understand internal conventions to write your own code in the same fashion. When you get comfortable using a framework, you can probably read its code without too much trouble.</li><li>by default Phoenix comes with a huge pack of tools and utils (ORM, routing, test suit, HTML rendering, metrics dashboard (sic!)…), but in most cases, there’s a trivial way to swap them out or turn them off.</li></ul><h3 id="2-reactiveness">2. Reactiveness</h3><p>When an app requires bi-directional communication between client and server, you usually either
integrate a 3rd party library into the framework, which means writing a pile of glue code, or
use a specialized framework like Tornado, which (caution, personal opinion here) kind of an awkward choice for those parts of the web app that do not concern themselves with WebSockets.</p><p>Phoenix is great for classical HTTP, but persistent communication is where it <em>really</em> shines. Primitives it gives you with channels, PubSub and Presence are just enough to avoid boilerplate without sacrificing flexibility. Recent live view release is a whole new way of building dynamic apps. I wouldn’t go as far as to call it revolutionary, but it is definitely an intriguing attempt of bridging the gap between frontend and backend.</p><h3 id="3-performance">3. Performance</h3><p>Phoenix’s performance has surprisingly little to do with the framework itself. It inherited its impressive concurrence characteristics from Elixir, which got it from Erlang, which got it thanks to the primitives of the BEAM virtual machine and the architectural patterns of OTP. The main principle at work to achieve concurrency is to schedule lightweight threads of execution to run each independent piece of work concurrently. You might have seen this approach in other languages (goroutines, python’s greenlets, etc.), that’s because it works great to organize concurrent code execution without performance hit and with a minimal headache for a developer. However, BEAM gives this concept support on a VM level, which means it can be optimized even on a hardware level.</p><p>While lightweight processes help you perform well on your IO-bound tasks, Elixir being a compiled language means that CPU bound tasks won’t bottleneck easily as well, and perform on less computing resources than most alternatives. While I can’t be 100% sure that it will be faster for your application than Go or Rust in terms of CPU usage, I’m reasonably sure that it will be more than fast enough in a context of a typical web app.</p><p><em><strong>Update:</strong> correction based on discussion in here and on other platforms: Elixir is slower than Go/Rust on purely CPU-bound tasks, mainly because BEAM interrupts running threads for task scheduling. Also, Elixir/Erlang compiles to bytecode, not directly to the machine code (although BeamAsm, JIT compiler for Erlang’s VM, has <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/2745">landed in master 4 days ago</a>, so this should change in the next OTP release).</em></p><h3 id="4-failure-tolerance-and-cluster-awareness">4. Failure tolerance and cluster-awareness</h3><p>You might have heard Phoenix being called a “monolithic framework”. This is true to some extent: Phoenix <em>does</em> encourage you to put your frontend, backend, and background tasks in the same app. However, it also provides facilities to ensure that failure in a single component of the app will not affect other independent components. To explain in short, the app is divided into processes that communicate with each other via kind-of event messages. Each component is supervised, the supervisor will catch unhandled failures and restart the process in an attempt to fix them. It’s somewhat reminiscent of a microservice architecture, just on a lower level.</p><p>Unlike most frameworks, Phoenix understands that it will most likely run on more than one node. It provides a way to communicate over the network in exactly the same way you communicate between the processes within your app.</p><p>This does not mean that Phoenix is a bad choice for microservices, it just means that framework itself can handle some of the same concerns microservices are designed to handle. A smaller app might benefit from that by avoiding some of the complexities of building up your own microservices architecture. Bigger apps, and those that are already built as microservices, can still incorporate Phoenix effectively.</p><h3 id="are-there-any-drawbacks">Are there any drawbacks?</h3><p>Elixir, and functional programming in general, is still a long way away from the mainstream. If you don’t know your way around closures, immutable data structures, and functional thinking it will take you a while before getting to feel comfortable with Phoenix. The good news is that functional programming is on an upwards trend, and with applications growing more parallel and distributed, I don’t think this trend will reverse any time soon. So the knowledge you acquire in the process will serve you well going forward, independent from what the future holds for Phoenix.</p><p>The included tooling is great, but you might miss some 3rd party SDK’s when you need them. That’s definitely something to consider when starting a project. To give you an example: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tools-sdks/">AWS</a> at the time of writing does not provide an official elixir client library.</p><p>Phoenix Framework a rock-solid, production-ready tool with a variety of usecases. It feels fresh and well thought through. I won’t be surprised if Phoenixes popularity continues to grow to reach the level of „Top tier“ frameworks in the next few years.</p></div></article></div></div></div></div>]]>

                    <p>A lot of trust needs to be put in to cryptocurrency exchanges. Firstly because you're entrusting them with your Fiat currency, and secondly because you're entrusting them with the <em>keys </em>to your cryptocurrency.</p><p>Each cryptocurrency address, regardless if it's Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Ethereum, is a public representation of a pair of <em>cryptographic keys</em>. That pair consists of two parts - a <strong>public </strong>key, and a <strong>private </strong>key. What's important here is that the <strong>private </strong>key is what allows you to make transactions, giving you the ability to transfer coins to other parties.</p><p>Now if you've ever used an exchange before, you'll notice that <strong>you don't normally see these keys</strong>. The exchange is managing it all for you in the background. They might have the keys for a Bitcoin or Ethereum address specifically created for your account in the background, which they're using to then make the trades that you ask them to via their website or app.</p><p>This is great, but those private keys? You're not going to see them. In fact if you transfer coins out of exchanges and <a href="https://live.blockcypher.com/">watch the transaction with a service like BlockCypher</a> - you'll often see the amount you transferred came from some address that was holding a lot more on it as a pool for multiple users, and your particular amount was divvied out to wherever you asked it to go with the remainer staying on the original address or moved somewhere else.</p><p>This kind of environment wasn't quite the intent for cryptocurrency - the intent was to <em>decentralise </em>- i.e. as a user, you control your own keys - not some larger authority like a bank. Most of the popular exchanges are well run and have proven themselves so far regarding trust and security, but ultimately they still hold your keys. They can assure you of their security controls and processes over and over, even enabling 2-Factor Authentication to <em>really</em> lock down access with YubiKeys, OTP tokens, and SMS codes. They can assure you that they provide cold storage services to <em>really</em> lock down access. But even 5 or 500 layers of security, never forget <strong>- they still hold your keys</strong>.</p><h2 id="so-what-should-you-do">So what should you do?</h2><p>The first step is to take ownership back. Most exchanges provide a capability to <em>send</em> your holdings to another address. They usually bury that feature behind a bunch of menus, but you should hopefully find the capability. All you need to do is create addresses in a product under your control, like <a href="https://signata.net/">Signata</a>, and then you can use those addresses as the destination for sending your holdings from the exchange.</p><p>The second step is to enable 2FA on the exchange. Yes, we've just outlined why 2FA isn't enough to protect your holdings - but that doesn't mean you shouldn't be using it anyway. At some point you're going to want to move your holding from Signata back into the exchange to trade them for fiat (or other currencies).

<p>There’s an ongoing discussion about what makes Python better prototyping
language than Rust (with Python being probably just the archetype of some
scripted weakly-typed language). The thing is, I prefer doing my prototypes in
Rust over Python. Apparently, I’m not the only one. So I wanted to share few
things about what makes Rust viable for these kinds of throw-away coding
sprints, at least for me.</p>

<h2 id="our-goals">Our goals</h2>

<p>Sometimes, our goal isn’t really to write perfect code that is performant,
correct, handles all kinds of errors sanely, has great UX and is maintainable.
These projects are what we are proud of, sure. We pin them on github profiles.
We write blog posts about them. We write whole handbooks of best practices how
to do them.</p>

<p>But sometimes we just need to throw something together really fast and don’t
care about the quality as much. That kind of bit of cardboard and huge amount of
duck tape thing. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Single-use debugging tools („I need to throw 10k of these weird requests at
the server to see if it triggers the bug. It didn’t? Ok, let’s try something
else…“)</li>
  <li>Searching for a counter-example to a claim in a scientific paper („I can prove
it’s a counter example once I have it, so I won’t need the code any more“)</li>
  <li>Processing bunch of data just once („I wonder how many of these <code>.txt</code> files
have broken unicode in them“)</li>
  <li>Figuring if something has any chance to fly at all, before committing to it
(„Could I distribute the changes as compressed binary diffs, or would that be
too large?“)</li>
  <li>Demonstration purposes („We would like to build something in lines of this,
but, you know, actually working“)</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, there’s a lot more. I’m not even sure if there’s more of the „proper“
coding or of this „throw away“ coding. Except that we don’t really brag about
our throw-away code („Look what terrible monster I’ve stitched together during
the lunch break“), we don’t write tutorials how to write them much, etc. So this
is exactly the kind of blog post we don’t write 😈.</p>

<p>Instead of writing something proper this time, we are going to talk about
how to write terrible code, but fast. We have decided to make an explicitly
sloppy job of this one and admit it to ourselves not to feel ashamed of it
later:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We want to spend as little time on it as possible. Just do it, throw the code
away after it had its use and move on. This one is going to be over by lunch
time.</li>
  <li>We don’t care about performance that much (as long as it finishes running
before the lunch too).</li>
  <li>We don’t care about handling all corner cases, only the ones we actually
encounter in the data.</li>
  <li>We don’t care about documentation or readability.</li>
  <li>We don’t care about tests, provided we are confident enough the answers are
accurate enough.</li>
  <li>Actually, we don’t really care at all…</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note: make sure not to let anyone put this into production 😇. If you don’t
delete it, make sure there’s a comment on a prominent place warning people not
to use it.</em></p>

<h2 id="why-do-people-think-python-fits-here-better-than-rust">Why do people think Python fits here better than Rust</h2>

<p>The thing is, Rust <em>makes us</em> care. That’s one of the points of Rust. It’ll
complain that our code is not production quality and that we need to do better
to save on the pain down the line. Its type system can be a real prick in
insisting on little details, like that ints and strings are not really the same
thing and that there’s a difference between owned and borrowed thing and… Well,
you know, all that stuff. Rust wants you to make good, proper, maintainable
code.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Python doesn’t really insist on anything. Therefore, it is
easier to not care in Python.</p>

<h2 id="my-own-experience">My own experience</h2>

<p>I know a bunch of programming languages and reach for the one that I hope would
suit me best in the given time. So, for some really simple things I simply put
together few lines of shell (and some slightly less simple ones ‒ I’m ashamed to
admit that some 1000 lines long shell monster kept running in real production
for years ‒ but it <em>did run</em>). If it can be done by 2 or 3 ugly pipelines, it’s
fine.</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve used Perl a lot (that one doesn’t care if it’s int or
string… no, correction, in Perl everything is a string, ints just don’t exist.
Well, kind of). It’s probably <em>the</em> language designed for throw away coding.
I’ve done some Python too (that’s like Perl, but with proper objects in it, and
everything is a dictionary there).</p>

<p>But recently I’ve noticed that if I try to do a similar thing, I do it faster in
Rust. Not that it runs faster (well, that usually too, but that’s not the
point), but that I’m done with the task at hand sooner and with slightly smaller
amount of cursing.</p>

<p>This certainly is in part because I’m more proficient in Rust than in Python.
It’s also because the Rust mental model is closer to how my brain works than the
Python one. <strong>Your mileage will vary</strong> ‒ if you’re a Python matador who’s been
coding in it for decades and are just learning Rust, you’ll certainly do it
faster in Python.</p>

<p>But also, there are some tricks you might employ to do these things in Rust
faster (that is, faster than you do now, not necessarily faster than in
<code>$OTHER_LANGUAGE</code>).</p>

<h2 id="tricks-for-faster-coding">Tricks for faster coding</h2>

<h3 id="compile-times">Compile times</h3>

<p>Rust is known for its slow compile times. Python has <em>no</em> compile times. If you
have to wait every time for the compilation just to have a bunch of errors
thrown into your face, it’s going to slow you down. Especially because Rust
<em>likes to</em> throw bunch of errors at you every time you try to compile it. Rust
is known for its great error messages, so it wants to brag how good they are by
using them <em>a lot</em>.</p>

<p>You can, however, notice that you don’t really need to <em>build and run</em> every
time. That you often just want to check everything is on the right path. For
Python, you do need to actually run the thing (because Python doesn’t really
have much of a compile time so it likes to throw the bunch of errors into your
face at <em>run time</em>), but Rust is the language that „if
it compiles, it’s correct“. And by complies, I actually mean mostly type-checks.</p>

<p>What does this all mean? You can check out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <code>rust-analyzer</code> language server. You’ll be getting red squiggles in the
editor instead of having to compile. It’s not perfect (sometimes the list of
errors is different, sometimes it just gives up on that particular project),
but it’s getting better and it points out most of the errors without any
compilation at all.</li>
  <li><code>cargo check</code> performs just the first stages of compilation and will stop
before codegen. It means it doesn’t produce anything that could be run, but
it is so much faster and provides the bunch of errors we so much want to have.</li>
  <li>You can let <code>cargo watch</code> keep recompiling the code asynchronously in another
terminal. I just glance at it to check if there are any errors around, but I
don’t wait for it ‒ at worst, the list of errors is one iteration outdated. It
can be used for other things, like keeping the documentation of the current
crate up to date, or having a head start at compiling the executable, or even
having all the tests being re-run on each save (I’m getting off topic here; we
are being sloppy here on purpose, so what tests are we talking about?)</li>
</ul>

<p>These don’t make the compile times shorter, but it eliminates the <em>waiting</em> for
them from the hot coding path. It still takes some time to compile (especially
if you have a lot of dependencies and do a clean release build), but that
doesn’t mean it has to slow you down.</p>

<h3 id="embrace-the-type-system-and-borrow-checker-and-all-of-these-things">Embrace the type system (and borrow checker and all of these things)</h3>

<p>After some time working with Rust, one learns to lean onto them instead of
fighting them.</p>

<p>This is where most of my own speed up comes from and what I miss about Python.
When I want to know if my code is working, I actually have to run the Python
thing and feed it with data. Which means I either need to set up a smaller input
or wait for the whole thing to get crunched, only to have it explode on some
typo or switched order of parameters after 5 minutes of running. After 10
iterations of running the Python code (each crashing later and later in the
code), it finally finishes. By that time, I’m no longer confident it does what
it should, after all these retries, so I go back and have to figure a way to
double-check it.</p>

<p>In Rust not only I don’t have to run the code until it is almost finished and
even when I feed it the whole input (which I usually do), it’s usually faster
and it runs to completion the first time. I also can move through the code much
faster. With Python, I stop to check the documentation, think about what type
goes where, etc, exactly because it’s so painful to find out only at runtime. I
need to be careful while writing the code.
With Rust, I just type the code, get the red squiggly, fix it and move on. I
outsource that effort of checking if these things click together in any
meaningful way to the compiler.</p>

<p>This is kind of in the theme of „hurry slowly“ approach. By making sure
everything has the right types and aligns well, it makes each iteration slower.
But it also makes it possible to have much fewer iterations before the whole
thing works well enough.</p>

<p>Also, don’t fall for the impression that throwing <code>unsafe</code> in there to bypass
some of the checking will save you time. It won’t. It’s a trap. If you don’t
know for sure that you need it, then you probably don’t and doing <code>unsafe</code> right
is a lot of work. Doing it wrong is easy, maybe easier than doing it safely, but
you’ll pay for it later on, when trying to figure out why the thing does
something arcanely weird. If you put any non-trivial <code>unsafe</code> in the code,
you’re risking spending days and nights in front of a debugger. The checks are
there for a reason.</p>

<h3 id="take-the-easy-way-out">Take the easy way out</h3>

<p>I don’t say to clone everything. Even in prototyping code, I often take <code>&amp;str</code>
as parameter if it’s just „looking at it“. But I do so in the obvious, trivial
cases. The ones I don’t really need to think about any more.</p>

<p>But if you ever find yourself thinking about writing any kind of
<code>-&gt; impl Iterator&lt;Item = &amp;impl Display&gt; + '_</code>, just stop and throw a
<code>Vec&lt;String…</code></p></section></div></div>

<p>Web Components had so much potential to empower HTML to do more, and make web development more accessible to non-programmers and easier for programmers. Remember how exciting it was every time we got new shiny HTML elements that actually <em>do stuff</em>? Remember how exciting it was to be able to do sliders, color pickers, dialogs, disclosure widgets straight in the HTML, without having to include any widget libraries?</p>



<p>The promise of Web Components was that we’d get this convenience, but for a much wider range of HTML elements, developed much faster, as nobody needs to wait for the full spec + implementation process. We’d just include a script, and boom, we have more elements at our disposal!</p>



<p>Or, that was the idea. Somewhere along the way, the space got flooded by JS frameworks aficionados, who revel in complex APIs, overengineered build processes and dependency graphs that look like the roots of a banyan tree.</p>



<figure><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/2025/32441377780_e3acf6de12_b.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>This is what the roots of a Banyan tree look like. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/79721788@N00/32441377780/">Photo by David Stanley on Flickr (CC-BY)</a>. </figcaption></figure>



<p>Perusing the components on <a href="https://www.webcomponents.org/">webcomponents.org</a> fills me with anxiety, and I’m perfectly comfortable writing JS — I write JS for a living! What hope do those who can’t write JS have? Using a custom element from the directory often needs to be preceded by a ritual of npm flugelhorn, import clownshoes, build quux, all completely unapologetically because “here is my truckload of dependencies, yeah, what”. Many steps are even omitted, likely because they are “obvious”. Often, you wade through the maze only to find the component doesn’t work anymore, or is not fit for your purpose.</p>



<p>Besides setup, the main problem is that HTML is not treated with the appropriate respect in the design of these components. They are not designed as closely as possible to standard HTML elements, but <em>expect</em> JS to be written for them to do anything. HTML is simply treated as a shorthand, or worse, as merely a marker to indicate where the element goes in the DOM, with all parameters passed in via JS. I recall <a href="https://adactio.com/articles/12839#webcomponents">a wonderful talk by Jeremy Keith</a> a few years ago about this very phenomenon, where he discussed <a href="https://shop.polymer-project.org/">this e-shop Web components demo by Google</a>, which is the poster child of this practice. These are the entire contents of its <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element:</p>



<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;
	&lt;shop-app unresolved=""&gt;SHOP&lt;/shop-app&gt;
	&lt;script src="node_assets/@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-loader.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
	&lt;script type="module" src="src/shop-app.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
	&lt;script&gt;window.performance&amp;&amp;performance.mark&amp;&amp;performance.mark("index.html");&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;</code></pre>



<p>If this is how Google is leading the way, how can we hope for contributors to design components that follow established HTML conventions?</p>



<p>Jeremy criticized this practice from the aspect of backwards compatibility: when JS is broken or not enabled, or the browser doesn’t support Web Components, the entire website is blank. While this is indeed a serious concern, my primary concern is one of <strong>usability</strong>: <strong>HTML is a lower barrier to entry language</strong>. Far more people can write HTML than JS. Even for those who do eventually write JS, it often comes after spending years writing HTML &amp; CSS.</p>



<p>If components are designed in a way that requires  JS, this excludes thousands of people from using them. And even for those who <em>can</em> write JS, HTML is often easier: you don’t see many people rolling their own sliders or using JS-based ones once <code>&lt;input type="range"&gt;</code> became widely supported, right?</p>



<p>Even when JS is unavoidable, it’s not black and white. A well designed HTML element can reduce the amount and complexity of JS needed to a minimum. Think of the <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog">&lt;dialog&gt;</a></code> element: it usually does require *some* JS, but it’s usually rather simple JS. Similarly, the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element is perfectly usable just by writing HTML, and has a comprehensive JS API for anyone who wants to do fancy custom things.</p>



<p>The other day I was looking for a simple, dependency free, tabs component. You know, the canonical example of something that is easy to do with Web Components, the example 50% of tutorials mention. I didn’t even care what it looked like, it was for a testing interface. I just wanted something that is small and works like a normal HTML element. Yet, it proved so hard I ended up writing my own!</p>



<h3>Can we fix this?</h3>



<p>I’m not sure if this is a design issue, or a documentation issue. Perhaps for many of these web components, there are easier ways to use them. Perhaps there are vanilla web components out there that I just can’t find. Perhaps I’m looking in the wrong place and there is another directory somewhere with different goals and a different target audience. </p>



<p>But if not, and if I’m not alone in feeling this way, we need a directory of web components with strict inclusion criteria:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Plug and play.</strong> No dependencies, no setup beyond including one <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag. If a dependency is absolutely <em>needed</em> (e.g. in a map component it doesn’t make sense to draw your own maps), the component loads it automatically if it’s not already loaded.</li><li>Syntax and API follows <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/02/designing-html-apis/"><strong>conventions established by built-in HTML elements</strong></a> and anything that <em>can</em> be done without the component user writing JS, <em>is</em> doable without JS, per <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html">the W3C principle of least power</a>.</li><li><strong>Accessible by default</strong> via sensible ARIA defaults, just like normal HTML elements.</li><li><strong>Themable</strong> via <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::part">::part()</a></code>, selective inheritance and custom properties. Very minimal style by default. Normal CSS properties should just “work” to the the extent possible.</li><li><strong>Only one component of a given type</strong> in the directory, that is <strong>flexible</strong> and <strong>extensible</strong> and continuously iterated on and improved by the community. Not 30 different sliders and 15 different tabs that users have to wade through. No branding, no silos of “component libraries”. Only elements that are designed as closely as possible to what a browser would implement in every way the current technology allows.</li></ul>



<p>I would be up for working on this if others feel the same way, since that is not a project for one person to tackle. <em>Who’s with me?</em></p>

September 24, 2020 | https://karma-engineering.com/lab/wiki/Haskell/Vedanta | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://karma-engineering.com/lab/wiki/Haskell/Vedanta">archive.org</a>

<p>
A program is precise specification of a process, detailed-enough to be executed by an abstract machine.
</p>
<p>
An algorithm is a formalized (well-defined and precise) general procedure (a sequence of actions to perform), to be implemented in all sufficient and necessary details.
</p>
<h2 id="Haskell">Haskell</h2>
<p>
Haskell is pure Logic. Strongly-typed with type-classes and highly syntactically sugared, which is compiled to a intermediate language (MIR) which is also a language based on a <em>Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus</em>, which, in turn, is <em>evaluated by runtime as a type-checked state machine</em> - this is what the function <code>main</code> produces (which is what a Haskell executable really is).
</p>
<p>
Not just that, all Haskell code, including MIR, could be evaluated by pure substitution -- by applying rewrite rules, (beta-reduction, inlining, etc.) exactly like Logic and Math, which, look at this:
</p>
<p>
<em>makes Haskell a pure high-order predicate logic, statically typed with type-classes, reducible to pure Lambda Calculus (as its implementation)</em>.
</p>
<p>
C++ is a joke compared to this and NodeJS is just bullshit.
</p>
<h2 id="Purity">Purity</h2>
<p>
All Haskell expressions are pure, even when they describe impure actions to be performed eventually by mundane impure runtime.
</p>
<p>
The expression produced by the main function is a pure definition of a state-machine (an actual structure!) verified to be type-safe (have no contradictions) by the compiler.
</p>
<p>
Each function is pure because the <em>context</em> (or state) is always passed to it as a parameter, even <em>The Whole World</em> is passed in the case of IO (implementation, however, throws it away!).
</p>
<p>
From the mathematical point of view if you have the whole world as a parameter to a function which returns a value <em>together with a new version of the world, after causing some effect on it</em>, then, the function is indeed pure. <em>Same input - same output. Always</em>.
</p>
<p>
This is not a joke. Not just a beautiful metaphor. As long as all functions are pure <em>the substitution model of evaluation (as in Lambda Calculus, Logic and Mathematics) still holds</em>, so Haskell is still a pure higher-order logic - <em>Simply Typed Lambda Calculus extended with some additional evaluation rules, type-classes and decorated with some syntactic sugar</em>. Its MIT is exactly this.
</p>
<p>
One more time: Haskell code is <em>a Pure Logic</em>, not just theoretically but technically and operationally.
</p>
<p>
It all can, in principle, be evaluated with pen and pencil using substitution. Just like Maths.
</p>
<h2 id="Monads">Monads</h2>
<p>
Haskell literally separates a pure functional code from impure by  creating <em>an abstraction barrier</em> between pure and impure code by encapsulation such code into various <a href="https://karma-engineering.com/lab/wiki/Haskell/Monads">Monads</a>.
</p>
<p>
Separation (an abstraction barrier) is enforced at a type level.
Functions below cannot access values (and functions) above.
</p>
<p>
The <em>contexts</em> could play very different roles, from holding algebraic data types, such as <code>Either</code> or <code>Maybe</code>, to encapsulations <code>State</code> and <code>IO</code>.
</p>
<p>
Being composed (which is what it is all about) Monads provide an implicit sequencing for a pure, lazy code, via <a href="https://karma-engineering.com/lab/wiki/FirstPrinciples/Nesting">nesting</a> of functions -- <code>(.)</code> and <code>(&gt;&gt;=)</code> are merely nested lambdas.
</p>
<p>
Thus, Monads are fit to encapsulate <code>IO</code> actions which imply serialization (sequencing).
</p>
<p>
End of the long and messy story.
</p>
<h2 id="Endofknowledge.">End of knowledge.</h2>
<p>
Technically, Haskell is a pure-functional language with lazy semantics  which is statically (and, obviously, strongly) typed with type-classes. It is simplified into an intermediate language (representation), which is just <em>Simple-Typed Lambda Calculus extended with a few additional types, syntactic forms and evaluation rules</em>. Even more technically, it uses <em>System F Omega formalism</em> to implement High-order Logic.

Time zones are hard. Dealing with time zones in software development?  Yeah, <strong>harder</strong>.</p>
<p>Here are <strong>4</strong> places where time zones might differ; and 4 personal bug stories for each case. I'll be referring to the same app for each story, the one I work with and maintain in my day-to-day job. This app works with Mexico's City time zone.</p>

<h2 id="time-zone-of-your-app">Time zone of your app</h2>
<p>Your app runs with a default time zone. It's usually the time zone of the server it runs on, but it can be different.</p>
<p>In Java, you can define the time zone of the whole application when it boots. If for some reason you don't want to work with your server's timezone, this is the place to change it.</p>
<h3 id="the-bug-time-in-chile-off-by-one-hour">The bug - Time in Chile off by one hour</h3>
<p>The app shows the date of creation of an object in many places. Three of these places were showing different times; <strong>two incorrect and one correct</strong>.</p>
<p>One error was because I forgot to pass the user's timezone to the date formatter. Quick fix.</p>
<p>The second error was weird. I couldn't identify why, so I compared it with the correct one.</p>
<p>But the third case was only right because the date had been double parsed! Once on the server and a second time on the client (browser).</p>
<p>So none of the three dates were actually correct. <strong>WTF?</strong></p>
<p>After some headaches, I learned that each version of Java comes with a time zone data file. This file includes the latest information on the world's time zones, and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.iana.org/time-zones">Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)</a> manages it. </p>
<p>Time zone changes happen when governments decide to apply or not to apply daylight saving times (DST). </p>
<p>In 2015, Chile decided to move from seasonal DST to permanent DST, and some JRE releases included this change. But then, in 2016 Chile decided to revert to how it was before; seasonal DST instead of permanent. <strong>What was the issue?</strong> The app was using one of these JRE releases with an outdated time zone data file.</p>
<p>You can read more about these <a target="_blank" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0622033">DST issues with Java here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="time-zone-of-your-server">Time zone of your server</h2>
<p>The operative system defines your server's time zone. I've always used Linux for production servers, and they come with UTC as the default time zone.</p>
<p>If you need to change this time zone, make sure to do it before your application starts or it won't reflect the change.</p>
<h3 id="the-bug-app-using-the-wrong-default-time-zone-from-the-server">The bug - App using the wrong default time zone from the server</h3>
<p>I was migrating some processes in our build and deployment pipeline. From configuring the app with every deploy to a pre-built AWS Amazon Machine Image (AMI) with HashiCorp's Packer.</p>
<p>One step of the initial configuration was to change the server's time zone to America/Mexico_City, and I was aware of it. So I created a bash script that changed the time zone on the AMI we were going to use. The script worked well when I tested it on a Linux instance. No problem there.</p>
<p>I proceeded to use this AMI in our staging environment and neither I nor my teammates noticed something off. So, to production!</p>
<p>Customer's questions and complaints about dates behaving weird arrived minutes later 😥</p>
<p><strong>The issue?</strong> The script that updated the server's time zone was failing silently and I missed double-checking it in the staging environment. The app wasn't using an explicit time zone, so it took the server's. And the server's time zone was UTC by default, and we needed America/Mexico_City. I fixed the script and, to make sure, updated the app's default time zone to the expected one.</p>

<h2 id="time-zone-of-your-database">Time zone of your database</h2>
<p>You can also change your database's time zone. I use AWS Relational Database Service (RDS) and the default time zone is UTC. You can update it from the parameter group of your cluster or individual instance.</p>
<h3 id="the-bug-wrong-database-time-zone">The bug - Wrong database time zone</h3>
<p>Now I was doing a migration of our database. I anticipated myself by changing the database's time zone to America/Mexico_City because the app and server had it. Every part of the system should be in the same page, right? <strong>Wrong!</strong></p>
<p>The database was perfectly okay being in UTC while the app and server were in America/Mexico_City. That's how it worked. </p>
<p>This bug was not as critical as the previous ones because I caught it in our staging environment. </p>

<h2 id="time-zone-of-your-users">Time zone of your users</h2>
<p>If it wasn't enough, each one of your users can have a different time zone, and you have to take that into consideration when showing time sensitive-data.</p>
<h3 id="the-bug-many-of-them">The bug - Many of them!</h3>
<p>I've encountered many bugs related to user's time zones:</p>
<ul>
<li>Missing time zone in date formatter.</li>
<li>Incorrect time zone selection from the user.</li>
<li>Missing DST time zone options for users to select.</li>
<li>Storing dates with time zone modifications that get parsed again when retrieved.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Time zones are one of the most complicated topics you'll find while developing software. They're complex by themselves, and even more when you throw some code into the mix.</p>
<p>I hope these short stories can help you avoid my mistakes in the future 🙌🏼</p>
<p><strong>Thanks for reading me! 💙</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><h4><a href="https://staffeng.com/guides">Guides</a> / <a href="https://staffeng.com/guides/deciding-to-switch">Deciding to switch companies</a></h4><div><p>My father was a professor of economics. After he completed his PhD in his late twenties, he started teaching at one university, got tenure at that university, and walked out forty-some years later into retirement. Working in technology, that sounds like a fairytale.</p>
<p>There are very few software companies with a forty-year track record, and even fewer folks whose <a href="https://lethain.com/forty-year-career/">forty-year career</a> consisted of one employer. There used to be a meme that many engineers spent either one or four years at each company to maximize their equity grants and then bounced on to the next. If that ever happened, it certainly isn’t common behavior for folks who aspire towards or reach Staff-plus roles.</p>
<p>Instead, generally those folks stay, and are rewarded for staying, at a given company as long as the circumstances support their success. If those circumstances change, they tend to either leave shortly thereafter or spend a while burning out and then leave after exhausting their emotional reservoir.</p>
<p>It takes years to build the visibility and social credibility to get promoted from a Senior Engineer role to a Staff-plus role, which makes it very difficult to walk away if you feel like you’re <em>just</em> one hump away from the promotion. Leaving, it can feel like, means starting over from scratch.</p>
<p>Then again, as described by <a href="https://staffeng.com/stories/duretti-hirpa">Duretti Hirpa</a> and <a href="https://staffeng.com/stories/keavy-mcminn">Keavy McMinn</a>, it’s common for folks to attain their first Staff-plus title by joining a new company. Even with all your internal credibility, sometimes leaving is the most effective path forward.</p>
<p>What’s the right decision for you?</p>
<hr>
<p>Before going further, I want to recognize two very different job-switching experiences: one of privileged flexibility and another of rigid constraints. Your residency might depend on a work-sponsored visa. You might be supporting an extended family. You might be constrained to a geographical area with few employers. This advice focuses on the former circumstances, which are more common circumstances for someone who’s deep enough into a technology career to pursue a Staff role. You should absolutely discount it to the extent this doesn’t reflect your circumstances.</p>
<h2>Why leaving works</h2>
<p>The company that knows your strengths the best is your current company, and they are the company most likely to give you a Staff-plus role. However, actually awarding the role depends on so many circumstantial concerns, that this isn’t how it works out in practice.</p>
<p>If your current team is very senior, it may be hard to justify your impact at the Staff engineer level because it’s being attributed to your peers. Your manager might have a limited budget that doesn’t have room for another Staff engineer. You might lack an internal sponsor. There simply might not be the need for an additional Staff engineer at your company. Any of these can mean that while you ought to be promoted, your current company won’t.</p>
<p>Conversely, when you interview for new roles, you can simply keep interviewing until you find a company that’s able to grant the title. The interview process often brings an automatic sponsor with it -- the hiring manager -- whose incentives will never be more aligned with yours than in the interview process.</p>
<p>The technical interviews are an inconsistent and unreliable predictor of success, which is bad for the industry and bad for companies, but works in your favor if you’re set on attaining a Staff-plus role and are willing to conduct a broad search. Interviewing creates the opportunity to play “bias arbitrage”, finding a company that values your particular brand of bullshit disproportionately. That might be a company that values folks with conference speaking visibility, your experience designing APIs, or <a href="https://staffeng.com/stories/dmitry-petrashko">your PhD thesis on compilers</a>.</p>
<p>Similarly, sometimes you’ll get into a rut at a company where your reputation is preventing forward progress. Perhaps you’ve tagged “difficult” after flagging inclusion issues. Maybe you embarrassed an influential Director at lunch and they’re blocking your promotion. A new company lets you leave that baggage behind.</p>
<hr>
<p>Yeah, of course, it’s always an open question whether you can <em>really</em> leave anything behind you in the tech industry. It can feel a bit cliquey at times. If you’ve worked in tech hubs, at larger companies, and for more than ten years, then you almost certainly have mutual connections with the folks interviewing you.</p>
<p>If you have a bad run at a company, maybe your manager was a bully or maybe you were going through a challenging period in your own life, it can feel like a cloud poisoning your future prospects. That said, much like the interview process in general, references and backchannel reference checks are deeply random. If you need any further evidence of that, look to the serial harassers who continue to get hired job after job at prominent companies.</p>
<h2>Things to try before leaving</h2>
<p>If you’re planning to leave due to lack of interest, excitement, support or opportunity, it’s worthwhile to at least explore the internal waters first. This lets you carry your internal network with you while still getting many of the advantages of switching companies. Depending on your company’s size and growth rate this might not be an option for you, but there are some folks who switch roles every two-to-three years within the same parent company, and find that an effective way to remain engaged and learning.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you’re considering leaving due to burnout or exhaustion, it’s sometimes possible to negotiate a paid or unpaid sabbatical where you can take a few months recharging yourself, often in conjunction with switching internal roles. This is more common at larger companies. (In case you were wondering, no your coworkers taking parental leave is not “on sabbatical” or “on vacation.”)</p>
<h2>Leaving without a job</h2>
<p>Speaking of burnout, if you’re <em>particularly</em> burned out, it’s worth considering leaving your job without another job lined up. There’s a fairly simple checklist to determine if this is a good option for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does your visa support this?</li>
<li>Are you financially secure for at least a year without working?</li>
<li>Do you work in a high-density job market, remotely, or are you flexible on where your next job is?</li>
<li>Do you interview well?</li>
<li>Could you articulate a coherent narrative to someone asking you why you left without a job lined up?</li>
<li>Are there folks at your previous company who can provide positive references?</li>
</ul>
<p>If all of those are true, then I don’t know anyone who <em>regrets</em> taking a sabbatical. However, bear in mind that it’s only the folks who took six-month-plus sabbaticals who felt reborn by the experience. Folks taking shorter stints have appreciated them but often come back only partially restored.</p>
<h2>Taking the plunge</h2>
<p>If you’re almost at the Staff promotion in your current company, there is absolutely another company out there who will give you the Staff title. Whether or not you’ll enjoy working there or be supported after getting there, that’s a lot harder to predetermine. If your internal reputation is damaged or if you’ve been repeatedly on the cusp of promotion but victim to a moving criteria line, then you should seriously consider switching roles if the title is important to you -- at some point you have to hear what your current company is telling you.</p>
<p>Conversely, if you’re happy in your current role outside of the title, consider if you can be more intentional about pursuing your promotion rather than leaving. Many folks hit a rut in their promotion path to Staff-plus, and using techniques like the <a href="https://staffeng.com/guides/promo-packets">promotion packet</a> can help you get unstuck. If you’ve used all the approaches, taken your self-development seriously, and still can’t get there -- it’s probably time to change.</p>
<p>That said, it’s easy to overthink these things. Few folks tell their decade-past story of staying at or leaving some job.</p></div><p><em><a href="https://staffeng.com/guides">Read another guide?</a></em> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <em><a href="https://staffeng.com/stories">Back to the stories?</a></em></p></section></div></div>]]>

September 24, 2020 | https://amitness.com/interactive-sentence-embeddings/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://amitness.com/interactive-sentence-embeddings/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
<p><a href="https://projector.tensorflow.org/">Embedding Projector</a> is a free web application for visualizing high-dimensional data. It has built-in demos for visualizing word embeddings in NLP and image embeddings for MNIST in Computer Vision.</p>
<p>I recently experimented with a way to load sentence embeddings along with the class labels into this tool and explore them interactively. In this blog post, I will explain the end-to-end process with an example dataset.</p>
<h2 id="toy-example-outlier-detection">Toy Example: Outlier Detection</h2>
<h3 id="1-preparing-dataset">1. Preparing Dataset</h3>
<p>To understand this use case, let’s take a subset of 100 movie reviews from the SST-2 dataset which are labeled as positive and negative.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>pandas</span> <span>as</span> <span>pd</span>

<span>df</span> <span>=</span> <span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>read_csv</span><span>(</span><span>'http://bit.ly/dataset-sst2'</span><span>,</span> 
                 <span>nrows</span><span>=</span><span>100</span><span>,</span> <span>sep</span><span>=</span><span>'</span><span>\t</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>names</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>'text'</span><span>,</span> <span>'label'</span><span>])</span>

<span>df</span><span>[</span><span>'label'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>df</span><span>[</span><span>'label'</span><span>].</span><span>replace</span><span>({</span><span>0</span><span>:</span> <span>'negative'</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>:</span> <span>'positive'</span><span>})</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The dataset has a column containing the text and a label indicating whether it’s positive or negative opinion.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/projector-head-5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We will introduce label noise into our dataset by corrupting five of the responses with random text. It will act as an outlier for our example.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>df</span><span>.</span><span>loc</span><span>[[</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>27</span><span>,</span> <span>54</span><span>,</span> <span>72</span><span>,</span> <span>91</span><span>],</span> <span>'text'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>'askgkn askngk kagkasng'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="2-generating-embeddings">2. Generating Embeddings</h3>
<p>Now, we will compute sentence embeddings for the headlines using the <code>sentence-transformers</code> package. First, let’s install it using pip.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>!</span>pip <span>install </span>sentence-transformers
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Next, we will create a helper function to return a NumPy array of sentence embeddings given a list of sentences.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>sentence_transformers</span> <span>import</span> <span>SentenceTransformer</span>

<span>sentence_bert_model</span> <span>=</span> <span>SentenceTransformer</span><span>(</span><span>'distilbert-base-nli-stsb-mean-tokens'</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>get_embeddings</span><span>(</span><span>sentences</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>sentence_bert_model</span><span>.</span><span>encode</span><span>(</span><span>sentences</span><span>,</span>
                                    <span>batch_size</span><span>=</span><span>32</span><span>,</span> 
                                    <span>show_progress_bar</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Using the above function, we can generate sentence embeddings for our data as shown below.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>e</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_embeddings</span><span>(</span><span>df</span><span>[</span><span>'text'</span><span>])</span>
<span># shape: (100, 768)
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="3-exporting-to-embedding-projector-format">3. Exporting to Embedding Projector Format</h3>
<p>Embedding Projector requires two TSV files to load our custom embeddings.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>output.tsv</code>: This file should contain the embeddings without any headers.</li>
<li><code>metadata.tsv</code>: This file should contain the original text and labels for the embeddings</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s first generate the <code>output.tsv</code> file for our sentence embeddings from the previous step.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># Convert NumPy array of embedding into data frame
</span><span>embedding_df</span> <span>=</span> <span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>DataFrame</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>)</span>

<span># Save dataframe as as TSV file without any index and header
</span><span>embedding_df</span><span>.</span><span>to_csv</span><span>(</span><span>'output.tsv'</span><span>,</span> <span>sep</span><span>=</span><span>'</span><span>\t</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>index</span><span>=</span><span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>header</span><span>=</span><span>None</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>To generate <code>metadata.csv</code>, we simply save our original dataframe.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># Save dataframe without any index
</span><span>df</span><span>.</span><span>to_csv</span><span>(</span><span>'metadata.tsv'</span><span>,</span> <span>index</span><span>=</span><span>False</span><span>,</span> <span>sep</span><span>=</span><span>'</span><span>\t</span><span>'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="4-importing-into-embedding-projector">4. Importing into Embedding Projector</h3>
<p>We first go to <a href="https://projector.tensorflow.org/">https://projector.tensorflow.org/</a>.</p>
<p>On the left-hand sidebar, click the <strong>Load</strong> button.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/projector-load-step-1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Then, for the first <strong>Choose file</strong> button, upload the <code>output.tsv</code> file and for the second <strong>Choose file</strong> button, upload the <code>metadata.tsv</code> file.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/projector-load-step-2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After uploading both files, click outside and you should see the sentence embedding projection. The dimensions of embeddings are reduced to 3D by default using PCA.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/projector-3d.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Let’s switch to 2D by turning off the checkbox for ‘Component #3’ in the bottom part of sidebar.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/projector-turn-off-3d.png" alt=""></p>
<p>On the 2D visualization, we can see how the random text is far from other groups of text as an <strong>outlier</strong>. On hovering the point, we see the text <code>askgkn askngk kagkasng</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/projector-outlier.gif" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="5-useful-features-in-projector">5. Useful Features in Projector</h3>
<h4 id="a-class-separation">a. Class Separation</h4>
<p>We can enable color coding of the points by their actual labels (positive vs negative) by using the <strong>Color by</strong> dropdown in the left sidebar.</p>
<p>Select the name of the column that contains your labels. In our example file, the column name is <strong>label</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/projector-color-code-labels.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The points themselves are interactive. You can see the actual sentence for each point by hovering over them.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/projector-interactive-1.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>You can click on the point to show the metadata. We can see below on clicking a blue point that its label is “positive” in the popup.</p>
<p>So the blue points are positive and the red points are negative. When a point is selected, 100 nearest points in terms of cosine similarity are also highlighted.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/projector-click-point.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>To get back to the original view, we can click on any empty white space.</p>
<div>
<h4>Applications</h4>
<p>The color coding can be a useful heuristic for many use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can be used to explore class overlap for the dataset you're working on and identify tricky sentences.</li>
<li>If there are labeling errors in your dataset, then this might help uncover them. For example, if a whole cluster of points is in a certain color, but some single point in that cluster is in a different color, then that might be an outlier or labeling error.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4 id="b-dimensionality-reduction-algorithm">b. Dimensionality Reduction Algorithm</h4>
<p>The web app provides three standard dimensionality reduction techniques: <strong>UMAP</strong>, <strong>T-SNE</strong>, and <strong>PCA</strong>.</p>
<p>You can choose the algorithm and their parameters from the bottom of the left sidebar.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/projector-choose-dim-algorithm.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="c-custom-linear-projection">c. Custom Linear Projection</h4>
<p>You can also use a custom keyword or full text as the axis using the <strong>CUSTOM</strong> tab. This will apply a custom linear projection and can help us explore meaningful directions in the embedding space.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/projector-custom-dim.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For example, the Gmail team tried setting “yeah” on the left side and “yes” on the right side. When they projected encoder embeddings for email replies to this custom linear projection, they found replies in a casual tone (e.g. Here you go) on the left side and responses in a more formal tone clustered towards the right side.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/projector-custom-direction.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Thus, Embedding Projector is a very useful tool to better understand the datasets and models we work with.</p>

<p>One November morning last year, Mehdi Yahyanejad listened to a voicemail in his Los Angeles office: “I’m contacting you from the city of Tehran,” said the voice. “This was the first time I’ve experienced an internet shutdown. … It feels like I’m in a prison.”</p>



<p>A few weeks earlier, Iran’s largest mobile networks and internet providers went offline. Amid weeks of growing anti-regime protests, Iranian authorities imposed <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/18/middleeast/iran-protests-explained-intl/index.html">the longest internet shutdown</a> in the country’s history, effectively cutting off external communication for over 80 million Iranians. In an unprecedented crackdown, regime forces <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/05/iran-details-released-of-304-deaths-during-protests-six-months-after-security-forces-killing-spree/">killed more than 300 protesters</a> and arrested <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/12/iran-thousands-arbitrarily-detained-and-at-risk-of-torture-in-chilling-post-protest-crackdown/">over 7,000 people</a>. When access was finally restored on November 23, nearly half the country was still unable to come online.</p>



<p>Nine months after the November blackout, Iranians still live in fear of another all-out shutdown. As authorities tighten their hold on internet access, diaspora-led companies are filling the gap for Iranians who are seeking a way to bypass censors. The circumvention tools, created largely by diaspora entrepreneurs, are becoming increasingly critical as they face a crackdown at home and the bite of American-led sanctions online.</p>



<p>On November 15, as Iranian authorities first moved to induce the digital blackout, 44-year-old Yahyanejad raced against the clock in Los Angeles to make sure that people back home had downloaded his satellite file-casting application <a href="https://www.toosheh.org/">Toosheh</a>.<em> </em>“It was a very small window,” says Yahyanejad. “Once they were fully disconnected, I wasn’t sure they’d be able to download the software.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Launched by Yahyanejad in 2016, the technology aggregates uncensored content, like news articles, YouTube videos, and podcasts, and sends it to Iranian homes directly via satellite TV. When Yahyanejad first began developing Toosheh in 2013, an estimated 70% of Iranian households owned a satellite dish, while around 20% had access to the internet. Even as internet access has grown, state censorship means Toosheh’s satellite technology is a much more reliable source for uncensored content. Iranians can install Toosheh’s satellite channel and receive a daily dispatch in the form of a file package of up to 8 gigabytes. Once a user downloads the app, the satellite transfers circumvent the internet entirely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yahyanejad says Toosheh gained nearly 100,000 new Iranian users in November 2019. In the absence of an internet connection, it became the only way for many users to access news from the outside world. The voice on Toosheh’s voicemail belonged to one such user, a 34-year-old high school principal in Tehran who downloaded emergency VPN and proxy tools delivered to him through the satellite service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having navigated extensive cyber censorship for over a decade, Iranians are tech savvy and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-42612546">adept at nimbly crossing firewalls</a>, using proxies and foreign circumvention tools. “It’s a constant cat-and-mouse game,” says Fereidoon Bashar, executive director of ASL19, a Canadian organization working to help Iranians bypass internet censorship. The group often works in tandem with Yahyanejad to distribute proxy tools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bashar says Iranians adapt quickly to ever-changing institutionalized control online. But the last five years of Iranian president Hassan Rouhani’s rule have seen <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/irans-president-plans-to-cut-countrys-internet-off-from-the-rest-of-the-world/">a tighter grip on internet connections</a>. Site blocking and calculated internet outages have become easier to enforce: the regime has reduced Iran’s dependence on global networks by pushing a local intranet, with the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/09/how-iran-is-building-its-censorship-friendly-domestic-internet/">aim to keep online traffic</a> inside the country. With strict American sanctions that threaten hefty fines for companies interfacing with Iran, foreign tech companies limit ordinary Iranians’ ability to purchase reliable proxies <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/09/how-iran-is-building-its-censorship-friendly-domestic-internet/">out of an abundance of caution</a>. Riddled with insecurity, the local VPN black market is not a reliable option for those trying to avoid government attention.</p>



<p>But even as internet access grew incrementally difficult over the years, no one saw the November blackout coming. “An internet shutdown was previously viewed as a kind of dystopian political campaign,” says Kaveh Azarhoosh, an internet policy researcher. In November, the worst-case scenario for Iran’s censorship suddenly became a reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the early days of the protest, Toosheh created a special “Protest News Package.” Every night, after aggregating content from over 200 publications, Toosheh delivered digital bundles containing clips of protests occuring in different cities: Tabriz, Qom, Shiraz, Mashhad, and others. It also contained slides about how to stay safe during a protest; crucial news coverage from banned sites, like the <em>New York Times</em>, Voice of America Persian, and Deutsche Welle; and a curated compilation of tweets from Iranian politicians. These packages weren’t just bringing news of the outside world to Iran: they kept Iranians informed about what was happening inside their own country too.</p>



<p>Yahyanejad, a physicist by training, left Iran in 1997 to pursue a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “I’ve lived in Iran, and I’ve gone to school and college there,” he explains. “I know that this repressive government exists because they are able to control the flow of information.” He says he’s always had an interest in limiting their control. “I want,” he says, “to see democracy in Iran in my lifetime.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2006, Yahyanejad launched a Reddit-like forum called <a href="https://www.balatarin.com/">Balatarin</a>. “Its popularity surprised me,” he says. The site posted a translated rumor about the supreme leader’s death, after he hadn’t been seen in public for two months, and was swiftly blocked by Iran shortly after. The moment was a turning point for Yahyanejad, who says, “I made a conscious decision to keep the platform open at a personal cost.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Iranian blocks on Balatarin inspired Yahyanejad to explore censorship circumvention. He launched the satellite app Toosheh in 2016. “I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWfwF8Gx6VA">went on BBC Persian’s ‘Newshour</a>,’ and as soon as I talked about it, people started downloading and testing it immediately,” he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yahyanjad finds himself among a cohort of diaspora Iranians working to fight the regime’s censors. ASL19, the Canadian technology group, collaborated with him to deliver proxy tools to over half a million Iranians during November’s shutdown. ASL19’s Bashar, who left Iran in the early 2000s before <a href="https://opennet.net/blog/2013/02/after-green-movement-internet-controls-iran-2009-2012">the tumultuous Green Movement</a>, says diaspora Iranians are stepping into the field because Iranians “risk harsh conditions, imprisonment, and long sentences” if they’re caught creating circumvention tools inside the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But even outside of Iran, outspoken diaspora activists like Bashar and Yahyanejad face immense risks. In June, it was reported that an Iranian activist named Ruhollah Zam was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-53238000">sentenced to death </a>in Iran after creating a popular anti-government Telegram news channel that he operated while living in exile in France. The channel, with 1.4 million followers, was shut down shortly after. For Yahyanejad, who knew of Ruhollah through the diaspora community, the ordeal was a shot across the bow. “I can never go back to Iran,” Yahyanejad admits. “But I see myself as part of the movement.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yahyanejad’s work has become crucial for Iranians, even after November’s shutdown. On July 14, following news that Iran’s Supreme Court had upheld the death sentences of three young anti-regime protesters, Iranians took to banned social media sites in an unprecedented protest, with over 6 million posts under the hashtag #DontExecute. Hours after #DontExecute began trending online, digital rights organization NetBlocks <a href="https://twitter.com/netblocks/status/1283106806332620801?s=20">monitored disruptions in the network</a>. Panicked users, still reeling from November’s shutdown, speculated another block was imminent. Luckily, an all-out ban didn’t occur, but the renewed threat of one was enough to increase Toosheh’s usage by more than 50% in the days that followed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Yahyanejad, who has been actively fighting the Iranian regime’s censorship for over a decade, the past year is proof that his work is even more necessary. “Internet shutdowns are psychological tools designed to terrify populations, to convince them that they are voiceless,” he says. “Fighting shutdowns is important so that you can show people that they are not alone and that there are others.”</p>

  <p><em>Disclaimer: This post as well as the code accompanying it contains some direct and indirect references to potentially 
offensive language. This is an analysis of stand-up comedy, which tends to contain curse words, racial slurs, etc.

<p>This post documents my first foray into unsupervised learning, natural language processing, and 
recommender systems. I completed this project over a 2-week span during my time as a student at
<a href="https://thisismetis.com/" target="_blank">Metis</a>.</p>

<p>The code for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/stephenjkaplan/standup-comedy-recommender" target="_blank">here</a>.
The Flask app I made for this project can be found <a href="https://standup-comedy-recommender.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>

<p><img src="https://stephenjkaplan.github.io/images/2020-09-18/comedy.jpg" alt="Comedy">
<small>Comedy! (Image: <a href="https://scrapsfromtheloft.com/stand-up-comedy-scripts/">Scraps from the Loft</a>)</small></p>

<p>A little over halfway through the Metis data science bootcamp, the curriculum shifted from 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning" target="_blank">supervised</a> to 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning" target="_blank">unsupervised</a> learning. At that point, my brain was<br>
firmly in “predict y given X” mode, and it quite honestly took a few days to wrap my head around what it means 
to use machine learning on unlabeled data, and why that would even be useful. It clicked when I applied a 
rudimentary model of the human brain to both of these approaches: often our brains make inferences based 
on our previous experiences and knowledge (supervised learning). However, sometimes we are forced to find previously 
unseen patterns in the world around us (unsupervised learning) before we can make decisions.</p>

<p>Concurrently, we were introduced to 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing" target="_blank">Natural Language Processing</a> (NLP). In addition 
to learning a lot specifically about NLP, one big takeaway was a clearer understanding of what is meant by
“Artificial Intelligence” in the context of machine learning - any instance 
of a computer being able to imitate (or even replicate) a human perception or ability. After this realization, 
I went from being somewhat weary of apply machine learning to text/speech, to extremely motivated to 
work on an NLP problem.</p>

<p>As you might expect, the main requirements of this project were:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use unsupervised learning.</li>
  <li>Use text as the primary data source.</li>
</ol>

<p>I almost instantly came up with an idea. Stand-up comedy specials are usually in a 1-hour monologue 
format, and are rich and diverse in topics, opinions, colloquialisms, and regional english dialects.
For that reason, and also the fact that I’m a huge fan of the comedy world, I knew that this would be
a stimulating project.</p>

<h3 id="data-wrangling">Data Wrangling</h3>

<p>Luckily, I was able to quickly find a website 
(<a href="https://scrapsfromtheloft.com/stand-up-comedy-scripts/" target="_blank">Scraps from the Loft</a>) with several hundred 
comedy transcripts. I used the Python <a href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/" target="_blank">requests</a>) library 
in a <a href="https://github.com/stephenjkaplan/standup-comedy-recommender/blob/master/analysis/data_acquisition.py" target="_blank">script</a> to acquire all of the raw HTML for each transcript, and 
<a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/" target="_blank">Beautiful Soup</a> to parse the main text and 
various metadata (comedian, title of comedy special, year).</p>

<p>After inserting the data into pandas dataframes (one for the metadata and one for the text corpus), I stored 
it in a remote <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" target="_blank">Mongo</a> database on an Amazon AWS EC2 instance. Admittedly, 
this wasn’t really necessary as my corpus was small enough to store locally , but I wanted to get more comfortable with 
both creating MongoDB collections and querying data for analysis and modeling using 
<a href="https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank">pymongo</a>.</p>

<h3 id="data-cleaning--the-nlp-pipeline">Data Cleaning &amp; The NLP Pipeline</h3>

<p>As we had been warned, cleaning and preparing the text corpus proved to be the most critical, time 
consuming part of this project. Topic modeling (and clustering) of text data relies on sufficient elimination 
of extraneous words, but also careful inclusion of words that might be indicators of a topic.</p>

<p>First, I performed some “macro” cleaning, removing entire documents (individual transcripts) that would 
throw off the modeling and/or not be relevant in a recommender app. That involved removing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Comedy specials in different languages (there were a handful in Italian and Spanish).</li>
  <li>Comedy specials that are not widely available (or available at all) on streaming platforms.</li>
  <li>Short-form comedy such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--IS0XiNdpk" target="_blank">monologues on Saturday Night Live</a>, 
or other late night TV shows.</li>
</ul>

<p>I then created an “<a href="https://github.com/stephenjkaplan/standup-comedy-recommender/blob/master/app/nlp_pipeline.py" target="_blank">NLP pipeline</a>”, 
that can take any document from the corpus and perform the following transformations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clean the text by removing punctuation, non-essential parts like the person introducing the comedian, 
removing numbers, removing line breaks, crazy noises and expressions like “aaaaah”, and common English 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_word" target="_blank">stop words</a>.</li>
  <li>“Lemmatized” words to reduce all forms of words to their base or “lemma”. (For example, “studies” and 
 “studying” become “study”). The purpose of this is to extract the core meaning and topics out of the text 
 rather than pay attention to how words are being used in the context of a sentence. The Python <a href="https://www.nltk.org/" target="_blank">NLTK</a> library 
 was very useful for this step and several of the previous steps.</li>
  <li>“Vectorized” the entire corpus. In general, this means converting the long strings of text to tabular format, 
 where each column is a word, each row represents a document in the corpus (also known as a 
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-term_matrix" target="_blank">doc-term matrix</a>), and each cell 
 contains a numerical representation of the words frequency of use or some other metric.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://stephenjkaplan.github.io/images/2020-09-18/cleaning.png" alt="cleaning">
<small>Summary of text cleaning steps.</small></p>

<p>The final data format is “fit” on the initial dataset, and then applied to any incoming data (as is the case with 
the <a href="#search-engine-recommender-with-content-based-filtering">search engine feature</a> described later in this post.)</p>

<p>To elaborate a bit on vectorization: I focused on trying out two <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.feature_extraction.text" target="_blank">types/implementations of vectorization in 
scikit-learn</a>:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer" target="_blank">Count Vectorizer</a>,
which simply counts the frequency of each word in each document/transcript.</li>
  <li><a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer" target="_blank">TF-IDF Vectorizer</a>,
which calculates the product of term frequency with its inverse-document frequency (a scale of 0 to 1 where values 
closer to zero are common in the entire dataset of transcripts). This is a valuable metric because it weights 
words that are common in a document more heavily if they aren’t common in general, which is a useful tool for 
ultimately extracting distinct topics.</li>
</ol>

<p>In general, creating this pipeline was an iterative process. I tried out different transformations and did 
topic modeling (explained in the next section) to evaluate the effectiveness of different components in the pipeline. 
This helped inform my decision to vectorize the text with <strong>TF-IDF</strong>, as it yielded topics that were much 
more discernible and easy to label by looking at each topic’s top words.</p>

<p>One other note important note is that using pre-built lists of common English stop words to remove from the 
dataset isn’t a complete solution. I had to do quite a bit of combing through the transcripts to identify 
insignificant, yet common words and manually add them to the stop words list. It may come as no surprise that 
curse words are extremely prevalent in comedy, and don’t usually add much meaning, so I had to include some 
pretty aggressive words in my code (several of which are fairly offensive and I wouldn’t use in conversation).</p>

<p>Aside from also removing names/other irrelevant proper nouns, I also had to carefully decide what to do about racial slurs.
Like it or not, racial slurs are common in stand-up comedy and can sometimes carry important meaning with regards to a 
comedian’s jokes. As a result, I left many of them in the dataset, but was also tasked with the uncomfortable task of 
hard-coding some extremely antiquated language in the NLP pipeline class for removal.</p>

<h3 id="modeling--flask-app-features">Modeling &amp; Flask App Features</h3>

<p>My main objective for this project was to develop a Flask application that provided more nuanced 
recommendations of comedy specials than what’s currently available on mainstream streaming platforms. I scoped 
out two features:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A dropdown genre filter using genres that were created by machine learning algorithms (as opposed to 
human labeling.)</li>
  <li>A search bar that allows a user to describe the comedy they want to see, and get content-based 
recommendations.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can play around with the app <a href="https://standup-comedy-recommender.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="automatic-genre-filters-with-topic-modeling">Automatic Genre Filters with Topic Modeling</h4>

<p>Creating machine-learned genres involves first applying the unsupervised learning technique of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model" target="_blank">topic modeling</a>, transforming the resulting 
data to extract which words are most closely related with each topic, and then performing the manual task 
of giving each topic a reasonable label.</p>

<p>In relatively simple terms, topic modeling involves reducing the dimensions of the document-term matrix (words) to a specified number 
of columns (representing the topics, and a weighting for each topic to each document). I tried a few different dimensionality reduction techniques including 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis" target="_blank">Latent Semantic Analysis</a> (LSA), 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation" target="_blank">Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a> (LDA), and 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-negative_matrix_factorization" target="_blank">Non-Negative Matrix Factorization</a> (NMF). 
Ultimately, the 
<a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.NMF.html" target="_blank">scikit-learn implementation of NMF</a>
yielded the most discernible topics.</p>

<p><img src="https://stephenjkaplan.github.io/images/2020-09-18/topics.png" alt="topics">
<small>Examples of top words associated with modeled topics.</small></p>

<p>Based on the top words generated from each topic, I used my knowledge of comedy to select the following genres:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Observational</strong>: This is sort of a catch-all for “average”, “every day” topics such as family, chores, marriage, pets, etc. This type of 
 comedy is quite common.</li>
  <li><strong>Immigrant Upbringing</strong>: Many comedians are 1st generation Americans with parents that immigrated to the US and brought their 
culture with them. Comedians with recently immigrated families often talk about the humorous struggles of assimilation, the quirks 
of their various cultures, the pressures of their parents, and hardworking nature of their families.</li>
  <li><strong>Relationships &amp; Sex</strong>: This is another very common topic in comedy, particularly for “dirty” comedians. The sub-topics range 
from dating, to LGBTQ humor, and heavily sexual jokes.</li>
  <li><strong>British/Australian</strong>: This topic was selected almost entirely based on colloquialisms of the comedian. While the United Kingdom 
and Australia have different cultures, they share some slang in common. If I were to continue to spend time on this project, I would 
probably try and separate these two topics, as British comedy historically is associate with a specific type of “dry” humor. That being said,
many non-American english-speaking comedians share a common …</li></ul></article></div></div>

<p>All data and engineering teams are faced with a constant inflow of organizational, technical, and interpersonal problems and the ability of your team to have business impact will depend largely on how effectively it can move towards optimal solutions to those problems.&nbsp; In this article, I discuss<em> four communication techniques</em> that improve the ability of a team to solve problems.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://documents.app.lucidchart.com/documents/4a162d92-9c91-4478-91b4-b893591b316f/pages/0_0?a=624&amp;x=109&amp;y=38&amp;w=844&amp;h=253&amp;store=1&amp;accept=image%2F*&amp;auth=LCA%2015c6c000cf3d2ca79ca0f2238c9ccfd56666e1b7-ts%3D1600622689" alt="" width="553" height="164"></figure>



<p><strong><em>Work from the problem to the solution:&nbsp; move in the right direction.</em></strong></p>



<p>When presented with a problem, first spend time elucidating the problem space before addressing potential solutions.&nbsp; Interestingly, I think the intuitive and most common approach is to do the opposite: present and advocate for your solution. &nbsp; I think the reason for this is that people tend to assume that others understand the problem as clearly as you do, that you have a full understanding of the problem, and that you understand which aspects of the problem are the most critical to solve for the business.&nbsp; Thus, the only thing that is interesting is the solution you came up with – a solution that is either clever or based on your notable experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The problem though is that these assumptions are usually wrong.&nbsp; Typically if you spend time first fleshing out the problem, you will realize that other people on the team have context on the problem that you don’t have.&nbsp; Or that they do not share an understanding of what the problem is or that there is disagreement about what aspects of the problem are the most critical to solve first.&nbsp; Often you will realize that people are focused on solving the technical problem but that they do not have a good understanding of the <em>business </em>problem.&nbsp; It is critical that the business problem is clearly fleshed out before addressing the technical problem.</p>



<p><em>Recommendation.&nbsp; </em>Spend time talking about the problem before anyone presents solutions.&nbsp; It will make sure everyone has the same context.&nbsp; It ensures that the business problem is the focus and that people will agree – <em>before presenting their solution ideas</em> – which aspects of the problem are the most critical to solve. This process helps remove ego from the conversation, which can develop when a group of smart highly experienced present different solutions that incidentally emphasize different aspects of the problem.&nbsp; Time spent on the problem space consistently will help you identify better solutions, more efficiently, and with less drama.</p>

<p><strong><em>Split-tracking – prevent circular and chaotic conversations.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>I have seen a number of conversations about thorny problems go in circles and not only fail to identify good solutions but even make little progress towards a shared understanding of the problem space.&nbsp; How do you prevent this from happening?&nbsp; The primary thing to do is to keep your conversation organized.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>One way to do so is to use a technique called <em>split-tracking</em>.&nbsp; Split-tracking is a technique, in which you identify that more than one issue or concern has been raised, bring group awareness to this observation, generate consensus that there is more than one issue at play, and then push others to focus on one issue at a time. &nbsp; Why does this help? &nbsp; People often don’t realize that they are conflating two issues so they don’t realize when they are jumping back and forth between these issues.&nbsp; If these issues are not explicitly identified and separated, it can be hard to probe and press a person’s thinking on an issue – they can unconsciously side-step into the second issue. If there are multiple people discussing a problem, it is possible for people to start going in circles if different people re-direct the group to a secondary issue and then another person brings it back to the first issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Recommendation.&nbsp; </em>Be on the lookout for multiple underlying issues and concerns.&nbsp; If you see them, stop the conversation and say,  “I am hearing two issues here.&nbsp; One is issue $X and other is issues $Y.&nbsp; Which one should we focus on first?” &nbsp; Make sure other people realize that there are separate issues – even if they are correlated – and get them to agree to work on them separately.&nbsp; In general, think like a scientist – care about the taxonomy of your problem and neatly classify all the sub-problems that exist and their relation to each other (i.e., this is a subproblem of this bigger problem).&nbsp; You can work towards a solution much more effectively, if the problem space is well organized and explicitly understood by everyone in the conversation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Empathy – prevent friction and “land mines” from stopping forward progress.</em></strong></p>



<p>Have you ever been in a meeting discussing a problem, making some progress, and then just suddenly had all forward progress come screeching to a halt? &nbsp; Usually this happens when people become defensive or if the conversation triggered an emotional response in someone.&nbsp; How do we prevent this from happening?&nbsp; Although each individual needs to work to keep the bigger picture in mind and to keep their ego out of the conversation, you cannot control other people’s reactions.&nbsp; So what can you do?&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Recommendation.&nbsp; </em>Work on being more empathetic in your communication.&nbsp; Carefully consider how others view the problem and how some aspects of the problem may impact them and their work more than you.&nbsp; Consider that even if they have less relevant experience than you, that they still want their viewpoints to be considered and valued.&nbsp; In general, approach people and their thoughts with curiosity.&nbsp; Try to clarify your understanding of their perspective and make it clear that you are spending time trying to understand their views.</p>



<p>If you do this, you will be less likely to trigger an emotional response that will put a lot of friction between you and your solution.&nbsp; You will make people feel heard even if the solution that is ultimately arrived at doesn’t solve their main pain points. When you approach problems empathetically, it is also easier to build consensus and excitement in the group, which is critical. Identifying the solution is not the final step – implementing the solution is, and you want a motivated team to tackle that step.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Emphasizing empathy when working with others has a few other advantages.&nbsp; One, because empathy is driven by curiosity about someone’s perspective, it makes it easier to identify genuine issues that you hadn’t been considering previously, thereby enriching your understanding of the problem.&nbsp; Two, it will help you identify nuances in the concerns of others, providing opportunities for split-tracking and organization of the conversation.&nbsp; Three, empathetic communication enhances psychological safety of the group, which in turn means that all people will feel comfortable voicing their concerns and insights. A group that can communicate openly will be better at fleshing out the full problem space and thereby will be better at identifying the optimal solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, I would like to note although people inherently vary in how empathetic they are, it is also a skill that can be cultivated. &nbsp; So make it a mindset that you work actively to engage in.&nbsp; Cultivate your curiosity. If you struggle with it, try meditation. Its core teaching is the power of developing an open loving curiosity about the world.&nbsp; I’ve spent a week in silent meditation, and I can tell you that if you can find the in and out flow of your breath to be fascinating, then it becomes easy to be intrigued by the perspective of your peers.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Monitoring – keep the conversation on track</strong></p>



<p>The part of the brain involved in understanding and solving a problem, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, is distinct from the part of the brain, the medial prefrontal cortex, that is involved in monitoring your environment and behavior for errors that signal a course correction is needed.&nbsp; I have noticed that leaders, who are great at moving a team towards optimal solutions, are able to keep this monitoring brain area highly activated even as they also help the team move towards a solution.&nbsp; They tend to be constantly scanning the conversation at a meta-level looking for issues that will derail it.&nbsp; So what type of issues are they monitoring for?&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Establish what you are monitoring for and set the conditions.&nbsp; </em>To know what to monitor for, you first need to clearly identify, at the start of a meeting, what your agenda is and what the basic problem(s) is that you will address.&nbsp; Once there is consensus here, it will be clearer to you if the conversation has moved off track and what you should be monitoring for.&nbsp; Moreover, it also ensures that you have needed conditions for keeping the conversation on track.&nbsp; For example, given your agenda, you should evaluate whether you even have the right decision makers in the room.&nbsp; Do you have unnecessary people who can push the conversation into tangents or are you lacking the needed people so that even if you make a decision, you may not be able to act upon that decision?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Conversation below the right level?&nbsp; </em>Is someone “going into the weeds” by diving into a technical explanation that isn’t needed right now? &nbsp; Monitor for this and pull the group out quickly. &nbsp; At best, it is just a waste of time.&nbsp; At worst, it will derail the conversation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Conversation above the right level?&nbsp; </em>Similarly, thoughts can steer the conversation to a level above the agenda.&nbsp; For example, if your company recently switched to a pods organization and there is some question about how to best handle ownership of one line of work in this new pod structure, it can be easy for the conversation to suddenly be about the pods themselves – whether they are good and how to change and improve the pods.&nbsp; This level of conversation would be above the one set in your agenda, is not one that you want to or are capable of addressing in your current meeting, and if you even were interested in addressing it, you probably don’t have the right people in the room to do so.&nbsp; Pull …</p></div></article></div>
