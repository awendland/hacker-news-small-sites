<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>I create an educational product and students occasionally ask for discounts. So-called "educational" discounts are very popular, but I don't give them.</p> <p>To be honest, I don't like them at all, but there is some nuance.</p> <p>Not all educational discounts bother me—primarily it's the discounts limited to students at degree-granting institutions and especially those tied to having a .edu email address.</p> <h2 id="why-might-edu-discounts-be-good"><a href="#why-might-edu-discounts-be-good">#</a> Why might .edu discounts be good?</h2> <p>Many of the arguments for student discounts are similar to those for region-based discounts, which I am a fan of. So let's look at some reasons to give discounts in general.</p> <h3 id="need"><a href="#need">#</a> Need</h3> <p>The idea behind student discounts, at least as it was first explained to me, sounds great. Students are often broke so it's only fair to give them a price break!</p> <p>I totally get that. As a student myself, I worked as a waiter, a calculus tutor, a bar tender and even started a house painting franchise in order not to get buried in debt. I went to a cheap state school, back when it was only about 70% of what it costs now, and I was <em>still</em> broke.</p> <p>I have a great deal of sympathy for anyone trying to pay their way through school in the US now. I have even more sympathy for anyone taking out debts they likely won't repay for many, many years.</p> <h3 id="price-discrimination"><a href="#price-discrimination">#</a> Price discrimination</h3> <p>In economics, <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/microessays/pd/price-discrimination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">price discrimination</a> refers to the idea of charging some customers more than others in order to maximize revenue.</p> <p>In the extreme form, it would mean charging each customer the absolute maximum price they're willing to pay and completely eliminating <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/188/concepts/definition-of-consumer-surplus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">consumer surplus</a>. This isn't practical or possible in most cases, but less extreme forms are very common.</p> <p>Sometimes customers are segmented by their actions, such as spending time clipping coupons or watching movies during typical work hours. Other times, customers are segmented simply by who they are. Senior discounts or higher prices for foreign tourists are both common examples.</p> <p>A less direct form of price discrimination is to create a slightly different product that would only appeal to customers with more money. In software, we see this often with features revolving around team management, accounting and compliance. This makes it possible to both sell to frugal hobbyist users and to charge large companies very high prices.</p> <h3 id="creating-habits"><a href="#creating-habits">#</a> Creating habits</h3> <p>For most, going to college is a time of major life transitions. Other than marriage, having children or serving in the military there are few times when people change as much.</p> <p>This is <strong>incredibly</strong> appealing to marketers.</p> <p>The opportunity to reach people when they're at a place where they're open to creating so many new habits that will stick with them for years or even decades is worth spending heavily on. One way to do it is through advertising. Another is by giving students a steep discount.</p> <h2 id="the-problem"><a href="#the-problem">#</a> The problem</h2> <p>In a number of ways that matter to me, educational discounts <em>as they are typically implemented</em> are radically different from region or need-based discounts.</p> <h3 id="who-has-a-edu-email-address"><a href="#who-has-a-edu-email-address">#</a> Who has a .edu email address?</h3> <p>Who has a .edu email address? Generally it's only students, faculty and alumni of accredited US colleges. This roughly translates to "many of the most priviledged people in the world".</p> <p>The vast majority of adults in the US <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=ACSST1Y2018.S1501&amp;g=0100000US&amp;tid=ACSST1Y2018.S1501&amp;hidePreview=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">do not have a 4-year degree</a>. There are probably a billion people in the world who would <em>love</em> to either enter a US college themselves or get their children into one.</p> <p>Competition for those slots is fierce. People spend small fortunes on English language education for a shot. I've seen it first-hand living in Asia for most my adult life.</p> <p>Obviously, not <em>everyone</em> with a .edu email address is or will be wealthy. However in aggregate, their parents are wealthier and they will be wealthier than any country in the world... by a large margin. At a minimum, getting a 4-year degree costs tens of thousands of dollars. Saving a few dollars a month on my <a href="https://alchemist.camp/episodes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">screencasts</a> is trivial in comparison.</p> <p>In contrast, the average person in Nigeria earns 2,000 USD/year. Even the average programmer isn't making much compared to their counterparts in other countries. Nigerians are also a double digit percentage of my audience! Indians are a large percentage as well.</p> <p>I have a <em>completely</em> different reaction when someone living in poor country asks for a discount than I do when someone spending more per year on tuition than I earned until my late 20s does.</p> <h3 id="who-is-a-student"><a href="#who-is-a-student">#</a> Who is a student?</h3> <p>An even more salient question is, who counts as a student. I've spent a great deal of time as a non-credentialed student at language schools, at a programming school and even completely on my own with a self-designed curriculum.</p> <p>During those times, I wasn't very successful in asking for educational discounts since nearly all are tied to credential-offering schools. I often thought about why and settled on two answers.</p> <ol><li>They probably worry about non-students claiming to be students to get the discount.</li> <li>Their educational discounts weren't really motivated by any sense of altruism or fairness to begin with.</li></ol> <h3 id="hypocrisy"><a href="#hypocrisy">#</a> Hypocrisy</h3> <p>Perhaps the thing that <em>most</em> bothers me about student discounts I see announced is the virtue signalling.</p> <p>If you're offering a discount to get your customers hooked early in their careers or to raise prices for business users, great. But you're not doing a noble thing if you're restricting a discount to people with .edu addresses.</p> <p>What that discount model actually does is exclude all of the students in poorer parts of the world as well as anyone who couldn't stomach going $100k in debt for a credential.</p> <h3 id="what-does-the-discount-subsidize"><a href="#what-does-the-discount-subsidize">#</a> What does the discount subsidize?</h3> <p>As economists love to point out, incentives matter. When you subsidize something, you get more of it. This isn't just true of governments, but it's also true of companies and other groups.</p> <p>That leads ato the question of what educational discounts subsidize. In effect, they subsidize going to very expensive universities. Is this something we want more of?</p> <p>In what's likely a minority opinion, I think too many people pursue formalized schooling for too long. Universities are necessary for some kinds of careers and for some kinds of research. Far more often, the price is just too high. The worst part of this cost isn't dollars either—it's four years of a person's life.</p> <p>Nearly anything universities teach can be learned outside of a university, and usually faster. I've experienced this first hand with mathematics, foreign languages and programming but it's certainly a wider phenomena.</p> <p>According to George Mason economist Bryan Caplan, <a href="https://amzn.to/2YLbmNG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">only about 10%-20% of the value in schooling is actually education</a>. The other 80%-90% is selection and signalling.</p> <h2 id="what-products-are-exceptions"><a href="#what-products-are-exceptions">#</a> What products are exceptions?</h2> <p>If I were selling very expensive tools for skilled professionals, like Adobe used to, then I'd offer student discounts. Even a person in relatively fortunate circumstances has fewer resources than a typical company.</p> <p>Dropping a few dollars a month doesn't move the needle compared to tuition, but spending thousands of dollars on a photo or video editor sure could.</p> <p>Another factor in Adobe's case was that by being <em>the</em> tool to use in the industry, students needed to learn it. Anyone trying to become a designer pretty much had to find a way, even if that meant "pirating" it. Giving students convenient affordable access to such a tool is also a great way to <em>become</em> a standard tool in the industry.</p> <p>Even Adobe didn't limit their discounts to US students, though. Doing so might have cost them billions.</p> <h2 id="the-bottom-line"><a href="#the-bottom-line">#</a> The bottom line</h2> <p>Having a .edu email address generally means being in the most expensive and desired university system in the world.</p> <br>  <br> <hr></div></div>]]>

						<p><span>Once, small firms centred on inventors were responsible for most of our innovation. Larger firms might buy or exploit these steps forwards, but they did not typically make them. And then for a brief period, this changed: many of the best new products, tools, and ideas came from research labs within large corporations. This brief period also happened to be the era when scientific, technological, and economic productivity sped forward at its fastest ever clip. Yet almost as soon as it arrived, the fruitful period was over and we returned to a situation where small companies and small-business-like teams at universities developed innovations outside of large companies and sold them in a market for ideas. Though we might enjoy the innovation created by small flexible firms, we should not dismiss the contributions made by large corporate labs. The corporate lab may be creeping back, but aggressively prosecuting antitrust against large firms growing organically through in-house research could easily snuff this spark out.</span></p>
<h3>The USA’s first system of innovation</h3>
<p><span>When the USA began to contribute to the progress of technology, in the early 19th century, it was largely practically-minded, not based on deep scientific understanding. Rather, it largely consisted of individual inventors commercialising their own inventions. Whereas nuclear power depended on decades or centuries of progress in physics, many late 19th century innovations were more like the cotton gin, which came together through practical-minded trial and error in the field. By the late 19th century, the system had morphed into one we would find strangely familiar today: inventors invented, venture capitalists invested, and companies commercialised. The system even had </span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/business-history-review/article/patent-alchemy-the-market-for-technology-in-us-history/90991329A8D4A49EBF7B49D2EAD1CE7A"><span>patent lawyers</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/khan_ip2_working_paper.pdf"><span>non-practising entities</span></a>, <span>which own patents purely </span><a href="https://www.hbs.edu/businesshistory/Documents/BHR870102.pdf"><span>to litigate on their behalf</span></a><span>. There were still startups commercialising an idea and scaling it up themselves, but many inventors found that the division of labour enabled by the market ideas allowed them to </span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/business-history-review/article/patent-alchemy-the-market-for-technology-in-us-history/90991329A8D4A49EBF7B49D2EAD1CE7A"><span>focus on what they did best</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Large firms were consumers of ideas created by inventors, and were sceptical of the value of doing in-house science. They believed it was easier to buy new science off the shelf. In 1885 T. D. Lockwood, head of American Bell Telephone Company’s patent department, said:&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>“I am fully convinced that it has never, is not now, and never will pay commercially, to keep an establishment of professional inventors, or of men whose chief business it is to invent”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Of course, Bell Labs itself later grew to be one of the marquees of commercial labs—in the late 1960s it employed 15,000 people including 1,200 PhDs, who between them made too many important inventions to list, from the transistor and the photovoltaic cell to the first digitally scrambled voice audio (in 1943) and the first complex number calculator (in 1939). Fourteen of its staff went on to win Nobel Prizes and five to win </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award"><span>Turing Awards</span></a><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>The 1920s stock market boom was in large part driven by a huge rise in the value that investors </span><a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.98.4.1370"><span>accorded to intangible capital</span></a><span> and ideas held within companies. A similar thing happened in the </span><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Capitalism-Without-Capital-Intangible-Economy/dp/0691175039"><span>1990s Dot-com Bubble</span></a><span>. Between 1921 and 1927 the number of scientists and engineers in industrial labs more than doubled. When the stock market crashed and the Great Depression hit it caused a </span><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d71a/90cfa2d0d0d72f13724d27dd326209431974.pdf"><span>massive and persistent decline</span></a><span> in independent inventing and the startup-like activity around it. But large labs continued to boom, increasing staffing and research spending throughout the lean 1930s, and earning more patents. By 1930, most patents were issued to large firms, rather than independent innovators, and this gap only widened into the 1950s. The industrial lab had become king.</span></p>
<h3>Why labs work well</h3>
<p><span>The question of why the industrial lab works is a microcosm of the question of why the firm works in general. Economist Ronald Coase, who won the Nobel Prize in 1991 (and who lived to be 102) bookended the most productive period of his career with two insights about transaction costs. The first, published in 1937 and entitled </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x"><span>“The Nature of the Firm”</span></a><span>, tells us why firms exist. In economics, situations are typically approached from the perspective of competitive behaviour in open markets. Most of the things we buy are from open, competitive markets like these. But when we sell our labour, we are usually bound to a single “buyer”—our employer—for an extended period of time for everything we have to offer. If market competition is so efficient, why do we not set up mini-firms for every instance of cooperative work and receive pay in line with our output? Why do we instead generally sell a promise to do whatever our boss says within limits for certain hours of the day for months or years in advance?</span></p>
<p><span>The other, </span><a href="https://www.law.uchicago.edu/files/file/coase-problem.pdf"><span>“The Problem of Social Cost”</span></a><span>, reads like a reflection of the first. Published in 1960, it spawned the so-called Coase Theorem, which holds that so long as transaction costs—the costs of interacting with other individuals or institutions, such as the costs of drawing up and enforcing a contract—are low, people will contract to deal with the problems emerging from positive and negative externalities, like the benefits of a new park to a neighbourhood or the costs of pollution. Where transaction costs are too high, institutions and policies are needed to deal with the externalities instead.</span></p>
<p><span>Coase answers the question of why businesses exist as he answers the question of why people simply don’t contract away all externalities: transaction costs. If there is a cost on both sides every time one person wants to pay another for a task, then some tasks will not be worth paying for, or worth doing at the going rate. Concretely: an employer who does not negotiate contracts for each and every individual work unit can afford to offer higher wages, and an employee who does not do so can afford to accept lower wages. Companies organized in this way thus outcompete pure market organization—in cases where transaction costs are large.</span></p>
<p><span>In many ways, this general story for why firms exist also explains why large firm R&amp;D labs were so successful. The transaction costs of collaboration are extremely large, and prevent all sorts of potentially-valuable crossovers: not just the financial costs of contracting with others, but the costs of finding people you work well with, of corresponding and collaborating with people far from you, and so on. University lecturers collaborate more with those in their department than in other departments, and more with those in their university or city than elsewhere, despite all the tools and technologies the internet has brought. Chance meetings are another driver of serendipitous discovery and unexpected but fruitful collaborations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What’s more, without great efforts in ‘translation’, many scientific ideas can be completely disconnected from practical applications. A research lab brings an array of scientific experts together from different disciplines, for collaboration and drawing on expertise at low cost. Fellow researchers bump into one another. And the firm context means the potential impact in terms of usable products is always taken into account.</span></p>
<h3>The DARPA Era</h3>
<p><span>The era of the R&amp;D lab has one particularly legendary story and paradigmatic example: PARC. Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Centre—the location in Palo Alto, now the home of companies like Tesla, Palantir, and Google, is no coincidence—developed many of the foundational building blocks of today’s technology and economy. In the 1970s, PARC researchers built the first computer with a graphical user interface, the first laser printer, the first Ethernet cable, and the first user-friendly word processor. Steve Jobs visited PARC in 1979, aged 24, and incorporated many of the ideas into Apple products. Charles Simonyi, a key developer at PARC, moved to Microsoft, where he developed the Office suite. But Xerox itself, which is still largely known for making photocopiers, did not capitalise on these inventions.</span></p>
<p><span>PARC, in turn, had hired many of its workers from Augmentation Research Centre, a publicly-funded project which pioneered the computer mouse, hyperlinks, the earliest predecessor to the internet, and many smaller innovations we take for granted in today’s computer ecosystem. ARC was funded by ARPA, the Advanced Research Projects Agency, now DARPA. Though DARPA (then ARPA) is funded by the US Department of Defence, it shares many elements with golden era R&amp;D labs. They are organised around a mission and a goal—even the most basic research is done with an end in mind—but researchers are given a lot of freedom to make their own decisions.</span></p>
<h3>A return to the market for ideas</h3>
<p><span>The scale of the change since the 1970s is huge—big businesses have retreated from research. In the 1960s, DuPont, the chemicals giant, published more in the </span><i><span>Journals of the American Chemical Society</span></i><span> than both MIT and Caltech combined. R&amp;D magazine, which awards the R&amp;D 100 to the hundred innovations it judges most innovative in a given four year period, gave 41% of its awards to Fortune 500 companies in its 1971 iteration and 47% in 1975. By 2006, 6% of the awards were going to firms in the Fortune 500. The great majority of these awards are now being won by federal labs, university teams, and spin-offs from academia. The lone inventor is back.</span></p>
<p><span>This is reflected by declines in the shares of patents going to the biggest businesses, and in the shares of scientists working there. In 1971 just over seven per cent of scientists in industry tracked by the US National Science Foundation worked in firms with under 1,000 employees; by 2004 this was 32%. In 2003 around a quarter worked at firms with fewer than ten employees. Even pharmaceuticals, the one area where large internal research labs are still significant, has been affected—around half of the drugs approved so far in the 2010s were originally discovered by small biotech startups.</span></p>
<p><span>In general, participation by large American firms in …</span></p></div></div></div>

<p>This URL is the link to the series that I am writing on <a href="https://hashnode.com/@hashnode">Hashnode</a> where I am developing a full-featured Markdown editor from scratch. But, the URL is so long and difficult to read and share on platforms like twitter. </p>
<p>Instead, wouldn't it be nice to have a simple short URL like <code>pbt.im/markdown-series</code> which redirects to the above URL. It's short, crisp, readable, and also equally conveys what one can expect in that link.</p>
<h3 id="sharing-affiliate-links">Sharing affiliate links.</h3>
<p>Other places where URL shortening can be useful is when you want to share or brand an ugly affiliate link, or when the domain of the link that you want to share is very long.</p>

<p>Take a look at some of the shortened links that I frequently use. </p>

<p>Sharing the above links is so easy. You don't even have to copy them. You can just type them out yourself. They are short, consistent, readable and can easily be remembered.</p>
<h3 id="links-can-change">Links can change</h3>
<p>Another disadvantage of sharing normal links is that the links can potentially change in the future. </p>
<p>If they do change, you can't hunt down every post and every place where you posted or shared that link and then update it. And it might not always be feasible to redirect the old URL to a new URL. </p>
<p>Shortened links can come in very handy in this situation. The shortened link that you share need not change ever. Whereas the URL that the short link should redirect to can change as you wish.</p>
<h3 id="bookmarks">Bookmarks</h3>
<p>I even started using my URL shortener to create bookmarks. I added a short URL(<code>/bookmarks</code>) that redirects to a GitHub page which contains all my other short URLs. Then whenever I want to bookmark a very useful URL, instead of bookmarking it normally, I started shortening it, which will automatically add it to my list of short URLs (which means it will also be available at <code>/bookmarks</code>)</p>
<p>Now that we saw some of the reasons of how shortened URLs can help us, let's see how to create one yourself.</p>
<h2 id="creating-your-own-url-shortener">Creating Your Own URL Shortener</h2>

<p>This is the tweet that inspired me to explore and create a URL shortener for shortening my links. I finally ended up using the approach that Kent suggested. I will be explaining the same in this article.</p>
<h3 id="netlify-redirects">Netlify Redirects</h3>
<p>Before we jump into the actual content, let's see what Netlify redirects are. Netlify gives us an easy way to handle redirects for any site that is hosted on the platform. All you have to do is create a <code>_redirects</code> file and then add the redirect rules in that file.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a <code>_redirects</code> file, each redirect rule must be listed on a separate line, with the original path followed by the new path or URL. Any line beginning with # will be ignored as a comment.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>/home              /</span>
/blog/my-post.php  /blog/my-post
/news              /blog
<span>/cuties            https:/</span>/www.petsofnetlify.com
</code></pre></blockquote>
<p>This is the bare minimum that you need to create your own URL shortener. </p>
<ul>
<li>Create an empty project with a single file called <code>_redirects</code>.</li>
<li>Add your short and complete URLs there.</li>
<li>Deploy that project to Netlify. </li>
</ul>
<p>You now have your own simple URL shortener. </p>
<p>Every time you want to add a new URL, you can just add it in the <code>_redirects</code> file and then deploy it. If using this workflow is good enough for you, you can stop here and use it.</p>
<p>But Kent went a step further and created a package called <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kentcdodds/netlify-shortener">netlify-shortener</a> which simplifies the workflow of creating short URLs even further.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to start using <code>netlify-shortener</code> and set up your own URL shortener</p>
<h4 id="step-1-create-an-empty-project">Step 1: Create an empty project</h4>
<pre><code>mkdir url-shortener
<span>cd</span> url-shortener
</code></pre><h4 id="step-2-initialize-it-as-npm-project">Step 2: Initialize it as npm project</h4>
<pre><code>npm <span>init</span> -y
</code></pre><h4 id="step-3-create-a-redirects-file-and-add-the-following-content">Step 3: Create a <code>_redirects</code> file and add the following content.</h4>
<pre><code>
/*       https://your-website.com
</code></pre>
<p><code>your-website.com</code> will act as a fallback when the URL doesn't match any of the available short URLs. Replace it with whatever URL you want to have as a fallback.</p>
<h4 id="step-4-add-homepage-and-shorten-script-to-your-packagejson-add-your-own-short-domain-url-to-the-homepage">Step 4: Add homepage and shorten script to your package.json (Add your own short domain URL to the homepage)</h4>
<pre><code>{
  "<span>homepage</span>": <span>"https://pbt.im"</span>,
  "<span>scripts</span>": {
    "<span>shorten</span>": <span>"netlify-shortener"</span>
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, you can run the following commands.</p>
<pre><code>
<span>npm</span> run shorten 


<span>npm</span> run shorten https:<span>//</span>yahoo.com


<span>npm</span> run shorten https:<span>//gi</span>thub.com gh
</code></pre><p>The <code>npm run shorten</code> command</p>
<ul>
<li>Generates a shortcode automatically if it is not provided.</li>
<li>Validates your URL.</li>
<li>Automatically check for URL collisions and throws an error if there is a collision.</li>
<li>Adds the URL to the top of the <code>_redirects</code> file and reformats the file properly.</li>
<li>Pulls the changes from remote, adds the new shortened URL, commits the code, and then pushes the commit to the remote again.</li>
<li>Automatically copies the short URL to your clipboard.</li>
</ul>
<p>You don't even have to provide <code>https://</code>, by default it assumes that the original link is <code>https://</code></p>
<p>You can even add it as a global command in your shell using <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kentcdodds/netlify-shortener#shell-function">these instructions</a></p>
<h3 id="my-workflow-for-shortening-a-url">My workflow for shortening a URL</h3>
<p>Open the terminal and simply write <code>shorten original-URL short-slug</code>. </p>
<p>For example, to shorten the link to my Github profile, I will run the following command </p>
<pre><code><span>shorten</span> github.com/pbteja1998 gh
</code></pre><h2 id="tl-dr">TL; DR</h2>

August 29, 2020 | https://theodormarcu.com/blog/2020-08-29-neuralink/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://theodormarcu.com/blog/2020-08-29-neuralink/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p><img src="https://theodormarcu.com/images/neuralink/neuralink1.jpg" alt="Neuralink Press Image">
<sub>Images courtesy of Neuralink.</sub></p><p>You probably heard about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/elon-musk-demonstrates-neuralinks-tech-live-using-pigs-with-surgically-implanted-brain-monitoring-devices/" target="_blank">the latest Neuralink demo</a>
by now. I’m referring to the one where Elon Musk showed pigs with brain implants walking around and making cute noises. But why should you care? Is this just another publicity stunt by a rich billionaire with eccentric pet projects, or does it actually matter?</p><iframe width="100%" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DVvmgjBL74w?start=947" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><sub>Click above to see the part of the presentation where the pig sniffs around and sounds play whenever the neurons associated with his snout fire. Trust me, it’s adorable. From now on, this is the sound I’ll play in my mind whenever I see animals sniffing around.</sub></p><p>The Neuralink demo is a big deal for several reasons. Most importantly, it shows a fully-working brain-machine interface product in a living being. I cannot emphasize how incredible this is. Creating a brain implant is a hard task. Not only do you have to figure out how to stick something in a brain without hurting it, but keeping that thing in place, building the software to interpret the signals coming from it, and then removing it with minimal damage is an endeavor that presents serious challenges at every step of the way. Making all of the above into a <em>product</em>, not a week-long surgery research project, is a truly Promethean achievement.</p><p>The fact that Neuralink is closer to delivering a product and not just research matters a lot. We’ve heard about advances in brain-machine interface research for decades now, but all the results have been highly experimental. Building a product and not an experiment means that all those results, from restoring speech to restoring movement, are closer to being used by those who actually need them. Furthermore, reducing the barriers to obtaining neural data from humans creates an unprecedented opportunity to better understand our own minds, not to mention traditionally elusive topics like consciousness.</p><p>One of the first things that stood out to me in the demo was how Neuralink inserts the brain-machine interface device into the brain. Insertion is something Neuralink has brought up in past presentations, but this time they showed a particularly good video of how it works. In order to insert sensors in a brain without damaging it, the Neuralink team has built electrodes in the shape of small wires that are 1/4 of the diameter of human hair. These electrodes are then inserted through a skull opening using a high-precision robot that scans the brain area <em>during</em> surgery, which allows it to avoid any blood vessels, no matter how small. This procedure reduces tissue damage and increases the probability that the implant won’t be outright rejected by the brain. To see how cool this is, just watch the demo below:</p><video id="video" muted="" preload="auto" poster="https://j.gifs.com/p8ADyp.jpg" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline="">
<source src="https://j.gifs.com/p8ADyp.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><p>The robot misses the blood vessels every time! This takes place in an area where distances are measured in micrometers - 1/100000 of a meter. This procedure is not something that would work without major advances in robotics and computer vision. Having a human do it by hand is out of the question. I suggest you go back to the <a href="https://youtu.be/DVvmgjBL74w?t=646" target="_blank">original demo</a> and watch the high-definition video to see just how good the robot is at this job.</p><p>The fact that the robot can implant a <em>Link</em> (Neuralink’s name for the sensor) in under an hour is a great achievement too. Neuralink’s goal is to make getting a brain-machine interface as easy as getting Lasik eye surgery. This demo showed that they’re not joking about delivering on this promise.</p><p>Another thing that truly stood out to me is how secure and inconspicuous the <em>Link</em> interface looked on the pig’s head. I couldn’t even spot it! This is really important, since if you’re about to make something that living beings are supposed to wear every day, you might as well make sure it’s not awkward or annoying. Even better, the interface should feel like it’s part of your own body.</p><p><img src="https://theodormarcu.com/images/neuralink/neuralink2.jpg" alt="Neuralink Press Image">
<sub>The new <em>Link</em> brain-machine interface.</sub></p><p>This is an area that did not receive a lot of attention before Neuralink. For example, when hospitals perform invasive brain-recordings using traditional methods like ECoG, wires come out of your head through skull openings. Since the brain is a squishy mass surrounded by liquid, keeping the liquid <em>in</em> and the area around the opening <em>clean</em> becomes an incredibly difficult task. Nurses have to hover around patients constantly to make sure that the wires are not coming loose and that the brain ooze is being cleaned so that no infections take place.</p><p>What makes the <em>Link</em> so revolutionary is that it’s a standalone device. By removing the need for charging or data transfer wires, this brain-machine interface is closer to an Apple Watch-level wearable than anything else that has been built so far. Seeing the charging puck (which seems to have copied the Apple Watch charging puck) offered perhaps the clearest glimpse of the future in the entire presentation (so did the 1-day battery life, which, while amazing for a device this size, will also lead to some really funny memes about how our brains will run out of battery and need to be charged).</p><p><img src="https://theodormarcu.com/images/neuralink/neuralink3.jpg" alt="Neuralink Inductive Charging Mechanism">
<sub>Is this going to be worse than forgetting to charge your phone at night?.</sub></p><p>Having something that fits neatly in your skull and blocks liquid from coming out without the need for wires is a major achievement. I’m sure there is still a lot of work to be done, especially given Elon’s calls for help from sealing experts, but seeing something as good as what we’ve seen today shows a great degree of progress.</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you’ve solved hard problems with phones / wearables (sealing, signal processing, inductive charging, power mgmt, etc), please consider working at engineering@neuralink.com</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1284306733720940544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2020</a></blockquote><p>Another noteworthy aspect of the <em>Link</em> interface is the signal processing. In this regard, the pig-sniffing-with-sounds demo was ok, since it didn’t really use any fancy techniques. What really stood out was predicting and interpreting brain signals using the information from the <em>Link</em> sensors.</p><video id="video" muted="" preload="auto" poster="https://j.gifs.com/vl0MOm.jpg" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline="">
<source src="https://j.gifs.com/vl0MOm.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><p>These demos can get a bit hand-wavey and Neuralink did not provide a lot of information about the techniques used to produce this particular example. However, given the fact that deep learning has been shown to be really good at brain signal decoding and prediction, I wouldn’t be suprised if Neuralink and OpenAI partenered on advancing signal processing using deep learning once the hardware is ready. Given Elon’s obsession with the singularity, I wouldn’t be surprised if this happened sooner.</p><p>Overall, I’m really excited about the future of invasive brain-machine interfaces after seeing this demo. While the jump from animals to humans is a big one and I’m sure Elon errs on being overly-optimistic when it comes to the timeline, this is a historical moment similar to launching the first dog into space. The fact that this is possible today opens an endless array of opportunities for the future of humanity.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>A few years ago I wrote <a href="https://medium.com/@LainIwakura/deobfuscating-obfuscated-code-for-fun-and-no-profit-36ec615c8f5d">two</a> <a href="https://medium.com/@LainIwakura/deobfuscating-code-for-fun-and-no-profit-round-2-60d78b67ebce">posts</a>
on medium.com explaining the workings of some obfuscated programs. After these posts other stuff took priority and I forgot about the world of obfuscation for a while. Now though, I find myself returning to it.
For reasons I’ll explain in a different post I find studying obfuscated code to be quite valuable. So, I thought to myself ‘Well, those last programs I examined were honestly pretty simple. What would it be like to research a truly obfuscated program?’</p>
<p>This post is the story of that journey. I will discuss the code, how I got such old and obscure code to run, as well as include snippets from my conversations with
one of the original authors (who was very helpful in figuring some of this out). If all that wasn’t enough I managed to obtain the original PDP and VAX source code, it will be hosted here with permission. I want to give a huge thank you to Sjoerd Mullender and Don Libes for their assistance and permission in reproducing some of this material.</p>

<p>Because older obfuscated programs tend to be easier to dissect I decided to stay in the early years of the IOCCC (International Obfuscated C Code Contest).
Among those early programs one sticks out as truly interesting - and that is the first IOCCC winner <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/1984/mullender/mullender.c">mullender.c</a>, which I’ve also replicated below because it’s quite short.

<p>Where do you start with a program like this? Well, the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/1984/mullender/hint.text">hint</a> provided by the IOCCC is always a good first step.
From this hint, we can learn a few things necessary to understanding how the program works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps most importantly, this program will only run on a PDP-11 or VAX-11.</li>
<li>The C startup routine - provided by crt0.o - transfers control to a location named ‘main’ - usually intended to be a function, but in this case it’s an array of shorts</li>
<li>These shorts (represented in different formats to enhance obfuscation) form a meaningful set of PDP-11 and VAX-11 instructions</li>
<li>The first instruction is a branch to the PDP code, and due to the way VAX calls the main ‘function’ it skips the first word of the program (I’ll discuss this more later).</li>
<li>The program prints a string</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, the program is a bunch of machine code instructions encoded in various formats. It runs because this code predates ANSI C by a half decade and old compilers seem to have had significantly less qualms about
‘main’ being a function or not (I tried to define ‘main’ as an array of shorts with a modern compiler and it did not like that one bit).</p>

<p>I admit it, the PDP-11 was before my time. I grew up in the Windows 95/98/2000 era, and until recently I didn’t even know what a PDP-11 was.
This ignorance left me kind of stuck, and a brief look on eBay confirmed that I was not going to get a working PDP-11 any time soon. Fortunately though,
an emulator exists. Enter <a href="http://simh.trailing-edge.com/">SimH</a>, it’s more of a suite of emulators for a wide range of historical computers - of which the
PDP-11 is one, and lucky for us the VAX-11 is another.</p>
<p>After a few false starts and misadventures with 2.11BSD, I realized I had no idea what I was doing so I decided I needed some help.
The two original authors of this program are Robbert van Renesse and Sjoerd Mullender, why not try to contact them? So I did.
Robbert didn’t answer my e-mail, but luckily Sjoerd got back to me and was happy to discuss the program. He told me that the
PDP-11 OS they used was Unix v7, so I proceeded on that route.</p>
<p>I managed to <a href="http://a.papnet.eu/UNIX/v7/Installation">find a guide</a> on installing Unix v7 onto this emulator that worked;
and now with my emulator running, and OS installed, I could slap it into a file, compile, and run the thing. Below is what I got.</p>

<figure>
	<img src="https://lainsystems.com/img/running_on_pdp11.gif">
	
		<figcaption>Running the program on the PDP-11 using Unix v7</figcaption>
	
</figure>


<p>The animation is a little choppy, but even still you can hopefully see that it is printing “:-)” across the screen until it is forced to exit (there is no clean way to stop it).</p>
<p>In my discussions with Sjoerd, it was revealed that the string it prints is not exactly “:-)” but instead "  :-)\b\b\b\b”
(NOTE: there should be 2 space characters at the start but my templating engine is removing one for some reason).
It is exactly 9 bytes long. The first 2 characters are whitespace, followed by the :-), finally followed by four ‘\b’
characters. The ‘\b’ characters indicate a backspace. What does the backspace accomplish? Well, if you count 4 characters back from when they begin you’ll see we’re left with a single space - it is at this point
that the program loops and prints the string again. This happens quickly enough that to our eyes it looks like the “:-)” is scrolling across the screen - a clever effect.</p>

<p>As it turns out, the C code is not very useful to examine directly. As it also turns out, the assembly isn’t much better. Below is a small sample of what the assembly looks like (from the PDP-11’s perspective):</p>
<pre><code>    .text
    .globl  _main
    .data
    .even
_main:
    .word   0425 
    .word   04735
    .word   -010041
    .word   031
    .word   0
    .word   0735
    .word   01773
    .word   05757
</code></pre><p>So, what to do? Well, you can actually set up a cross compiler for the PDP-11 and if you go through that effort you can use the objdump program targeted at PDP-11 binaries.</p>
<p>Below is the relevant portion of the objdump - the whole thing is <a href="https://lainsystems.com/mull_objdump.txt">here</a>, but not all of it is useful. Sjoerd confirmed that the PDP code is
from _main+0x2c to _main+0x4a (inclusive). Of course, the first word is also a PDP-11 instruction. Everything I’ve ommitted is related to the VAX portion of
the program which we will get back to. (It’s also not proper VAX code since the disassembler thinks everything is PDP-11).</p>
<pre><code>   0:   0115            br  0x2c
  2c:   11c4            mov pc, r4
  2e:   0be4            tst -(r4)
  30:   e5c4 0009       sub $11, r4
  34:   1137 0006       mov r4, $0x3e
  38:   15c0 0001       mov $1, r0
  3c:   8904            sys 4
  3e:   0000            halt
  40:   0009            .word   11
  42:   15c2 0200       mov $1000, r2
  46:   892d            sys 55
  48:   7e82            sob r2, 0x46
  4a:   01f0            br  0x2c
</code></pre><p>Before going further there are 2 important things to know about PDP-11 assembly code:</p>
<ul>
<li>The PDP-11 works primarily with octal. All the addresses and instructions are encoded in octal.</li>
<li>In an instruction like <code>mov pc, r4</code>, you are moving pc INTO r4, not r4 into pc. Personally, I got used to this pretty quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first number in the original program is 277, put that into a hex converter and you’ll get 115 like we see in the objdump. More interesting though is what you get translating it into octal - 425.
How does 0425 get you br 0x2c though? Well for that you need to grab some <em>manuals</em>. I got my hands on a lot of old manuals for these computers but the most useful one was the PDP-11/45 Handbook from 1973.
It would helpfully describe the instruction format, and exactly what it did. Below is an example of the page for the unconditional branch instruction.</p>

<figure>
	<img src="https://lainsystems.com/img/pdp11-branch.png">
	
		<figcaption>PDP-11/45 Handbook Describing the Branch instruction</figcaption>
	
</figure>


<p>As you can see, it sets the program counter to pc + 2x the offset - which is 25 (octal) in our case. Since the program counter at the start of our program is 2 (because it points to the next word to execute),
we get 2 + (25 x 2), or 2 + 52 = 54, which translating back into hex gives us 2c. Cool!</p>

<p>Now that we know how the branch works we can examine the main stuff - I won’t go into huge depth with the manuals for each little instruction but doing so is fun if you’re bored and enjoy that sort of thing.</p>
<p>The next relevant portion of code is this:</p>
<pre><code>  mov pc, r4
  tst -(r4)
  sub $11, r4
  mov r4, $0x3e
  mov $1, r0
  sys 4
  halt
  .word   11
</code></pre><p>We move the program counter into the r4 register and then use the ‘test’ (tst) instruction. This has the effect of clearing the some flags in the PSW (processor status word), and because
the register is using ‘Autodecrement mode’ it will subtract 2 from the value stored at r4. When using autoincrement / decrement, it will go by 1 in byte instructions or 2 in word instructions.
After this we subtract 11 from r4, but 11 is actually 9 (used to octal yet?). Then we store r4 into…0x3e? Well, if you look back at the objdump you’ll see that 0x3e is ‘halt’ or 0000. This
mov instruction overwrites that value with the contents of r4. We move 1 into r0 (1 indicating STDOUT), and call ‘sys 4’. The next line will be the value of r4 as just mentioned, and <code>.word 11</code>
simply inserts octal 11 directly into that spot. If you’re wondering what exactly is in r4 and why we’re doing all this stuff, be patient - we’re getting there.</p>
<p>If you’re familiar with system calls, you probably know what’s going on. If not, all of this is to setup the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_(system_call)">write</a> system call. I
actually made a <a href="https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/15590/trying-to-understand-some-assembly-syntax-in-the-unix-v7-write-system-call">post on the retro-computing stackexchange</a>
asking about the workings of this call internally - I recommend checking it out if you want further clarity on how this works.</p>
<p>After this we have the final 3 lines of PDP code which are:</p>
<pre><code>  mov $1000, r2
  sys 55
  sob r2, 0x46
</code></pre><p>We put 1000 into r2, and call system call 55. After this, we use the ‘sob’ instruction - which is ‘subtract one and branch’ and not an invitation to cry - to see if r2 is 0 yet. If it isn’t, we branch
to the previous line and call system call 55 again. loop until r2 is 0. Syscall 55 eh? Which …</p></div></div></div>

  <p>OpenMath is an emerging standard for representing mathematical objects with their semantics, allowing them to be exchanged between computer programs, stored in databases, or published on the worldwide web. While the original designers were mainly developers of computer algebra systems, it is now attracting interest from other areas of scientific computation and from many publishers of electronic documents with a significant mathematical content. There is a strong relationship to the MathML recommendation from the Worldwide Web Consortium, and a large overlap between the two developer communities. MathML deals principally with the presentation of mathematical objects, while OpenMath is solely concerned with their semantic meaning or content. While MathML does have some limited facilities for dealing with content, it also allows semantic information encoded in OpenMath to be embedded inside a MathML structure. Thus the two technologies may be seen as highly complementary.</p>

<p>Mathematical objects encoded in OpenMath can be</p>

<ul>
  <li>displayed in a browser</li>
  <li>exchanged between software systems</li>
  <li>cut and pasted for use in different contexts</li>
  <li>verified as being mathematically sound (or not!)</li>
  <li>used to make interactive documents really interactive.</li>
</ul>

<p>OpenMath is highly relevant for persons working with mathematics on computers, for those working with large documents (e.g. databases, manuals) containing mathematical expressions, and for technical and mathematical publishing.</p>

<p>The worldwide OpenMath activities are coordinated within the OpenMath Society, based in Helsinki, Finland. It is coordinated by an executive committee, elected by its members. It organizes regular workshops and hosts a number of electronic discussion lists. The Society brings together tool builders, software suppliers, publishers and authors.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I had an hour-long conversation yesterday talking to a fellow entrepreneur who quit the adventure and took a job. He was curious to know what I had done differently to arrive at a positive outcome.</p><p>My first reaction was to tell him that this is not my first attempt. </p><p>I've tried building a company twice before and failed miserably. I even tried building a breakfast delivery business in 2015 (I had no idea what I was doing back then) and I made ₹85,000 in revenue before I shut it down.</p><p>SuperLemon is actually my fourth attempt. Sankalp and I did just enough things right this time (or avoided just enough mistakes) to make the business work. </p><p>The journey to reaching here was long, filled with doubt internally and from everyone around me, even frustrating and hopeless at times.</p><p>Out of all the things we talked during the call, the three things that stood out to me were:</p><h3><strong>1-</strong> I kept trying again and again</h3><p>If something didn't work, I would find a job to save up and try again as soon as I have a year's worth of runway and a strong enough conviction about the idea. </p><p>As of today, I don't see any other path in life but building businesses.</p><h3><strong>2-</strong> I knew when to quit</h3><p>When things weren't working out no matter our best effort, clearly there was something wrong. I spent 12 months on my second venture before realising there's no market demand. </p><p>But I quit my third venture (right before SuperLemon) in about 4 months when it was obvious to me that it wasn't going to work.</p><h3><strong>3-</strong> Introspect </h3><p>After every attempt or failure, I would spend between 1-3 months in intense introspection of what went wrong. </p><p>This wasn't an exercise to beat myself up over it, but rather to learn what I need to do differently the next time for things to work out more favourably.</p><h3>If you're a budding entrepreneur</h3><p>I don't recommend this path to anyone unless they are willing to take all the pain and failures, learn from them, and try again with the hope to eventually get it right.</p><p>Quit sooner than later when something isn't working, but only if you've understood why it won't work. </p><p>Ask always yourself if you're in it for the long haul. Otherwise you might as well quit right now.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2> What is the yield curve?</h2><p>The Yield Curve shows current yield rates, for US Treasuries, at varying maturities. That was a lot of jargon, so let's break it down.</p><canvas></canvas><p>US Treasuries represent bonds issued by the US Government. Think of a bond as any loan - the issuer of a bond has to pay interest each month, and the amount borrowed at maturity. Maturity refers to the period after which the bond is to be paid back. The US Government issues bonds for varying maturity rates, from 30 days to 30 years. And finally, the yield rate represents the effective interest rate for a bond, based on its current price.</p><h2>Why does it matter?</h2><p>The yield curve sets the basic, or lowest possible, interest rates. Any changes in the yield curve have a ripple effect across the entire economy.</p><p>Effectively, the yield curve represents current interest rates for the US Government. The US Government is considered the safest borrower in the economy. So, it gets to borrow money at the lowest possible interest rates. Everyone else has to pay more interest, to compensate for the added risk. </p><p>Let's take a concrete example. On September 4, 2019, Apple issued bonds worth $7bn. These bonds had maturities ranging from 3 years, to 30 years. The yield rate on these bonds was higher than the US Government bond yields on the same day.</p><canvas></canvas><p>Similarly, if you want to take out a 30 year mortgage, your interest rate will be some number plus the interest rate of the 30 year treasury.</p><p>So when the yield curve rises, that means interest rates for everyone go up. It becomes more expensive for Apple to borrow money, or for you to get a mortage. If it's more expensive to borrow money, it's more expensive to spend money; and in this way, higher interest rates make economic growth harder.</p><p>The yield curve also matters because it's considered a predictor for future recessions.</p><h3>How is the yield curve a recession indicator?</h3><p>The shape of the yield curve offers some clues. In normal times, the yield curve slopes upwards. Remember, the higher risk the, the higher the interest rate. Shorter periods are safer - it's easier to predict what will happen in the next 30 days, than in the next 30 years.</p><p>When the yield curve is <em>inverted</em>, something is wrong. It means that rates for long term-periods are lower than interest rates for short-term periods. This is rare, and breaks the relationship we described above. It's so abnormal, that it is a reliable predictor of economic recessions.</p><p>The chart below is an example of an inverted yield curve; specifically, the yield curve for August 11, 2006. Yield curves were inverted for much of 2006 and 2007. It proved prophetic. In late 2007 we entered the deepest economic recession since the 1930s.</p><canvas></canvas><p>The graph below shows the <em>spread</em> between the 10 year treasury and the 3 month treasury. The spread is just the difference between two interest rates; so anytime the spread drops below 0, it means the yield curve was inverted on that day.</p><canvas></canvas><h3>How does this matter as a personal investor?</h3><p>One way to use the yield curve is to check whether it is inverted. If the yield curve is inverted, postpone taking any loans if you can. An inverted yield curve is a sign that the rates might be lower in the future, so you'd want to wait for that to happen. It's also a sign that there might be economic trouble ahead; so ensure your savings are truly safe.</p><p>The yield curve can help you identify opportunities to refinance old mortgages or loans. If interest rates have dropped since the day you took the loan, you might have an opportunity to refinance it at a lower interest rate.</p><p>The yield curve doesn't change frequently; check it once per quarter.</p><h2>How does it change?</h2><h3>The Federal Reserve manages parts of the yield curve.</h3><p>The Fed's job is to manage inflation and maintain economic growth. They use a variety of tools to do so. For the moment, don't worry about how the Fed does it - just know that the Fed has lots of control over short term rates, but only some control over long term rates.</p><p>During a recession the Fed's goal is to get the economy growing again. In order to do so, it will cut interest rates. As explained above, high interest rates reduce spending, while low interest rates stimulate spending. When spending is stimulated, the economy grows, and things eventually return back to normal.</p><p>The Fed is good at its job, and is reliable, so the relationship described above works well. So well, that investors know the Fed will do so when a recession hits. If investors think a recession is coming 2 years from now, they'll start betting that interest rates will drop. This in fact causes <strong>yield rates</strong> to fall, resulting in an inverted yield curve. </p><p>But there are limits to what the Fed can actually do.</p><h3>What's happening during COVID-19?</h3><p>The yield curve is considered extremely flat today. The chart below shows the spread between 30 day and 30 year bonds. The lower the spread, the flatter the yield curve.</p><p>The Fed has committed to keeping interest rates as as close to 0 as possible. COVID-19 has hit the economy hard; low interest rates are needed to stimulate the economy as much as possible, but the Fed might be hitting its limits.</p><h3>What could the future look like?</h3><p>There's a notion of the <em>Zero Lower Bound</em>. Theoretically, interest rates can't drop below 0%. Negative interest rates are weird - that implies being paid to take out a loan. For a long time, it was assumed that the bound was a hard one. Meaning that once the Fed has cut interest rates to 0%, it can't do anything more to stimulate the economy.</p><p>Firstly, we've discovered that 0% might not be the lower bound. European central banks, such as the Swiss central bank, have run interest rates lower than 0% for some time now.</p><p>Secondly, the Fed has discovered new tools to stimulate the economy. A notable example is Quantitative Easing, first used in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. The Fed has started to do it again; but this time around, the effects have been very different. To be explained in a future post!</p><h2>What else do I need to know?</h2><p>The Fed is one of many interacting agents in the world of interest rates; we haven't discussed inflation or gone into details about the role that investors play.</p></div></div></div>]]>

      <article role="main">
        <p>This isn’t going to be a post about how adopting a several-thousand-year-old practice <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/healthy-living/mindfulness-sells-buddhist-meditation-teachings-neoliberalism-attention-economy-a8225676.html">can make you a better servant of capital</a>.
Instead, let’s talk about when I feel the lowest of the low.
It comes after spending any number of hours on my computer, maybe even a full day, endlessly circling around different websites in search of stimulation, the quick jolt that comes with learning an interesting fact or watching a funny short video or seeing someone get dunked on for having a bad political opinion.
I’ll eventually wake into a state that could be identified as conscious thought, look back on the many (genuinely exciting!) things I wanted to learn or do that day, and contrast it with what I actually did.
What did I actually do? I honestly don’t even know. I doubt I could list even three things I’d read or experienced the entire preceding eight hours.
At this moment I feel very bad. I know one of the ~30,000 days in my life is gone.
And I didn’t get anything out of it.
Actually, I’m worse off, because spending your time in this way just begets even more time spent in this way.</p>
<p>I don’t have any social media apps on my phone.
I deleted my twitter account.
I deleted my reddit account.
I don’t have an instagram account.
My facebook account exists only to be part of some groups.
I use LeechBlock.
I redirect websites to 0.0.0.0 in my hosts file.
Everyone I know does most of these things.
Everyone I know still has trouble spending their time how they actually want to spend it.
If I were to write down a list of the things I find most important in life, endlessly circling around a handful of websites would not even be in consideration.</p>
<p>If I get stuck in the loop for more than a week or so my brain starts to eat itself.
There’s a visceral knawing feeling.
My thoughts dwell on how to defeat this thing which is deleting hours from my life.</p>
<p>So far the only thing which has helped is mindfulness meditation.
After sitting for 10 or 20 minutes and focusing on my breath, my mind becomes quiet.
Traffic on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network">default mode network</a> dies down a little bit.
I’m no longer instantly pulled into the online vortex upon encountering the slightest speedbump in my work.
Instead my mind just… stays quiet, and I keep the problem in my head.
This doesn’t last forever.
I could probably meditate for 10 minutes out of every hour and still have spent more time on the things I actually wanted to spend time on, at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Deciding to meditate is hard.
The idea of spending ten minutes intentionally doing nothing runs against a lot of messaging I’ve internalized.
It’s also very difficult to keep my attention on my breath instead of running away to consider whatever figment wanders through my thoughts.
There’s an interesting metaphor I’ve heard.
Your mind is like a train station.
Thoughts think themselves - they are trains pulling into the station.
A train of thought will shortly pull out of the station, but you don’t have to be on it.
Or maybe you just boarded it without thinking, then don’t realize what you’ve done until you’re a mile down the track.
No worries; you can always return to the station.</p>
<p>I decided to try mindfulness meditation after listening to the audio version of Robert Wright’s book <a href="http://whybuddhismistrue.net/">Why Buddhism Is True</a> while on a cross-country drive.
It’s about how many beliefs in Buddhism - specifically Western Atheistic Buddhism - have support from modern psychology &amp; neuroscience.
I wasn’t motivated to start meditating by thinking it would help me in this struggle for my attention; the discovery was quite accidental.
I use the <a href="https://www.wakingup.com/">Waking Up</a> app.
Friends of mine also report good experiences with <a href="https://www.headspace.com/">Headspace</a>.</p>
<p>It’s troubling I have to go to such lengths to live my life the way I think I want to live it.
Maybe this struggle is uniquely modern, maybe it’s one for the ages.
I still have issues sometimes, especially before bed when my defenses are lower and I can get sucked into the loop instead of reading a good book or just going to sleep.
Still, for the first time in my life I’ve found an actually effective tool for resisting the attention economy.</p>

<p>Since “Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand” sounds stupid to New Zealanders (Auckland is pretty much a big city with a single job market and is not a state or similar) I clicked on the link and opened the application to stick with what I currently have</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="912" height="557" src="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-36-46.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-36-46.png 912w, https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-36-46-300x183.png 300w, https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-36-46-768x469.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 912px) 100vw, 912px"></figure>



<p>Except the problem is that the pulldown doesn’t offer many any other locations</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="546" height="316" src="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-38-03.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-38-03.png 546w, https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-38-03-300x174.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px"></figure>



<p>The only way to change the location is to click “use Current Location” and then allow Linkedin to access my device’s location.</p>



<div><p>According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/suggested/110568">the help page</a>:</p><p><em>By default, the location on your profile will be suggested based on the postal code you provided in the past, either when you set up your profile or last edited your location. However, you can manually update the location on your LinkedIn profile to display a different location.</em></p></div>



<p>but it appears the manual method is disabled. I am guessing they have a fixed list of locations in my postcode and this can’t be changed.</p>



<p>So it appears that my options are to accept Linkedin’s crappy name for my location (Other NZers have posted problems with their location naming) or to allow Linkedin to spy on my location and it’ll probably still assign the same dumb name.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="489" height="42" src="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-48-43.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-48-43.png 489w, https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-48-43-300x26.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 489px) 100vw, 489px"></figure>



<p>The basically appears to be a way for Linkedin to push user to enable location tracking. While at the same time they get to force their own ideas on how New Zealand locations work on users.</p>

<p>PHP has a Just In Time compiler (JIT) since its most recent major version, PHP 8.</p>
<p>Here's a demo of JIT's impact on PHP. The video was recorded by Zeev, a core
developer of the php engine, to demonstrate the performance difference between
php 7.0 and JIT when generating fractals.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dWH65pmnsrI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""><iframe style="margin: auto; margin-bottom: 20px;" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dWH65pmnsrI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>It is fair to expect great performance improvements after watching this video,
especially if you remember the amazing boost when migrating from php 5 to 7.
But soon you'll notice that such gains aren't for most applications (unless
you do fractals for a living 🤷🏻‍♀️).</p>
<p>So before you get too hyped or too disappointed about JIT, let me explain what
this thing is and how you can get the most out of it.</p>
<h2>What is a Just In Time compiled language and why do we need it?</h2>
<p>Let me introduce you to compilation first, I believe we will need it.</p>
<p>CPUs can't read english, you already know that. They can kind of read a series
of bits and bytes which represent addresses, values, instructions... But guess
who can't code this? That's right, us! (At least I can't 👀 (I kind of can, but... no.))</p>
<p>A solution to this problem is to translate something we, humans, can write into
something CPUs can execute. This translation can be called "compilation". So
<strong>compilation is a translation of human-readable code to machine code.</strong>
Simple, oder?</p>
<p>Translating human-readable code to machine code can happen in three different
ways: Ahead Of Time (AOT) compilation, Just In Time (JIT) compilation or, our
favorite, interpretation (or Implicit Compilation).</p>
<p><strong>Languages like C, C++ or Rust are AOT-compiled languages.</strong> You write the code,
you compile it and the output is a binary object that a CPU immediately understands
how to execute. It is called Ahead Of Time because you compile the binary object
BEFORE you run it.</p>
<p><strong>Languages like PHP, Java or JavaScript are interpreted.</strong> A code written in such
languages will be translated into an intermediate representation and another
program (a compiled one) will understand and execute such intermediate
representation. It is very common to call such programs "Virtual Machines" or
"Interpreters".</p>
<p><strong>Normally interpreted languages have less performance and freedom when compared
with AOT-compiled languages</strong> because things like memory management, CPU-targeted
instructions and funky low-level tricks are not available to the user space. So
another program (the interpreter) has to manage all of this plus be polyglot
enough to talk to different kinds of processors and operating systems.</p>
<p><strong>Languages like Java, LUA and now PHP are not only interpreted but also Just
In Time compiled!</strong> They still need a VM, but their VMs are capable of compiling
this intermediate representation of code into binary objects in runtime. These
JIT-capable VMs operate in a hybrid mode where code is partially compiled and interpreted.</p>
<p>When JIT kicks in, parts of your php code will be compiled into machine code so the
Zend VM (php's virtual machine) won't interpret these parts anymore. Your php
code will talk directly to the CPU.</p>
<p>So why can't we just compile everything, then? If the VM is a bottleneck, why
bother to run through it in the first place? We could just compile our php code
into machine code and be happy about it.</p>
<p>Well, we'd have to compile to specific CPU architectures, be prepared to talk to
different operating systems, be extremely clear about our variable types and
perform way more bare-metal operations than we should if we want to be productive.
There are decent abstractions for Golang and Rust, for example, but they aren't
very practical and require control over the environment they're deployed against.</p>
<p><strong>Interpreted languages, on the other hand, can be easily deployed to different
servers, allow rapid development and create room for dynamic typing systems.</strong></p>
<p>Just In Time compilation is potentially the best of the two worlds, combining
good speed and developer experience.</p>
<p>Dynamic typing, as you know, is one of the core features of PHP. It is very
complex and is tattooed into php's core in a way that removing the dynamic
typing is almost unthinkable.
<a href="https://thephp.website/en/issue/php-type-system/">Here’s a great summary on how php’s type system works.</a></p>
<p>And because of Dynamic Typing (and some other things you'll learn about below)
the Just In Time compiler present in PHP is not yielding big performance gains.
At least not yet.</p>
<p>Curious why? Keep reading!</p>
<h2>Let's see how PHP works with and without JIT</h2>
<p>In PHP there are three steps before executing your code: <strong>tokenizing</strong>,
<strong>parsing</strong> into an AST and <strong>compiling</strong> to an intermediate representation
known as <strong>Opcode</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tokenizing (or Lexing) is the process of reading php code and splitting
it into understandable units called tokens.</strong> <code>&lt;?php</code> becomes a _T_OPEN<em>TAG</em>,
<code>echo</code> becomes a _T<em>ECHO</em> and <code>"Hello, friend"</code> becomes T_CONSTANT_ENCAPSED_STRING.
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/tokens.php">A complete list of PHP's tokens can be found here.</a></p>
<p>Parsing is the process of making sense out of such tokens. In PHP parsed tokens
are organized in a tree structure named AST (Abstract syntax tree).
The AST's job is to represent what operations should be. In <code>echo 1+1</code> the interpreter
should in fact understand <code>print the result of the expression 1+1</code>. Such tree would
look something like the following:</p>
<pre><code>operation =&gt; ECHO,
operand =&gt; expression (
    operation =&gt; ADD,
    operand1 =&gt; 1,
    operand2 =&gt; 1
)</code></pre>
<p>PHP is then able to <strong>compile this tree into an intermediate representation
called Opcode.</strong></p>
<p>The Opcode is what is actually executed by the virtual machine, so executing
is the final step. Here's a diagram illustrating how this process looks like.</p>

</a>
<figcaption>A simplified overview on PHP's interpreting flow.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You probably realized that tokenizing, parsing and compiling code every single time
can be a big bottleneck. PHP engineers thought so too and that's why the
Opcache extension exists. Let's have a quick look at it.</p>
<h2>The Opcache extension</h2>
<p>The Opcache extension is shipped with PHP and generally there's no big reason to
deactivate it. If you use PHP, you should probably have Opcache switched on.</p>
<p>It adds an in-memory shared cache layer to store Opcodes. So tokenizing, parsing
and compiling will happen once for each file and will be shared with every request.</p>
<p>With Opcache extension enabled, the execution of PHP code looks like in the following
diagram:</p>
<figure>
<a href="https://thephp.website/assets/images/posts/10-php-8-jit/zendvm-opcache.png" target="_blank">
<img src="https://thephp.website/assets/images/posts/10-php-8-jit/zendvm-opcache.png" alt="The PHP's interpreting flow with Opcache">
</a>
<figcaption>The PHP's interpreting flow with Opcache. If a file was already parsed, php fetches the cached Opcodes for it instead of parsing all over again.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Side note:</strong> this is where <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/preload">PHP 7.4's preloading feature</a>
shines! It allows you to tell PHP FPM to parse your codebase, transform it into
Opcodes and cache them even before you execute anything.</p>
<h2>Enters the Just In Time compilation</h2>
<p>While the Opcache extension will prevent PHP from tokenizing, parsing and compiling
over and over again, the Just In Time compilation aims to skip the virtual machine's
Opcode interpretation and let it execute machine code directly.</p>
<p>PHP's JIT implementation uses a C library called
<a href="https://luajit.org/dynasm.html">DynASM (Dynamic Assembler)</a>
which maps a set of CPU instructions in one specific format into assembly code for
many different CPU types. So the Just In Time compiler transforms Opcodes into an
architecture-specific machine code using DynASM.</p>
<p>The compilation happens between fetching Opcodes from cache and executing them.
Since compiling Opcode into machine code can be very expensive, PHP has to decide
which portions of your code might make sense to be compiled or not.</p>
<p><strong>PHP then profiles Opcodes being executed by the Zend VM and checks which ones
might make sense to compile. (based on your configuration)</strong></p>
<p>When an Opcode is compiled its execution doesn't happen through the Zend VM handlers,
they are directly executed by the CPU.</p>

</a>
<figcaption>The PHP's interpreting flow with JIT. If compiled, Opcodes don't execute through the Zend VM.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When an Opcode should be compiled is decided based on your INI configurations. You'll
get more details in the next section.</p>
<h2>JIT Configuration</h2>
<p>Configuring JIT in PHP is very simple, there are two INI directives we need to set:
<code>opcache.jit_buffer_size</code> and <code>opcache.jit</code>. The first indicates how much memory
we're willing to allocate for compiled code, while the later one dictates how JIT
should behave.</p>
<p>There's also an optional directive named <code>opcache.jit_debug</code> for debugging purposes.
I will not cover this one here.</p>
<p>For example, the snippet below indicates that we're willing to give up to 100 Megabytes
of compiled code, enabling AVX instruction generation, using a global linear-scan register
allocator, profiling each request and jitting hot functions, optimizing the compiled
code based on static type inference. (👀 WUT?)</p>
<pre><code>opcache.jit_buffer_size=100M
opcache.jit=1235</code></pre>
<p>To make your life easier, I’m bringing some presets that
<a href="https://beberlei.de/2020/07/05/what_to_look_out_for_when_testing_php_jit.html">Benjamin Eberlei kindly shared in his blog</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>opcache.jit=1205</code> (JIT everything)</li>
<li><code>opcache.jit=1235</code> (JIT hot code based on relative usage)</li>
<li><code>opcache.jit=1255</code> (trace hot code for JITability, the best so far)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>opcache.jit</code> entry is a sequence of values named "CRTO", each character can have different
behavioural effect on your application. Below I explain what each of these letters can do:</p>

<p>
Has anyone else ever thought about why so many engineers are also
active amateur radio operators? My theory is that there's just so much
passion for the science and practical use of these complex electronic
systems! We enjoy the problems, challenges and solutions so much that
we want to find other ways outside of work to find those same
experiences. In this case, I've got a story that starts with some
amateur radio equipment but comes full-circle to address an extremely
common design issue.
</p>
<h2 id="headline-1">
The Attempted QSO
</h2>
<p>
This all begins with a new radio. I recently installed the
FTM-3200DR<sup><a id="footnote-reference-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>, a 2m-band, 65W transceiver with Yaesu's digital C4FM
modulation. One of the first things I wanted to try with this radio
was a direct, simplex QSO<sup><a id="footnote-reference-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup> with a friend who is about 16 miles
away as the crow flies. Unfortunately for propagation, we've got a
decent amount of hilly terrain up here in the Skylands region of New
Jersey in addition to this being the summer season with significant
foliage.<sup><a id="footnote-reference-3" href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
After setting up the radio, I had one more crucial component before we
could attempt the exchange… the antenna! I considered making one
from scratch, but eventually settled on the Arrow OSJ (open-stub
J-pole)<sup><a id="footnote-reference-4" href="#footnote-4">4</a></sup>. This antenna had excellent ratings and reviews for a
low cost. It's also sold as a dual band (2m and 70cm) if I ever
decided to take advantage of that capability. Originally, my plan was
to install the antenna in the attic (after performing all safety
calculations)<sup><a id="footnote-reference-5" href="#footnote-5">5</a></sup>. After thinking about it though, I noticed the old
satellite dish mounted on the roof which hadn't been touched since we
moved in and decided on that location instead. 
</p>
<p>
One motivation in selecting this antenna was its omni-directional
propagation<sup><a id="footnote-reference-6" href="#footnote-6">6</a></sup>. Despite the idea of using this radio to communicate
with one friend, I still held high high the importance of an
omni-directional station. As I was installing the OSJ antenna, I
realized that it's not a perfectly symmetrical design - should I
orient the driven element in the direction of desired propagation, or
the opposite? I decided that it was time for an electromagnetic
analysis! Of course, I had these thoughts while on the roof, and
mounted the antenna with my best guess.
</p>

<h2 id="headline-2">
Open-Stub J-Pole Analysis
</h2>
<p>
Once down from the roof, I began my analysis. There are some free
simulators out there that use the NEC<sup><a id="footnote-reference-7" href="#footnote-7">7</a></sup> on one end of the
(electromagnetic?)  spectrum. At the other end are the
enterprise-level RF design tools such as Microwave Office<sup><a id="footnote-reference-8" href="#footnote-8">8</a></sup>,
ADS<sup><a id="footnote-reference-9" href="#footnote-9">9</a></sup>, and Ansys<sup><a id="footnote-reference-10" href="#footnote-10">10</a></sup>. Did you know that it doesn't take a full
RF design software license to get a good idea of antenna performance?
Even just an SI/PI analysis suite such as Cadence Sigrity can get us
what we need. The Sigrity 3DEM license along with 3D Workbench<sup><a id="footnote-reference-11" href="#footnote-11">11</a></sup>
provides a perfect environment to quickly model arbitrary 3-D geometry
and determine parameters such as resonant frequency, VSWR/S11, and
far-field radiation patterns. It may not automatically give detailed
results such as efficiency or directivity but it's plenty to give an
idea of behavior and allows the designer an opportunity to modify a
design to meet any project requirements. 
</p>

            <p><em>Figure 3. OSJ model, UHF connector detail.</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
The antenna was simulated as if mounted to a 100" insulated pole. The
range of 100 MHz to 500 MHz was selected in order to ascertain
behavior in both the 2m and 70cm bands. The UHF connector<sup><a id="footnote-reference-12" href="#footnote-12">12</a></sup> was
originally modeled, but I realized that I didn't have accurate
dimensions of the SO-239 stud or coupling nut, and I wouldn't want to
introduce reflections which are not representative of the antenna
structure itself.
</p>
<h3 id="headline-3">
Results
</h3>
<p>
The results confirmed exactly what some reviews have stated:
performance is slightly worse in the 70cm band. S11 (converted to
VSWR) does indicate this, with a best-case SWR of 1.2 in the 70cm
band, and 1.1 in the 2m band.
</p>

            <p><em>Figure 5. OSJ VSWR.</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
One of the most interesting things about this analysis is that the
center frequency for both bands is quite a bit different from what is
reported. The Arrow SWR chart<sup><a id="footnote-reference-13" href="#footnote-13">13</a></sup> shows the 2m band coverage from
142-150 MHz and the 70cm from 430-453 MHz. Our analysis shows the 2m
band covering 136-142 MHz and the 70cm band covering 404-414 MHz -
both lower than expected. This should be confirmed with an antenna
analyzer, though one is not currently available to make the
measurement. Interesting to note - I'm not the first person to notice
these discrepancies when simulating against the instruction manual's
dimensions<sup><a id="footnote-reference-14" href="#footnote-14">14</a></sup>. I did make a point to measure the antenna and each
element was within 1/4" of the stated dimensions. That made me even
more eager to get an analyzer on it to test its actual response. At
that point, I tweaked the model to match measurements and ensure the
feed point is modeled correctly. For now though - the goal is simply
to determine propagation directionality which I'll analyze in the next
section.
</p>
<h4 id="headline-4">
Far Field Propagation
</h4>
<p>
Finally, we arrive at my ultimate goal - determining whether or not
propagation is truly omni-directional! The fastest way to check this
out is to look at the far field propagation plots. For reference,
Fig. 6 shows the orientation of the antenna in relation to the
axes. We are specifically looking for any directivity at all in the
antenna. All plots will indicate the frequency of interest, and every
plot was generated with a 1V source (13 dBm) and field strength is
simulated at a distance of 3m.
</p>
<figure>

            <p><em>Figure 6. Antenna orientation.</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
First, I'll present an isometric view of the propagation pattern. It's
important to note that the units are given in mV/m for the 3D plots,
but dBuV/m for the 2D plots to follow. This makes the magnitude of
variation seem greater in the 3D plots, but we can probe for specific
values on the 2D plots. (Click any of the propagation plots for a
larger view).
</p>
<figure><a href="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/ff_139m_iso.png">
    <img src="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/ff_139m_iso.png" alt="Figure 7. Far field, 139 MHz, isometric view." width="400"> </a><figcaption>
            <p><em>Figure 7. Far field, 139 MHz, isometric view.</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
The isometric view is the first indication that we aren't looking at
purely omni-directional propagation. As fun as the 3D views are to
look at, we can get the specific difference with a 2D plot.
</p>
<figure><a href="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/ff2d_139m_z.png">
    <img src="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/ff2d_139m_z.png" alt="Figure 7. Far field, 139 MHz, top-down cut on the XY-plane (Z=0)." width="400"> </a><figcaption>
            <p><em>Figure 7. Far field, 139 MHz, top-down cut on the XY-plane (Z=0).</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
As it turns out, there is a minor difference in propagation depending
on the angle ɸ. The maximum value at ɸ=180° is 114.4 dBuV/m,
and the minimum value at ɸ=0° is 112.4 dBuV/m. It would be nice
to represent this as a dBi difference. Using an online
calculator<sup><a id="footnote-reference-15" href="#footnote-15">15</a></sup> (they're always right of course!) we can determine
the gain of the antenna in dBi. In this case, we see a gain of 6.2 dBi
in the forward direction and 4.2 dBi in the backward direction for a 2
dB front-to-back ratio. Coincidentally, this was my guess while on the
roof and was the orientation I used while mounting the antenna. This
may not be extremely significant but it's worth knowing while mounting
the antenna.
</p>
<p>
Surprisingly, there's even more directivity at 70cm, although that
won't matter for me and my 2m-only radio. 
</p>
<figure><a href="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/ff_410m_z.png">
    <img src="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/ff_410m_z.png" alt="Figure 8. Far field, 410 MHz, top-down view." width="400"> </a><figcaption>
            <p><em>Figure 8. Far field, 410 MHz, top-down view.</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
The bottom-line answer to my original question is that if you really
need to squeak out every last bit of gain in a certain direction, then
you'd be better off mounting the J-pole with the driven element closer
to that desired direction.
</p>
<p>
One last thing - if anyone is looking at more simulations or
measurements, here's the Touchstone<sup><a id="footnote-reference-16" href="#footnote-16">16</a></sup> file for this simulation which can
be downloaded and compared. Let me know if you use it!

<h4 id="headline-5">
What about that QSO?
</h4>
<p>
As of publication my friend and I have yet to close the link on a
successful exchange. This could be due to any number of factors, but I
was able to make contact with another ham via a repeater located 30
miles from my QTH<sup><a id="footnote-reference-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup>, so the reasonable assumption is that the antenna
system on my roof is operating well.
</p>
<h2 id="headline-6">
PCB antenna
</h2>
<p>
While analysis of ham radio antennas is an interesting pursuit, it
caused me to stop and consider more practical applications of this
software. One thing that really struck me was the huge rise in IoT
devices using Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, NFC, and many other wireless
communication protocols. How can a designer be assured their antenna
will work as required? Sure, copying dimensions from datasheets or
other resources might be adequate but for optimal performance on the
first fab run, a simulation would be very helpful. As an example, I've
chosen a common antenna design and show how quick and easy it is to simulate
and validate prior to fabrication.
</p>
<h3 id="headline-7">
Antenna Selection
</h3>
<p>
Cypress has an excellent document<sup><a id="footnote-reference-17" href="#footnote-17">17</a></sup> describing antenna and RF
design. Even better, they have links to PCB designs of a few antennas
which can be adapted to a designer's board. I chose to import and
simulate their MIFA (Meandered Inverted-F Antenna).
</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/mifa_3d.png" alt="Figure 9. MIFA 3D view." width="400"> <figcaption>
            <p><em>Figure 9. MIFA 3D view.</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
Prior to beginning the simulation we must determine the PCB stackup
and materials used. Fortunately the linked design files include a
fabrication drawing which indicates a finished PCB thickness of
62mils. The material is listed as generic FR-4, so we'll use one of
the most common FR-4 materials available: Isola 370HR<sup><a id="footnote-reference-18" href="#footnote-18">18</a></sup>. 
</p>
<p>
Next, the board design must be imported into the simulation tool of
choice. In this case, I'll bring the .brd file into PowerSI 3D-EM in
order to tweak the stackup. From there, we'll save it as a .spd and
bring that into 3D Workbench.
</p>

<h3 id="headline-8">
Initial Simulation
</h3>
<p>
The first simulation shows that this board must have been designed
specifically for manual adjustment given the resonant frequency is 2.1
GHz (see Fig. 11 below). …</p></div></div>

    <p>The aim of this guide is to make you more comfortable with git without having to read a whole book.
I will do this by giving you more of an “inside tour” of the inner workings of git.</p>

<p>If you are curious and want to become more comfortable with git, this guide aims to satisfy your curiosity more than “traditional” git guides.</p>

<p>I hope you’ll learn enough here to use git with more confidence, and will know better where to look when you are stuck.</p>

<p>Git is a computer program that creates snapshots – essentially backups – of folders on your computer.
In git, these snapshots are called “commits”.
A commit contains everything in that folder:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The folder structure</li>
  <li>names of files</li>
  <li>contents of files</li>
  <li>metadata of files</li>
</ul>

<p>Git’s strengths come from how it organizes the commits and from all the commands it provides for manipulating, labelling, and comparing them.
Handling commits is what makes git a “Version Control System”.</p>

<p>Git tries to make it <em>very</em> easy to take backups so that you can always find a useful place to return to if needed. Also, having a detailed commit history can help answer questions about the state of things at different points in the past, and about why changes were made. Each commit has info about when it was created, and by whom, as well as a “commit message” written by the committer, which ideally contains important information about why it exists.</p>

<p>Git also has commands for collaborating with others (e.g. push/pull/fetch).
The collaboration essentially means exchanging commits and “branches” (which in git are just labels for commits).
Usually collaboration means sending them to a server where others can retrieve them, but it’s also possible to share them directly with other collaborators.<sup id="fnref:distributed"><a href="#fn:distributed">1</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="first-steps">First steps</h3>

<p>Download git: <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/">https://git-scm.com/download/</a></p>

<p>Git is usually used from the command line, but there are also other ways to use it (<code>git gui</code>, SourceTree, TortoiseGit to name a few.
<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis/">Here is a big list of graphical user interfaces for git</a>).</p>

<p>To download an existing repository (for example the one for this blog), run</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/oyvn/oyvn.github.io.git
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To create your own repository in an existing folder, run</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git init                      # Creates the repository
git add .                     # Prepares a commit of whatever was in
                              # the folder.
git commit -m"Initial commit" # Stores the commit with the message
                              # "Initial commit"
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="the-repository">The repository</h2>

<p>A “repository” (repo) is a collection of commits.
When you use <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-init"><code>git init</code></a> to create a repo inside a folder, git adds a hidden folder called “.git” inside it. The .git folder is where it puts all the commits.</p>

<p>The rest of your folder is now referred to as the “working directory”.</p>

<p>When you create a commit, git stores all the files and folders as “objects” in the .git folder.
Together, the stored objects contain all the information necessary to recreate the contents of the working directory.</p>

<p>When you retrieve a repo with <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone"><code>git clone</code></a>, git essentially retrieves the .git folder and recreates – “checks out” – the working directory from the objects.</p>

<p>There are a few different types of git objects, let’s take a closer look.</p>

<h2 id="the-objects---commit-tree-and-blob">The objects - commit, tree and blob</h2>

<p>In git, everything is files.
All objects are stored as files in the .git repo.
Objects have different types depending on what data they contain.
An object’s file name is usually a string of gibberish that serves as a unique reference to that object.</p>

<p>When you call <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit"><code>git commit</code></a>, git creates a “commit” object, as well as “tree” objects for each folder, and “blob” objects for each file in the snapshot.
The blob is the simplest, it’s just a copy of the file, except for the name, which is a gibberish reference instead.</p>

<p>If you look in <code>.git/objects</code> you will find all commit, tree, and blob objects in your repo, all with gibberish names.</p>

<p>By not associating objects with file or folder names, the object can be reused even if the name or location of a file or folder changes, as long as the contents remain unchanged.</p>

<p>A tree object contains:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The name and a reference for every immediate sub-folder. The reference is to a tree object describing the sub-folder’s contents.</li>
  <li>The name and a reference for every file in the folder. The reference is to a blob object with the file contents.</li>
</ul>

<p>A commit object contains:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The committer and author (That’s you, if you made the commit – your name and email address as configured via <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config"><code>git config</code></a>).</li>
  <li>The current date and time.</li>
  <li>The commit message that you authored in the process of committing.</li>
  <li>A reference to the tree object for the working directory.</li>
  <li>One or more references to other commit objects (“parent commits”).</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point I want you to notice a few things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each commit points to a parent.
This means the commit can be understood as building on something that came before it.</li>
  <li>Even though a commit is thought of as a <em>change</em>, or <em>difference</em> (also called a “delta”), it is stored by git as a standalone snapshot.
Any information about what change it represents is computed when needed, by comparing commits.</li>
  <li>Because objects are referred to by reference, any time an object already exists git just refers to the existing object.
So when your commit only changes one file, only one new blob object (and at least one tree object) needs to be created.</li>
  <li>Retrieving any object by its reference just means finding a file with a certain name.</li>
</ul>

<p>Objects are described in depth in the <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects">Git Internals</a> chapter of the free Pro Git Book.
I recommend it if you are curious, it’s where I learned this.</p>

<p>Now let’s take a closer look at the unique gibberish reference (“hash”).</p>

<h2 id="references-the-hash">References (the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">hash</a>”)</h2>
<p>This section might be heavy, but keep going, it gets to the heart of many of git’s quirks.</p>

<p>In git, there are hashes everywhere, displayed as long strings of numbers and letters.
All objects have hashes, but you mostly see commit hashes, for example when you run <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log"><code>git log</code></a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://oyvn.github.io/assets/git-log.png" alt="git log" title="git log output."></p>
<p>git log output from this blog’s repo.</p>

<p>The hash is calculated from the contents of a given object, and is  completely unique to that object.
It’s often called the “sha” of the commit, because the hash is of the type <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1">sha1</a>.</p>

<p>A hash (or “digest”) is a big number which always a certain length.
For sha1, the length is 160 bits, or 20 bytes<sup id="fnref:sha1_finite"><a href="#fn:sha1_finite">3</a></sup>.
In git, these bytes are always displayed as a text string of 40 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a> characters (0-9, a-f)<sup id="fnref:sha_length"><a href="#fn:sha_length">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The hash is created by taking the data (the input) and doing some convoluted math on it.
The input can be any data, of any length.
In git, objects serve as inputs.</p>

<p>The convoluted math is such that the hash follows some very strict rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The length of the hash is the same regardless of the length of the input.</li>
  <li>The hash is always the same every time if the input is the same.</li>
  <li>The hash is always <em>completely</em> different if the input is even <em>slightly</em> different, even if a single bit is changed, added or removed.</li>
  <li>Finding an input for a given hash (i.e. calculating the hash backwards) is impossible.</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code>sha1("a"):
    86f7e437faa5a7fce15d1ddcb9eaeaea377667b8
sha1("To die, to sleep - to sleep, perchance to dream - ay, there's the rub, for in this sleep of death what dreams may come"):
    0855319deffa58b0458c29edeaa8d6a120d44f35
sha1("to die, to sleep - to sleep, perchance to dream - ay, there's the rub, for in this sleep of death what dreams may come"):
    cab29b74b98c3ad638fe9c1abed72be40d69badc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Some example SHA1 hashes.</p>

<p>From these rules, we can realize that if <em>any</em> data in an object changes, it is no longer the same object, because the reference will be completely different.
That includes if the time changes by just one second in a commit, or a file changes by just one byte, or if a folder name changes slightly.</p>

<p>It also means that the changes must propagate.
If a file changes, its reference changes, so the tree containing the reference changes, and the commit containing the tree changes.</p>

<p>Any commits descended from the commit must also change.
In fact, looking backwards in time, a commit hash uniquely identifies not just the commit, but also, through its parents and grandparents etc., the entire git history - every tree, blob, and commit - up until that commit. If any detail in any place in the history was different, the current commit would not be the same commit since its hash would be different.</p>

<p>Phew!</p>

<p>Ok. Time for a short story about something slightly different.</p>

<h2 id="intermission-index">Intermission: Index</h2>

<p>When creating a commit, you might want to limit the difference from the previous commit.
You’ll want to group changes in a logical way, to make the commit easier to describe, and to reason about later.</p>

<p>You might have done many changes, though, since the last commit.
Git helps in this situation by allowing you to “stage” changes before commiting them.
<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add"><code>git add</code></a> adds files to the “index” i.e. stages them, i.e. marks them as “to be committed”.</p>

<p>When you create the commit, only the staged files and folders receive new objects, the rest are stored as unchanged.</p>

<p>Git creates trees and blobs from the files as you stage them, so that <code>git commit</code> just needs to create a commit object which references the tree created for the index.</p>

<p>The index often confuses people, but at this point in the guide it might be interesting to realize the similarities between the index and a commit.</p>

<p>Now for the story.</p>

<p>I once mistakenly deleted a new file I had been working on, losing several hours of work since I hadn’t committed it (commit often, people!).
But I remembered that I had staged it at one point, so I knew a blob object was created.
I managed to search the files in my .git folder for a phrase present in the lost file, and I found the file.
The blob …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>I got into a discussion about monads recently. On a search to find some resources to share, I realized that most essays explained them with type signatures and rules. A missing ingredient to grok them, I think, is to understand the intuition behind them. How could you end up <em>inventing</em> monads?</p><p>Okay, let’s try to build that intuition. We’ll avoid both types and category theory.</p><p>Say you have a few functions to get a user, a profile, and a display picture:</p><pre><code>function getUser(id) { 
  return USERS[id] 
}

function getProfile(user) { 
  return user.profile
}

function getDisplayPicture(profile) { 
  return profile.displayPicture
}</code></pre><p>Now, given an id, how would you get the profile picture?</p><p>You could write this: </p><pre><code>getDisplayPicture(getProfile(getUser(id)))</code></pre><p>Buut, this would throw an error: all these functions <em>could</em> return null. If <code>getUser</code> returned null for example, you would see: </p><pre><code>Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'profile' of undefined</code></pre><p>To fix this, you may end up writing something like this:</p><pre><code>function getDisplayPictureFromId(id) { 
  const user = getUser(id)
  if (!user) return
  const profile = getProfile(user)
  if (!profile) return
  return getDisplayPicture(profile)
}</code></pre><p>But, this is getting pretty ugly. All these conditional returns distract from what you’re really trying to do. <strong>What if there was a way to get rid of these conditionals?</strong></p><p>So, that’s our challenge: let’s get rid of these conditionals. One way we can do this, is to make some kind of helper. This helper would let us chain these functions together: </p><pre><code>new Chainer(getUser(id))
  .whenExists(user =&gt; getProfile(user))
  .whenExists(profile =&gt; getDisplayPicture(profile))</code></pre><p>This looks pretty good. Let’s implement it.</p><h2>whenExists</h2><p><code>.whenExists</code> would only run the callback if the value exists. Here’s how you could write this:</p><pre><code>class Chainer {
  constructor(v) { 
      this.value = v
  }
  whenExists(f) { 
      if (!this.value) return this;
      return new Chainer(f(this.value))
  }
}</code></pre><p>And voila, with just this, we can now write</p><pre><code>function getProfilePictureFromId(id) { 
  return new Chainer(getUser(id))
    .whenExists(user =&gt; getProfile(user))
    .whenExists(profile =&gt; getDisplayPicture(profile))
}</code></pre><h2>More Problems</h2><p>Notice that <code>getDisplayPictureFromId</code> now returns a <code>Chainer</code>. </p><p>Imagine we had another function <code>resizeDisplayPicture</code>, that <em>also</em> returned a Chainer</p><pre><code>function resizeDisplayPicture(pic) { 
    return new Chainer(pic).whenExists(pic =&gt; ...
}</code></pre><p>What would happen, if we wrote:</p><pre><code>getProfilePictureFromId(id).whenExists(pic =&gt; resizeDisplayPicture(pic))</code></pre><p>Let’s look at whenExists again:</p><pre><code>whenExists(f) { 
  if (!this.value) return this;
  return new Chainer(f(this.value))
}</code></pre><p>If <code>getProfilePictureFromId(id)</code> did exist, we would run </p><pre><code>new Chainer(f(this.value))</code></pre><p>which in this case is</p><pre><code>new Chainer(resizeDisplayPicture(this.value)) </code></pre><p>Which becomes </p><pre><code>new Chainer(new Chainer(this.value)...</code></pre><p><strong>Uh oh. We now have a Chainer inside of a Chainer.</strong> Ideally, we’d want a function that somehow “merged” these chainers together.</p><h2>whenExistsMerge</h2><p>So let’s do that. We can call it <code>whenExistsMerge</code></p><pre><code>class Chainer {
  constructor(v) { 
      this.value = v
  }
  whenExists(f) { 
      if (!this.value) return this;
      return new Chainer(f(this.value))
  }
  whenExistsMerge(f) { 
      if (!this.value) return this;
      return f(this.value)
  }
}</code></pre><p>And with that, we can write </p><pre><code>getProfilePictureFromId(id)
  .whenExistsMerge(pic =&gt; resizeDisplayPicture(pic))
  .whenExists(resizedPic =&gt; ...)</code></pre><p><strong>Aand voila, you’ve just invented a specific type of monad.</strong> Kind of (1). Chainer is analogous to the <code>Maybe</code> monad. <code>whenExists</code> is analogous to its <code>fmap</code> operation, and <code>whenExistsMerge</code> is analogous to its <code>bind</code> operation. If you’re curious about the type-based technicalities now, <a href="http://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html" target="_blank">see this essay</a>. </p><p>So, now we’ve found this cool <code>Chainer</code>. We can stop here, or think a bit further. What’s so special about it? </p><p>Well, it’s like a box that wraps around some information. We can interact with that box with  <code>whenExists</code> and <code>whenExistsMerge</code>.</p><p>How else can we use the idea of <code>box</code> and <code>whenExists?</code></p><p>Here’s one. Let’s say you were dealing with callback hell: </p><pre><code>fetchUser(id, (err, user) =&gt; {
  if (err) ... 
    fetchProfile(profile, (err, profile) =&gt; { 
      if (err) ...
        fetchDisplayPicture(...
    }
}</code></pre><p>What if we created something like an <code>Async Chainer</code>: it stores the result of some future computation. Then, you could use the <code>whenExists*</code> functions, which let you interact with the value <em>when</em> it is computed. We turn the callback hell into</p><pre><code> fetchUser(id).whenExistsMerge(fetchProfile).whenExistsMerge(fetchDisplayPicture)</code></pre><p>Well, replace <code>whenExistsMerge</code> with <code>then</code>, and you're on a road to discover <code>Promise</code>, which is also a monad. Kind of (2). </p><p>Now, it’s pretty cool to notice that both the nullable use case and the async use case have the same interface. The name <code>whenExists</code> may be a bit too specific. Really, what it does is give you an interface to <code>map</code> over the value. If you use the word <code>map</code>, <code>whenExistsMerge</code> really lets you <code>flatMap</code> over the value. </p><p>This begins to get us to the fundamental abstraction of a monad: a box, with an interface for <code>map</code>, and <code>flatMap</code>. As you look deeper, you’ll notice that this abstraction can handle a lot of other things. If you’re curious, research the <code>Result</code> monad for example.</p><p>And with that, you’ve invented monads : ) </p><h2>Aside: Do you <em>really</em> need this?</h2><p>As you went through this, you may have realized that there are other ways to solve the problems that monads solve. Instead of <code>Chainer</code>, your language could have a <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html#safe-calls" target="_blank">safe call</a> abstraction. Instead of <code>Promise</code>, your language could have an <code>async/await</code> abstraction. Sometimes those can be a better <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5WdGrpoug" target="_blank">better choice</a>. Nevertheless, if your language doesn’t have those abstractions, you can use monads to solve them. And of course, like any powerful abstraction, you can invent new monads to simplify your business logic.</p><hr><p>(1) I cheated a bit with <code>Chainer</code>, by avoiding the subtypes <code>Just</code> and <code>Nothing</code>. This makes it so you can’t express something like <code>Just(null)</code>. Still, it gets at the essence : ) </p><p>(2) Likewise, <code>Promise</code> isn’t quite a monad, because it mixes both <code>flatMap</code> and <code>map</code> with <code>then</code>. This makes it so you can’t have a <code>Promise&lt;Promise&lt;Res&gt;&gt;</code>. Again though, it gets at the essence</p><p><em>Thanks to Joe Averbukh, Mark Shlick, Daniel Woelfel, Irakli Safareli, Jacky Wang for reviewing drafts of this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>The term JAMStack is meant to define a technology stack that relies heavily on JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. It also is meant to mean a whole lot more than that. In this article, we will explore how this concept is being expressed on the web.</p>
<p>
<span>J</span>avaScript<br>
<span>A</span>PIs<br>
<span>M</span>arkup<br>
<span>Stack</span><br>
</p><p>You may be thinking to yourself, JavaScript, microservices exposed via APIs, and of course markup make up most websites these days. How is JAMStack not just describing the web in 2020? When you google "JAMStack" you may see an ad for a <a href="https://jamstack.io/">portable electric apm</a>, but you will also see a result for <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMStack.org</a>. JAMStack.org is a nice resource that the folks over at <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> have created in order to help codify a set of standards around an emerging trend in how websites can be built. Let's begin with the first definition listed on JAMStack.org</p>
<p>
        <span>“</span>
        Fast and secure sites and apps delivered by pre-rendering files and serving them directly from a CDN, removing the requirement to manage or run web servers.
    </p>

<p>This statement does not do a great job of picking apart the JAM in JAMStack but does do a good job of leading with some value propositions, techniques, and specific technologies that are hallmarks of JAMStack. Let's pick this apart 2005 style with a tag cloud.</p>
<p><span>Fast</span>
    <span>CDN</span>
    <span>Secure</span>
    <span>Pre-rendering</span>
    <span>No servers</span>
    <span>Sites</span>
    <span>Apps</span>
</p>

<p>I have given what I believe to be the proper weight to each of these key words that help make up JAMStack, but before we dig into them, let's start from the beginning of sorts. Here is <a href="https://simple-jamstack.netlify.app/">an exmaple of a JAMStack site</a>.</p>


<p>This site simply takes the last 5 movie picks from the <a href="https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/movie-reviews-api/1/overview">NYTimes Movies API</a>, renders them and adds an ability to vote on which films seem interesting and uninteresting via the <a href="https://formcake.com/api">Formcake API</a>. You could build this project in any number of stacks, but what makes this a JAMStack site? You can follow along in more detail using the public <a href="https://github.com/Formcake/simple-jamstack">repo</a>. Below we will go into some of these key aspects around JAMStack in more detail.</p>
<h2 id="pre-rending">Pre-rending</h2>
<p>One of the most important and talked about aspects of JAMStack is that projects are depoyed as static builds. It is a bit of a debate within the community on whether something must be statically built and hosted to be JAMStack but most JAMStack specific tooling is built around the idea of static builds. For those who are unfamiliar with this term, a static build simply means that a site or app is entirely or partially generated as flat files for serving. Those flat files are then returned to the user upon request as opposed to a server rendering them. The project could also be decribed as "Pre-rendered" since some or all of the site has been build ahead of time. When a change occurs to the content of a JAMStack site, you must rebuild it and serve the new flat files. A slice of a review website's static file structure may look like the following.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Url</th>
<th>Static File</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>/</td>
<td>index.html</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>/movies</td>
<td>/movies/index.html</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>/movies/reviews</td>
<td>/movies/reviews/index.html</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>/movies/reviews/tenet</td>
<td>/movies/reviews/tenet/index.html</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<pre><code>
index.html
movies/
    index.html
    reviews/
        index.html
        tenet/
            index.html

</code></pre>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Formcake/simple-jamstack">sample movie interest project</a> utilizes pre-rendering with the help of <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>. Eleventy is a fantastic way to get started with static sites because it is extremely flexible and can grow with your project.</p>
<h2 id="no-servers">No Servers</h2>
<p>Like the term serverless, this is a bit of a misnomer. Of course JAMStack sites are served by a server. The preferred server stack however is one that is specifically designed to only deliver static files like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">AWS S3</a>. There are many benefits to be gained from taking this approach. One of those is stability. When you choose a system like S3 to host your website, you are making many concessions. You have no control over the operating system, the software installed on the server, or even the choice of http server technology. The benefit however is that none of those are of any concern when you are doing something as simple as serving a static file. All of those decisions and layers of complexity are manged and run at enourmous levels at scale by AWS. This makes it very unlikely that your site will go down because those layers of complexity can be highly optimized when used for one purpose. The sample project does not use a custom server because it is hosted on Netlify. Netlify is designed around hosting static files and therefore is highly optimized for this purpose.</p>
<h2 id="cdn">CDN</h2>
<p>The next layer of hosting for a JAMStack site is the use of a CDN. A CDN, or content delivery network, is a way of storing snapshots of the pages of your website and distributing those around the world. When a user requests a page your CDN will deliver a cache or vesion of that page instead of your main server. The main benefit of a CDN is that it is the <strong>fastest</strong> way to deliver content and the most <strong>secure</strong> way as well. CDN's can obscure your main server from the world and help protect it from malicious traffic or activity. The sample project utilizes a CDN because it is hosted on Netlify and <a href="https://www.netlify.com/products/edge/">Netlify uses a CDN</a> to deliver deployed content.</p>
<h2 id="apis">APIs</h2>
<p>You may think that most websites are run via APIs these days and so why point this out. For JAMStack the importance on APIs centers around the fact that by default a JAMStack project does not have a web server to ping for data since a static hosting server is the only implied server in the stack. Many sites and most apps however need a server of some kind to create interactivity and store / access data. In the JAMStack world, it is encouraged that you either find a service with an API that performs an aspect that a server would or create a microservice using lambdas to still be as "serverless" as possible. Hosting platforms like <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> and <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> both support server like features using lambda functions. In the example application, I kept it simple and used Formcake's API to handle all server side features.</p>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/blog-posts/nytimes-form.png" alt="Creating your token in Formcake"></p>
<p>Formcake allows a form submission through an ajax request and so it was easy to utilize this functionality to allow users to vote on movie picks.</p>
<pre><code>
axios.post('https://api.formcake.com/api/form/4e656bac-5c16-4d5d-be65-eb2928be0179/submission', {
    vote, 
    movieTitle
});

</code></pre>

<p>I could have gone to the trouble of creating a lambda based micro service for the voting mechanic but for simple projects it is far easier to use something off the shelf. This is also part of the JAMStack ethos in a way. It's all about what is possible when you fully decouple the front and backend.</p>
<h2 id="sites-and-apps">Sites and Apps?</h2>
<p>JAMStack.org mentions that JAMStack can be used for both websites and web applications. I agree with this sentiment but I also think that JAMStack is not perfectly suited for many types of applications. If you were to signup for <a href="https://formcake.com/pricing">Formcake's free plan</a> you would notice that most pages load like a server side rendered application. If you go to your /forms page, you will instantly be greeted with your forms. The same is true for an individual form detail page and your account page. This is because we utilize <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">server side rendering technology</a> in order to deliver our site. We feel this to be a requirement for a SaaS application in 2020 because we are beyond the days of having loading wheels for every component on a single page application. It is a bit of an argument in the JAMStack community on whether an SSR application is a JAMStack project. I don't necessarily care because we should all be choosing the best technology for our projects but I feel that it is worth pointing out. This distinction makes JAMStack better suited for static content or sites with light interactivity in my opinion.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope this explanation of JAMStack is helpful to those looking to explore it. It has never been easier to create a powerful website with the pricipals behind JAMStack thanks to hosting platforms like <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> and tools like <a href="https://formcake.com/">Formcake</a>. As always, if you feel that your project could benefit from JAMStack but does not quite meet the requirements, simply take from JAMStack what improves the project and leave behind what detracts from it. This is how we built Formcake and we are very pleased with the results.</p>

<!-- Horizontal Top Article -->
<p>You haven’t quite figured out HTTP2 yet that you’re already starting to get pissed off by people talking about HTTP3. But there’s a reason for that: HTTP3 is fast. I bet you in five minutes you’ll agree with me. </p>



<h3>Once upon a time</h3>



<p>I can’t tell you about the future without telling you about the present. <strong>Do you know about HTTP ?</strong> Defined in 1991, it’s the protocol that manages the web. It means <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HyperText Transfer Protocol</a> and it allows you to fetch resources from a web page. </p>



<p>From a web server to your browser. It’s built on a lower level protocol –<strong>TCP: it’s going to be important-</strong> and it’s stateless. It means that each request is completely independent. Each GIF present on this page is a GIF proudly independent in its life on the internet. That’s good for him and his life as a GIF. But for us it’s a bit of a broken system.</p>



<p>Because the problem is that <strong>each request will only look for one file at a time</strong>. Each time an expensive TCP connection is created for the occasion. Imagine if you had 10,000 Internet tips on your page.</p>



<p> I know a lot of people absolutely loved my pattern making skills in the previous article. So, to explain the Internets to you properly, I’m doing it again.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/iI0MrHF.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/iI0MrHF.jpg" alt="http"></figure></div>



<p>Despite the fact that a browser can make six different requests at the same time, HTTP is still slow and full of TCP connections. Plus, we developers, usualy don’t care about that. <strong>We like to put as much crap on our pages as possible. </strong>Big jQuery lib with 300 useless CSS stylesheets ending with a big transparent 8 mega PNG. </p>



<p>When Google saw all the crap we were doing everywhere <strong>they started talking about SPDY</strong> (it’s called speedy). The point? To speed up the Internets. </p>



<p>SPDY is a specification that proposes to use HTTP as is but with a change of rules. And by <strong>compressing headers, prioritizing requests and multiplexing</strong>, it will transform all TCP requests and connections into one! </p>



<p>Concretely, when your HTML is read, your browser looks at everything you’re going to ask in your page. Then, it’s getting everything all at once. <strong>This way you avoid doing it file by file.</strong> </p>



<p>The first draft of HTTP2 is SPDY based. Very quickly HTTP2 was adopted and life on the internet has become faster. <strong>Today <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ce-http2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">42.7% of the internet</a> use HTTP2.</strong></p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2jePyHC.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/2jePyHC.jpg" alt="http2"></figure></div>



<h3>Great, what about HTTP3?</h3>



<p>If I piss you off with HTTP and HTTP2 when you explicitly clicked to see sexy HTTP3, there’s a good reason. HTTP2 was created by taking HTTP as a base and changing the rules.<strong> It’s the same thing with HTTP3. </strong>So by understanding the present it’s easier for me to explain the future to you.</p>



<p>Googlers are geeks, they never stop. After SPDY became HTTP2, they thought that it was still not fast enough. So they started talking about QUIC (it’s called Quick). <strong>This will be the second experimental technology developed by Google to become an official upgrade of the HTTP protocol</strong>. But what’s so special about this protocol?</p>



<p>The main big evolution of HTTP3 is the change of transport layer. No more of the heavy TCP connections I’ve been telling you about since the beginning. <strong>Now, it’s all about UDP. </strong></p>



<p>By the way QUIC means “Quick UDP Internet Connections”. This change of protocol will speed up connection establishment and data transfer times enormously. Howerver, <strong>UDP is certainly faster and simpler, but it doesn’t have the reliability and error handling of TCP.</strong></p>



<p>TCP has to make several round trips just to establish a connection in a square and stable way. <strong>Where UDP doesn’t give a damn and does it really fast without stability and risk of lost packets. </strong>However UDP can dramatically reduce latency in requests. Up to almost zero latency in repeated connections to the same server because no roundtrip is made to establish connections.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/hDmNkpS.png" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/hDmNkpS.png" alt="http3"></figure>



<p>HTTP3 is the multiplexing and compression features of HTTP2 with a protocol change from TCP to UDP. The Google guys then added their layer in the protocol to guarantee stability, order in the reception of packets and of course security. </p>



<p><strong>So HTTP3 uses UDP for its high speed while keeping the stability of QUIC</strong>, without forgetting the security of TLS. Because yes, in QUIC you find TLS 1.3 which allows you to make your beautiful SSL. I’ve been talking about layers for a while, this is what it looks like under the hood.</p>

<p>In 2018, QUIC became HTTP3. The Internet Enginerring Task Force dudes, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVf_yyMfIPQ&amp;t=4956" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>dudes in shorts who decide on Internet protocols</strong></a>, have agreed. And that’s great news because the Internets will never be fast enough for us, impatient people.</p>



<h3>Epilogue</h3>



<p>HTTP3 is the sexy future with a HTTP base that has been tuned to the maximum by google geeks. At the time of writing, <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ce-quic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only 4.6% of the Internet uses HTTP3</a> but this figure is likely to grow in the coming years. We stayed on the surface today, but there are a lot of deep-dive articles everywhere that I invite you to consult if you’re more curious.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>By Leib Litman, PhD, Zohn Rosen, PhD, Cheskie Rosenzweig, MS, Aaron Moss, PhD, Adam Dietrich, &amp; Jonathan Robinson, PhD</strong></p><h2><strong>Background</strong></h2><p>Lately, there’s been considerable debate over the accuracy of presidential polls. While recent polls show Joe Biden ahead,&nbsp;a number of pundits speculate that some Donald Trump supporters may be hesitant to share their true opinions when polled by phone. That hypothesis is gaining traction, leading some to argue that Trump may be leading despite what the latest numbers show. It’s also being fueled by the belief that 2020 will be a repeat of the 2016 election, when Trump polled poorly in advance of the election, but still went on to win the Electoral College vote.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the current debate on whether there are segments of Trump (or Biden) backers reticent to express their true opinions in phone polls, there’s been little empirical investigation into if the phenomenon actually exists. Pundits on major broadcast and cable news networks, such as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/does-a-shy-trump-voter-exist-arnon-mishkin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fox News</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/09/politics/trump-voters-analysis/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNN</a>, continue to speculate on the potential impact of so-called “shy Trump voters” on the outcome of the November presidential election result.&nbsp; In a recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/16/us/politics/trump-polls.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a> published in <em>The New York Times</em>, David Winston says the following:&nbsp;</p><p><em>“The idea that people lie, it’s an interesting theory, and it’s not like it’s completely off-the-wall. But it’s obviously a very complicated thing to try to prove because what do you do? Ask them, ‘Are you lying?’”</em></p><p>On its face, a poll that asks people whether they lie in phone polls may not make much&nbsp;sense. After all, why would a person who lies in a telephone poll tell the truth about that in a different online poll? We here at CloudResearch reasoned that the issue may be methodological.</p><p>To explore this issue, we structured our survey to overcome shortcomings of previous polls. Instead of simply asking voters whom they will vote for — and then ask whether they just lied — we centered our research around a general question: “Are you comfortable in truthfully disclosing the presidential candidate you intend to vote for in a telephone poll?” Our rationale for this approach was that there’s a major difference between admitting you just lied and admitting to being genuinely concerned about disclosing your preferred candidate.&nbsp;</p><p>For the most part, we expected to find very few “shy voters.” After all, telephone surveys are supposed to be anonymous, so why would people be reluctant to share their opinions? However, to the extent people said that they were reluctant to express their voting preferences on a telephone poll, we were interested in their rationale for their reluctance. As a result, we included open-ended follow-up questions to better understand the factors that drive voters to fudge their responses.</p><hr><h2><strong>What CloudResearch Found</strong></h2><ul><li>11.7% of Republicans say they would not report their true opinions about their preferred presidential candidate on telephone polls.&nbsp;</li><li>In contrast, just 5.4% of Democrats say they’d be reluctant to share their true voting intentions — roughly half the number of Republicans reluctant to tell the truth on phone polls.&nbsp;</li><li>10.5% of Independents fell into the “shy voter” category, just a percentage point lower than how Republicans react to phone polls.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>After asking about people expressing their true opinions on telephone calls, we then inquired about their preferred candidate. This ordering was important as we did not want to fall into the same trap as other pollsters who tend to lead with preference declarations. When we broke the responses down based on current Trump vs Biden supporters, we found the following:</p><ul><li>10.1% of Trump supporters said they were likely to be untruthful on phone surveys — double the number of Biden supporters (5.1%) reticent to share their true intentions.</li></ul><p>When respondents indicated that they were untruthful during polls, we followed up to confirm those responses, and then inquired as to why “shy voters” are concerned about sharing their voting intentions. Some example responses are below. These are just a representational sampling of viewpoints that we collected — sentiments not easy to gauge by responses to mere yes/no questions.&nbsp;</p><p><em>“I don’t believe the information would be confidential and I think it’s dangerous to express an opinion outside of the current liberal viewpoint.”</em></p><p><em>“Well I probably wouldn’t give my opinion period, but if pushed, I would not give my real opinion for fear of reprisal if someone found out.”</em></p><p><em>“Because most polls released to the public are slanted and aren’t scientifically based. So, they are messing with the results of the survey from the beginning by knocking down one party or the other. I’m just trying to right the ship.”</em></p><p><em>“I am hounded day and evening by phone solicitors.&nbsp; They interrupt me all the time; sometimes my irritation takes over, and I don’t answer correctly.”</em></p><p><em>“My answers could be recorded so I don’t really trust such phone conversations.”</em></p><p><em>“I do not discuss politics — let alone with a total stranger on the telephone.”</em></p><p><em>“I don’t always trust phone call surveys. I wouldn’t want to be bombarded with phone calls and political mail.”</em></p><p><em>“I don’t want my opinion associated with my phone number.”</em></p><p><em>“I am less anonymous, and somewhat ashamed of my opinion as it is frowned upon.”</em></p><hr><h2>In General, “Shy Voters” Cited Six Concerns:&nbsp;</h2><p>1. A lack of trust in phone polls as truly being anonymous.&nbsp;</p><p>2. An apprehension to associate their phone numbers with recorded responses.</p><p>3. Fear that their responses will become public in some manner.</p><p>4. Fear of reprisal and related detrimental impact to their financial, social, and family lives should their political opinions become publicly known.&nbsp;</p><p>5. A general dislike of phone polls.&nbsp;</p><p>6. Malicious intent to mislead polls due to general distrust of media and political pundits (though a sentiment expressed only by a few “shy voters”).&nbsp;</p><p>Such concerns were more often than not expressed by Republicans and Independents, and also by those who said they would vote for Donald Trump. Democrats and Biden supporters lagged both groups in terms of being concerned that their voting intentions would be shared with others.&nbsp;</p><p>However, our survey findings — that show a greater reluctance on the part of Republicans, Independents and Trump voters to disclose their opinions — should not be interpreted as outright lying. Rather, such reluctance seems to stem from a&nbsp; lack of trust in the anonymity of polls and a fear of the consequences if their opinions were to become public.&nbsp;</p><p>The results could have implications in terms of the true accuracy of phone polls; if Republicans, Independents and supporters of Donald Trump (regardless of party affiliation) are less likely to participate in polls or accurately disclose the candidate they support, that inherently generates biased poll outcomes.</p><p>Given razor thin-margins in the swing states, such bias may have important consequences, although more research is required to fully understand the potential magnitude of this effect. We intend to examine the magnitude of “shy-voter bias” in specific states like Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin over the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>The results of our survey also illustrate the primary concerns that pollsters may need to address to allay voters about the level of anonymity and privacy of phone polling. We’ll also examine these issues and potential remedies in future research.</p><hr><h2><strong>Methodology</strong></h2><h3><strong>Sample&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Interviews were collected from two national online sample waves of 1,000 registered voters (2000 respondents in total), matched to U.S. Census data on gender, age, race, and region. Data were collected August 19 – 27, 2020&nbsp;using&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cloudresearch.com%2Fproducts%2Fprime-panels%2F" rel="noreferrer noopener">CloudResearch’s Prime Panels</a>, a platform that incorporates data quality checks in sample recruitment and sources participants from an aggregate of market research panels (<a target="_blank" href="https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.3758%2Fs13428-019-01273-7" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chandler et al., 2019</a>). The two waves differed from each other in terms of how quotas were set. In the first sample, the full sample was matched to the U.S. Census and the sample was equally split between Republicans, Democrats and Independents. In the second wave, rather than matching the entire sample to the U.S. Census, each political party was matched to the demographic quotas appropriate for that party. The results presented above are for the first wave of participants, although the overall findings were similar across both waves. Specifically, in Wave 2, 10.5% of Trump supporters said they were likely to be untruthful on phone surveys compared to 4.6% of Biden supporters.</p><h3><strong>Survey Design&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Prior to entering the survey, all respondents were screened for attentiveness and English language comprehension. Following the screening process a <em>responsive verification protocol</em> was used, consisting of multiple interactive interview steps. Step 1 – Respondents were first asked one of two randomly assigned questions: Q1 – “Given today’s charged political environment, if you were asked in an automated telephone poll (also called “Interactive Voice Response” or “IVR”), would you give your true opinion about which presidential candidate you are likely to vote for?”. Q2 – “Given today’s charged political environment, if you were asked by a telephone interviewer, would you give your true opinion about which presidential candidate you are likely to vote for?”. We also wanted to compare how comfortable respondents are in responding to telephone polls, compared to online and in-person polls. We therefore also asked the same question about phone interviews, online surveys, and in-person polls, presented next to each other in the same grid. The response options to all questions were: 1. “I would definitely express my true opinion”, 2. “I would probably express my true opinion”, 3. “I would probably not express my true opinion” and 4. “I would definitely not express my true opinion”.</p><p>Step 2 – For those who indicated that they would not provide their true opinion on either question from Step 1 (i.e. responded with options 3 or 4), a follow-up question was asked: “On a previous question, you indicated that you …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>Whenever someone sees my editor, this is always the first thing they ask
about.</p>

<p>Vim (and Emacs) have features that let you conceal text with other text.
The actual source text is not modified. If you put your cursor on the
concealed line, the conceal goes away.</p>

<p>This is best illustrated by example. Here’s what the Python code
normally looks like:</p>

<pre><code>identity = lambda x: x
</code></pre>

<p>But here’s what I see:</p>

<pre><code>identity = λ x: x
</code></pre>

<p>It’s really easy to abuse since no one has to view it but you, unlike
code formatting. I ended up creating an entire mini-language, consistent
across multiple programming languages.</p>

<p>The running examples throughout this blog post will be Python and Rust,
because I’ve used those recently. Haskell is another language that
benefits a lot from this.</p>

<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>By relieving the brain of all unnecessary work, a good notation sets
it free to concentrate on more advanced problems, and in effect
increases the mental power of the race.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we start by unifying the building blocks of every language with
prettier Unicode versions.</p>

<pre><code>==          | ≝
!=          | ≠
&lt;=          | ≤
&gt;=          | ≥

and, &amp;&amp;     | ∧
or, ||      | ∨
not, !      | ¬

None        | ∅
true, false | ⊤, ⊥ (top and bottom from logic)

for         | ∀
in          | ∈
not in      | ∉

=           | ← (to remind me that equality is really assignment)
-&gt;          | → (that's an arrow replaced by a better arrow)

assert      | ‼
</code></pre>

<p>Types are concealed with their math symbols</p>

<pre><code>bool        | 𝔹
char        | ∁
string, str | 𝐒

unsigned    | ℕ
int         | ℤ
float       | ℝ
complex     | ℂ

vector      | V
tensor      | 𝕋
</code></pre>

<p>This is nice because it makes reading code uniform across languages.
Basic constructs like <code>for .. in ..</code> read like math.</p>

<h2 id="idiosyncratic">Idiosyncratic</h2>

<p>Most of this category is for making ugly syntax bearable.</p>

<p>I read a lot of scientific code and Greek letters as variable names
abound.</p>

<p>So I concealed the entire Greek alphabet, lower and uppercase.</p>

<p>I also don’t like looking at <code>::</code> in C++ and Rust. Conceptually, it’s
like a dot operator for the purposes of reading code, so I conceal it
with <code>.</code>.</p>

<p>I also don’t like looking at semicolons, and my linter will tell me if I
missed them, so they get concealed with <code>𐤟</code> (which is apparently a
Phoenician word separator. It should look like a very faint dot, but may
not render correctly in the browser. You can see I’ve scoured a lot of
glyphs for this).</p>

<p>I hate the use of <code>self</code> in Python, so I concealed it with <code>♀</code>, the
female sign emoji. It looks like a little person (a little <em>self</em>), and
is a single character.</p>

<p>If I’m going to see a word a lot in a lot of contexts, it’s probably
going to end up concealed.</p>

<h3 id="grammar-of-control-flow">Grammar of control flow</h3>

<p>I have a system for conditionals and looping.</p>

<pre><code>loop              | ∞ (`loop` is just `while True`)
while             | ⥁
continue          | ↻

match, if         | ▸
elif              | ▹
else              | ▪

break             | ◁
return            | ◀


def, fn, function | ※ (Japanese typography reference marker)
class             | §
</code></pre>

<p>The infinity and ouroboros symbols for <code>loop</code> and <code>while</code> feel
intuitive.</p>

<p>The rest, not so much. I worked up this system late at night.</p>

<p><code>continue</code> is a loop because it doesn’t break out of the loop (that’s
why it loops clockwise since I always imagine looping going clockwise).
It’s a broken ouroboros because it cuts off the current iteration.</p>

<p>The conditionals always start with an <code>if</code>, which is filled in, and just
gets a pointer to indicate, “hey look at this condition”. Conditions
have to end with an <code>if</code> or an <code>else</code>, but not an <code>elif</code>, so <code>elif</code> gets
an empty pointer. <code>else</code> is indicated by the mathematical “end of proof”
symbol, since the <code>else</code> ends the conditional. In this way, a
conditional is only valid if it begins and ends with solid markers.</p>

<p><code>return</code> takes you out of a function’s scope, and I think of going in
scope as going rightwards, so <code>return</code> points left. Plus the right
pointer was taken by <code>if</code>. <code>break</code> is similar but may not take you out
of <em>all</em> scopes, just the innermost loop enclosing it.</p>

<p>I think the <code>function</code> conceal is pretty clear. The <code>class</code> conceal is
because I think of classes like I think of sections in an essay, so they
get a section marker.</p>

<h2 id="really-idiosyncratic">Really Idiosyncratic</h2>

<p>AKA mathy.</p>

<pre><code>range  | ι
unsafe | ☡

struct | ∏
enum   | ∐
</code></pre>

<p>The iota is because that’s the one bit of APL I know.</p>

<p><code>unsafe</code> comes from the “dangerous bend” symbol that Bourbaki used to
indicate a tricky section in their books. That concession to
user-friendliness ironically concealed a dangerous bend. Which was the
fact that Bourbaki books don’t care about anyone being able to read
them.</p>

<p><code>struct</code> and <code>enum</code> are product and sum (AKA coproduct) types, so they
get the corresponding symbols from category theory.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>It lets me <em>feel</em> my code rather than read it. It makes seeing the
<em>shape</em> of code easier at first pass, and I can see the forest for the
trees somewhat better. But then I have to hunker down and edit it.</p>

<h2 id="important">Important</h2>

<pre><code>function! ToggleConcealLevel()
    if &amp;conceallevel == 0
        setlocal conceallevel=2
    else
        setlocal conceallevel=0
    endif
endfunction

nnoremap &lt;silent&gt; &lt;C-c&gt;&lt;C-y&gt; :call ToggleConcealLevel()&lt;CR&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That toggles the conceal. Now other people can read over your shoulder.
It’ll also spare you explanations of how you got the <code>for</code> to look like
it does in math.</p>

<h2 id="screenshot">Screenshot</h2>

<p>(Since so many of you asked)</p>

<p>In April 2012, three college juniors — Felwa, Tasnim, and Najla — waited anxiously on the campus of Prince Sultan University in Riyadh. For the previous six months, their lives had been consumed by the pursuit of a single, radical idea: frustrated that women, year after year, were barred from the annual Gamers’ Day convention, <a href="http://gamersday.com/en/about-us.php#:~:text=Gamers'%20Day%20is%20a%20gaming,numbers%20of%20visitors%20and%20exhibitors">the largest annual gaming convention in Saudi Arabia</a>, they had decided to launch the first-ever gamers’ convention for women in the kingdom. As the organizers hurried around counting consoles and hanging posters near stalls, they wondered whether anyone would show up.</p>



<p>Over the past decade, Saudi Arabia’s gaming scene has dramatically evolved, especially for women. In the early 2000s, the country had strict moral regulations on entertainment, and games were mostly sold in a gray market or through unofficial channels. Areej, a 23-year-old university graduate, picked up her interest in gaming from her father, who once frequented the informal neighborhood stores that sold pirated copies of popular games for 10 riyals ($2). “He played Japanese and English games, even though he didn’t even understand English back then,” she recalled. “He would keep dictionaries around while playing. That’s actually how he learned the language.” Areej hopes to become a “localizer,” a job that entails translating English-language games into Arabic. A decade ago, this wouldn’t have been possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After Sony’s 2007 release of the PlayStation 3 in the kingdom, the gaming industry began to take shape in Saudi Arabia. The first <a href="https://www.gamersday.com/en/">Gamers’ Day</a> took place in 2008, and it now draws upward of 60,000 male visitors over the course of four days. The convention presents video game companies with a lucrative opportunity to demo their latest equipment and products; devoted players, in turn, get to try out highly anticipated games that have not yet been released. In 2012, as the three girls were setting up Girls Con (or GCON as it would come to be known), the industry was estimated to have a global revenue stream of $70 billion.</p>



<p>In the months prior to GCON, Tasnim, the only one in the group with work experience, took the lead pitching sponsorship proposals to the all-male staffs at Nintendo and PlayStation Arabia. Without any real data on female gamers in the Middle East, and with barely any on girl gamers in North America, she had pitched on the assumption that the <a href="https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/male-and-female-gamers-how-their-similarities-and-differences-shape-the-games-market/">gender ratio for gamers in Saudi Arabia</a> was likely the same as in the United States: 47%. But there was no way to prove this. Until then, the world of female gaming in Saudi Arabia was a private one, usually set in the intimacy of people’s bedrooms.</p>



<p>“You could find girls who played video games, just for fun or on their mobile phone, but I had no idea how many girls were into hardcore gaming,” Felwa said. While mobile games like Angry Birds and Candy Crush were popular — the Kingdom boasts a <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/xe/Documents/technology-media-telecommunications/GMCS-whitepaper.pdf">90% cell phone penetration rate</a> — Felwa was curious to see how many girls had grown up like her playing Tomb Raider, Tekken, and League of Legends.</p>



<p>When the hall flooded with nearly 3,000 women, some as young as 13 and others in their 50s, it was a shock. “I definitely did not expect moms to come,” Felwa said. Back then, it was mandatory for women to wear the traditional black abaya, and often a headscarf, while in public. It was only when the women walked through the doors into the all-female space that their abayas slipped off to reveal an array of cosplay costumes.</p>



<p>Inside the hallway, girls who were expected to behave discreetly at all times rushed around trying to play as many PlayStation- and Nintendo-sponsored games as they could. On one side of the hall, first-time cosplayers shared a rare opportunity to express their fandom. On the other, 150 people stood in a rowdy line waiting their turn in a Call of Duty tournament.</p>

<p><strong>While the Middle</strong> <strong>East</strong> represents only a small portion of the international gaming industry, it is a rapidly expanding market. In 2017, the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council accounted for around $693 million of gaming revenue, most related to esports. By 2021, that number is expected to exceed <a href="https://www.strategyand.pwc.com/m1/en/press-releases/2020/gcc-gaming-market.html">$821 million</a>, boosted in part by the pandemic-induced lockdown.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Saudi Arabia expects to be at the forefront<strong> </strong>of that expansion. In a country where roughly 50% of the population is under 30, gaming has become an emblem for a generation of young Saudis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In recent years, Prince Faisal bin Bandar, a young member of the royal family raised on Atari consoles, set out to make Saudi Arabia the Middle East’s hub for the $160 billion gaming industry. Under his leadership, the<strong> </strong><a href="https://safeis.sa/">Saudi Arabian Federation for Electronic and Intellectual Sports (SAFEIS)</a> aims for esports revenue to amount to 1% of the country’s GDP (approximately $22 billion) by 2030.</p>



<p>While Saudi Arabia was a late arrival to esports, its male players have already made their mark. Since 2017, Prince Faisal and the federation have been scouting, coaching, and sending professional esports players to competitions across the world. Mossad Al-Dossary, then 18, made headlines in 2018 after <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/fifa/news/msdossary-triumphs-fifa-eworld-cup-grand-final-london">winning first place</a> at the FIFA eWorld Cup in London, taking home a $250,000 cash prize.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Female gamers, however, are still finding their way. Women in Felwa, Tasnim, and Najla’s generation grew up under the watch of religious police, in a time when public spaces were segregated by gender. While women still do not have the same rights as men, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman<strong> </strong>has relaxed male-guardianship rules and mandatory dress codes and legalized certain forms of entertainment for women. “I still struggle to convey what Saudi Arabia was like at that time to those that haven’t had that experience,” Tess said. There were no theaters, and sports facilities for girls were limited, “So, mostly, we had to stay inside and make do with what we had — and games were all that we had.”</p>



<p>Raghad, 23, currently works for a mining company, but she dreams of becoming a voice actor for video games. Although she’s never lived anywhere but Saudi Arabia, she has a distinctly squeaky American accent — a curious trait she picked up from a fifth-grade teacher who had lived in the U.S. and a torrent of YouTube videos. She is considering taking voice-acting classes online, assuming she can find any, because she’s not allowed to travel abroad alone to study until after she’s married. It’s still common to meet women who come to gaming as a result of these kinds of restrictions, as Felwa, Tasnim, and Najla did years ago. This is why going to GCON can be such a powerful experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>In 2018, Felwa,</strong> Tasnim, and Najla handed GCON over to Ghada Al-Moqbel, who attended her first GCON in 2013 at the age of 18. Now she leads Saudi Arabia’s women’s gaming community. This occurred right after bin Salman took control and began dismantling the country’s gender segregation. For Ghada and the wider community of female gamers, these changes forced them to decide whether they wanted to stay on the fringes of the gaming community or take a more central role. In 2018, GCON organizers met regularly to discuss whether there was still value in creating an exclusively female space for gaming.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“We had to stay inside and make do with what we had — and games were all that we had.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>For Ghada, the answer was yes. While attitudes toward female gamers have improved, parts of Saudi society remain uncomfortable with this burgeoning culture. When GCON first launched, participants were criticized for indulging in supposedly immoral behavior, and social media accounts of female gamers were routinely hacked. Likewise, after the first Comic Con in Jeddah, in 2017, a<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%D9%83%D9%88%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%88%D9%86_%D8%AD%D9%81%D9%84_%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF%D8%A9_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D9%8A%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%86_%D8%A8%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%87?src=hashtag_click"> hashtag</a> accusing participants of being Satan worshippers flooded social media along with pictures of women who had dressed up for cosplay. Thanks in part to the continuing fear of societal backlash, many Saudi women still advocate for all-female events.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But like the kingdom, GCON is also evolving. “We’re not just entertainment anymore,” Ghada said. “It’s about empowering and enabling women to be serious in the gaming and esports industry.” In mid-August, Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, the largest women-only university in the world, <a href="https://www.arabnews.com/node/1718151/saudi-arabia">announced</a> that it would be creating a degree program for animation.</p>



<p>Since Ghada took over, the organization has expanded, hosting regular skill-development workshops as well as the annual convention. While she has maintained GCON’s focus on female gamers, she has been open to collaborating with their male peers. In 2017, organizers from Gamer’s Day worked with GCON to arrange their first mixed-gender gaming event. While 2020 was supposed to be a big year for Ghada and GCON, Covid-19 disrupted their plans. Nonetheless, it’s unlikely that GCON — a force that arose in far more challenging terrain — will be going away anytime soon.</p>

<p>Most people are familiar with central banks’ ability to create money out of thin air. A central bank has access to physical printing presses which can produce physical banknotes, and it has the corresponding ability to create electronic money. However, central banks are not the only entities which create money. Money is also created by regular banks, such as retail banks and commercial banks, in the process of making loans.</p>
<p>Many people believe that regular banks’ ability to create money is similar to central banks’ ability to create money. It is not. This misconception has been perpetuated by a powerful cast of characters which includes <a href="https://www.hs.fi/tiede/art-2000002869261.html" target="_blank">mainstream news outlets</a> and even <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521914001070" target="_blank">some economists</a>.</p>
<p>This article will demystify money creation by illustrating the following facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A bank deposit is merely an IOU.</li>
<li>A bank loan is merely an exchange of 2 IOUs.</li>
<li>Anyone can create IOUs out of thin air.</li>
<li>When a customer redeems an IOU at a bank, the bank typically needs to hand over another form of money — the kind that it cannot create out of thin air.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bank deposits are merely IOUs</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you have $100 in cash. You decide to deposit it at your local bank. Now you no longer have $100 in cash. Instead, you have a <em>promise</em> from the bank that you can withdraw $100 in cash at any time. The bank has $100 in cash and you have a promise. Let’s imagine this promise as a physical document acknowledging debt, an IOU (”I owe you”). The bank owes you $100 and promises that you can exchange this IOU to $100 cash at any time.</p>

<p>Is this IOU ”money”? We’ll get to that later, but the short answer is yes, that IOU is money. There are different types of money, and checking account deposits are usually considered to be a type of money.</p>
<p>Let’s illustrate this bank deposit as an exchange:</p>

<p>Assets are things the bank <em>owns</em>, liabilities are things the bank <em>owes</em>. In this simplified example, the only asset that the bank has is the $100 in cash that you deposited — now considered to be the <em>bank’s</em> asset — and the only liability is the $100 debt that the bank owes to you. These accounting entries were created at the same time: when the bank incremented your checking account by $100 (the deposit liability in bank’s accounting), there was a corresponding $100 cash deposit (the cash asset in bank’s accounting).</p>
<p><strong>A bank loan is merely an exchange of 2 IOUs</strong></p>
<p>Let’s continue with the example where you deposited $100 to a bank. Suppose I will go into that bank and ask for a $10 loan. Now that the bank owns $100, it can easily afford to loan me $10. I promise to pay back $11 at a later point in time, so the bank is eager to offer me a loan and make that dollar.</p>
<p>The bank deposits this $10 loan to my checking account. Remember, checking account deposits are IOUs, so the bank just gave me a $10 IOU. I promised to pay back $11, so I also created an IOU. In other words, this loan is an exchange of 2 IOUs: the bank promises to give me $10 in cash whenever I want, and I promise to give the bank $11 at a later point in time. Let’s imagine these IOUs as physical documents:</p>

<p>The bank still has that $100 cash in assets, and it still has that $100 liability to John. But now the bank also has a $10 liability to me: I could withdraw my $10 from the bank in cash at any time. Corresponding to this liability, the bank has recorded a new asset: my promise to pay back $11 later.</p>
<p>Notice how the bank now has $110 of deposits, but only $100 of cash in the vault. Welcome to fractional reserve banking! If I decided to withdraw my $10 from the bank today, and you decided to withdraw your $100 from the bank tomorrow, the bank would say ”oops, we no longer have your money”. In practice this rarely happens due to a myriad of reasons (banks can trade assets between each other when they have too little/too much cash, banks have internal risk controls which limit lending and other risky endeavours, lawmakers impose restrictions which are monitored by regulators, the existence of deposit insurance reduces likelihood of bank runs, etc.).</p>
<p>Anyway, let’s get to the interesting bit. Before taking out the loan there was $100 on checking account balances and afterwards there was $110 on checking account balances. Clearly, money was created in the process of taking out the loan. Where did this money come from? Was it created out of thin air? The short answer is yes, kind of, but let’s step back a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>What is money, anyway?</strong></p>
<p>Let’s go back to the cash deposit example. You deposit $100 into a bank and the bank records it as an asset. The bank records a corresponding liability: a $100 deposit to your checking account. Did the bank create money in this scenario?</p>
<p>Before the deposit there was $100 of cash money, but after the deposit there was $100 of cash money + $100 of electronic money = $200 worth of money in total. But of course we don’t want to ”double count” your money just because you deposited it in a bank, right? That’s why economists developed this convention that cash money in a bank’s vault is considered to be ”out of circulation”, and thus, is not typically counted when we count how much money exists.</p>

<p>The Eurozone M1 definition for money is <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/money_credit_banking/monetary_aggregates/html/hist_content.en.html" target="_blank">basically</a> equal to this notion of ”currency in circulation”. The concept of money is ambiguous, so there are many different definitions, varying by both economic area and by use case. Nevertheless, checking account balances are included in most commonly used definitions (though not in all, for instance the UK M0 definition for money <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/details/further-details-about-m0-data" target="_blank">does not</a> include checking account balances).</p>
<p>In abstract terms we might think that the $100 cash you deposited into a bank was transformed into a $100 checking account balance. Except it wasn’t. That $100 of cash money still exists. It was not transformed into anything. The bank took $100 of cash and put it in a vault. Then the bank created an IOU out of thin air and gave it to you. (We can say that the IOU was created out of thin air, because the corresponding $100 cash in the vault is not earmarked to this IOU — the bank may run out of cash before you try to redeem that IOU.) Then economists decided that the IOU counts as money, and the cash in the vault does not count as money. Thus, the act of depositing cash in a bank does not result in (net) creation of money. $100 of electronic money is added to circulation while $100 of cash money is removed from circulation, for a net difference of $0.</p>
<p>When you deposit cash in a bank, the bank creates an IOU out of thin air. Similarly, when you take a loan out of a bank, the bank creates an IOU out of thin air. However, due to accounting conventions, the latter action results in net money creation, while the former action does not. (Although these conventions are weird, they make sense: currency in circulation is a good measure with real implications for economic activity, and currency in circulation is genuinely increased when banks loan money.)</p>
<p><strong>Anyone can create IOUs out of thin air</strong></p>
<p>If there’s only one thing you take away from this article, let it be this. IOUs are promises. Anyone can make promises out of thin air. For example, I could be handing out IOUs like this, furbished with my signature for authenticity:</p>

<p>You might think these would be worthless, but that’s not exactly the case. People who know me would think ”Atte is good for $10”. These would not be worth exactly $10, because you would still rather take $10 in cash than a coupon that’s exchangeable for $10 in cash. And it’s unlikely that these IOUs would be used to facilitate real economic activity, so these IOUs should not be considered ”money”. Although there are clear differences in how these IOUs <em>would be used</em>, compared to the IOUs created by banks, is there any <em>fundamental</em> difference between the IOUs themselves?</p>
<p>Let’s take another example and get one step closer to creating money. This one is real, not hypothetical, example of IOUs created by a non-bank corporation.</p>
<p>We have to go all the way back to 2011. Poker is booming and Full Tilt Poker is one of 2 giants dominating the scene (the other being PokerStars). The way that poker sites work is you deposit money (like you would in a bank) and then as you play poker and you win and lose money from other players, the poker site keeps track of how much money everyone has (like a bank would keep track of transfers between customers of the same bank).</p>
<p>In other words, a poker site issues IOUs to players. These IOUs are supposedly redeemable at any time (like the IOUs created by a bank). The IOUs created by Full Tilt Poker were largely treated as money by players of the site, to the point where they were used to facilitate real economic activity. For example, it was typical for players to settle small debts (like $10 for a movie ticket) by sending a player-to-player transfer on Full Tilt Poker instead of sending a bank transfer (because transfers on poker sites were typically faster and easier to make than bank transfers).</p>

<p>For all intents and purposes, the IOUs created by Full Tilt Poker were money. They simply were not counted as money due to accounting conventions. Now, some of you might be thinking <em>”Wait a minute… Doesn’t the poker site have all player funds in the bank? If all player funds have corresponding bank deposits, then those bank deposits would already be counted as money, and we wouldn’t want to double count that money.”</em> Yeah, I also thought that Full Tilt Poker had player funds in the bank (can you guess where this is going?).</p>
<p>On April 15, 2011, known in the poker world as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Scheinberg" target="_blank">Black Friday</a>, the FBI raided offices of Full Tilt Poker and PokerStars as part of a larger crackdown on online gambling. This law enforcement action triggered an instant bank run by players: everyone …</p></div></div></div>

        <p>It’s common to talk about the way we build software in terms of the individual tools we compose together, like command-line utilities and deployment pipelines and containers and services, and most obviously, <em>programming languages</em>. Programming languages seem to get the highest level of scrutiny out of everything that comprises the way we write software. And in the last decade, I think we’ve seen a healthy rejuvenation of innovation in programming languages, driven by languages like Rust, Go, OCaml, Zig, and Swift that bring new ideas to the industrial programming world in practical packages.</p>
<p>But while programming languages are academically interesting, I think <strong>we more desperately need innovation in programming <em>environments</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The programming <em>environment</em> isn’t a single component of our workflow, but the total sum enabled by the tools working together harmoniously. The environment contains the programming language, but also includes the debugging experience, dependency management, how we communicate with other developers (both within source code and without), how we trace and observe code in production, and everything else in the process of designing APIs to recovering from failure.</p>
<p>The story of programming language evolution is also a story of rising ideas in what capabilities good programming <em>environments</em> should grant developers. Many languages came to popularity not necessarily based on their merits as great languages, but because they were paired with some new and powerful capability to understand software and write better implementations of it.</p>
<p>C brought practical portability to (what was at the time) high level programs. C literally elevated the programming environment out of processor-specific assembly code into a common vernacular. The legacy is so strong that most languages we use in production today are either direct descendants of C, or inherit much of their syntax, like curly brace-delineated blocks and structures, semicolon statement-terminators, and parenthesized function calls.</p>
<p>JavaScript is popular outside of the browser almost entirely on the merit of its ecosystem, its tooling, and the trivial debugging experience enabled by the repl. JavaScript’s programming environment is entirely interactive, visual, and real-time, without the need for clunky debugging apparatuses. The impact of that interactivity is obvious in the fact that many of my developer friends started programming on the Web, explicitly because it was the easiest way to write programs that produced output we could see and share.</p>
<p>One of Go’s claims to fame and primary design goals is compilation speed. Compared to its predecessor C++, Go compiles fast. And when you make something fast, people start to use it differently.</p>
<p>Erlang, with its <a href="https://www.erlang.org/">advanced, concurrent, message-passing runtime</a>, offers a better way to build high availability, highly reliable systems. It was born in the telecom industry, but has found home in many other critical services industries.</p>
<p>Thoughtfully crafted programming environments are the hidden treasures of the software industry. When we choose a language because of the “tooling” or because of the “IDE experience” or because of “the workflow,” what we are really doing is making a judgement about the programming <em>environment</em> we want to live in and grow around our work.</p>
<p>Between investments being made into new languages and the community’s willingness to experiment, there’s a lot of creative energy being poured into inventing better languages. I think it would serve us well if we invested just as deeply into rethinking the context in which we write those programs. We should be asking questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>While professional photo editors and video games can run in the browser, why are we still using a repl that prints lines in the terminal?</li>
<li>Does the compile-time / run-time distinction make sense to have? Can we give better control to developers about when their code is executed during the software development and deployment process?</li>
<li>What does an operating system kernel designed for debugging experience look like?</li>
<li>What does a memory model or memory allocator designed for debugging experience look like?</li>
<li>Are the tools we have today good enough foundations for massive open-source communities like NPM? How can we improve the programming environment and our tools to make the most of package repositories with hundreds of millions of libraries and billions of lines of code?</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some people trying to create better programming environments. <a href="https://repl.it/">Repl.it</a> brings general purpose development to the browser. Experiments like <a href="http://lighttable.com/">Light Table</a> more closely integrate source code with its output. Jupyter notebooks are a unique way of writing and sharing code that focus on the process of iteration.</p>
<p>But these are also workflows and tools built around languages that were never designed for such interactive experiences. I think if we build a culture of thinking about programming environments as a place ripe for creative innovation, we’ll see a new class of software development tools emerge that make the most of today’s machines and networks and allow us to write new kinds of software we couldn’t before.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>May 03, 2020</p></header><p>Modern applications don’t crash; they hang. One of the main reasons for it is the assumption that the network is reliable. It isn’t. </p><p>When you make a network call without setting a timeout, you are telling your code that you are 100% confident that the call is going to succeed. Would you really take that bet?</p><p>If you are a making synchronous network call that never returns, then to very least your thread hogs forever. Whoops. Asynchronous network calls that don’t return are not free either. Sure, you are not hogging threads, but you are leaking sockets. Any HTTP client library worth its salt uses socket pools to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_persistent_connection">avoid recreating connections</a>. And those pools have a limited capacity. Like any other resource leak, it’s only a matter of time until there are no sockets left. When that happens, your application is going to get stuck waiting for a connection to free up.</p><p>If the network is not reliable, why do we keep creating APIs that have infinity as the default timeout? Some APIs don’t even have a way to set a timeout in the first place! A good API should be easy to use the right way and hard to use the wrong way. When the default timeout is infinity, it’s all too easy for a client to shoot itself in the foot. </p><p>If you remember one thing from this post, then let it be this: <strong>never use “infinity” as a default timeout</strong>.</p><p>Let’s take a look at some concrete examples.</p><p>Javascript’s XMLHttpRequest is THE web API to retrieve data from a server asynchronously. Its <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/timeout">default timeout is zero</a>, which means there is no timeout!</p><div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>var</span> xhr <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>XMLHttpRequest</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

xhr<span>.</span><span>send</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Client-side timeouts are as crucial as server-side ones. There is a <a href="https://hpbn.co/primer-on-browser-networking/#connection-management-and-optimization">maximum number of sockets your browser</a> can open for a particular host. If you make network requests that never returns, you are going to exhaust the socket pool. When the pool is exhausted, you are no longer able to connect to the host. </p><p>The fetch web API is a modern replacement for the XMLHttpRequest API, which uses Promises. When the API was initially introduced, there was <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/951">no way to set a timeout at all</a>! Browsers have recently added experimental support for the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController">Abort API</a> to support timeouts, though.</p><div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> controller <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>AbortController</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

For example, .Net Core’s HttpClient has a default timeout of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpclient.timeout?view=netcore-3.1#remarks">100 seconds</a>. It’s lax but much better than no timeout at all. That comes as no surprise since those languages are used to build large scale distributed systems that need to be robust against network failures.

</header><p>
((tl;dr See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dljNabciEGg">my video presentation/demonstration</a> of this essay))
</p>

<p>
Maintaining servers falls into two phases:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Bang head until server works</li>
<li>Capture effort into some automation tool like Puppet or Chef.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Recently, I’ve been playing around with making the first phase closer
to the second.  For lack of a better word, I’m calling it <i>literate
devops</i>.
</p>

<p>
I’ve talked about using <a href="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/LP/introduction.html">org-mode’s <i>literate programming</i> model</a> to
investigate new ideas and crystallize thoughts, and this approach
appears to work well for me since I lack those esoteric sysadmin
skills.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgbcbce75">
<h2 id="orgbcbce75">Tell us a Story</h2>
<div id="text-orgbcbce75">
<p>
Once upon a time, I was tasked with patching an RPM, which is not in
my comfort zone, so my initial plan of attack was:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Use Vagrant to create a disposable CentOS system</li>
<li>SSH into this virtual machine to download needed tools</li>
<li>Run various unknown commands</li>
<li>Rinse and repeat this step until successful</li>
</ol>

<p>
Of course, once I figure out the solution, I need to document it for
others on my team, and maybe create a <i>repeatedable</i> script.
</p>

<p>
First step is well documented elsewhere, but today I learned (TIL)
you can <code>ssh</code> directly to your Vagrant-based virtual machine with
this little magic (<b>Note:</b> <i>client</i> is the name of my virtual
machine I specified in the <code>Vagrantfile</code>):
</p>

<div>
<pre>vagrant ssh-config --host clientvm &gt;&gt; $<span>HOME</span>/.ssh/config
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This command appends some lovely host-connection magic so you can
issue: <code>ssh clientvm</code>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8dff3db">
<h2 id="org8dff3db">Literate Devops</h2>
<div id="text-org8dff3db">
<p>
Instead of opening up a terminal to my virtual machine, I pop into
Emacs and load this sprint’s <i>note file</i><sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>, create a new header,
and enter the shell and ruby commands in this text file.
</p>

<p>
What good is this? Unlike a traditional terminal, this allows me to
<i>log</i>, <i>document</i> and <i>execute</i> each command.
</p>

<p>
For instance, here is a screen-shot of a section of my Emacs buffer:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops.png" alt="literate-devops.png">

</figure>

<p>
As an old bear with very little brains, my prose can explain the
background and purpose of each command.  Clicking the hyperlink
refreshes my memory of previous discoveries. A keychord <i>executes</i>
the code block…
</p>

<p>
Yes. I execute the commands from within Emacs.
</p>

<p>
Hitting <code>C-c C-c</code> (Control-C twice) runs the code (based on the
language).  This example runs in the shell. The results are placed
back into the file, which can be used by other code blocks (and <a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/results.html#results">many
other options</a>).
</p>

<p>
For instance, here is the first half of a section for downloading
the GPG Keys from a repository (the URL is placed in a <i>property</i>
that is shared among all code blocks in his section):
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-14.png" alt="literate-devops-14.png">

</figure>

<p>
The Shell script block (in the center of the screen-shot) uses
<code>wget</code> to download the HTML index file and parse and extract the key
file URLs.  We’ll have a Ruby script do that parsing, and since the
script may be a bit hairy, we’ll define it in another code block.
</p>

<p>
One technique from <a href="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/LP/introduction.html">literate programming</a> is the idea that one code
block can be inserted into another block (the reference is a name
within double angle brackets, <code>&lt;&lt;...&gt;&gt;</code>). Donald Knuth called this
feature WEB. Since it can accidentally conflict with some languages
(like Ruby), I have it off by default, but turn it on for this block
with the <code>noweb</code> parameter.
</p>

<p>
Here is the Ruby script. Having it in a separate Ruby-specific code
block allows me to turn on all the Ruby magic that Emacs can muster.
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-15.png" alt="literate-devops-15.png">

</figure>

<p>
The last step is to take the URLs produced by the first script and
feed them to another Shell script that will call <code>wget</code> to download
each:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-16.png" alt="literate-devops-16.png">

</figure>

<p>
The <code>key-list</code> was the name of our original code block, as well as
the name of its results. We assign that list of results to a
variable, <code>LIST</code> that the shell script would access as <code>$LIST</code>.
</p>

<p>
This example demonstrated how literate programming can weave code
and data through different languages.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5d7bdd1">
<h2 id="org5d7bdd1">What about the Virtual Machine?</h2>
<p>
Normally, specifying <code>sh</code> as the code block’s <i>language</i>, tells
Emacs to run the code in my local system’s shell, but in this case,
I want it ran on my virtual machine (or on my development server in
my lab). I’ll describe two options for doing this, using <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/TrampMode">Tramp</a> and
Babel Sessions.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org2251b72">
<h3 id="org2251b72">Tramp to the Rescue</h3>
<div id="text-org2251b72">
<p>
Tramp is an Emacs feature that allows one to edit a file on a
remote machine using <code>ssh</code> and other protocols. For instance,
running the <code>find-file</code> function (bound to <code>C-x C-f</code>) lets you type
something like:
</p>

<pre>/ssh:howard.abrams@goblin.howardism.org:web/files/robot.txt
</pre>

<p>
If you put the following in your <code>.emacs</code> initialization file:
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>(</span><span>setq</span> tramp-default-method <span>"ssh"</span><span>)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
And update your <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file to know what user account goes
with the host name, the file reference above can be shorten to:
</p>

<pre>/goblin.howardism.org:web/files/robot.txt
</pre>

<p>
Emacs looks for the <code>:</code> character to determine if Tramp should be
invoked.  Tramp uses SSH keys if available, or will prompt you for
a password if needed.
</p>


<p>
Each org-mode code block can specify a <code>:dir</code> option that specifies
where the code snippet should run, for instance, the following
blocks are equivalent:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-9.png" alt="literate-devops-9.png">

</figure>

<p>
The <code>:dir</code> option allows full Tramp functionality, allowing me to
run a block on a different machine. Remember how I added my
<code>client</code> Vagrant virtual machine to my <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file?
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-10.png" alt="literate-devops-10.png">

</figure>

<p>
<i>But I need access to my machine behind a firewall!?</i>
</p>

<p>
My job deals with virtual machines running in a highly protected
data center, where I need to first log into jump boxes and bastion
machines. Tramp handles these sorts of hops. For instance:
</p>

<pre>/ssh:10.98.18.229|ssh:10.0.1.122|sudo:/etc/network/interfaces
</pre>

<p>
Uses my account name to log into the bastion machine, and
then uses my account name to <code>ssh</code> into a virtual machine running
in a private cloud. And then uses the <code>sudo</code> command to let me edit
a file owned by <code>root</code>.
</p>

<p>
Tramp pipe references works with the <code>:dir</code> option for <code>org-mode</code>
source blocks:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-11.png" alt="literate-devops-11.png">

</figure>

<p>
Few tricks to keep in mind:
</p>

<ul>
<li>All but the last hop uses a pipe character, |, instead of the
colon character, :</li>
<li>If you use the pipe character, you need to specify all
protocols, like <code>ssh</code>, even if it is the default.</li>
<li>If your local machine’s operating system is different than the
machine you are connecting to, you need to fix a bug in
<code>org-mode</code>, which I can show you how to fix<sup><a id="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0d027af">
<h3 id="org0d027af">Using org-mode Sessions</h3>
<div id="text-org0d027af">
<p>
Another approach is to create a <i>session</i> that connects different
code blocks together. Each screen shot below, each code block below
has the same <code>session</code> value, <code>client</code> (which is conveniently the
same my virtual machine’s hostname, <code>client</code>):
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-2b.png" alt="literate-devops-2b.png">

</figure>

<p>
If I execute the first block, a <i>shell</i> is started in the
background, and it ssh’s into the machine. Note, to get this
working, you need to enable <i>password-less access</i> by placing your
SSH’s public key into the remote system’s <code>.ssh/authorized_keys</code>
file, or using the <code>ssh</code> Emacs package.<sup><a id="fnr.3" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
From this point on, each code block I execute with the <code>client</code>
session value, uses this connection, and the code is executed on the
remote machine (a virtual machine in this case, but that doesn’t
matter).
</p>

<p>
Either of these approaches works well, but the second approach,
allows me to set variables to create a particular state that other
blocks may expect.  However, this requires execution of each block in
order.
</p>

<p>
I have a third, more interactive, approach<sup><a id="fnr.4" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> using <code>screen</code>, but
it doesn’t allow passing variables to the code, and as you’ll see
below, this is pretty important to me.
</p>


<p>
Regardless, I continue learning how to accomplish my goal, all the
while documenting and <i>validating</i> my steps. The end result can be
exported to web or wiki page.

<div id="outline-container-org39ccdca">
<h2 id="org39ccdca">What about Verbose Commands?</h2>
<div id="text-org39ccdca">
<p>
Yes, executing some commands can be quite time-consuming and
verbose, but often I need to search the results, and having the
results placed in an Emacs buffer allows better searching.
</p>

<p>
Often I use a collapsible “drawer” (which is just a way to identify
the beginning and end of the output):
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-3.png" alt="literate-devops-3.png">

</figure>

<p>
Place the cursor on this drawer and hit the <code>Tab</code> key to hide or
show the output:

<div id="outline-container-org3721d6c">
<h2 id="org3721d6c">Can you Use the Output?</h2>
<div id="text-org3721d6c">
<p>
The results of some commands are often needed for the next command,
and I’m sure you just love using your mouse to copy and paste part
of the output, but I have a better way.
</p>

<p>
For instance, I needed a list of an RPM’s dependencies:

<p>This is the first part of a blog series where I examine programming concepts from a scientific perspective. In this part I dig up every study relating to function length I could find, fill in some gaps with original research, and examine what we can learn.</p>



<p>Highlights:</p>



<ul id="block-f6ddbfdc-f37f-48df-8d67-6990d4b79de3"><li>We find that in older studies (pre-2000) short functions correlate with higher defect density</li><li>There seem to be no post-2000 studies exclusively focusing on function length, but through original research we find that modern code bases exhibit similar behavior</li><li>We also find that in empirical experiments short functions make code slower to debug, with some weaker evidence suggesting they also make it slower for adding new features but faster to modify</li></ul>



<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>



<p>In programming lore it’s hard to find sources glorifying long functions. This is codified, for example, in the widely quoted book ‘Clean Code’ which states:</p>



<blockquote><p>The first rule of functions is that they should be small. The second rule of functions is that they should be smaller than that. Functions should not be 100 lines long. Functions should hardly ever be 20 lines long</p></blockquote>



<p>Favoring short functions isn’t by any means a new practise – a 1986 study “An Empirical Study of Software Design Practices” states “keeping modules small” as a good design practise. They also quote a book from 1974, stating “many programming standards limit module size to one page (or 50-60 source lines of code)”.</p>



<p><strong>What is a small function?</strong></p>



<p>What was meant by shorts functions in the 80s is different from small functions of today. In a study from 1991 ([1]) the line between small and large functions is drawn at 142 lines, staggeringly long by modern standards. In the same vein, a study from 1984 groups functions into buckets by increments of 50 lines ([2]).</p>



<p>However, nowadays the vast majority of functions are under 50 lines. A quick analysis of Eclipse, a popular open source IDE, reveals it averages about 8.6 lines per method in its source code. Above mentioned book “Clean Code”, published in 2008, states that functions should rarely be more than 20 lines, and the author has stated in other contexts he often prefers to use single-line functions, and that about half of the functions written by the author in Ruby are single-liners.</p>



<p>This shift in function sizes is perhaps partially due to changes in programming languages. In the 80s a Fortran “module” was commonly considered a function and some variables&nbsp; (see eg. <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/fortran/fortran_modules.htm">https://www.tutorialspoint.com/fortran/fortran_modules.htm</a>) and function was the basic building block of software, whereas nowadays most Java or C++ programmers would define “module” as a class consisting of multiple functions.</p>



<p>Many studies focus on analyzing module sizes without specifying what a module is, so I’ve only included studies which specifically state they analyze functions. This, combined with the change in what we consider a basic building block of software, combined with the historical shift in function sizes, makes it hard to properly analyze and aggregate the studies, but we can certainly try.</p>



<p><strong>Function length and defect density – pre-2000</strong></p>



<p>The first studies concerning the length of functions I could find were from the early 80s. Nowadays most studies examine the code on a class and package level, whereas in the 80s object oriented programming was still quite rare and functions were the main building blocks of software, so it made a lot of sense to examine functions and their error proneness.</p>



<p>The early research on function length and defect density found that very small functions tended to have higher defect densities. This has been cited in “Code Complete”, where Steve McConnell says: “The routine should be allowed to grow organically up to 100-200 lines, decades of evidence say that routines of such length no more error prone then shorter routines.” Further, he gives a reference to a study that says routines 65 lines or longer are cheaper to develop. (see appendix for a more extensive take on the studies used in Code Complete)</p>



<p>To dive further, a study from 1984 ([2]) grouped function to buckets with increments of 50 lines and measured the error density for each bucket. They found that smaller functions contained, on average, more defects per line:</p>

<p>A follow-up study ([3]) examined five Fortran projects, and states that “no significant relationship was found between module size and fault rate“ even though, in the same paragraph, the authors also state that “nevertheless, [small modules] exhibited the highest average fault rate because a small module with even a single fault will show a very high fault rate“. It’s not clear why the authors state that module size and fault rate has no significant relationship and then state that average fault rate is highest for small modules. Another conclusion from [3] is that larger functions are cheaper to develop.</p>



<p>A third empirical study ([1]) analyzed 450 routines and found that “small” routines (those with fewer than 143 source statements, including comments) had 23 percent more errors per line of code than larger routines but were 2.4 times less expensive to fix than larger routines. This is interesting since it contrasts with some other experimental results we’ll see later.</p>



<p>So far it appears short functions are correlated with higher defect density, but due to the large sizes of the examined functions you’d be forgiven for doubting the relevance of these studies to modern software engineering.</p>



<p><strong>Modern defect prediction literature</strong></p>



<p>Modern defect prediction approaches are characterized by large data sets and machine learning methods applied on them. They mainly concentrate on correlating features such as “average method length” and “lines of code” with defects in an attempt to create defect prediction models.</p>



<p>Several such studies have found a correlation between size of methods and defects. For example [4] found that the size of the longest method in a class correlates positively with post-relase defects. Does this mean we should refactor our long methods into short ones to avoid defects?</p>

<p>Turns out the answer is no. In those same studies, the number of methods also correlates with defects:</p>







<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?resize=640%2C61&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="61" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?resize=1024%2C98&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?resize=300%2C29&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?resize=768%2C73&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?resize=1536%2C146&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?resize=2048%2C195&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?resize=1568%2C149&amp;ssl=1 1568w, https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>The number of functions in a class also correlates with defects. [4]</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>To put it plainly, if we have a long function and split it into smaller ones, we’re not removing a source of defects, but we would simply be switching from one to another.</p>



<p>The same effect can be seen in other defect prediction studies. For example in [5] we see that both “Weighted Methods per Class” and “Average Method Complexity” correlate with defects, where former is defined as “number of methods in the class” and latter as “the average method size for each class“.</p>



<p>In both studies both metrics have a statistically significant correlation with defects, and this appears to be the trend across many other studies in defect prediction literature.</p>



<p>The literature doesn’t provide a straightforward way to measure which feature (length or number of methods) is more significant when predicting defects. It’s quite possible that, for example, measures such as “average method complexity” and “number of methods in a class” simply act as 2nd order estimators for number of lines, in which case we’d simply be comparing which measure correlates better with the underlying metric.</p>



<p>In addition, we’re interested in examining the length of the functions on a more granular level. Finding out that the number of methods and the length of methods both correlate with defects doesn’t give us anything tangible, and doing this sort of class or module level correlation analysis doesn’t get us very far.</p>



<p>However, the datasets used in many of these studies are open and we can download them to try to examine the relationship between functions length and defects ourselves.</p>



<p><strong>Data set analysis</strong></p>



<p>Time to scare the wikipedia editors among you and do some original research. All the code and data can be found at <a href="https://github.com/softwarebyscience/function-length/">https://github.com/softwarebyscience/function-length/</a>.</p>



<p>I took two datasets which contained the features we are interested in, such as the number of methods and lines of code per class. The first dataset I worked with is simply called “Eclipse Bug Database” and it contained data from three major Eclipse releases ([7]).</p>



<p>In addition, I used the “Bug Prediction Dataset” from <a href="http://bug.inf.usi.ch/download.php">http://bug.inf.usi.ch/download.php</a> as it seemed larger than the Eclipse Bug Database. The data is collected between 2005 and 2009 from 5 different Java projects – for a more detailed explanation see [6].</p>



<p>The results from the first dataset are quite straightforward:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.13.53-PM.png?resize=511%2C375&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="511" height="375" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.13.53-PM.png?resize=1024%2C752&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.13.53-PM.png?resize=300%2C220&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.13.53-PM.png?resize=768%2C564&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.13.53-PM.png?w=1174&amp;ssl=1 1174w" sizes="(max-width: 511px) 100vw, 511px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Here smaller methods clearly have a higher defect density, with the minimum defect density roughly found in classes where the methods average around 10-15 lines. What’s perhaps hard to see from the chart is that defect density starts very slightly increasing towards the right.</p>



<p>The results from the second dataset are a bit more interesting (moving average in red):</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.15.45-PM.png?resize=502%2C367&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="502" height="367" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.15.45-PM.png?resize=1024%2C750&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.15.45-PM.png?resize=300%2C220&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.15.45-PM.png?resize=768%2C563&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.15.45-PM.png?w=1168&amp;ssl=1 1168w" sizes="(max-width: 502px) 100vw, 502px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Perhaps most surprisingly, the distribution is quite different compared to the first dataset, even though I would’ve expected the distributions to look very similar. I have no good theories as to why this might be the case (apart from a bug in my code, although I did check it several times).</p>



<p>There are a few other interesting details here. The average error density in the second dataset is higher, and this is likely because we consider all bugs over the ~4 year period, whereas the first dataset only considers the last 6 months and specific type of bugs (see [6] and [7] for details). In addition there are some zero-length functions. These are likely methods of abstract classes, meant to be overwritten. When analyzing post-release defects we see a roughly similar picture, if noisier (graph can be found in …</p></div></div>

<p>When 27-year-old Lebanese teacher Sara Mazbouh heard news of the Covid-19 stay-at-home order, her mind went straight to her students. Mazbouh, who has been teaching for nine years at a school in the suburbs of Beirut, wondered how they would cope. After the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-protests/protesters-block-roads-in-beirut-other-parts-of-lebanon-idUSKBN1XE0H7">nationwide protests</a> and shutdowns across Lebanon in October of last year, the day-to-day lives of her students would again be paralyzed by circumstances out of their control.</p>



<p>In the early weeks of the shutdown, Mazbouh and her colleagues photocopied their lessons, leaving them for parents to pick up at school. Then, <a href="https://en.unesco.org/covid19/educationresponse">like countless others around the world</a>, Mazbouh’s campus announced it would be closing for the rest of the year. Most of her students are firmly middle-class; she knew many parents wouldn’t be able to afford online learning — steady internet and a computer at home <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/lebanon-telecommunication-in-government-hands/a-48634796#:~:text=But%20this%20progress%20does%20not,that%20is%20on%20the%20rise.">aren’t a given</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Exasperated, Mazbouh messaged her fellow teachers on WhatsApp. A distance-learning solution, they soon realized, was right in front of them.</p>



<p>In Lebanon, where schools have been closed for over five months, WhatsApp has become an informal distance-learning app for students and teachers. The app allows educators to share their lessons using voice notes, videos, and photos in group chats that mimic a classroom structure.&nbsp;</p>

In the wake of the massive explosion that rocked the country’s capital in early August, more than 300,000 Beirutis, up to <a href="https://www.voanews.com/middle-east/unicef-says-beirut-children-will-need-special-care-after-blast">one-third of them school-age children</a>, have been displaced from their homes. In spite of the odds, teachers and parents are embracing creative ways to keep their “WhatsApp schools” in session.</p>



<p>For Mazbouh and her fellow teachers, shifting classes to WhatsApp was a matter of necessity. “The school administration didn’t even ask us to pursue WhatsApp teaching as a solution,” she says. “But the kids shouldn’t have to waste their year.” The teachers at Mazbouh’s school had such success with their ad hoc WhatsApp classroom that the administrators organized similar group chats for their elementary school counterparts.</p>



<p>As teachers across the country bring their classrooms to WhatsApp, they have realized there are new students in their classrooms: parents. For younger students, the adults play videos, record their kids completing assignments, and send the footage to teachers, who monitor their progress. Kindergarten teacher Noura Chehayeb shares snippets of her students’ reading progress on Facebook along with encouraging messages for their parents, whom she tags in different posts. The clips offer glimpses into each household’s unique effort to maintain normalcy during the pandemic. In one, a mom films her child singing a nursery song in their backyard. In another, a girl practices her French spelling, while her father talks at a TV playing the nightly news in the background.</p>



<p>Even though it was never intended to be an educational tool, there are unique benefits to WhatsApp distance learning. Some of the higher-end platforms used for distance learning require technical skills and hardware, such as laptops, that not all families possess. WhatsApp requires only a smartphone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The app’s “read receipts” function as an unofficial monitoring tool for teachers tracking their students’ participation. Once a student opens a group chat, all texts and photos appear as “seen” from the teacher’s perspective. Antoine Gebian, a 41-year-old private-school teacher, realized WhatsApp treated audio messages a little differently: his students must open each clip to indicate a “played” receipt; he could check if they hadn’t listened to his voice notes. Gebian used the function as a sort of attendance tally for his WhatsApp classroom. While Lebanon’s school curricula are offered in French and English, many parents speak only Arabic fluently. WhatsApp’s voice notes allow Lebanese teachers to switch between the three with ease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But distance learning, even when held exclusively on WhatsApp, may be out of reach for Lebanon’s students this fall.</p>



<p>The effects of this month’s blast are far-reaching: the nearly 2,700-ton explosion obliterated Beirut’s port, Lebanon’s biggest and its main source for imports that sustain the country. The economic impact will go beyond the city itself. “Many parents are saying they can’t enroll their kids for economic and Covid reasons,” says Mazbouh, who was laid off from her job of nearly a decade in July. “The percentage of parents who are actually enrolling their kids is very low, and if they are, they’re not paying their fees.” Mazbouh’s school closed the same week she lost her job, its principal dismissed along with all the other teachers. Mazbouh says she doesn’t blame the school for the closure. “Our economic situation is very hard,” she says. “They have every right to shut down.”&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“It’s much easier for children to grasp things if they live in a physical space that portrays it.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>That was before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/04/world/middleeast/beirut-explosion-damage.html">the August 4 blast</a>. Initial reports indicate that more than <a href="https://www.voanews.com/middle-east/unicef-says-beirut-children-will-need-special-care-after-blast">120 schools were damaged by the explosion</a>, leaving some 55,000 students without physical classrooms. Lebanese authorities say they plan to host displaced families in those that haven’t been damaged. Together with the pandemic, it makes a return to the classroom this fall unlikely<strong> </strong>for many students in Lebanon. For those schools that do try to stay in session, WhatsApp may be a solution to the myriad challenges they face.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carla Najem, a psychologist at the American University of Beirut Medical Center, says prolonged time out of the classroom may have serious repercussions for Lebanese students. “Our basic needs are not being met right now,” says Najem. “[Students] are going through a lot mentally and emotionally.”</p>



<p>Even as conditions in an ailing Lebanon deteriorate, Najem says that certain aspects of distance learning, like sharing photos and videos, can ameliorate some of the long-term negative effects. “It’s much easier for children to grasp things if they live in a physical space that portrays it,” Najem says. “Maybe we need to use those things as an opportunity to help children connect.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Najem says we have a lot to learn from students, even as they face a daunting new school year. “Children are very resilient,” she explains. “They adapt much quicker than adults.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content" role="main">
      <p>This blog post explains the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02217">Hopfield Networks is All You Need</a> and the corresponding new PyTorch <a href="https://github.com/ml-jku/hopfield-layers">Hopfield layer</a>.</p>

<h2 id="main-contributions">Main contributions</h2>
<p>We introduce a new energy function and a corresponding new update rule which is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum of the energy function.</p>

<p>The new energy function is a generalization (discrete states \(\Rightarrow\) continuous states) of <strong>modern Hopfield Networks</strong> aka <strong>Dense Associative Memories</strong> introduced by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01164">Krotov and Hopfield</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01929">Demircigil et al.</a>
The new modern Hopfield Network with continuous states keeps the characteristics of its discrete counterparts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>exponential storage capacity</li>
  <li>extremely fast convergence</li>
</ul>

<p>Surprisingly, the new update rule is the attention mechanism of transformer networks introduced in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">Attention Is All You Need</a>.
We use these new insights to analyze transformer models in the paper.</p>

<h2 id="what-this-blog-post-is-about">What this blog post is about</h2>

<p>This blog post is split into three parts. First, we make the transition from traditional Hopfield Networks towards <strong>modern Hopfield Networks</strong> and their generalization to continuous states through our <strong>new energy function</strong>. Second, the properties of our new energy function and the connection to the self-attention mechanism of transformer networks is shown. Finally, we introduce and explain a new PyTorch layer (<a href="https://github.com/ml-jku/hopfield-layers">Hopfield layer</a>), which is built on the insights of our work. We show several practical use cases, i.e. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13505">Modern Hopfield Networks and Attention for Immune Repertoire Classification</a>, Hopfield pooling, and associations of two sets.</p>

<h2 id="from-classical-hopfield-networks-to-self-attention">From classical Hopfield Networks to self-attention</h2>

<p><strong>Associative memories</strong> are one of the earliest artificial neural models dating back to the 1960s and 1970s. Best known are <a href="https://authors.library.caltech.edu/7427/1/HOPpnas82.pdf">Hopfield Networks</a>, presented by John Hopfield in 1982.
As the name suggests, the main purpose of associative memory networks is to associate an input with its most similar pattern. In other words, the purpose is to store and retrieve patterns.
We start with a review of classical Hopfield Networks.</p>

<h3 id="hopfield-networks">Hopfield Networks</h3>

<p>The simplest associative memory is just a <strong>sum of outer products</strong> of the \(N\) patterns \(\{\boldsymbol{x}_i\}_{i=1}^N\) that we want to store (Hebbian learning rule). In classical Hopfield Networks these patterns are polar (binary), i.e. \(\boldsymbol{x}_i \in \{ -1,1 \}^d\), where \(d\) is the length of the patterns. The corresponding weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\) is:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{W} = \sum_i^N \boldsymbol{x}_i \boldsymbol{x}_i^T \ . \tag{1}
\end{equation}\]

<p>The weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\) stores the patterns, which can be retrieved starting with a <strong>state pattern</strong> \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\).</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Nomenclature</strong></p>

<p>From now on we denote the \(N\) <strong>stored patterns</strong> as \(\{\boldsymbol{x}_i\}_{i=1}^N\) and any <strong>state pattern</strong> or <strong>state</strong> as \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\).</p>

<hr>

<p>The basic <strong>synchronuous update rule</strong> is to repeatedly multiply the state pattern \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\) with the weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\), subtract the bias and take the sign:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\xi^{t+1}} =  \text{sgn}(\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{\xi}^t - \boldsymbol{b}) \ , \tag{2}
\label{eq:restorage}
\end{equation}\]

<p>where \(\boldsymbol{b} \in \mathbb{R}^d\) is a bias vector, which can be interpreted as threshold for every component.
The <strong>asynchronous update rule</strong> performs this update only for one component of \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\) and then selects the next component for update.
Convergence is reached if \(\boldsymbol{\xi^{t+1}} = \boldsymbol{\xi^{t}}\).</p>

<p>The asynchronous version of the update rule of Eq. \eqref{eq:restorage} minimizes the <strong>energy function</strong> \(\text{E}\):</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\text{E} = -\frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{\xi}^T \boldsymbol{W} \boldsymbol{\xi} + \boldsymbol{\xi}^T\boldsymbol{b} = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^d\sum_{j=1}^d w_{ij}\xi_i\xi_j + \sum_{i=1}^d b_i\xi_i \ . \tag{3}
\label{eq:energy_hopfield}
\end{equation}\]

<p>As derived in the papers of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=58341">Bruck</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166218X85900290">Goles-Chacc et al.</a> and <a href="https://authors.library.caltech.edu/7427/1/HOPpnas82.pdf">the original Hopfield paper</a>, the convergence properties are dependent on the structure of the weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\) and the method by which the nodes are updated:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For asynchronous updates with \(w_{ii} \geq 0\) and \(w_{ij} = w_{ji}\), the updates converge to a stable state.</li>
  <li>For synchronous updates with \(w_{ij} = w_{ji}\), the updates converge to a stable state or a limit cycle of length 2.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the asynchronous update rule and symmetric weights, \(\text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t+1}) \leq \text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t})\) holds. When \(\text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t+1}) = \text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t})\) for the update of every component of \(\boldsymbol{\xi}^t\), a local minimum in \(\text{E}\) is reached.
All stored patterns \(\{\boldsymbol{x}_i\}_{i=1}^N\) should be fixed points of the Hopfield Network, i.e.</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{x}_i = \text{sgn}(\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{x}_i - \boldsymbol{b}) \ . \tag{4}
\end{equation}\]

<p>They should even be local minima of \(\text{E}\).</p>

<p>In the following example, no bias vector is used. This means that taking the inverse image, i.e. flipping all pixels at once, results in the same energy.</p>

<p>We start with an <strong>illustrative example</strong> of a Hopfield Network. <strong>One input image</strong> should first be stored and then be retrieved.
The input image is:</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_original.png" alt="not found" width="300px"></p>

<p>Since an associative memory has <strong>polar states and patterns</strong> (or binary states and patterns), we convert the input image to a black and white image:</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_bw.png" alt="not found" width="300px"></p>

<p>The <strong>weight matrix</strong> \(\boldsymbol{W}\) is the outer product of this black and white image \(\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}\):</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{W} = \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}} \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}^T \ , \qquad \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}} \in \{ -1,1\}^d \ , \tag{5}
\label{eq:weight_matrix}
\end{equation}\]

<p>where for this example \(d = 64 \times 64\).</p>

<p>Can the original image be restored if half of the pixels are masked out? The masked image is:</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_bw_masked.png" alt="not found" width="300px"></p>

<p>which is our inital state \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\). This inital state is updated via multiplication with the weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\).
It takes one update until the original image is restored.</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_bw_masked_retrieved.png" alt="not found" width="600px"></p>

<p>What happens if we store <strong>more than one pattern</strong>? The weight matrix is then built from the sum of outer products of <strong>three stored patterns</strong> (three input images):</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{W} = \sum_{i=1}^3 \boldsymbol{x}_i \boldsymbol{x}_i^T \ , \qquad \boldsymbol{x}_i \in \{ -1,1\}^d \ . \tag{6}
\end{equation}\]

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/multi_pat_img/experiment_6.png" alt="not found"></p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/multi_pat_img/experiment_12.png" alt="not found"></p>

<p>In this figure, the left hand side shows the three stored patterns, and the right hand side shows masked state patterns \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\) together with the retrieved patterns \(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{\text{new}}\).</p>

<p>Looking at the upper row of images might suggest that the retrieval process is no longer perfect. But there are two interesting facts to take into account:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Masking the original images introduces many pixel values of \(-1\). We therefore have the odd behavior that the inner product \(\langle\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}^{\text{masked}},\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Bart}}\rangle\) is larger than the inner product \(\langle\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}^{\text{masked}},\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}\rangle\).</li>
  <li>As stated above, if no bias vector is used, the inverse of the pattern, i.e. flipping all pixels at once, results in the same energy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although the retrieval of the upper image looks incorrect, it is de facto correct. However, for the lower row example, the retrieval is no longer correct.
The weights of \(2 \cdot \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Marge}}\) have simply overwritten the weights of \(\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}\).
For both examples, only the retrieval after the first update step is shown, but the results do not change when performing further update steps.
The next figure shows the Hopfield Network retrieval for 6 patterns.</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/multi_pat_img/experiment_115.png" alt="not found"></p>

<p>Clearly, retrieving the patterns is imperfect. One might suspect that the limited storage capacities of Hopfield Networks, see <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.322.3548&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Amit et al.</a> and <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevE.66.061910">Torres et al</a>, is the problem.
However, we show now that the storage capacity is not directly responsible for the imperfect retrieval.
The storage capacity for <strong>retrieval of patterns free of errors</strong> is:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
C \cong \frac{d}{2\log(d)} \ , \tag{7}
\label{eq:storage_hopfield}
\end{equation}\]

<p>where \(d\) is the dimension of the input.</p>

<p>The storage capacity for <strong>retrieval of patterns with a small percentage of errors</strong> is:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
C \cong 0.14 d\ . \tag{8}
\label{eq:storage_hopfield2}
\end{equation}\]

<p>In the example, the storage capacity is \(C \cong 0.14 d = 0.14 \cdot 64 \cdot 64 \sim 570\).
Thus, insufficient storage capacity is not directly responsible for the retrieval errors.
Instead, the example patterns are correlated, therefore the retrieval has errors.</p>

<p>Consequently, we need a model which <strong>allows pulling apart close patterns</strong>, such that (strongly) <strong>correlated patterns can be distinguished</strong>.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>On storage capacity</strong></p>

<p>The storage capacities stated in Eq. \eqref{eq:storage_hopfield} and in Eq. \eqref{eq:storage_hopfield2} are derived for \(w_{ii}=0\).
Recently, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2016.00144/full">Folli et al.</a> analyzed the storage capacity for Hopfield Networks with \(w_{ii}\geq 0\). Also for \(w_{ii}\geq 0\), a storage capacity of \(C \cong 0.14 d\)
for retrieval of patterns with a small percentage of errors was observed. The ratio \(C/d\) is often called <strong>load parameter</strong> and denoted by \(\alpha\). <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2016.00144/full">Folli et al.</a> showed that there is a second regime with very large \(\alpha\), where the storage capacity is much higher, i.e. more fixed points exist. However, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07741">Rocci et al.</a> and <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/21/8/726/htm">Gosti et al.</a> reported that these fixed points for very large \(\alpha\) are unstable and do not have an attraction basin.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="modern-hopfield-networks-aka-dense-associative-memories">Modern Hopfield Networks (aka Dense Associative Memories)</h3>

<p>The storage capacity is a crucial characteristic of Hopfield Networks. <strong>Modern Hopfield Networks</strong> (aka Dense Associative Memories) introduce a new energy function instead of the energy in Eq. \eqref{eq:energy_hopfield} to create a higher storage capacity. <strong>Discrete</strong> modern Hopfield Networks have been introduced first by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01164">Krotov and Hopfield</a> …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>In my previous posts on loss aversion (<a href="https://jasoncollins.blog/2019/09/10/kahneman-and-tverskys-debatable-loss-aversion-assumption/">here</a>, <a href="https://jasoncollins.blog/2019/11/06/what-can-we-infer-about-someone-who-rejects-a-5050-bet-to-win-110-or-lose-100-the-rabin-paradox-explored/">here</a> and <a href="https://jasoncollins.blog/2019/12/05/the-case-against-loss-aversion/">here</a>), I foreshadowed a post on how “ergodicity economics” might shed some light on whether we need loss aversion to explain people’s choices under uncertainty. This was to be that post, but the background material that I drafted is long enough to be a stand alone piece. I’ll turn to the application of ergodicity economics to loss aversion in a future post.</p>
<p>The below is largely drawn from presentations and papers by <a href="https://ergodicityeconomics.com/">Ole Peters</a> and <a href="http://lml.org.uk/research/economics/">friends</a>, with my own evolutionary take at the end. For a deeper dive, see the <a href="https://ergodicityeconomics.com/lecture-notes/">lecture notes by Peters and Alexander Adamou</a>, or a recent <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-019-0732-0">Perspective by Peters in Nature Physics</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The choice</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you have $100 and are offered a gamble involving a series of coin flips. For each flip, heads will increase your wealth by 50%. Tails will decrease it by 40%. Flip 100 times.</p>
<p><strong>The expected payoff</strong></p>
<p>What will happen? For that first flip, you have a 50% chance of a $50 gain, and a 50% chance of a $40 loss. Your expected gain (each outcome weighted by its probability, 0.5*$50 + 0.5*-$40) is $5 or 5% of your wealth. The absolute size of the stake for future flips will depend on past flips, but for every flip you have the same expected gain of 5% of your wealth.</p>
<p>Should you take the bet?</p>
<p>I simulated 10,000 people who each started with $100 and flipped the coin 100 times each. This line in Figure 1 represents the mean wealth of the 10,000 people. It looks good, increasing roughly in accordance with the expected gain, despite some volatility, and finishing at a mean wealth of over $16,000.</p>
<p><em>Figure 1: Average wealth of population</em><br>
<img src="https://jasonallancollins.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/non_ergodic_figure_1.jpeg?w=1100" alt="Figure 1"></p>
<p>Yet people regularly decline gambles of this nature. Are they making a mistake?</p>
<p>One explanation for declining this gamble is risk aversion. A risk averse person will value the expected outcome of a gamble lower than the same sum with certainty.</p>
<p>Risk aversion can be represented through the concept of utility, where each level of wealth gives subjective value (utility) for the gambler. If people maximise utility instead of the value of a gamble, it is possible that a person would reject the bet.</p>
<p>For example, one common utility function to represent a risk averse individual is to take the logarithm of each level of wealth. If we apply the log utility function to the gamble above, the gambler will reject the offer of the coin flip. [The maths here is simply that the expected utility of the gamble is 0.5*<em>ln</em>(150) + 0.5*<em>ln</em>(60)=4.55, which is less than the utility of the sure $100, <em>ln</em>(100)=4.61.]</p>
<p><strong>The time average growth rate</strong></p>
<p>For a different perspective, below is the plot for the first 20 of these 10,000 people. Interestingly, only two people do better than break even (represented by the black line at $100). The richest has less than $1,000 at period 100.</p>
<p><em>Figure 2: Path of first 20 people</em><br>
<img src="https://jasonallancollins.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/non_ergodic_figure_2.jpeg?w=1100" alt="Figure 2"></p>
<p>What is happening here? The first plot shows that the average wealth across all 10,000 people is increasing. When we look at the first 20 individuals, their wealth generally declines. Even those that make money make less than the gain in aggregate wealth would suggest.</p>
<p>To show this more starkly, here is a plot of the first 20 people on a log scale, together with the average wealth for the full population. They are all below average in final wealth.</p>
<p><em>Figure 3: Plot of first 20 people against average wealth (log scale)</em><br>

<p>If we examine the full population of 10,000, we see an interesting pattern. The mean wealth is over $16,000, but the median wealth after 100 periods is 51 cents, a loss of over 99% of the initial wealth. 54% of the population ends up with less than $1. 86% finishes with less than the initial wealth of $100. Yet 171 people end up with more than $10,000. The wealthiest person finishes with $117 million, which is over 70% of the total wealth of the population.</p>
<p>For most people, the series of bets is a disaster. It looks good only on average, propped up by the extreme good luck and massive wealth of a few people. The expected payoff does not match the experience of most people.</p>
<p><strong><em>Four possible outcomes</em></strong></p>
<p>One way to think about what is happening is to consider the four possible outcomes over the first two periods.</p>
<p>The first person gets two heads. They finish with $225. The second and third person get a heads and a tails (in different orders), and finish with $90. The fourth person ends up with $36.</p>
<p>The average across the four is $110.25, reflecting the compound 5% growth. That’s our positive picture. But three of the four lost money. As the number of flips increases, the proportion who lose money increases, with a rarer but more extraordinarily rich cohort propping up the average.</p>
<p><strong><em>Almost surely</em></strong></p>
<p>Over the very long-term, an individual will tend to get around half heads and half tails. As the number of flips goes to infinite, the number of heads and tails is “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_surely">almost surely</a>” equal.</p>
<p>This means that each person will tend to get a 50% increase half the time (or 1.5 times the initial wealth), and a 40% decrease half the time (60% of the initial wealth). A bit of maths and the time average growth in wealth for an individual is (1.5*0.6)<sup>0.5</sup> ~ 0.95, or approximately a 5% decline in wealth each period. Every individual’s wealth will tend to decay at that rate.</p>
<p>To get an intuition for this, a long run of equal numbers of heads and tails is equivalent to flipping a head and a tail every two periods. Suppose that is exactly what you did – flipped a heads and then flipped a tail. Your wealth would increase to $150 in the first round ($100*1.5), and then decline to $90 in the second ($150*0.6). You get the same result if you change the order. Effectively, you are losing 10% (or getting only 1.5*0.6=0.9) of your money every two periods.</p>
<p>A system where the time average converges to the ensemble average (our population mean) is known as an ergodic system. The system of gambles above is non-ergodic as the time average and the ensemble average diverge. And given we cannot individually experience the ensemble average, we should not be misled by it. The focus on ensemble averages, as is typically done in economics, can be misleading if the system is non-ergodic.</p>
<p><strong><em>The longer term</em></strong></p>
<p>How can we reconcile this expectation of loss when looking at the time average growth with the continued growth of the wealth of some people after 100 periods? It does not seem that everyone is “almost surely” on the path to ruin.</p>
<p>But they are. If we plot the simulation for, say, 1,000 periods rather than 100, there are few winners. Here’s a plot of the average wealth of the population for 1000 periods (the first 100 being as previously shown), plus a log plot of that same growth (Figures 4 and 5).</p>
<p><em>Figure 4: Plot of average wealth over 1000 periods</em><br>
<img src="https://jasonallancollins.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/non_ergodic_figure_4.jpeg?w=1100" alt="Figure 4"></p>
<p><em>Figure 5: Plot of average wealth over 1000 periods (log plot)</em><br>
<img src="https://jasonallancollins.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/non_ergodic_figure_5.jpeg?w=1100" alt="Figure 5"></p>
<p>We can see that despite a large peak in wealth around period 400, wealth ultimately plummets. Average wealth at period 1000 is $24, below the starting average of $100, with a median wealth of 1×10<sup>-21</sup> (rounding to the nearest cent, that is zero). The wealthiest person has $242 thousand dollars, with that being 98.5% of the total wealth. If we followed that wealthy person for another 1000 generations, I would expect them to be wiped out too. [I tested that – at 2000 periods the wealthiest person had $4×10<sup>-7</sup>.] Despite the positive expected value, the wealth of the entire population is wiped out.</p>
<p><strong>Losing wealth on a positive value bet</strong></p>
<p>The first 100 periods of bets forces us to hold a counterintuitive idea in our minds. While the population as an aggregate experiences outcomes reflecting the positive expected value of the bet, the typical person does not. The increase in wealth across the aggregate population is only due to the extreme wealth of a few lucky people.</p>
<p>However, the picture over 1000 periods appears even more confusing. The positive expected value of the bet is nowhere to be seen. How could this be the case?</p>
<p>The answer to this lies in the distribution of bets. After 100 periods, one person had 70% of the wealth. We no longer have 10,000 equally weighted independent bets as we did in the first round. Instead, the path of the wealth of the population is largely subject to the outcome of the bets by this wealthy individual. As we have already shown, the wealth path for an individual almost surely leads to a compound 5% loss of wealth. That individual’s wealth is on borrowed time. The only way for someone to maintain their wealth would be to bet a smaller portion of their wealth, or to diversify their wealth across multiple bets.</p>
<p><strong>The Kelly criterion</strong></p>
<p>On the first of these options, the portion of a person’s wealth they should enter as stakes for a positive expected value bet such as this is given by the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion">Kelly Criterion</a>. The Kelly criterion gives the bet size that would maximise the geometric growth rate in wealth.</p>
<p>The Kelly criterion formula for a simple bet is as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3D%5Cfrac%7Bbp-q%7D%7Bb%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7Bp%28b%2B1%29-1%7D%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=1" alt="f=\frac{bp-q}{b}=\frac{p(b+1)-1}{b}" title="f=\frac{bp-q}{b}=\frac{p(b+1)-1}{b}"></p>
<p>where</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <em>f</em> is the fraction of the current bankroll to wager</p>
<p>  <em>b</em> is the net odds received on the wager (i.e. you receive $b back on top of the $1 wagered for the bet)</p>
<p>  <em>p</em> is the probability of winning</p>
<p>  <em>q</em> is the probability of losing (1-p)
</p></blockquote>
<p>For the bet above, we have <em>p</em>=0.5 and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b%3D%5Cfrac%7B0.5%7D%7B0.4%7D%3D1.25&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="b=\frac{0.5}{0.4}=1.25" title="b=\frac{0.5}{0.4}=1.25">. As offered, we are effectively required to bet <em>f</em>=0.4, or 40% of our wealth, for that chance to win a 50% increase.</p>
<p>However, if we apply the above formula given <em>p</em> and <em>b</em>, a person should bet <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%280.5%2A%281.25%2B1%29-1%29%7D%7B1.25%7D%3D0.1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\frac{(0.5*(1.25+1)-1)}{1.25}=0.1" title="\frac{(0.5*(1.25+1)-1)}{1.25}=0.1">, or 10%, of their wealth each round to maximise the geometric growth rate.</p>
<p>The Kelly criterion is effectively maximising the expected log utility of the bet through setting the size of the bet. The Kelly criterion will result in someone wanting to take a share of any bet with positive expected value.</p>
<p>The Kelly bet “almost surely”” leads to higher wealth than any other strategy in the long run.</p>
<p>If we simulate the above scenarios, but risking only 10% of wealth each round rather than 40% (i.e. heads wealth will increase by 12.5%, tails it will decrease by 10%), what happens? The expected value of the Kelly bet is 0.5*0.125+0.5*-0.1=0.0125 …</p></div></div>

        <p><span>“So what does a game designer do? Are you an artist? Do you design characters and write the story? Or no, wait, you’re a programmer?”</span></p>
<p>Game design is one of those nebulous terms to people outside the game industry that’s about as clear as the “astrophysicist” job title is to me. It’s also my job, so I find myself explaining what game design means to a lot of people from different backgrounds, some of whom don’t know anything about games.</p>
<h2>The Door Problem</h2>
<p>I like to describe my job in terms of “The Door Problem”.</p>
<p>Premise: You are making a game.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there doors in your game?</li>
<li>Can the player open them?</li>
<li>Can the player open every door in the game?</li>
<li>Or are some doors for decoration?</li>
<li>How does the player know the difference?</li>
<li>Are doors you can open green and ones you can’t red? Is there trash piled up in front of doors you can’t use? Did you just remove the doorknobs and call it a day?</li>
<li>Can doors be locked and unlocked?</li>
<li>What tells a player a door is locked and will open, as opposed to a door that they will never open?</li>
<li>Does a player know how to unlock a door? Do they need a key? To hack a console? To solve a puzzle? To wait until a story moment passes?</li>
<li>Are there doors that can open but the player can never enter them?</li>
<li>Where do enemies come from? Do they run in from doors? Do those doors lock afterwards?</li>
<li>How does the player open a door? Do they just walk up to it and it slides open? Does it swing open? Does the player have to press a button to open it?</li>
<li>Do doors lock behind the player?</li>
<li>What happens if there are two players? Does it only lock after both players pass through the door?</li>
<li>What if the level is REALLY BIG and can’t all exist at the same time? If one player stays behind, the floor might disappear from under them. What do you do?</li>
<li>Do you stop one player from progressing any further until both are together in the same room?</li>
<li>Do you teleport the player that stayed behind?</li>
<li>What size is a door?</li>
<li>Does it have to be big enough for a player to get through?</li>
<li>What about co-op players? What if player 1 is standing in the doorway – does that block player 2?</li>
<li>What about allies following you? How many of them need to get through the door without getting stuck?</li>
<li>What about enemies? Do mini-bosses that are larger than a person also need to fit through the door?</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s a pretty classic design problem. SOMEONE has to solve The Door Problem, and that someone is a designer.</p>
<h2>The Other Door Problems</h2>
<p>To help people understand the role breakdowns at a big company, I sometimes go into how other people deal with doors.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Creative Director</span>: “Yes, we definitely need doors in this game.”</li>
<li><strong>Project Manager</strong>: “I’ll put time on the schedule for people to make doors.”</li>
<li><span>Designer</span>: “I wrote a doc explaining what we need doors to do.”</li>
<li><span>Concept Artist</span>: “I made some gorgeous paintings of doors.”</li>
<li><span>Art Director</span>: “This third painting is exactly the style of doors we need.”</li>
<li><span>Environment Artist</span>: “I took this painting of a door and made it into an object in the game.”</li>
<li><span>Animator</span>: “I made the door open and close.”</li>
<li><strong>Sound Designer</strong>: “I made the sounds the door creates when it opens and closes.”</li>
<li><strong>Audio Engineer</strong>: “The sound of the door opening and closing will change based on where the player is and what direction they are facing.”</li>
<li><strong>Composer</strong>: “I created a theme song for the&nbsp;door.”</li>
<li><span>FX Artist</span>: “I added some cool sparks to the door when it opens.”</li>
<li><strong>Writer</strong>: “When the door opens, the player will say, ‘Hey look! The door opened!’ “</li>
<li><span>Lighter</span>: “There is a bright red light over the door when it’s locked, and a green one when it’s opened.”</li>
<li><span>Legal</span>: “The environment artist put a Starbucks logo on the door. You need to remove that if you don’t want to be sued.”</li>
<li><strong>Character Artist</strong>: “I don’t really care about this door until it can start wearing hats.”</li>
<li><span>Gameplay Programmer</span>: “This door asset now opens and closes based on proximity to the player. It can also be locked and unlocked through script.”</li>
<li><strong>AI Programmer:</strong> “Enemies and allies now know if a door is there and whether they can go through it.”</li>
<li><strong>Network&nbsp;Programmer:</strong> “Do all the players need to see the door open at the same time?”</li>
<li><strong>Release Engineer</strong>: “You need to get your doors in by 3pm if you want them on the disk.”</li>
<li><strong>Core Engine Programmer:&nbsp;</strong>“I have optimized the code to allow up to 1024 doors in the game.”</li>
<li><strong>Tools Programmer:</strong> “I made it even easier for you to place doors.”</li>
<li><span>Level Designer</span>: “I put the door in my level and locked it. After an event, I unlocked it.”</li>
<li><strong>UI Designer</strong>: “There’s now an objective marker on the door, and it has its own icon on the map.”</li>
<li><strong>Combat Designer</strong>: “Enemies will spawn behind doors, and lay cover fire as their allies enter the room. Unless the player is looking inside the door in which case they will spawn behind a different door.”</li>
<li><strong>Systems&nbsp;Designer</strong>: “A&nbsp;level 4 player&nbsp;earns 148xp for opening this door at the cost of 3 gold.”</li>
<li><strong>Monetization Designer</strong>: “We could charge the player $.99 to open the door now, or wait 24 hours for it to open automatically.”</li>
<li><span>QA Tester</span>: “I walked to the door. I ran to the door. I jumped at the door. I stood in the doorway until it closed. I saved and reloaded and walked to the door. I died and reloaded then walked to&nbsp;the door. I threw grenades at the door.”</li>
<li><strong>UX / Usability Researcher</strong>: “I found some people on Craigslist to go through the door so we could see what problems crop&nbsp;up.”</li>
<li><strong>&nbsp;Localization</strong>: “Door. Puerta. Porta. Porte.&nbsp;Tür. Dør. Deur. Drzwi. Drws.&nbsp;문”</li>
<li><strong>Producer</strong>: “Do we need to give everyone those&nbsp;doors or can we save them for a pre-order bonus?”</li>
<li><strong>Publisher</strong>: “Those doors&nbsp;are really going to help this game stand out during the fall line-up.”</li>
<li><strong>CEO:</strong> “I want you all to know how much I appreciate the time and effort put into making those doors.”</li>
<li><strong>PR</strong>: “To all our fans, you’re going to go&nbsp;crazy over our next reveal #gamedev #doors #nextgen #retweet”</li>
<li><strong>Community Manager</strong>: “I let the fans know that their concerns about doors will be addressed in the upcoming&nbsp;patch.”</li>
<li><strong>Customer Support</strong>: “A player contacted us,&nbsp;confused about doors. I gave them detailed instructions on how to use them.”</li>
<li><span>Player</span>: “I totally didn’t even notice a door there.”</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the reasons I like this example is because it’s so mundane. There’s an impression that game design is flashy and cool and about crazy ideas and fun all the time. But when I start off with, “Let me tell you about doors…” it cuts straight to the everyday practical considerations.</p>
<p><em>Recent edits:&nbsp;Added&nbsp;localization, character artist, system designer, combat designer, composer, audio engineer, monetization designer, and I think that’ll be it for now.</em></p>

            <p>Do you work with Postgres on a daily basis? Write application code that talks
to Postgres? Then check out the bite-sized SQL snippets below that can help
you work faster!</p>

<h3 id="insert-multiple-rows-in-one-statement">Insert Multiple Rows In One Statement</h3>

<p>The INSERT statement can insert more than one row in a single statement:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>planets</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>gravity</span><span>)</span>
     <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'earth'</span><span>,</span>    <span>9</span><span>.</span><span>8</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'mars'</span><span>,</span>     <span>3</span><span>.</span><span>7</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'jupiter'</span><span>,</span> <span>23</span><span>.</span><span>1</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="insert-a-row-and-return-automatically-assigned-values">Insert a Row and Return Automatically-assigned Values</h3>

<p>Values auto-generated with DEFAULT/serial/IDENTITY constructs can be returned
by the INSERT statement using the RETURNING clause. From the application
code perspective, such an INSERT is executed like a SELECT that returns a
recordset.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- table with 2 column values auto-generated on INSERT</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>items</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>slno</span>       <span>serial</span>      <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span><span>,</span>
    <span>name</span>       <span>text</span>        <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span>
    <span>created_at</span> <span>timestamptz</span> <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>now</span><span>()</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>items</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span>
     <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'wooden axe'</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'loom'</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'eye of ender'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>RETURNING</span> <span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>slno</span><span>,</span> <span>created_at</span><span>;</span>

<span>-- returns:</span>
<span>--      name     | slno |          created_at</span>
<span>-- --------------+------+-------------------------------</span>
<span>--  wooden axe   |    1 | 2020-08-17 05:35:45.962725+00</span>
<span>--  loom         |    2 | 2020-08-17 05:35:45.962725+00</span>
<span>--  eye of ender |    3 | 2020-08-17 05:35:45.962725+00</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="autogenerated-uuid-primary-keys">Autogenerated UUID Primary Keys</h3>

<p>UUIDs are sometimes used instead of primary keys for various reasons. Here is
how you can use an UUID instead of a serial or IDENTITY:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>EXTENSION</span> <span>IF</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>EXISTS</span> <span>"uuid-ossp"</span><span>;</span>

<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>items</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>id</span>    <span>uuid</span> <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>uuid_generate_v4</span><span>(),</span>
    <span>name</span>  <span>text</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>items</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span>
     <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'wooden axe'</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'loom'</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'eye of ender'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>RETURNING</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>name</span><span>;</span>
  
<span>-- returns:</span>
<span>--                   id                  |     name</span>
<span>-- --------------------------------------+--------------</span>
<span>--  1cfaae8c-61ff-4e82-a656-99263b7dd0ae | wooden axe</span>
<span>--  be043a89-a51b-4d8b-8378-699847113d46 | loom</span>
<span>--  927d52eb-c175-4a97-a0b2-7b7e81d9bc8e | eye of ender</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="insert-if-not-existing-update-otherwise">Insert If Not Existing, Update Otherwise</h3>

<p>In Postgres 9.5 and later, you can <em>upsert</em> directly using the ON CONFLICT
construct:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>parameters</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>key</span>   <span>TEXT</span> <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span><span>,</span>
    <span>value</span> <span>TEXT</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>-- when "key" causes a constraint violation, update the "value"</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>parameters</span> <span>(</span><span>key</span><span>,</span> <span>value</span><span>)</span> 
     <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'port'</span><span>,</span> <span>'5432'</span><span>)</span>
<span>ON</span> <span>CONFLICT</span> <span>(</span><span>key</span><span>)</span> <span>DO</span>
            <span>UPDATE</span> <span>SET</span> <span>value</span><span>=</span><span>EXCLUDED</span><span>.</span><span>value</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="copy-rows-from-one-table-into-another">Copy Rows From One Table Into Another</h3>

<p>The INSERT statement has a form where the values can be supplied by a SELECT
statement. Use this to copy rows from one table into another:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- copy between tables with similar columns </span>
  <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>pending_quests</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>quests</span>
        <span>WHERE</span> <span>progress</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>100</span><span>;</span>

<span>-- supply some values from another table, some directly</span>
  <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>archived_quests</span>
       <span>SELECT</span> <span>now</span><span>()</span> <span>AS</span> <span>archival_date</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span>
         <span>FROM</span> <span>quests</span>
        <span>WHERE</span> <span>completed</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you’re looking to bulk-load tables, also check out the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html">COPY command</a>,
which can be used to insert rows from a text or CSV file.</p>

<h3 id="delete-and-return-deleted-information">Delete and Return Deleted Information</h3>

<p>You can use the <code>RETURNING</code> clause to return values from the rows that were
deleted using a bulk-delete statement:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- return the list of customers whose licenses were deleted after expiry</span>
<span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>licenses</span>
      <span>WHERE</span> <span>now</span><span>()</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>expiry_date</span>
  <span>RETURNING</span> <span>customer_name</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="move-rows-from-one-table-into-another">Move Rows From One Table Into Another</h3>

<p>You can move rows from one table to another in a single statement, by using CTEs
with <em>DELETE .. RETURNING</em>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- move yet-to-start todo items from 2020 to 2021</span>
<span>WITH</span> <span>ah_well</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>todos_2020</span>
          <span>WHERE</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>started</span>
      <span>RETURNING</span> <span>*</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>todos_2021</span>
            <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>ah_well</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="update-rows-and-return-updated-values">Update Rows and Return Updated Values</h3>

<p>The RETURNING clause can be used in UPDATEs too. Note that only the new
values of the updated columns can be returned this way.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- grant random amounts of coins to eligible players</span>
   <span>UPDATE</span> <span>players</span>
      <span>SET</span> <span>coins</span> <span>=</span> <span>coins</span> <span>+</span> <span>(</span><span>100</span> <span>*</span> <span>random</span><span>())::</span><span>integer</span>
    <span>WHERE</span> <span>eligible</span>
<span>RETURNING</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>coins</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you need the original value of the updated columns: it is possible through a
self-join, but there is no guarantee of atomicity. Try using a <code>SELECT .. FOR
UPDATE</code> instead.</p>

<h3 id="update-a-few-random-rows-and-return-the-updated-ones">Update a Few Random Rows and Return The Updated Ones</h3>

<p>Here’s how you can choose a few random rows from a table, update them and
return the updated ones, all in one go:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>WITH</span> <span>lucky_few</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span>
      <span>FROM</span> <span>players</span>
  <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>random</span><span>()</span>
     <span>LIMIT</span> <span>5</span>
<span>)</span>
   <span>UPDATE</span> <span>players</span>
      <span>SET</span> <span>bonus</span> <span>=</span> <span>bonus</span> <span>+</span> <span>100</span> 
    <span>WHERE</span> <span>id</span> <span>IN</span> <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>lucky_few</span><span>)</span>
<span>RETURNING</span> <span>id</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="create-a-table-just-like-another-table">Create a Table Just Like Another Table</h3>

<p>Use the CREATE TABLE .. LIKE construct to create a table with the same columns
as another:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>to_be_audited</span> <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>purchases</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>By default this does not create similar indexes, constraints, defaults etc. To
do that, ask Postgres explicitly:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>to_be_audited</span> <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>purchases</span> <span>INCLUDING</span> <span>ALL</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>See the full syntax <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="extract-a-random-set-of-rows-into-another-table">Extract a Random Set of Rows Into Another Table</h3>

<p>Since Postgres 9.5, the TABLESAMPLE feature is available to extract a sample of
rows from a table. There are two sampling methods currently, and <em>bernoulli</em> is
usually the one you want:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- copy 10% of today's purchases into another table</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>to_be_audited</span>
     <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span>
       <span>FROM</span> <span>purchases</span>
<span>TABLESAMPLE</span> <span>bernoulli</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>)</span>
      <span>WHERE</span> <span>transaction_date</span> <span>=</span> <span>CURRENT_DATE</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The <em>system</em> tablesampling method is faster, but does not return a uniform
distribution. See the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-select.html#SQL-FROM">docs</a>
for more info.</p>

<h3 id="create-a-table-from-a-select-query">Create a Table From a Select Query</h3>

<p>You can use the CREATE TABLE .. AS construct to create the table and populate
it from a SELECT query, all in one go:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>to_be_audited</span> <span>AS</span>
      <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span>
        <span>FROM</span> <span>purchases</span>
 <span>TABLESAMPLE</span> <span>bernoulli</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>)</span>
       <span>WHERE</span> <span>transaction_date</span> <span>=</span> <span>CURRENT_DATE</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The resultant table is like a materialized view without a query associated with
it. Read more about <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html">CREATE TABLE .. AS here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="create-unlogged-tables">Create Unlogged Tables</h3>

<p><em>Unlogged</em> tables are not backed by WAL records. This means that updates and
deletes to such tables are faster, but they are not crash-tolerant and cannot
be replicated.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>UNLOGGED</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>report_20200817</span> <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>report_v3</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="create-temporary-tables">Create Temporary Tables</h3>

<p><em>Temporary</em> tables are implicitly unlogged tables, with a shorter lifetime. They
automatically self-destruct at the end of a session (default), or at the end
of the transaction.</p>

<p>Data within temporary tables cannot be shared across sessions. Multiple sessions
can create temporary tables with the same name.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- temp table for duration of the session</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TEMPORARY</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>scratch_20200817_run_12</span> <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>report_v3</span><span>);</span>

<span>-- temp table that will self-destruct after current transaction</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TEMPORARY</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>scratch_20200817_run_12</span>
                      <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>report_v3</span><span>)</span>
                      <span>ON</span> <span>COMMIT</span> <span>DROP</span><span>;</span>

<span>-- temp table that will TRUNCATE itself after current transaction</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TEMPORARY</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>scratch_20200817_run_12</span>
                       <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>report_v3</span><span>)</span>
                       <span>ON</span> <span>COMMIT</span> <span>DELETE</span> <span>ROWS</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>



<p>Comments can be added to any object in the database. Many tools, including
pg_dump, understand these. A useful comment might just avoid a ton of trouble
during cleanup!</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>COMMENT</span> <span>ON</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>idx_report_last_updated</span>
        <span>IS</span> <span>'needed for the nightly report app running in dc-03'</span><span>;</span>

<span>COMMENT</span> <span>ON</span> <span>TRIGGER</span> <span>tgr_fix_column_foo</span>
        <span>IS</span> <span>'mitigates the effect of bug #4857'</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="advisory-locks">Advisory Locks</h3>

<p>Advisory locks can be used to co-ordinate actions between two apps connected to
the <em>same</em> database. You can use this feature to implement a global, distributed
mutex for a certain operation, for example. Read all about it <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html#ADVISORY-LOCKS">here in the
docs</a>.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- client 1: acquire a lock </span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>pg_advisory_lock</span><span>(</span><span>130</span><span>);</span>
<span>-- ... do work ...</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>pg_advisory_unlock</span><span>(</span><span>130</span><span>);</span>

<span>-- client 2: tries to do the same thing, but mutually exclusive</span>
<span>-- with client 1</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>pg_advisory_lock</span><span>(</span><span>130</span><span>);</span> <span>-- blocks if anyone else has held lock with id 130</span>

<span>-- can also do it without blocking:</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>pg_try_advisory_lock</span><span>(</span><span>130</span><span>);</span>
<span>-- returns false if lock is being held by another client</span>
<span>-- otherwise acquires the lock then returns true</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="aggregate-into-arrays-json-arrays-or-strings">Aggregate Into Arrays, JSON Arrays or Strings</h3>

<p>Postgres provides aggregate functions that concatenate values in a <em>GROUP</em> to
yield arrays, JSON arrays or strings:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- get names of each guild, with an array of ids of players that</span>
<span>-- belong to that guild</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>AS</span> <span>guild_name</span><span>,</span> <span>array_agg</span><span>(</span><span>players</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>players</span>
    <span>FROM</span> <span>guilds</span>
    <span>JOIN</span> <span>players</span> <span>ON</span> <span>players</span><span>.</span><span>guild_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>;</span>

<span>-- same but the player list is a CSV string</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>string_agg</span><span>(</span><span>players</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>','</span><span>)</span> <span>-- ...</span>
  
<span>-- same but the player list is a JSONB array</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>jsonb_agg</span><span>(</span><span>players</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>-- ...</span>
  
<span>-- same but returns a nice JSONB object like so:</span>
<span>-- { guild1: [ playerid1, playerid2, .. ], .. }</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>jsonb_object_agg</span><span>(</span><span>guild_name</span><span>,</span> <span>players</span><span>)</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>AS</span> <span>guild_name</span><span>,</span> <span>array_agg</span><span>(</span><span>players</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>players</span>
    <span>FROM</span> <span>guilds</span>
    <span>JOIN</span> <span>players</span> <span>ON</span> <span>players</span><span>.</span><span>guild_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>
<span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>q</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="aggregates-with-order">Aggregates With Order</h3>

<p>While we’re on the topic, here’s how to set the order of values that are passed
to the aggregate function, <em>within each group</em>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- each state with a list of counties sorted alphabetically</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>states</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>string_agg</span><span>(</span><span>counties</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>','</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>counties</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>)</span>
    <span>FROM</span> <span>states</span> <span>JOIN</span> <span>counties</span>
    <span>JOIN</span> <span>states</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>counties</span><span>.</span><span>state_name</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>states</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Yes, there is a trailing ORDER BY clause inside the function call paranthesis.
Yes, the syntax is weird.</p>

<h3 id="array-and-unnest">Array and Unnest</h3>

<p>Use the ARRAY constructor to convert a set of rows, each with one column, into
an array.  The database driver (like JDBC) should be able to map Postgres arrays
into native arrays and might be easier to work with.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- convert rows (with 1 column each) into a 1-dimensional array</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>ARRAY</span><span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>players</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>lifetime_spen…</span></code></pre></figure></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>With QFlow.ai coming out of beta, I wanted to share a bit about what QFlow.ai is and does, but also try to answer the question: why build QFlow.ai?</p>
<p>Let’s begin with the problem. Both I and my co-founder have spent years in executive
positions (CFO, VP Finance, VP Operations, VP Marketing, etc.) at B2B companies. At each company, between sales,
marketing, customer success, and finance, <strong>we had a lot of tools generating a lot of data</strong>. But our organizations were by and large
stuck with outdated tools and skills to analyze that data.</p>

<li><a href="#what-is-next-for-qflow-ai">What’s next?</a></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://blog.qflow.ai/images/DataSources.gif" alt="Lots of data, not much information"></p>
<h2 id="deceivingly-simple-but-important-questions-are-notoriously-difficult-to-answer-for-b2b-sales--marketing-professionals">Deceivingly simple but important questions are notoriously difficult to answer for B2B sales &amp; marketing professionals</h2>
<p>Often the simplest of questions that we ask of our data are difficult to answer reliably,
accurately, and efficiently. Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does the customer acquisition journey look like, from marketing, to sales, to customer success?</li>
<li>What programs, marketing campaigns, and sales tools are yielding the best outcomes? What about relative to cost?</li>
<li>How much time is it taking for our sales reps to follow up on an inbound lead?</li>
<li>What happened to the opportunities that made up the $XX million dollars in last month’s sales forecast?</li>
<li>What types of outbound sales activities are yielding productive vs. unproductive outcomes? Which sales behaviors can we model our playbook around?</li>
<li>How can we more accurately predict conversions? How can we more accurately forecast renewals?</li>
<li>Can we fix lead scoring and build trust between sales and marketing?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="to-properly-analyze-a-b2b-business-a-data-warehouse-is-required-but-alone-is-insufficient">To properly analyze a B2B business, a data warehouse is required but alone is insufficient</h2>
<p>Addressing these questions with intellectual honesty turned out to be a slippery slope.
If we got engineering to stand up a data warehouse, we would then require a data engineering resource. If we got a data engineering resource, we
would then have to compete for her/his time and attention with more interesting projects.</p>
<p>And, even if we successfully had convinced a capable data engineer to help us maintain the data warehouse, that was just the
beginning. <strong>We would <em>still</em> need</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>heavy lifting in terms of data transformation, far beyond the capabilities of SQL</li>
<li>to overcome disagreements / the lack of belief in marketing attribution models</li>
<li>to get stakeholders onboard across sales, marketing, finance, customer success, etc.</li>
<li>analysts to partner with data engineers, <strong>so we could derive <em>useful information</em> from the data</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In short, we had data, but found that too often it resulted in little useful information. Managing our business meant we needed to <strong>discard
“intuition” and embrace complex data</strong>, which in turn meant upgrading our organization’s tool set and skill set.
This simply wasn’t feasible most of the time.</p>
<p>So we built QFlow.ai. Because B2B customer-facing teams deserve to use a modern data toolset and its benefits.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-qflow-ai">What is QFlow.ai?</h2>
<p>QFlow.ai is a platform that enables B2B businesses to adopt machine learning, embrace complexity, and quickly answer the
questions that matter most. It works not by generating more data, but by using the <strong>data that you already have from</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Salesforce.com (standard objects)</li>
<li>Your marketing automation platform (Marketo, Hubspot, Pardot, etc.)</li>
<li>Commonly used marketing platforms (e.g., Google Ads)</li>
<li>Optionally, any custom data that would be relevant to a machine learning model (more on that later)</li>
</ul>
<p>We built QFlow.ai specifically to capture the data needed to engineer a time series based dataset, with
an abstraction layer that sits on top and addresses idiosyncratic implementations of Salesforce.com.</p>
<p>If you’re familiar with idiosyncratic business systems implementation, you might understandably have raised an eyebrow just now.</p>
<p>With the understanding each company is different, we built an account setup process that addresses differences in and
builds on  similarities in implementations. It works so well
that we’ve patented it.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.qflow.ai/images/qflow-ai-setup-wizard.png" alt="Simple setup abstracts away complexity"></p>
<p>Rather than spending days, weeks, or months setting up marketing attribution, our beta customers start getting value out of
QFlow.ai over the course of an early afternoon.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-qflowai-work">How does QFlow.ai work?</h2>
<p>Let’s address how QFlow.ai works at a high level.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, QFlow.ai creates a secure data warehouse for you and you alone — into which it pulls your corporate data</li>
<li>It uses existing data in your CRM and marketing platform to generate data visualizations and power machine learning recipes (more on that later)</li>
<li>It then re-assembles standard and, optionally, custom data to a format amenable to machine learning</li>
<li>And it works out of the box, requiring mere minutes of configuration — not days or months of setup / professional services
<img src="https://blog.qflow.ai/images/QFlow-Platform-Overview-Aug-2020.png" alt="QFlow Platform Basics"></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-does-qflow-ai-do">What are the capabilities of QFlow.ai?</h2>
<p>As of August 2020, the Standard Plan QFlow.ai includes the following major features:</p>
<table>

<h2 id="different-qflow-ai-plans">What differentiates QFlow.ai Standard from QFlow Pro? (Machine Learning Recipes)</h2>
<p>Originally, we planned on much more differentiation. But at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we made a decision to shove as much functionality as
possible into the QFlow.ai standard plan at a very low-friction price  ($699/mo paid annually, $899/mo paid monthly).</p>
<p>The primary difference between the two plans today is that <a href="https://qflow.ai/products/machine-learning">Machine Learning Recipes</a>
are available in Pro. This is not “machine learning” in a box. Instead, we’ve developed templates for machine learning
models that address common use cases in B2B. These templates are building blocks that, when deployed, are trained
and tuned machine learning models. <strong>We call these pre-built templates Machine Learning (ML) Recipes.</strong></p>
<p>Our two most popular Machine Learning recipes address <strong>lead scoring</strong> and <strong>opportunity scoring</strong>.</p>
<p>A typical Machine Learning recipe relies on standard information gleaned from your Salesforce.com and marketing platform integration,
but all recipes in our library can ingest <strong>custom data</strong> (e.g., product usage data, # API calls, seat utilization).</p>
<p>The inferred results from your ML jobs are available both on the QFlow.ai platform
and in your Salesforce.com instance. This way, your employees are able to orient their workday more intelligently without disruption.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-next-for-qflow-ai">What’s on the roadmap for QFlow.ai</h2>
<p>We have built a lot in 9 short months, but there remains a lot to build. If you are a capable data scientist, devops
engineer, marketing or sales professional, or have a skill set that offers a unique contribution to our journey, we’re
interested in talking with you about a fulfilling job.</p>
<p><strong>It’s been humbling to see our earliest customers use QFlow.ai transform the way that they approach generating and retaining B2B revenue
in a cost-effective way.</strong> During our limited private beta, QFlow.ai generated insights for customers that saved hundreds of thousands
of dollars in ineffective spend, increased forecastable pipeline for sales team by 2.4x, and measurably
worked to get marketing, sales, and finance teams on the same page.</p>
<p>So, what’s next? More building, more listening. An occasional blog post to try to let you know what we’re up to.
And a couple dedicated features for Customer Success teams to complement our ML recipe that predicts and helps mitigate churn.</p>
<p>When you’re ready to join us on this journey, let us know by <a href="https://qflow.ai/contact-us">scheduling a time for a demo</a>.
Until then, we’ll be hard at work.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to sort a list in Python, by following the below three steps:</p> <ol><li>Options to sort a list in Python<ul><li>What is the difference between “sort” and “sorted”</li><li>An example of using “sort”</li><li>An example of using “sorted”</li></ul></li><li>How to Sort a List in Reverse<ul><li>Sort a list in Reverse using “sort”</li><li>Sort a list in Reverse using “sorted”</li></ul></li><li>Sort with a Custom Function using Key</li></ol> <h2>1. Options to sort a list in Python</h2> <p>There exist two main options, those are <code>sort()</code> and <code>sorted()</code>, let’s explore them below.</p> <h3>What is the difference between “sort” and “sorted”</h3> <p><code>list.sort()</code> changes the list in place and returns <code>None</code>.</p> <p><code>sorted()</code> takes an iterable and returns a new list, sorted.</p> <h3>An example of using “sort”</h3> <pre title=""># create a list of unordered items
our_list = ["f", "a", "c", "z", "b"]

# sort the list
new_list = our_list.sort()

# print the new list
print(new_list)
# result: None

print(our_list)
# result: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'f', 'z']
</pre> <p>Notice how it changes the list itself, but does not return a value to be placed into a new variable.</p> <h3>An example of using “sorted”</h3> <pre title=""># create a list of unordered items
our_list = ["f", "a", "c", "z", "b"]

# sort the list
new_list = sorted(our_list)

# print the new list
print(new_list)

# result: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'f', 'z']
</pre> <p>Notice how the changes are saved to the new list/variable.</p> <h2>2. How to Sort a List in Reverse</h2> <p>Using the above functions, it’s simple to sort a list in reverse. Just specify the <code>reverse</code> argument and set it to <code>True</code>.</p> <h3>Sort a List in Reverse using “sort”</h3> <pre title=""># create a list of unordered items
our_list = ["f", "a", "c", "z", "b"]

# sort the list
new_list = our_list.sort(reverse=True)

print(our_list)
# result: ['z', 'f', 'c', 'b', 'a']
</pre> <h3>Sort a List in Reverse using “sorted”</h3> <pre title=""># create a list of unordered items
our_list = ["f", "a", "c", "z", "b"]

# sort the list
new_list = sorted(our_list, reverse=True)

# print the new list
print(new_list)

# result: ['z', 'f', 'c', 'b', 'a']
</pre> <h2>3. Sort with a Custom Function using Key</h2> <p>It is also possible to implement your own sorting method. This is done by adding a <code>key</code> parameter and setting it to a method.</p>  <p>For example:</p> <pre title=""># create a list of different length items
our_list = ["fasd", "asstt", "cqasf", "zqfwsef", "ba"]

# sort the list, by `len`
new_list = sorted(our_list, key=len)

# print the new list
print(new_list)

# result: ['ba', 'fasd', 'asstt', 'cqasf', 'zqfwsef']
</pre> <p>Just as we used <code>sorted</code> here, you could also have used <code>list.sort</code> as follows:</p> <pre title="">our_list.sort(key=len)
</pre> <p>As before, you can also combine the <code>reverse=True</code> argument should you want the reverse order.</p> <pre title="">our_list.sort(key=len, reverse=True)

# or

sorted(our_list, key=len, reverse=True)
</pre> <p>You could also swap out the use of the <code>len</code> method as the custom <code>key</code> with your own function, or lambda, to sort by some custom choice.</p> <p>For example:</p>  <pre title="">student_tuples = [('john', 'A', 15),('jane', 'B', 12),('dave', 'B', 10),]
sorted(student_tuples, key=lambda student: student[2]) 

# result: [('dave', 'B', 10), ('jane', 'B', 12), ('john', 'A', 15)]
</pre> <p>Or in another example:</p> <pre title="">lst = [('candy','30','100'), ('apple','10','200'), ('baby','20','300')]
lst.sort(key=lambda x:x[1])
print(lst)

# result: [('apple', '10', '200'), ('baby', '20', '300'), ('candy', '30', '100')]
</pre>  </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blogContent"><p><img alt="Pull doughnuts" src="https://www.grouparoo.com/_next/static/images/doughnuts-90d02f03fc3e2d5704ed88886a47f9df.jpg"></p><p>There’s an underlying pattern prevalent today in many digital marketing tools that is causing problems. Wasted time, overpaying, slow velocity, and privacy issues for your customers are some of the results of this pattern. The problem is the over-reliance on Events. Specifically, the problem is that many marketing tools live in a world where they expect to be “pushed” data, when it would be so much better if they were “pulling” data when they needed it.</p><p>In this blog post, we’ll explore the problems with event-based “Push” marketing &amp; analytics tools, and how we can fix them by switching to a “Pull” based solution, like the one that <a href="https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo">Grouparoo</a> is building.</p><h2>The Problems with “Push” and Events</h2><p>We have conducted interviews with over 70 marketing teams of all sizes throughout the world. What follows is a synthesis of some of the common problems they face with their current marketing tools.</p><h3>Overpaying</h3><p>One of the most telling critiques of event-based SaaS marketing tools is the fact that marketing teams are /actively/ pruning the events they are sending to control costs. Tools like Segment work best when you can build a robust profile of your customers' activity, but Segment charges you more when you store more data! Segment essentially holds their functionality hostage as you gain more users who in turn produce more events. Countless marketers lamented pain of having to decide which events to keep tracking versus which to stop tracking. Inevitably, a new campaign idea would hit them a few months later that would need the event that they stopped tracking. These teams and marketers just didn’t have the money to keep sending every event. This takes us to the Stale Data problem.</p><h3>Stale Data</h3><p>When using only events to model your customers, there’s a huge lag time between when you start capturing that data and when you can use it. For example, say you want to run a campaign targeting customers who haven’t purchased in 6 months. If you start sending <code>purchase</code> events in June, the soonest you can start your campaign is December. Not only is that a long time to wait, but you’ve also sacrificed your team’s agility to modify those events or the campaign while you wait, <a href="https://www.grouparoo.com/blog/the-shots-you-get-to-take">minimizing the shots you get to take</a>.</p><h3>Lost History</h3><p>In addition to the slow ramp up time for a new campaign based on events, there’s the problem of lost events. With poor mobile connections, errors on your web pages &amp; apps, slow vendors, and increasingly prevalent ad-blocking tools, it’s very easy to lose an event. Every marketer we talked to had their own less-than-scientific process they used to explain discrepancies between events and product data. Everyone had a different process and no one really trusted an event-based data source. If events are the only way you model your customers, it can be devastating if you miss a <code>changed-email-address</code> event - you might never be able to reach your customers at all!</p><p>Coupling this issue with the Stale Data problem, there’s no way to fully model customers you had before you started sending events. There’s no way to compare the profile you’ve built in Segment against your product database, where the customer’s data is actually stored with confidence.</p><h3>Privacy Nightmare</h3><p>Finally, there’s a challenging privacy story regarding events. You have a relationship with your customers and part of that relationship is based on trust. How sure are you that Segment or Mixpanel is storing your customers' data safely? How many other services do your events pass though on the way to them? Google Analytics or Google Tag Manager? AdMob? Facebook or Twitter Pixels? The list goes on and on. Any one of these vendors is a potential vector for attack, event theft, or event manipulation.</p><p>With regulations like GDPR and CCPA and many more on the way, you have a clear legal responsibility to keep your customers' data safe. Part of that responsibility is ensuring that the companies you share data with will update, delete, and anonymize data when <em>you</em> ask them too. What’s your process for doing that for all of your past events?</p><h2>The future is "Pull"</h2><p>How would you build things if you were starting today? We would focus on pulling in data from our existing sources, of course!</p><p>Now, imagine you were starting to build a new marketing tool from scratch, like <a href="https://www.grouparoo.com/">Grouparoo</a> is. You aren’t burdened by the poor legacy choices of Segment, Mixpanel, and the rest. How would you build things if you were starting today? We would focus on pulling in data from our existing data sources. With Grouparoo, events are a way to augment your customer profiles, not the main source of critical data.</p><p>Grouparoo’s goal is to make it easy for non-technical members of your team to build robust customer profiles and groups. Then, they can synchronize that data in a safe way to communication and advertising partners. A highly-functioning digital marketing team can quickly add new profile properties, augment them with data from your product and data warehouse(s), and start running a new campaign in minutes, rather than weeks.</p><h3>Within your Firewall</h3><p>To be in the best position to pull in data, the Grouparoo application should be located within your company firewall. This means that Grouparoo should run on <em>your</em> servers and have (read) access to your databases. In this way, no data ever leaves your company’s control, and you can always inspect, audit, and change it. You don’t need to send your customer data over the open internet to a third party just to build a new cohort.</p><h3>Safe and Secure</h3><p>Since your customer data lives where it belongs on your servers, you can make changes and deletions as needed, and you can prove it. You can build a transparent GDPR/CCPA process at your company with Grouparoo. Grouparoo has robust access controls and logs to ensure that every profile and group is managed the way it should be.</p><h3>Cost Controls</h3><p>Since Grouparoo is running on your servers, there’s no additional cost to import more data. If you want to add more properties to your customer profiles to build more fine-grained groups and cohorts, then do it! Have you imported a facet you no longer need? Delete it! Grouparoo doesn't charge per event, or any other measure of data quantity, so you are free to experiment at will.</p><h3>Always up-to-date</h3><p>The “Pull” pattern has a wonderful property; Grouparoo can check up on the data whenever we are about to use it! This means that rather than waiting for an event to (possibly) be sent to Grouparoo to update a customer’s preferences or LTV, we can ask the primary source. Grouparoo will always re-import the properties of every profile before sending a communication to the customer, or syncing with a third party. This means that you can be sure that you’ll always be working with the latest customer preferences, purchase, email address, names, etc. when communicating with them. No lost events will prevent you from communicating effectively.</p><h3>Ready for ad-blocking technology by respecting consumer choices</h3><p>Finally, the pattern of tracking and sending <strong>so many</strong> events from our sites and applications is leading to more and more consumers blocking tools like Segment, Mixpanel, Amplitude, and Google Analytics from getting any events at all. In fact, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192830/apple-safari-intelligent-tracking-privacy-full-third-party-cookie-blocking">major browsers are now shipping with defaults to prevent third-party tracking and cookies</a>. Rather than fight the modern privacy-conscious consumer because your marketing stack relies on events, embrace the choices they are making. Utilize your source-of-truth of their behavior and preferences you already have, your product database.</p><h2>Grouparoo’s Open-Source Promise</h2><p>There’s still a place for events in your marketing stack, but they shouldn’t be the primary source of any piece of customer data. Grouparoo’s goal is to embrace the “Pull” data model as much as we can, and this means making it as easy as possible for you to install and run it within your cloud. To that end, Grouparoo’s core product is <strong>available for free</strong>, under the <a href="https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo/blob/master/LICENSE.txt">Mozilla 2.0 Open Source License</a>.
