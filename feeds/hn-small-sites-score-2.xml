<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>The COVID pandemic made me think about how arcaic the current education system is. I should say, the current <em>delivery</em> of education. The core idea for a fairer education relies in a sort of <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>, but at the state level. Traditional teachers won’t be replaced by a classroom computer, but would see their role reshaped: from teachers to facilitators. For example, a 1-hour class might include a 40min video of the subject delivered by a top specialist followed by 20min of classroom activities and Q&amp;As.</p><p>The current delivery of educational subjects is in the hands of an army of teachers. The quality of teaching is highly variable, and the schools with the best ratings are usually the ones in rich neighborhoods. Good ratings on a school can alone make or break the real estate market, driving house prices and rents in the nearby radius. Public schools should provide a level playing field for everyone, but this is not the case, and never has been. Rich parents can afford higher rents while poorer families are driven in the outskirsts of a city, where lower rated schools usually are. Public housing in high-income areas have historically provided a solution for this, but the chance of being accepted in a specific public housing project are still highly randomized.</p><p>During the second wave of the COVID pandemic in the UK in January 2021, the schools were again shut down. Interestingly, the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/teach">BBC started broadcasting curriculum-mapped lessons</a> on primary and secondary school subjects, for free. If we were to push this concept to its very limit, imagine what a country like the UK could be able to offer to its pupils. The best of the best delivered to anyone. A physics lesson delivered by Prof. Brian Cox, a science lesson on evolutionary byology delivered by Richard Dawkins or Sir David Attenborough, an english class delivered by Stephen Fry. This is already happening in higher education and in the workplace anyways - learning and training has been remote for ages now. But this shouldn’t be the end of the classroom as the social aspect of school is as important as the educational one. Teachers could see their role reshaped towards being educators or classroom facilitators, answering pupils questions and coordinating classroom activities.</p><p>I’ve grown up in Europe, where education is generally considered quite good. My school experience up to College has been scarred by mediocrity, with some notable horrific experiences and a couple of teachers who became like mentors to me. I’m sure a lot of people can relate to my experience. Later in life and like many like me, I self-taught myself software engineering using YouTube, Coursera and online material. I’ve had the chance to follow the best courses from the best teachers at Stanford, MIT and so on. Being a drop-out from College I was even able to complete my degree by re-enlisting 10 years later and rather than going back to the classroom, I was studying the subject on Khan Academy and textbooks. The potential of a unified, highest-quality possible education delivery for everyone is immense. The solution is not necessarily remote learning, but the tools given by remote learning.</p><p>I wonder whether in the aftermath of the pandemic and the combination of widespread use of conferencing tools, unified delivery of learning might become a serious subject of discussion to build a fairer future for our children.</p></div></article></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/procrastination_work_no.png" alt="Q2 Time: how to work without a looming deadline"></p><p>You have work to do, but the deadline is in a couple of weeks or months. Or you have no deadline at all.</p><p>How do you do great work every day instead of the usual last-minute push before a deadline?<br>A vitally important question in the era of knowledge work.</p><h3>The mythical land of Q2, the important but not urgent</h3><p>This post is all about the Q2 of the Eisenhower matrix - the part that many procrastinators never get around to.</p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/eisenhower_Q2.png" alt="Eisenhower Matrix"></p><p>It's a shame because Q2 is where all the future-focused, strategic work lies: learning new skills, investing into new endeavors, working on new branches of a business,...</p><p><strong>Q2 is the quadrant of potential.</strong></p><p>Without spending time in Q2 frequently, we tread water in life, doing only the things that we've always done, or that we're forced into at the last minute. Just enough to get by, but not to go to bed with a sense of pride.</p><p>Let's change this.</p><p>We'll start with the first obstacle to working on non-urgent important tasks—the reactive habit of&nbsp;<em>checking</em>.</p><h2>Why checking things became a default habit</h2><p>If you have Internet access, you probably developed this simple habit:</p><p><em>When I get bored, I check ___________.</em></p><p>This is a problem.</p><p>Work often isn't engaging at the beginning of a session. It can seem onerous, never-ending, and boring (before you get into the problem-solving mode).</p><p>If you always have an easy way to get distracted, you'll take it. Often.</p><p>When you&nbsp;<em>check</em>&nbsp;a site or app, you get a bit of dopamine - a feel-good neurochemical.</p><p>This dopamine hit makes it addictive to check stuff. Just the possibility of something new, random, or unexpected is exciting, even if that new thing ends up being a work email.</p><p>Checking things is the cornerstone of&nbsp;<strong>a reactive work style:</strong></p><ul><li>You never do something unless it's in reply to someone else.</li><li>You wait for others to remind you multiple times to do something.</li><li>You refresh inboxes constantly and keep them open at all times.</li><li>When you find yourself bored, you immediately check something.</li></ul><p><strong>This way of working is devoid of initiative. It's an addiction to new information disguised as being "responsive."</strong></p><p>Nothing non-urgent ever gets done.</p><p>How can we get ourselves to do it?</p><h2>2 ways to do non-urgent work</h2><p>The first way is to make Q2 feel like Q1 - to make it urgent. There's a variety of ways to do it.</p><p>The second way is to choose to work on Q2 because you can.</p><h2>1. Make Q2 feel like Q1</h2><p>When we're on a deadline, we spring into action.</p><p>The consequences of not acting become clear: we'll get fired, fail a class, or ruin a relationship...</p><p>The fear of these scenarios is visceral. It drives us to finally get things done.</p><p>While reliance on this fear is not ideal, we can use it.</p><h3>Create consequences for your actions (or lack thereof)</h3><p>If you know that without a deadline, you don't work, create deadlines.</p><p>There are many ways of doing this:</p><ul><li><strong>Tell your coworker you'll do something.</strong><br>If you tell a coworker that you'll have done something by Tuesday, they will expect you to deliver. If you don't, you'll cause them to be disappointed or angry. That's a clear consequence.</li><li><strong>Promise publicly you'll do something.</strong><br>If you promise on social media or any other public forum that you'll do something by a certain time, you're putting your reputation at risk.</li><li><strong>Schedule an event you don't want to miss.</strong><br>If it's 3PM and you schedule a fancy dinner with your partner at 6PM, it becomes clear that you have only the next 3 hours to get things done (unless you want to miss the dinner). Having more events in your schedule highlights the space available for work. If there's little time for delays, you'll probably adapt and not delay.</li><li><strong>Sign up for&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.stickk.com/">Stickk</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.beeminder.com/">Beeminder.</a></strong><br>Both of these services allow you to make a financial bet against yourself. They also help you put your goals into a concrete format. Losing your own money if you don’t do something can be a powerful motivating force.</li></ul><p>Besides these ways of creating a deadline for yourself, you can also heighten your awareness of not working when you're meant to.</p><h3>Create a crystal clear sense of "Now I focus"</h3><p>When a deadline is looming over us, we feel this visceral feeling of "now I really need to work."</p><p>Suddenly, every available hour is an hour we can use to work. Having so much to do and so little time to do it makes us use every minute.</p><p>In other words, it becomes crystal clear to us that&nbsp;<strong>now is the time to focus.</strong></p><p>We can use other tools to get to that feeling.</p><h4>Work alongside others</h4><p>Our environment shapes our behavior in a profound way. Imagine you're working next to a coworker who's focusing intensely. They can also see your screen when they occasionally glance away from their work.</p><p>Would that inspire you to focus a bit more?</p><p>The research says yes.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/497818?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">One study</a>&nbsp;found that the presence of another person improves performance by 16-32%. Interestingly, the study notes: "low productivity workers are the most sensitive to the behavior of peers."</p><p>Now, if you can't use this in your physical environment and work with your coworker, or partner, you can use a service like&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.focusmate.com/">Focusmate.</a></p><p>It allows you to work with 50 minute sessions with others who want to focus on their work.</p><p>You can try the service for free and see if it helps you.</p><h4>Make a grand gesture</h4><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/tips/hotel.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="5 Star hotel"></p><p>A slightly more esoteric way of boosting your awareness of "now I work" is to make a grand gesture.</p><p>Cal Newport describes this strategy in Deep Work and uses the example of J K Rowling.</p><p>When Rowling was stuck writing The Goblet of Fire, she decided to check into a 5 star hotel.</p><p>A stay in a hotel like that is expensive. You can spend hundreds of dollars every day.</p><p>For Rowling, the whole purpose of staying in that hotel was to write. If she was paying thousands of pounds every week, it heightened her awareness time passing. She was paying for every minute, so she'd better produce something worth it.</p><p>Now, this grand gesture is not available to all of us, but another is:&nbsp;<strong>a trip.</strong></p><p>To help himself decide whether to start his online training program AltMBA, Seth Godin went into the desert for a few days with his friends.</p><p>He had one objective for himself: decide.</p><p>He thought about the project, wrote about it, and ultimately decided to commit and do it.</p><p>Could you take a trip somewhere as an opportunity to make a decision you’ve been putting off?</p><p>If you don't want to make yourself work using the above, the other choice is creating a routine in your life to take on non-urgent work without pressure.</p><h2>2. Choosing to work now</h2><h3>Make time for Q2 or it won't happen</h3><p>The anti-dote to reactive site and app checking is&nbsp;<strong>consciously blocking out big uninterrupted chunks of time.</strong></p><p>Our mind works best when we focus on 1 task for an extended period of time, without interruptions.</p><p>If you have email or social media open at all times, you'll get interrupted.</p><h3>Decide to set specific times aside</h3><p>When was the last time you had 2+ hours to work on non-urgent tasks? A time when you didn’t check any distractions and had no one interrupt you?</p><p>If you have to starch your memory extensively to find an answer, then it may be time for a change.</p><p>Uninterrupted time is crucial for productivity, particularly when it comes to dealing with complex or ambiguous tasks.</p><p>It’s also crucial to specify what you’re going to work on. Without a clear intention, the urgent work and unproductive habits will take over.</p><p>The simplest way to do this is to put a big block on the calendar and put what you need to do as the title. You can also add any links or notes to the description.</p><p>When in your week can you do this? When can you make time for futures oriented, important work?</p><h3>Choose to work because you can</h3><p>The last point may well be the most important one. Much of our time, we don’t choose to work. We’re forced to do so by our circumstances. That puts us in a defensive position.</p><p>But we can actively&nbsp;<em>choose</em>&nbsp;to do work. Choose to write that email. Choose to reach out to someone. Choose to start working on the next project. Go on offense.</p><p>Fear is the default motivator for many of us. If I don't do this, I will [insert unpleasant consequences here].</p><p>There are other ways, other internal narratives that we can use.</p><p>"I'm doing this because I have the time and I'm alert and able.""I'll do this because the sooner I do it, the better.""I'll get this done now because it would be awesome if it existed."</p><p>Instead of focusing on what happens if you&nbsp;<em>don't</em>&nbsp;do something, focus on what happens if you&nbsp;<em>do</em>.</p><p>Switch from the fear of consequences to desire for a specific awesome version of the future.</p><p><strong>When you do block out a 2 hour block of time and find yourself with nothing urgent to do, choose to work.</strong>&nbsp;Because you can. Because you want to create something awesome. Because it will make you happy at the end of the day, week, month, and year.</p><p>Don't wait until circumstances force you, go on offense now!</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>There are 2 main ways to get non-urgent work done:</p><ol start=""><li>Make it feel urgent.</li><li>Choose to do it.</li></ol><p>To make work feel more urgent, you can:</p><ul><li><p>Create consequences for your inaction.</p><ul><li>Tell your coworker you'll do something.</li><li>Promise publicly you'll do something.</li><li>Schedule an event you don't want to miss.</li><li>Sign up for&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.stickk.com/">Stickk</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.beeminder.com/">Beeminder.</a></li></ul></li><li><p>Make yourself hyper-aware of not taking action.</p><ul><li>Work alongside others with&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.focusmate.com/">Focusmate.</a></li><li>Make not taking action feel wasteful to yourself (scrolling social media in a 5 star hotel).</li></ul></li></ul><p>To choose to do non-urgent work:</p><ul><li>Block out big uninterrupted chunks of time for non-urgent work.</li><li>Assign specific times to specific tasks.</li><li>When you have the opportunity, choose to work because you can.</li></ul><p>Pick 1 strategy out of this article and apply it today!</p></article></div>]]>

<p>Facebook has given an ultimatum for WhatsApp users to either share their data with Facebook or leave the service. And that date is February 8th.</p>
<p>One of the most appealing things about WhatsApp is it’s end to end encryption. Even though their are other chat apps, no one provides end to end encryption to chats by default other than WhatsApp and Signal. </p>
<p>Not even Telegram provide encryption by default, and you need to start a secret chat to enable end to end encryption.</p>
<p>One of the most important things in iOS 14 is the ability for users see what kind of data apps are collecting from their users. </p>
<p>So in light of all this I went through the top 10 social networking/chat apps to see how much data they are collecting in comparison to Signal, and explain why I won’t use Signal and what we can do instead.</p>
<h2>The top 10 social media/chat apps</h2>

<h2>Telegram</h2>
<p>Telegram is one of the better apps when we compare with the others in this group. They collect relatively small amount of data.</p>
<p>It is currently the number 1 in my region, Telegram is extremely popular in my region because it provides a great way to share pirated content. </p>
<p>There is no limit to the file size that you can upload on Telegram, and there is no limit for the number of users that a Telegram group can have.</p>
<p>This makes it an ideal place for people to share pirated copies of movies, games, songs in groups with hundreds of users.</p>

<p>I’m bit reluctant to use Telegram due to its poor user interface, and its connections to Russia.</p>
<p>To clarify what I meant by poor user interface, on the android device that I tried Telegram, I was unable to select multiple chats, and deleting a chat is a multi step process. It doesn’t have to be that complicated.</p>
<h2><strong>WhatsApp</strong> </h2>
<p>WhatsApp is currently the number 2 in my region, and when compared with Telegram, WhatsApp is collecting a decent amount of data to track you.</p>

<h2>Facebook and <strong>Messenger</strong> </h2>
<p>Facebook is a vacuumed of user data, they collect everything that they can get their hands on.</p>
<p>The Messenger app is also no different to the Facebook app. I’m not installing either of them, no matter how much Facebook mobile website tries to funnel me to installing their Messenger app.</p>

<h2>IMO</h2>
<p>IMO is also a chat app with a niche audience. Even though it’s not popular in the USA, IMO is quite popular in Southeast Asia as a platform to share adult content, like a live cam website.</p>
<p>But it too has chat capabilities just like any other chat app, and it too collects a decent amount of user data, even more than WhatsApp.</p>

<h2>Viber</h2>
<p>When it comes to my friends and relatives Viber is the second most popular chat app behind WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger.</p>
<p>Especially girls love using Viber because of the large variety of stickers, that they can select in the app.</p>
<p>Personally, I don’t like using viber, and find it too bloated. Yes, the stickers are nice, but what I need is a chat app, not a sticker app.</p>
<p>And it appears Viber is also collecting lot of data as well.</p>

<p><strong>I’m skipping Parent control app, because even though listed as a chat app it does not appear to look like a chat app.</strong></p>
<h2>Signal</h2>
<p>When it comes to chat apps, it’s unbelievable to see that Signal is basically not collecting any user data.</p>
<p>They also provide end to end encrypted chats by default.</p>
<p>The lack of collecting user data is a sign that they don’t need to sell user data as a way to make money. </p>
<p>Signal is currently depending on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://signal.org/donate" target="_blank">donations</a>, and even if they find other ways to monetize the service, as long as they are not collecting data, we can be sure that our data is not being used to monetize the service.</p>

<h2>BOTIM</h2>
<p>I have not used the BOTIM and I have no idea why it’s there in the charts ahead of other chat apps like WeChat and Line.</p>
<p>Maybe BOTIM has a niche audience that I don’t know about.</p>

<h2>Why <strong>I’</strong>n not/<strong>can’t</strong> use Signal</h2>
<p>I love to use Signal, I wish everyone can use Signal, and I wish I can use Signal, but I just can’t.</p>
<p>I have installed any tried using Signal couple of times, but whenever I install it it’s basically a ghost town. No one is using it and I can’t convince anyone else to join, because none of their friends on Signal either.</p>
<p>The network effect on WhatsApp is strong, and almost all of my non techie regular WhatsApp users will just accept the new TOS and will share their data with Facebook. They just want a chat app and that is what WhatsApp is providing.</p>
<p>Even if I install Signal, I will be the only one in my network using it. And no one will be willing to use Signal just to chat with me.</p>
<p>I will try to keep my personal messages away from WhatsApp as much as possible, but. I won’t be able to leave my WhatsApp groups. I will use iMessages whenever I’m chatting with someone with an Apple device.</p>
<h2>What we <strong>actually</strong> need</h2>
<p>What we actually need is not Signal, WhatsApp or Telegram. What we need is a protocol, just like email but for chat and apps that build on top of this protocol.</p>
<p>There are such protocols, but no major company is willing to use them for their chat apps.</p>
<p>If we have such protocol, then we will be able to switch apps with ease, without having to worry about the network effect or losing out chats just like we can do with our emails.</p>
<p>So please everyone try to invest on a protocol, not on an individual app.</p>

<p>Welcome to the new world of engineering management! You’ve entered a brave new world that will be significantly different than your life as an individual contributor. Here are some tips I’ve learned over time.</p>



<p>You have one goal: <strong>maximize your team’s productive work</strong>.</p>



<p>That’s it. Do that and you will succeed. Do anything else and you fail. Life is simple.</p>



<p>Let’s break that down into a few key ideas.</p>



<h2>Maximize Your Team Member’s Potential</h2>



<p>First, let’s assess the type of engineers you may have on your team.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Solid</strong> = Can solve well defined problems.</li><li><strong>Bad</strong> = Can’t solve well defined problems.</li><li><strong>Junior</strong> = Bad engineers but have the excuse of being very early in their career or being put into a new situation.</li><li><strong>Leaders</strong> = Can determine the problems that need to be solved and help others get the necessary work done.</li></ul>



<p>How should you manage the different types of engineers?</p>



<p><strong>Engineering Leaders</strong>. If you are a new manager, you are likely the only Leader in your team. If you are lucky enough to have team members that are Leaders, your life will be easy. Just keep giving them tough problems and stay out of their way.</p>



<p><strong>Solid Engineers</strong>. These engineers will hopefully make up most of your team. They can tackle well defined problems, so to maximize their current utility, work on giving them the minimum definition they need and then get out of their way. To maximize their long term success, you want to try and turn Solid Engineers into Leaders. One way to do this is to keep giving them tougher problems with less definition and let them grow into Leaders.</p>



<p><strong>Bad Engineers. </strong>Hopefully you don’t inherit any Bad Engineers. If you do, you need to quickly assess whether it is worth the management effort to get them to Solid Engineers, or get them off your team (either by firing or a transfer to another team).</p>



<p><strong>Junior Engineers. </strong>As a new manager, you are likely to have several Junior Engineers. I’ve found that everyone is happiest if both the Junior Engineer and yourself acknowledge that Junior Engineers do not produce useful work today. Instead, both the Junior Engineer and yourself should focus your efforts on turning them into a Solid Engineer as soon as possible. As a manager, you can accelerate their growth by (1) giving them training tasks, i.e. tasks that may not be the most relevant to your team’s productivity today, but help them grow as an individual and (2) giving them extra 1 on 1 attention. While this extra effort will consume significant time now, you can have a Solid Engineer within a few months. Plus, this extra effort is nothing compared to the effort you would later need to spend to move someone from a Bad Engineer to Solid Engineer.</p>



<h2>Maximize Your Team Output</h2>



<p>Now that we have covered the basics of maximizing individual team member’s performance, let’s move on to some tips for maximizing your whole team’s output.</p>



<h3>Your Output</h3>



<p>First, you need to plan that your personal coding output will basically be zero. You may occasionally do some coding, but you need to remember that you are judged on your team’s output now, not just your own. So any coding project you do needs to be weighed against the opportunity cost of you spending that same amount of time improving your team members. I’ve found that this likely means you will only end up coding (1) early prototypes, (2) refactorings, or (3) nice to have projects. Instead, you need to switch to thinking about your team’s output.</p>



<h3>Meetings</h3>



<p>As a new manager, your life can easily be consumed by meetings. You will now be in charge of 1:1s and team meetings, and also get invited to lots of cross team meetings. My biggest regret as an early manager is saying yes to every meeting. I personally am fine with delegating work, but my weakness was that I still wanted to know everything that was going on. Before you know it, you will spend all day running from meeting to meeting. This is bad for three reasons: (1) you don’t have time to think, (2) you can’t adapt to emergencies and (3) your team members will become too shy to schedule 1:1s with you since they assume you are doing something important.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So fight the good fight and minimize the number of meetings. I advocate the following meeting philosophy:</p>



<ul><li>All meetings should have a predefined agenda, even 1:1s.</li><li>Have the minimum number of people in the meeting (ie prefer 1:1s or small groups)</li><li>Minimize the number of meetings that are just status updates. Most of these can likely be replaced by email, Slack, or a document.</li><li>Group meetings into blocks. I’ve had success with the following type of meeting schedule:<ul><li>Monday AM: Sprint starts / big team meetings.</li><li>Monday PM: 1:1s.</li><li>Tuesday: No recurring meetings.</li><li>Wednesday: Cross team meetings.</li><li>Thursday: No recurring meetings.</li><li>Friday AM: Sprint check ins / sprint end meetings.</li><li>Friday PM: 1:1s.</li></ul></li></ul>



<h3>Documents</h3>



<p>A well written document is one of your two new best friends. The power of a well written document is that it (1) forces you to clarify your thoughts, (2) provides a clear documentation trail and (3) prevents you from repeating yourself. There is nothing worse than having a meeting with a lot of people that leads to some very important decisions, but then no one can seem to remember what those decisions are. Write, write, and write some more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Do Productive Work</h2>



<p>At this point your team should be doing lots of work. But how do you guarantee that this work is productive? Let me introduce you to your second new best friend: <a href="https://www.whatmatters.com/get-started/">Objectives and Key Results</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main principles of OKRs are:</p>



<ul><li>Objectives should be clearly defined aspirational goals</li><li>Key results are specific quantitative measures</li><li>Each objective should be supported by 3-5 key results</li><li>Ideally key results can be measured on a 0-100% scale</li><li>To make key results push the boundaries of your team, it is recommended that<ul><li>A key result is considered achieved if &gt;=70% is achieved</li><li>Key results are not tied to pay</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>Many companies use a mix of yearly and quarterly OKRs. I personally find the quarter OKRs most useful as a management tool. The yearly OKRs are more useful for upper management to set clear company wide goals, but I’ve found that setting yearly team goals are not very useful unless they directly tie into a company OKR. Instead, I would focus on writing solid quarterly team OKRs.</p>



<p>For OKRs to truly work, you need to get buy in from the whole team. In order to get buy in, you should:</p>



<ol><li>Do the necessary prep work to deeply understand the company priorities and OKRs.</li><li>Involve your team members in developing the team OKRs.</li><li>Set up a central dashboard to track your progress on OKRs.</li><li>Make that dashboard a central part of your meetings. Kick off team meetings by looking at the dashboard and calling out progress.</li><li>Have a retrospective at the end of the recording period to understand why your team succeeded or failed to achieve OKRs.</li><li>Rinse and repeat. Your first several quarters of OKRs likely won’t go well. But please don’t give up until you have tried for at least 4 quarters in a row.</li></ol>



<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>Good luck, hope these tips help!</p>

Given its safety, </span><span>w</span><span>e call for immediate widespread increased vitamin D intakes</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>Vitamin D modulates thousands of genes and many aspects of immune function, both innate and adaptive. The scientific evidence</span><span>1</span><span>&nbsp;shows that:</span></p><p><span>Vitamin D is well known to be essential, but most people do not get enough. Two common definitions of inadequacy are deficiency &lt; 20ng/ml (50nmol/L), the target of most governmental organizations, and insufficiency &lt; 30ng/ml (75nmol/L), the target of several medical societies &amp; experts.</span><span>2</span><span>&nbsp;Too many people have levels below these targets. </span><span>Rates of vitamin D deficiency &lt;20ng/ml exceed 33% of the population in most of the world, and most estimates of insufficiency &lt;30ng/ml are well over 50% (but much higher in many countries).</span><span>3</span><span>&nbsp;Rates are even higher in winter, and several groups have notably worse deficiency: the overweight, those with dark skin (especially far from the equator), and care home residents. These same groups face increased COVID-19 risk.</span></p><p><span>It has been shown that 3875 IU (97mcg) daily is required for 97.5% of people to reach 20ng/ml, and 6200 IU (155mcg) for 30ng/ml,</span><span>4</span><span>&nbsp;intakes far above all national guidelines. Unfortunately, the report that set the US RDA included an admitted statistical error in which required intake was calculated to be ~10x too low.</span><span>4</span><span>&nbsp;Numerous calls in the academic literature to raise official recommended intakes had not yet resulted in increases by the time SARS-CoV-2 arrived. Now, many papers indicate that vitamin D affects COVID-19 more strongly than most other health conditions, with increased risk at levels &lt; 30ng/ml (75nmol/L) and severely greater risk &lt; 20ng/ml (50nmol/L).</span><span>1</span></p><p><span>Evidence to date </span><span>suggests </span><span>the possibility that the COVID-19 pandemic sustains itself in large part &nbsp;through infection of those with low vitamin D, and that deaths are concentrated largely in those with deficiency. The mere possibility that this is so should compel urgent gathering of more vitamin D data. </span><span>Even without more data</span><span>, </span><span>the </span><span>preponderance </span><span>of evidence indicates that </span><span>increased vitamin D would help reduce infections, hospitalizations, ICU admissions, &amp; deaths</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>Decades of safety data show that vitamin D has very low risk: </span><span>Toxicity would be extremely rare with the recommendations here. The risk of insufficient levels far outweighs any risk from levels that seem to provide most of the protection against COVID-19, and this is notably different from drugs. Vitamin D is much safer than steroids, such as dexamethasone, the most widely accepted treatment to have also demonstrated a large COVID-19 benefit. Vitamin D’s safety is more like that of face masks. </span><span>There is no need to wait for further clinical trials to increase use of something so safe, </span><span>especially when remedying high rates of deficiency/insufficiency should already be a priority</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>Therefore, we call on all governments, doctors, and healthcare workers worldwide to immediately recommend and implement efforts appropriate to their adult populations to increase vitamin D, at least until the end of the pandemic. Specifically to:</span></p><p><span>Many factors are known to predispose individuals to higher risk from exposure to SARS-CoV-2, such as age, being male, comorbidities, etc., but </span><span>inadequate</span><span>&nbsp;v</span><span>itamin D is by far the most easily and quickly </span><span>modifiable</span><span>&nbsp;risk factor with abundant evidence to support a large effect</span><span>. Vitamin D is inexpensive and has negligible risk compared to the considerable risk of COVID-19.</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>&nbsp;The following include 4000 IU within their tolerable intakes in official guidelines: NAM (US, Canada), SACN (UK), EFSA (Europe), Endocrine Society (international), Nordic countries, The Netherlands, Australia &amp; New Zealand, UAE, and the American Geriatrics Soc. (USA, elderly). No major agency specifies a lower tolerable intake limit. The US NAM said 4000 IU “is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects to almost all individuals.” See also [</span><span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32180081/">Giustina et al ‘20</a></span><span>].</span></p><p><span>The signatories below endorse this letter.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div role="main"><div><article><p>Modern processors are quite complex, with many parts having the potential to become a bottleneck. It is relatively easy to reason about the performance of short pieces of code, especially if memory effects are kept to a minimum. Both static analysis tools like LLVM MCA and microbenchmarks can provide a lot of information in such cases. However, the behaviour of the whole program is not just the sum of those small parts. As the code becomes larger and more complex other effects start appearing. One of such potential problems are excessive instruction cache misses.</p><p>Every program has different properties, and those large-scale effects will affect it differently. However, if its job is to execute complex logic on a small amount of data, the instruction cache is likely to become a problem at some point. The actual impact may vary significantly from codebase to codebase, which is why I won’t show any numbers in this article. Let’s consider this just a collection of ideas, but it is not easy to tell how much any of them will help for a given application.</p><p>First, let’s have a quick look at the processor front end. Below is a simplified diagram of how it is arranged in Skylake, the numbers between units are the maxima per cycle.</p><p><img loading="lazy" width="630" height="860" src="https://paweldziepak.dev/static/icache-front-end.min.2e73578fff.svg" alt="CPU front end"></p><p>Each cycle the processor fetches up to 16 bytes from the instruction cache using information from the Branch Prediction Unit to predict the control flow. The pre-decode unit determines instruction lengths and puts up to five of them in the Instruction Queue. From the Instruction Queue, up to 5 instructions (with macro-fusion) are brought each cycle to the decoders. There is one complex decoder that can handle instructions that translate to up to 4 µops and 3 simple decoders that can handle only single-µop instructions. In total, all decoders are limited to producing no more than 5 µops each cycle. Instructions that require more than 4 µops go through Microcode Sequence ROM, which emits 4 µops per cycle, and while it is active, the decoders are disabled. There is also Decoded ICache (<abbr title="Decoded Stream Buffer">DSB</abbr>) which caches decoded µops. It can emit up to 6 µops each cycle. All µops, regardless of their source, end up in the Instruction Decode Queue (IDQ). The Loop Stream Detector (LSD) detects small loops and keeps them in the queue, so that no fetched, decodes or reads from the DSB are needed during the duration of the loop. IDQ is the last part of the front end, and the queued µops continue to the back end.</p><p>From the instruction cache point of view, the front end has two weaknesses. Firstly, instructions are processed in-order which can severely limit the processor ability to hide latencies of cache misses. HyperThreading can make sure that this part of the processor still does some useful work, but it is also the source of the second problem – all resources, including the L1 instruction cache and µop cache are shared between the hardware threads.</p><p>Modern processors provide various metrics that help monitor their behaviour. However, the task of extracting the relevant data requires a proper approach if it is to be done efficiently. Top-down analysis is invaluable with helping to understand microarchitectural phenomena in large codebases. The idea is to monitor program behaviour with the <abbr title="Performance Monitoring Unit">PMU</abbr> counters and identify the bottleneck starting with the major functional parts of the CPU and then digging deeper narrowing down on the exact source of the problem. It can be done in an automated way by tools like VTune or toplev.</p><pre><code>FE    Frontend_Bound:                                      39.48 +-  0.00 % Slots

</code></pre><p>Above is an example of a toplev result. We can see that the instruction cache misses were the dominating bottleneck. Unsurprisingly instruction TLB misses also show up. On the front end bandwidth side of things, toplev points to the legacy decode pipeline. That makes perfect sense if the instructions are supplied from DSB or LSD, then there are no instruction fetches, and no cache misses.</p><p>Sometimes, the final summary may not provide sufficient information if there are changes in the code behaviour during the test. When that’s the case, a graph is likely to be a much more helpful way of presenting the results.</p><p><img loading="lazy" width="950" height="950" src="https://paweldziepak.dev/static/icache-toplev.min.2b465fdb6f.svg" alt="toplev"></p><p>Tools like toplev are great for initial identification of the problem, but once that’s done what we need is a right way for comparing different solutions. Ultimately, the most important metric is the actual performance of the program in a real-life workload. toplev still can be helpful as it shows the balance between different performance-limiting factors. What also can be useful is <code>perf stat</code> which can show the performance counter statistics. The event most relevant for us is <code>L1-icache-load-misses</code>, though there are more model-specific registers that may be of interest.</p><p>Now, that we know how to diagnose excessive instruction cache misses, let’s see what can be done to deal with this problem.</p><h2 id="avoiding-work">Avoiding work</h2><p>If the number of executed instructions is the problem, the most obvious solution is to try to reduce that number. Obviously, that’s much easier said than done, but there are some common patterns for dealing with this issue. One example would be prepared statements in databases. The general idea is that if a client knows it will send requests that have some commonality, it can tell the database engine early that the requests are going to match specific templates. This information allows the server to do as much work as possible during the preparation stage, thus reducing the amount of logic that needs to be executed for each individual request.</p><p>Extracting common patterns doesn’t have to be explicit. A server or any other kind of an application which actions depend on the user input could attempt to look for repeating patterns and cache some common parts. This is a very vague idea and most likely won’t be easily implementable in a lot of applications, but in some cases may be quite a natural solution. It also shows the main problem with the “just do less” approach – it is very application specific. On the plus, side, if this can be done, it is likely to help with the overall performance, not just the instruction cache misses.</p><p>Another potential problem is making sure that the preparation phase can really do something to help during the execution phase. If that means pre-computing some values, then it’s simple. However, if the only thing that preparation gives us is the knowledge which code paths are going to be exercised and which branches taken during the execution, it is going to be harder to take benefit from it. One option is to have some specialised code for the most common paths, C++ templates may come in handy here. If it is not easy to determine what may be the most common paths, then a just-in-time compiler may be used to generate code in the preparation stage.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><h2 id="batching-work">Batching work</h2><p>So far, we have been trying to reduce the number of executed instructions, by taking advantage of some earlier knowledge to avoiding repeating the same work. In other words, we have introduced two stages:</p><ul><li>preparation, which is performed rarely and, consequently, less performance critical</li><li>execution, which is done many times and is expected to dominate overall performance</li></ul><p>The way this can help with the instruction cache misses is that the execution stage, being smaller, is more likely to fit in the instruction cache. Whether this brings any measurable benefits depends highly on the type of the application and how much logic can be moved from execution to preparation stages.</p><p>We have already split our processing pipeline into preparation and execution stage. If the execution stage can fit in the instruction cache, we are done. However, often, that’s not the case. What we can do to improve the situation more is to split the execution into more stages. This time the goal is not to reuse work as it was with the preparation, but to group entities that need to have the same code executed for them. In other words, if the processing pipeline consists of steps A, B and C the idea is to separate them, add a queue in front of each of those stages, and then cycle through those stages each time handling multiple elements from the queue. Connections between the stages don’t have to be one-to-one, any directed graph is fine.</p><p><img loading="lazy" width="756" height="331" src="https://paweldziepak.dev/static/icache-seda.min.7259b25adc.svg" alt="SEDA diagram"></p><p>In the diagram above, there is one stage that feeds tasks to one of two stages. This could be, for example, a front-end of a database server. The first stage does some initial request processing and then, depending on whether it is a read or write, puts it in the appropriate queue. Each stage processes requests in batches, the first one warms up the instruction …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

It's like the distance a speeding car travels after the brakes are applied.</p>  <p>But Monday's <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-00955-x">study in the journal Nature Climate Change</a> calculates that a bit differently and now figures the carbon pollution already put in the air will push global temperatures to about 2.3 degrees Celsius (4.1 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since pre-industrial times.</p>  <p>Previous estimates, including those accepted by international science panels, were about a degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) less than that amount of committed warming.</p>  <p>International climate agreements set goals of limiting warming to 2 C&nbsp;(3.6 F) since pre-industrial times, with the more ambitious goal of limiting it to 1.5 C&nbsp;(2.7 F) added in Paris in 2015. The world has already warmed about 1.1 C&nbsp;(2 F).</p>  <p>"You've got some ... global warming inertia that's going to cause the climate system to keep warming, and that's essentially what we're calculating," said study co-author Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&amp;M University. "Think about the climate system like the Titanic. It's hard to turn the ship when you see the icebergs."</p>  <p>Dessler and colleagues at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab and Nanjing University in China calculated committed warming to take into account that the world has warmed at different rates in different places and that places that haven't warmed as fast are destined to catch up.</p>    <p>Places such as the Southern Ocean, surrounding Antarctica are a bit cooler, and that difference creates low-lying clouds that reflect more sun away from earth, keeping these places cooler. But this situation can't keep going indefinitely because physics dictates that cooler locations will warm up more and when they do, the clouds will dwindle and more heating will occur, Dessler said.</p>  <p>Previous studies were based on the cooler spots staying that way, but Dessler and colleagues say that's not likely.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5693652.1597940952!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/greenland-record-melt.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5693652.1597940952!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/greenland-record-melt.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5693652.1597940952!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/greenland-record-melt.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5693652.1597940952!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/greenland-record-melt.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5693652.1597940952!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/greenland-record-melt.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5693652.1597940952!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/greenland-record-melt.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>In this Aug. 16, 2019 file photo, icebergs float away as the sun rises near Kulusuk, Greenland.

Breakthrough Institute climate scientist Zeke Hausfather said the new work fits better with climate models than observational data.</p>  <p>Just because the world is bound to get more warming than international goals, that doesn't mean all is lost in the fight against global warming, said Dessler, who cautioned against what he called "climate doomers."</p>  <p>If the world gets to net zero carbon emissions soon, 2 degrees of global warming could be delayed enough so that it won't happen for centuries, giving society time to adapt or even come up with technological fixes, he said.</p>  <p>"If we don't, we're going to blow through (climate goals) in a few decades," Dessler said. "It's really the rate of warming that makes climate change so terrible. If we got a few degrees over 100,000 years, that would not be that big a deal. We can deal with that. But a few degrees over 100 years is really bad."</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><article><header></header><p>How do you send a password over the internet? You acquire a SSL certificate and let TLS do the job of securely transporting the password from client to server. Of course it’s not as cut-and-dry as I’m making it out to be, but the gist of it holds true and stood the test of time. This hasn’t always been this way though, and one incredibly popular storefront on the world wide web prefers to add a little extra to this day. I’ll be discussing Steam’s unique method of logging in their users, and go down a deep rabbit hole of fascinating implementation details.</p><h3 id="pointing-out-the-obvious">Pointing out the obvious</h3><p>I found a StackOverflow question from 2013 <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1582894/how-to-send-password-securely-over-http">asking how to securely send a password over HTTP</a>. The answers are pretty unanimous: get a SSL certificate. Here’s an experiment: set up your favorite traffic-capturing proxy, browse to a service you frequently use, log in with your account (or preferably a throwaway), and inspect the requests. You will most certainly find that your username and password are sent as-is in a HTTP request body. The only reason this works is because your connection to the server is encrypted using TLS.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/steam-rsa/so-real-host.png" alt="StackOverflow user asking what to do if a webhost doesn't support SSL certificates, told to move to a real webhost"><figcaption><p>Weird to think that this used to be an issue</p></figcaption></figure><p>The internet was a different place though in the early 2010s, let alone the many years prior. We now have services like <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a> which issue SSL certificates free of charge for a period of three months, with automatic renewals if desired. There really wasn’t much of a way around acquiring a SSL certificate for money, but usually with extended validity and support. You could certainly argue that there is a price to be paid for the security and privacy of your users, but that didn’t stop questions like the one I linked from appearing.</p><p>Now that we all agree that TLS is important, let’s switch it up. Let’s pretend we cannot send a password over HTTPS and have to somehow make it work with plain HTTP, while also providing users with some level of security. There’s the <code>Authorization</code> header which is standardized and widely accepted. However, in conjunction with the “Basic” HTTP Authentication scheme, it provides no security if used in plain HTTP.</p><p>There are tried and tested challenge-response algorithms, most notably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol">SRP</a> which is designed to do password-based authentication without ever actually sending the password, but you probably have to implement them yourself and a slight oversight could cause serious harm. You could also defer authentication to an external service. “Sign in with service XYZ” is commonly used, but comes with its own ramifications. All things considered, it’s not trivial to send secrets over an inheretly insecure connection.</p><p>So when me and a friend took Steam apart in search for traces of personally identifiable information, I was surprised to see that Steam’s login page doesn’t only rely on TLS to ensure that your password stays protected.</p><h3 id="crypto-cherry-on-top">Crypto cherry on top</h3><p>Again, grab your favorite traffic-capturing proxy and navigate to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/login">Steam’s login page</a>. Enter your username and password and you will (hopefully) be asked to enter a one-time token generated by your preferred two-factor authentication method. You can stop right there, because the magic I want to point out has already happened. You’ll find that pressing the login button launches a request against an odd endpoint: <code>/login/getrsakey</code>, followed by <code>/login/dologin</code>.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/steam-rsa/getrsa-call.png" alt="Requests to fetch script assets, acquire RSA key and perform login"><figcaption><p>All relevant assets and requests in succession</p></figcaption></figure><p>Inspect the request for <code>/login/getrsakey</code> and you’ll find a JSON-formatted response, containing fields with names that should look very familiar to anyone who’s briefly dealt with public key cryptography. You’re given a RSA public key, though the exact values might look a bit odd. It’s clear that <code>publickey_mod</code> and <code>publickey_exp</code> define the modulus and the exponent used in encryption, but the former is given in hexadecimal while the latter appears to be given in binary (I’ll get back on that later). There’s also a timestamp which has no immediately recognizable starting point. As to what the purpose of <code>token_gid</code> is, I have no clue yet.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span>

</code></pre></div><p>The login page pulls some scripts on load. There is the main login handler contained in <code>login.js</code> which is completely unobfuscated, so anyone can just analyze it and find out what it does. The site also loads some additional dependencies, namely <code>jsbn.js</code> and <code>rsa.js</code>.</p><p>A quick search for the name mentioned in the first line of <code>jsbn.js</code> reveals that these two scripts are the work of <a href="http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/">Tom Wu</a> — a MIT and Stanford graduate who likes software engineering and computer cryptography. They released <code>jsbn.js</code> and <code>rsa.js</code> as pure JavaScript implementations of arbitrary precision integers and RSA encryption/decryption respectively. You’ll also find that these libraries have had their most recent updates in 2005 and 2013 which is a bit of information I’ll come back to later. For now, just keep it in mind.</p><h3 id="going-down-the-rsabbit-hole">Going down the r(s)abbit hole</h3><p>So now that we have all relevant assets, let’s dig around in <code>login.js</code>. The code is a bit of a mess with lots of callbacks and proxied function calls, but it turns out the parts of interest can be easily condensed. In essence, the script can be boiled down to a couple of steps, each step assuming that everything went fine in the previous step.</p><ol><li>The user enters their username and password and presses the login button.</li><li><code>DoLogin</code> is called, which checks if the login mask was filled out correctly and launches a request against <code>/login/getrsakey</code>.</li><li><code>OnRSAKeyResponse</code> is called. This checks if the response is well-formed.</li><li><code>GetAuthCode</code> is called. It runs some platform-specific code in case there are any 2FA measures active on the user’s account.</li><li><code>OnAuthCodeResponse</code> is called. This is where the password is encrypted using RSA and the request against <code>/login/dologin</code> is prepared and executed.</li><li><code>OnLoginResponse</code> is called. The user is logged in and redirected to the Steam storefront.</li></ol><p>The code in <code>OnAuthCodeResponse</code> shows why the requested public key is formatted the way that it is. Starting at line 387 in the source file, the modulus and exponent of the <code>/login/getrsakey</code> response are passed as-is to the RSA library. The user’s password is then encrypted with the given public key and added to the request against <code>/login/dologin</code> in the subsequent login step.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>var</span> <span>pubKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>RSA</span><span>.</span><span>getPublicKey</span><span>(</span><span>results</span><span>.</span><span>publickey_mod</span><span>,</span> <span>results</span><span>.</span><span>publickey_exp</span><span>);</span>

</code></pre></div><p>I copied the source files onto my local machine to explore the RSA library a little bit. Both the modulus and the exponent are passed to the function <code>RSAPublicKey</code> which behaves like a constructor in the “pre-class” JavaScript era. <code>RSAPublicKey</code> simply wraps both values into instances of <code>BigInteger</code> provided by the <code>jsbn.js</code> script. It was to my surprise that the exponent is actually not represented in binary but, just like the modulus, in hexadecimal. (Also, turns out <code>0x010001</code> is a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6098381/what-are-common-rsa-sign-exponent">very common encryption exponent</a> in RSA implementations.) So now it’s clear that the password encryption is based on 2048-bit RSA with an encryption exponent of 65537.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>let</span> <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>RSA</span><span>.</span><span>getPublicKey</span><span>(</span><span>"c85ba44d5a360856..."</span> <span>/* insert your own long modulus here */</span><span>,</span> <span>"010001"</span><span>);</span>

</span></code></pre></div><p>Moving on to the <code>timestamp</code> field. The <code>/login/getrsakey</code> response contains an <code>Expires</code> header. It references a date in the past, meaning that the response is absolutely not meant to be cached or persisted in any way. If you check back on <code>/login/getrsakey</code> over a longer period of time, you’ll notice that the public key changes ever so often and, as such, its timestamp value too. This means there’s only a limited time frame in which a certain Steam-issued RSA public key can be used to authenticate.</p><p>This becomes even more evident when examining the subsequent request against <code>/login/dologin</code>. Among many other things, it contains the username, encrypted password as well as the timestamp of the issued RSA public key. Trying to perform a login attempt while altering the timestamp fails as expected. But more importantly, it’s also not possible to reuse an older public key, even if the password is correctly encrypted.</p><p>I went one step further and <a href="https://gist.github.com/JoogsWasTaken/8a8e60859e1721255c57e9185eb6cb10">wrote a simple Python script to collect public keys</a> over the span of three days using a throwaway account. I let it run every five minutes using a cronjob. The goal was to check just how often Steam’s public keys change and to hopefully find out how the <code>timestamp</code> field behaves.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/steam-rsa/sqlite-pubkeys.png" alt="SQLite database containing public keys sourced from Steam"><figcaption><p>Lots and lots and lots of public keys</p></figcaption></figure><p>I found that the public key changes every 12 entries, meaning that it’s safe to assume that they rotate every hour. The encryption exponent stays the same — no surprises here. More intriguing however is the aforementioned <code>timestamp</code> field. For every 12 public keys, the value of the <code>timestamp</code> increases by a certain amount, namely 3600000000 and then some. And what’s more is that this number wraps around after some period of time as can be seen in the following image. Be warned, because all of what I’m about to say is highly speculative.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/steam-rsa/sqlite-wraparound.png" alt="Public key entries where the timestamp value wraps around in-between"><figcaption><p>Timestamp field wrapping around</p></figcaption></figure><p>I found that 3600000000 microseconds is equal to one hour, making me assume that the value of the <code>timestamp</code> field is, in fact, given in microseconds. However, I already hinted at the fact that the timestamp value doesn’t increase by one hour exactly with every new public key. In my own data, I observed that the difference between two successive timestamps is one hour plus 1 to 2.6 seconds, with most being in the order of about 1.05 to 1.25 seconds. But this raises another interesting possibility.</p><p>Let’s assume that a new public key is generated every hour plus one second. If I query the public key …</p></article></section></div>

                    <p>Today is a difficult day in America, a difficult day to be an American.</p><p>Watching the videos of my fellow countrymen breaking windows to get into the U.S. Capitol, seeing the photos of our elected lawmakers huddling under chairs in the House chamber: these are images of our very democracy under attack -- all in an attempt to disrupt what is usually a ceremonial certification of an election.</p><p>As sad and disappointing as the situation is, what is worse is what got us here. &nbsp;Disinformation is real. The vilification of the news media is real. &nbsp;At some point in the last few years, we’ve bifurcated reality, politicizing verifiable facts and even the act of journalism itself.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">After I called them rioters just now on air, the crowd converged on the area press had gathered so we took off.

</figure><p>America is a democracy -- a government by the people, for the people. &nbsp;And in order for the people to govern themselves, we need a well equipped press corps to keep us informed. &nbsp;There cannot be two sets of facts, two universes of truth. &nbsp;We need the reliable journalists to win, to keep us informed, so we can debate ideas, not facts.</p><p>Reporting is not a political act, but it’s also not simply stenography for the powerful. &nbsp;Digging, investigating, holding those in power accountable -- these are the ideals that journalism holds in the highest regard. </p><p>Most who work for reputable news organizations are obsessive in their caution to limit any appearance of impropriety. &nbsp;They adhere to strict editorial standards that the audience is largely unaware of. They are bound by policies and standards that guide how and what they report all designed to ensure credibility in the information they share.</p><p>And yet, disinformation runs wild. &nbsp;The downside of a platform where anyone can post anything, is that anyone can post anything. &nbsp;</p><p>I know many people do not like to pay for news. &nbsp;Frankly, it makes fiscal sense not to when you view it as a commodity and so much is available for free. &nbsp;But when news is commoditized, and taken from an aggregator or a social network, the provenance &nbsp;-- and credibility - can be a gamble.</p><p>It also means that there is ever less money funding the responsible reporting that we need so much. &nbsp;There are technical means to disable ads; there are methods to sneak around paywalls. &nbsp;But each of these actions means that journalism is ever so slightly less economically viable, with dire consequences.</p><p>Newspapers go bankrupt. &nbsp;</p><p>News websites turn to clickbait to attract the remaining ad-viewing traffic they so desperately need.</p><p>And others who abide by no ethics step up to fill the void, which can lead to plagiarizing total fabrication or conspiracy minded fantasists, breathlessly reporting the intricate details of insane theories about the dark side of our leaders. </p><p>All of this makes trust in all media decline (even those that are obsessively reliable), makes the profession less viable, and makes our democracy less informed.</p><p>All of this makes today’s scenes on Capitol Hill possible.</p><p>Journalism is not the enemy. &nbsp;It is the shield that protects us from those that wish to turn us against each other.</p>

<p>In short, the concern is that an array of magnets in the phone may turn off the life-saving function of these cardiac devices.</p>
<p>This “MagSafe” technology was already used elsewhere, but this is the first time it has been incorporated into an iPhone.</p>
<p>Nearly all ICDs will stop shocking a patient when placed near a sufficiently strong magnet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pacemakers exposed to a magnet are set to a pre-programmed mode that varies by manufacturer, usually with a rate of 65-80bpm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ask any Emergency Medicine physician and they will be able to point you to a blue circular magnet used for this exact purpose.&nbsp;</p></div>

<p>1. This is unlikely to result in medical malpractice litigation against any individual physician. However, it does place the manufacturer at risk for product liability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. ED physicians should keep this in mind for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. These patients should be completely exposed during the code, removing all clothing and foreign objects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. For patients with pacemakers, consider that any unusual or unexplained symptoms could have been explained by a transient switch in pacemaker mode while their phone was nearby. Interrogating the pacemaker will help shed light on this.</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>React is the de-facto tool for frontend web development. It has a rich ecosystem and a well-known company to back it up. Despite all of this, I think they still get a ton of stuff wrong. This post is about my personal views and things I think React is already a too slow-moving giant to fix.</p><h2 id="the-syntax">The syntax</h2><p>React has such an awful API that they needed to create a whole new programming language syntax to overcome it: The <code>React.createElement</code> API. Most of the time it's hidden behind JSX that's transpiled onto <code>React.createElement</code> calls.</p><p>You either only ever write JSX when working with React, or you get frustrated with the amount of clutter that gets to your codebase from all that repetition that provides no value to the reader.</p><pre><code>Reat.createElement(<span>'html'</span>, <span>null</span>,
  React.createElement(<span>'body'</span>, <span>null</span>,
    React.createElement(<span>'div'</span>, <span>null</span>,
      React.createElement(...)
    )
  )
)
</code></pre><p>I think a much better way is to follow what SwiftUI and Flutter are doing: Move the element's name from argument to be the function's name:</p><pre><code>html(
  body(
    div(...)
  )
)
</code></pre><p>This does not only remove unnecessary clutter, but removes the need for any compilation step.</p><h2 id="create-react-app">create-react-app</h2><p>Next up us a monstrosity that's nowadays accepted by many to be a "best practice" for getting started with a React project. The problem being, that React ecosystem is such a complex beast that they created a bootstrap project so you can get anything done in a meaningful time. Just pray that you don't need to eject it any time soon.</p><p>Just to give you an idea of the absurdness of this situation: create-react-app creates a "hello world" project for you that downloads <strong>2.5 million lines of Javascript code</strong> to your machine. For a hello world app.</p><p>I have strong feelings about fighting complexity by adding more complexity, and this sure smells like something you should not be doing in 2021.</p><p>Instead we should be thinking about where our browsers and server ecosystems are nowadays and if we could make the bootstrapping <em>simpler</em>. Browsers <a href="https://caniuse.com/es6-module">know how to handle imports nowadays</a>, and the module format is <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html">also part of Node.js</a> without any preprocessing, so you don't necessarily need a build step to get those working.</p><p>Modern browsers are really good with on-the-fly compression like gzip <a href="https://caniuse.com/brotli">and even brotli</a>, so minification is not so much of an issue. Your CDN should anyways be optimizing compression of your static assets.</p><p>Another point being that React is over 100kb when minified (including React DOM because you can't do that much without it). Imagine how much unminified code you could fit in 100kb if you used something that doesn't need to be built at all.</p><h2 id="react-is-not-just-a-view-rendering-library-anymore">React is not just a view rendering library anymore</h2><p>React used to be only a good frontend rendering library with JSX. Nowadays you're signing up for a framework with its own plugin ecosystem, hooks, fibers, suspense, and other obscure future features like <a href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components.html">server components</a>.</p><p>We've changed from doing <em>model-view-controller</em> to using all-consuming views that perform both business logic and create side effects. Views have become the top-level entity that controls everything else.</p><p>Remember the old saying "UI is a function of state"? React used to be a good implementation of this, but nowadays it's more of "UI that handles your state".</p><p>I think a good view rendering library should do just one thing well: Render the UI based on the app's state. It should not care where the state is, and most importantly it should not handle the state itself. Otherwise we'll end up with things like bloated class components or <em>"suddenly global state and black magic is fine"</em> type of hooks inside otherwise pure functions.</p><p>Instead you should be handling your business logic, side effects and data gathering some place else, and use proper separation of concerns to model your application's logic.</p><h2 id="imagine-a-better-world">Imagine a better world</h2><p>So how would a better React alternative look in 2021? I made a small prototype library called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/longwood">Longwood</a> based on above principles, and a hello world looks like this:</p><pre><code><span>&lt;<span>html</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>body</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>id</span>=<span>"app"</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>script</span> <span>type</span>=<span>"module"</span>&gt;</span><span>
      <span>import</span> { div, text } <span>from</span> <span>'https://cdn.skypack.dev/longwood'</span>

      <span>const</span> render = div(text(<span>'Hello world!'</span>))
      render(<span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'app'</span>))
    </span><span>&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/<span>body</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>html</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p><a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/unruffled-star-xs16e?file=/index.html">▶️ Try it out at CodeSandbox.io</a></p><p>That's all the code you need. No precompilation, no build steps, no downloading of 2.5 million lines of code to get started. You can open a text editor, save the code as an <code>index.html</code> file, open it in a browser and it works.</p><p>You have the same power of Javascript to compose your views as with React, and there's a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/longwood-usestate">separate state management library</a> to get started if you're coming from React. But moreover <em>it's okay to handle your state however you want</em>. It's just a rendering library. It can be used for just a small portion of your site if you want. It even supports server-side rendering out of the box (with jsdom).</p><p>Since you're going to ask, here are a couple of examples:</p><ul><li><a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/competent-swartz-beoub?file=/src/TodoComponent.ts">React style Todo app</a></li><li><a href="https://links.thejunkland.com/">Rendering 1000+ rows of data with Longwood</a><ul><li><a href="https://links.thejunkland.com/react/">Same example done with create-react-app</a></li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="to-wrap-up">To wrap up</h2><p>We’ve come a long way since the web 2.0 times. jQuery made the world a better place by making DOM manipulation easier. AngularJS made the world a better place by introducing data binding to the masses. But all great increments seem to fade at some point to welcome better alternatives.</p><p>Will the future be bright for Longwood? I have no idea, it’s a single-person project and at the moment has one production site running on it. But I hope it demonstrates a point that we can do things even better in the future if we keep innovating and cherry-picking the good stuff from others.</p><p>Happy hacking.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22What%20React%20gets%20wrong%22%20by%20@luotojesse%20https://thejunkland.com/blog/what-react-gets-wrong.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tweet</a></p></article></div></div>]]>

                    <h2 id="and-their-influence-on-dark">And their influence on Dark</h2><p><br>After two decades of coding professionally in a dozen languages, I’ve come to a conclusion about static and dynamic types:</p><ul><li>Static types help you ensure that your changes work, especially for changes that span large parts of the program. This leads to long-term productivity gains from reduction in errors, as well as code that works better.</li><li>The lack of static types in dynamic languages allows you to prototype quicker and iterate faster. It also makes your code more readable.</li></ul><p>The result is a productivity quagmire. Static languages bring the cost of type-safety to every line of code that is written, slowing development of new features and concepts. Dynamic languages’ lack of type safety produces significant costs down the line, eating the productivity benefit of the early quick prototyping.</p><p>In Dark, we want the advantages of both. We want to take a type-safe core with long-term productivity gains and risk-reduction, and use tooling to enable the quick prototyping and readable code that you get from dynamic languages.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/darklang/the-design-of-dark-59f5d38e52d2" rel="noopener">Dark</a> has a number of features that are different from regular programming languages. A quick intro:</p><ul><li>Dark’s goal is to remove accidental complexity from coding. We want you to write backend services quickly and safely, with little to no overhead.</li><li>Dark is for building backends — you typically write HTTP handlers and we handle the deployment and infrastructure.</li><li>Dark combines an editor, language and infrastructure, and we use the tight integration to overcome common limitations in programming languages.</li><li>Dark doesn’t have a compilation step or separate compiler/interpreter. Instead, the editor updates with errors and warnings as you type (it also prevents syntax errors and some type errors).</li><li>Dark is designed for continuous delivery — the practice of frequently making small, low-risk changes. Code that you write is deployed to “production” (typically behind a feature flag) immediately after being written.</li></ul><p>Statically-typed functional languages (hereafter FPs, with apologies to Lispers) are amazing. They have a property that exists almost nowhere else: once it compiles, it usually works first try. We obviously want this property in Dark, so we made Dark a statically-typed functional language.</p><p><em><em>(If you’re already very familiar with statically-typed functional languages, you can </em></em><a href="https://medium.com/darklang/real-problems-with-functional-languages-efe668c5264a" rel="noopener"><em><em>skip this section</em></em></a><em><em> without missing much.)</em></em></p><h2 id="type-safety">Type safety</h2><p>In FPs, the compiler checks if all the types line up, and if you’ve handled every possible edge case about your type. When you make a change, the compiler tells you every single place you need to change, which you need to figure out for yourself in dynamic languages. Importantly, that safety comes for free — you don’t have to write millions of unit tests to get it. The result is that small changes across large scale systems are pretty risk free. You can still get the logic wrong, but the plumbing is guaranteed to behave as expected.</p><h2 id="nulls">Nulls</h2><p>In almost every non-FP language, including Java, C, C++, Go, Python, Ruby, PHP, Erlang, Javascript, Clojure, Scala, SQL, C#, and Objective-C, any value can be null, and it can be extremely challenging to reason about whether a particular variable is or isn’t null in practice. Nulls cause program crashes when functions and methods are called on them, when they are indexed, and when their fields are accessed.</p><pre><code>function leadPlayer(players) {
  if (players.length &lt;= 0)
    return null;
  return players[0];
}
function chooseCaptain(players) {
  // throw a NullPointerException if the `players` list is empty.
  leadPlayer(players).setCaptain(true);
}</code></pre><p>In the Java/Javascript-ish code above, the type system doesn’t protect against the NullPointerException when we expected an object but get a null.</p><p>FPs replace nulls with an Option type (called <a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/error_handling/maybe.html" rel="noopener nofollow">Maybe in Elm</a> and <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Maybe" rel="noopener nofollow">Haskell</a>, <a href="https://learning-rust.github.io/docs/e3.option_and_result.html" rel="noopener nofollow">Option in Rust</a>, <a href="https://danielwestheide.com/blog/2012/12/19/the-neophytes-guide-to-scala-part-5-the-option-type.html" rel="noopener nofollow">Scala</a>, and <a href="https://dev.realworldocaml.org/guided-tour.html#scrollNav-3-3" rel="noopener nofollow">OCaml</a>/<a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/the-option-type/" rel="noopener nofollow">F#</a>, and <a href="https://hackernoon.com/swift-optionals-explained-simply-e109a4297298" rel="noopener nofollow">Optional in Swift</a>). The Option type encodes in the type system that a value can be null. If the value is not an Option, then it cannot be null.</p><p>Every time you have an Option, the compiler requires you to handle both potential cases: if it is a real value, or if it’s not. Since the compiler won’t let you access a field or index or call a method on a null value, that entire class of errors is removed.</p><pre><code>function leadPlayer(players) {
  match players with
  | [] -&gt;
    return Nothing
  | head :: rest -&gt; // an array with 1 or more elements
    return (Just head)
}
function chooseCaptain(players) {
  match leadPlayer(players) with
  | Just player -&gt;
      player.setCaptain(true); // we know this can't be null
  | Nothing -&gt;
      // don't throw an exception
}</code></pre><p>As we can see, the FP version of the same code requires the <code>null</code> (called <code>Nothing</code> in our examples) to be handled.</p><h2 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h2><p>Similarly, in most languages, any operation can cause an exception. Even Java with its checked exceptions has a category of exceptions (RuntimeExceptions) that can happen anywhere, including the beloved <code>NullPointerException</code>. Exceptions are so pervasive that it’s basically impossible to have a single line of code that is known to be exception-free — and even if it is, you won’t have a compiler to tell you that.</p><p>Here’s an example of some simple Python code that will throw an exception if <code>a</code>or <code>b</code>are strings which are not valid ints:</p><pre><code>sum = int(a) + int(b);</code></pre><p>FPs commonly use a Result type instead of exceptions (or C/Go error codes). A Result is a value which is either a valid value or an error. Like the Option type, the compiler sees every Result and requires you to handle the potential error, knowing that you cannot do your regular type operations on an error.</p><p>Here’s the same in an Elm-like language with result types. As you can see, this requires you to handle both the errors of <code>a</code>and <code>b</code>.</p><pre><code>match String.toInt a, String.toInt b with
| Ok a, Ok b -&gt;
    sum = a + b
| _ -&gt;
    Debug.log(“Error parsing integers);
    sum = 0</code></pre><p>By removing both nulls and exceptions, FPs remove a huge set of possible errors, and allow developers the safety of knowing that their programs work. Most importantly, that knowledge comes from automatic tooling, not manually writing test cases.</p><h2 id="implementation-in-dark">Implementation in Dark</h2><p>Dark takes influence from FPs, and Dark programs are fully type-checked. Dark’s type system allows us to find everywhere that a change needs to propagate, and tells you whether your types line up or not.</p><p>We also use Results and Options instead of exceptions and nulls, to avoid all the problems that come from those language features.</p><p>Unfortunately, these benefits come with significant frustrations and downsides, which current functional languages have — in our opinion — poor solutions for.</p><h2 id="type-checking-in-dark">Type checking in Dark</h2><p>In most FP compilers, your whole program either compiles or it doesn’t, making it difficult to make small scale changes. If I’m programming in Python, and I want to test out a quick hacky change in some component, I can do that immediately to discover whether the hack will even solve my problem.</p><p>Not so in FP. If I change a type in a FP, it might take me an hour to change every use of that type so that my program can even compile. And that’s assuming I’m stubbing out any logic that I don’t want to handle just yet. There’s little I find more frustrating than discovering in step 2 that the type changes I diligently propagated in step 1 were wrong and that I wasted the last hour.</p><p>Dark is designed for continuous delivery. As such, we don’t like requiring you to make large scale changes across your program, like changing a type everywhere. Instead, we want you to quickly discover that bad ideas won’t work, without first requiring you to propagate the type changes throughout your program.</p><p>Dark has a deliberately small compilation unit (the amount of code which is compiled together, and therefore which must be type checked together). You can make changes in a single HTTP route without having to make it type check with the rest of your program. This lowers the amount of type changes that you need to make to test out a single change.</p><p>The way this works is that you don’t actually change types in Dark. Instead, you make a copy of the type, and make your changes on that new copy. This allows you to prototype with the new type and test your change easily, making cheap iterations (and new types) as you try out new ideas. Once you are confident in your new type, you replace the uses of the old type (with semi-automated tooling to handle all the changes, including changes that are way down the call-stack).</p><p>As a result, you get the benefits of type checking, along with the benefits of cheap prototyping and quick iteration.</p><h2 id="option-result-types-in-dark">Option/Result types in Dark</h2><p>If I want to use a value wrapped in an Option or Result, I must first unwrap it, and then handle the failure case. This ensures that my code handles all errors and edge cases, but also adds costs to prototyping and iteration. If I want to make a quick hack in Python or Javascript, I can ignore nulls and errors on the first pass as I prototype and develop my algorithm. Not so with static types — in fact, often I’m forced to do low-level restructuring of my code to handle Options and Results.</p><p>Consider the code I have to add to my prototype in our Elm-like example:</p><pre><code>match String.toInt a, String.toInt b with
| Ok a, Ok b -&gt;
  sum = a + b
| _ -&gt;
  Debug.log(“Error parsing integers);
  sum = 0</code></pre><p>The Python code was significantly faster to write (though it has bugs that we want to ignore during our prototype).</p><p>Dark uses a concept from <a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/" rel="noopener nofollow">Scott Wlaschin</a> called “<a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/rop/" rel="noopener nofollow">Railway Oriented Programming</a>” to reduce this complexity. ROP is a metaphor where the error values of Results and Options form an alternate execution path through the program, called an Error Rail. When an error happens, the execution in the main body stops and instead passes over to the Error Rail.</p><p>Dark takes the ROP metaphor and makes a literal version of it in our editor. If you call a function in Dark that returns a <code>Nothing</code>(the name of the null-ish value of our Option type), …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>Choose the simple and good process over the <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/06/productivity-porn/">complicated and perfect</a> process. The value of universal understanding outweighs the value of accounting for every possible edge case and gotcha.</p>



<p>I like to talk about processes in terms of <em><a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/22/power-in-naming-things/">recite-ability</a></em>. If everyone involved in the process can’t recite it off the top of their head, try to simplify it. </p>



<p>Look at the humble Kanban board with <em>Todo</em>, <em>Doing</em>, and <em>Done</em> columns. Everyone knows which column their ticket should be in. There are only 3 of them! Simple!</p>



<p>That’s why we should think long and hard before adding that <em>In Review</em> column or the <em>Awaiting Deploy</em> column. Those should only be created when <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/17/stop-solving-problems-nobody-complained-about/">not having them becomes <em>torture</em></a>. Each one makes the process that much less recite-able. If a team’s board has so many columns that the average team member can’t recite them all from memory, that’s trouble.</p>



<p>The 80/20 rule applies, as always. If I can get 80% of the value of a process with 20% of the complexity, then that’s a tradeoff I’ll take almost every time. Of course there are exceptions, but I find that they aren’t as common as we’d expect. </p>



<p>I know it feels safer to account for everything so that there’s nothing left open to interpretation. But then we’ve just replaced one problem (“if X is true the we’ll have to do Y manually and that allows for human error!”) with <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/10/the-tragedy-of-the-commons-in-software-development/">a worse problem</a> (“nobody <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/01/never-underestimate-peoples-ability-to-not-hear-you/">deeply understands this</a> so they’re making mistakes or ignoring it altogether”).</p>



<p>One of my favorite rules for <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/06/10/spotting-broken-processes/">spotting broken processes</a> is: <em>when times get tough, if people run away from the process instead of towards it, it’s broken</em>. And when people are freaking out, they run away from complexity and towards simplicity.</p>



<p>So strive for simple. A simple process is a happy process.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p><span> The <a href="https://store.google.com/product/titan_security_key" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Google Titan Security Key</i></a> is a FIDO U2F hardware device proposed by Google (available since July 2018) as a two-factor authentication token to sign in to applications (e.g. your Google account). Our work describes a side-channel attack that targets the <i>Google Titan Security Key</i>’s secure element (the NXP A700X chip) by the observation of its local electromagnetic radiations during ECDSA signatures (the core cryptographic operation of the FIDO U2F protocol). In other words, an attacker can create a clone of a legitimate <i>Google Titan Security Key</i>.</span></p>

<p><span> To understand the NXP ECDSA implementation, find a vulnerability and design a key-recovery attack, we had to make a quick stop on <i>Rhea</i> (NXP J3D081 JavaCard smartcard). Freely available on the web, this product looks very much like the NXP A700X chip and uses the same cryptographic library. <i>Rhea</i>, as an open JavaCard platform, gives us more control to study the ECDSA engine.</span></p>

<p><span> We could then show that the electromagnetic side-channel signal bears partial information about the ECDSA ephemeral key. The sensitive information is recovered with a non-supervised machine learning method and plugged into a customized lattice-based attack scheme.</span></p>

<p><span> Finally, 4000 ECDSA observations were enough to recover the (known) secret key on <i>Rhea</i> and validate our attack process. It was then applied on the <i>Google Titan Security Key</i> with success (this time by using 6000 observations) as we were able to extract the long term ECDSA private key linked to a FIDO U2F account created for the experiment.</span></p>

<h3>Cautionary Note</h3>
<p><span> Two-factor authentication tokens (like FIDO U2F hardware devices) primary goal is to fight phishing attacks. Our attack requires physical access to the <i>Google Titan Security Key</i>, expensive equipment, custom software, and technical skills.</span></p>

<p><span> <b>Thus, as far as our study goes, it is still safer to use your <i>Google Titan Security Key</i> or other impacted products as FIDO U2F two-factor authentication token to sign in to applications rather than not using one.</b></span></p>

<p><span> Nevertheless, this work shows that the <i>Google Titan Security Key</i> (and other impacted products) would not avoid unnoticed security breach by attackers willing to put enough effort into it. Users that face such a threat should probably switch to other FIDO U2F hardware security keys, where no vulnerability has yet been discovered.</span></p>

<h3>Discovered By</h3>
<p><span> Victor lomné (NinjaLab) and Thomas Roche (NinjaLab).<br>
with the help of Camille Mutschler (NinjaLab) and Dr. Laurent Imbert (LIRMM, CNRS).</span></p>

<h3>List of Impacted Products</h3>
<ul>
<li> Google Titan Security Key (all versions) </li>
<li> Yubico Yubikey Neo </li>
<li> Feitian FIDO NFC USB-A / K9 </li>
<li> Feitian MultiPass FIDO / K13 </li>
<li> Feitian ePass FIDO USB-C / K21 </li>
<li> Feitian FIDO NFC USB-C / K40 </li>
<li> NXP J3D081_M59_DF and variants </li>

<li> NXP J3E145_M64 and variants </li>
<li> NXP J3E081_M64_DF and variants </li>
</ul>


<h3>Further Notes</h3>
<p><span>
1. The impacted Yubico Yubikey Neo is an old product no more available for sale. All FIDO U2F Yubico Yubikeys currently available on their webstore are based on a newer secure element from Infineon, and are not impacted by our work to our knowledge.
</span></p>
<p><span>
2. The NXP P5 / SmartMX secure microcontroller family and its associated cryptographic library (up to v2.9) impacted by our work is quite old. Since, NXP has released two new generations of secure microcontroller families, the “NXP P60 / SmartMX2” family and now the “NXP P70 / SmartMX3” family. Both are Common Criteria certified (with recent certification process), and are not impacted by our work to our knowledge.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Billions of dollars in Bitcoin are stolen every year.&nbsp; If you’re a victim of Bitcoin theft or a scam, read this article first.</p>
<p>I will tell you why most “recovery” services are scams, and what you should actually do.</p>
<h3><strong>Can a Bitcoin recovery service help get my stolen Bitcoin/Ethereum/etc back?</strong></h3>
<p>The first and most important thing you should know is <strong>that there is absolutely no way to reverse confirmed Bitcoin/cryptocurrency transactions</strong>.&nbsp; Once a transaction is confirmed on the Blockchain, there is no way to reverse it.</p>
<p><strong>Beware of “Bitcoin recovery” scams</strong></p>
<p>There are many “Bitcoin recovery” services that claim to be able to return stolen Bitcoin.&nbsp; They will have all kinds of explanations of how they do this.</p>
<p>Here is a debunking of the most common recovery methods:</p>
<h3><strong>Lawyers:&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What they promise: </strong>we will prosecute thieves and force them to return stolen Bitcoin</p>
<p><strong>Why it won’t work:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>In almost all cases, you won’t know the identity of the people who stole your Bitcoin. It’s nearly impossible to find out the real-world identity of the owner of a given Bitcoin address.</p>
<p>Even if you have a name, email address, “registered trading account,” website, etc, it will be very difficult to obtain the cooperation of the police in getting their real-world identity.</p>
<p>The police don’t care about “small scale” theft. In most cases, the thieves will be in a different country than you.&nbsp; Furthermore, unlike cash, there is no paper trail to follow.&nbsp; Bitcoin/cryptocurrency is generally considered “property” rather than money, and hacking isn’t given the same weight as theft of physical goods.&nbsp; All of this makes authorities unlikely to pursue cases.</p>
<p>Even when the identity of the thieves is definitely known, the Bitcoin is rarely returned. The only cases where Bitcoin has been recovered in theft has been in a class-action lawsuit (such as with Mt Gox). Even then, it usually takes thousands of victims, at least tens of millions of dollars stolen, expensive attorneys, and many years.</p>
<p>I’m not saying it’s impossible. Just don’t expect to send a random lawyer $5000-$10,000 (typical “recovery” fees) and anything useful to happen. It’s a scam.</p>
<h3><strong>“Ethical hackers”</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What they promise:</strong> we will hack the thieves and get them to return your Bitcoin.</p>
<p><strong>Why it won’t work:</strong></p>
<p>First, anyone who was able to steal your money is already a sophisticated hacker. Most “hackers” prey on the technologically ignorant.&nbsp; Anyone capable of stealing your Bitcoin probably knows the tricks of so-called “ethical hackers”.</p>
<p>Second, it’s nearly impossible to find out the real-world identity from a Bitcoin address or an email address.&nbsp; If the U.S. government struggles to find find out who operates darknet markets, what hope has some hacker you paid $1000?</p>
<p>Third, even an “ethical hacker” has to break into someone else’s systems — and probably break some laws in the process. If they could someone break into people’s computers to get their Bitcoin, why should they return it to you?&nbsp; Why do they need you at all?&nbsp; If they can hack people’s computers to steal Bitcoin, they are just as likely to steal yours.</p>
<p>There are no credible, independent reports of anyone successfully doing this. “Ethical hackers” that return Bitcoin for cash upfront simply do not exist.&nbsp; It’s a scam.</p>
<h3><strong>Blockchain hackers</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What they promise:</strong> we will hack Bitcoin or brute force your private key to reverse the transaction and return your Bitcoin.</p>
<p><strong>Why it won’t work:</strong></p>
<p>The market cap of Bitcoin is nearly $700 billion dollars.&nbsp; Every single Bitcoin transaction and address is public.&nbsp; If someone could steal or reverse a Bitcoin transaction, they wouldn’t be helping you.&nbsp; <a href="https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin/rich-list/">They would be going after the richest Bitcoin wallets worth tens of billions of dollars.</a> Of course, once it got out that Bitcoin could be hacked, the exploit would either be patched, or Bitcoin would become worthless.</p>
<p>No matter how brilliant they claim to be, it’s a scam.</p>
<h3><strong>Chainalysis</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What they claim:</strong> we will trace Bitcoin transaction to the service holding them, and force them to return your money.</p>
<p><strong>Why it won’t work:</strong></p>
<p>Chainalysis is a real thing.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/">There are companies</a> that keep databases of addresses used by criminals and gambling sites, and help exchanges ban those customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, they can’t help you for a few reasons:</p>
<p>First, they have expensive products for businesses and governments than the random recovery service you found online probably doesn’t have access to.</p>
<p>Second, the most they can do is trace which major exchange or business got your Bitcoin.&nbsp; At this point, you would need the cooperation of the exchange to tell you which customer made that deposit.&nbsp; That cooperation is impossible to obtain without a court order, which as previously explained is nearly impossible to obtain.&nbsp; Furthermore, thieves don’t use cooperative exchanges in the first place, since they require <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Know_your_customer">KYC. </a>If they want to cash out, they are going to use some less-reputable service in a country that probably does not cooperate with your government.</p>
<p>Third, once your crypto hits an exchange, it’s impossible to trace what a given customer does with it next.&nbsp; If someone simply deposits Bitcoin with an exchange, you will never know when they take it out or move it.&nbsp; This is because exchanges combine all their funds, so your stolen Bitcoin will be given to whoever requests a withdrawal first.&nbsp; It will not be withdrawn by the person who deposited it.</p>
<p>Fourth, criminals don’t keep Bitcoin at exchanges.&nbsp; In my experience, they will either sit on it for years or cash it out immediately. They are not stupid enough to keep it where it can be confiscated, however unlikely that is.</p>
<p>It’s a scam.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion:&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>It is nearly impossible to return your stolen cryptocurrency.&nbsp; Don’t lose more of your money in vain.</p>
<p><strong>Am I wrong?&nbsp; Are there other “recovery” methods I forgot to mention? Please let me know below.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>So what should I do?</strong></h3>
<p>First, there is a small qualification that <strong>unconfirmed transactions can be reversed or canceled</strong>.&nbsp; In a few cases, I’ve been able to reverse transactions that haven’t confirmed yet.&nbsp; It’s rare and requires immediate action.&nbsp; Usually, this happens with wallets that receive mining payments, as they require much higher fees to confirm.</p>
<p>Second, if your Bitcoin keys, logins, seed, etc have been leaked or exposed, but the thieves have not yet sent it away, you must act <strong>immediately&nbsp;</strong>to transfer it to a new private wallet.</p>
<p>Third, realize that if someone has stolen your Bitcoin, you may still be vulnerable to theft. You probably did something wrong or were exploited by someone who can do it again.</p>
<p>Don’t go out and buy more Bitcoin.&nbsp; You need to <a href="https://walletrecovery.info/ten-essential-security-practices-to-keep-your-bitcoin-safe/">perform a security audit</a> to understand how it was stolen. You may have a keylogger tracking all your keystrokes, or a root exploit that allows someone to access all your files.&nbsp; Educate yourself. Learn about <a href="https://walletrecovery.info/watch-out-for-these-five-common-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-scams/">the most common cryptocurrency scams</a>. At a minimum,&nbsp; <a href="https://walletrecovery.info/how-to-safely-store-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies/">read my article on how to safely store Bitcoin</a>.</p>
<p>Fourth, make sure your crypto was really stolen.&nbsp; You should see a transaction to an address that does not belong to you on a date/time you did not make any transactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://walletrecovery.info/contact-us/">If you’re not sure, ask for help</a></strong>.&nbsp; If you don’t see an outgoing transaction, it was probably not stolen – you’re doing something wrong.</p>
<p>Fifth, if your Bitcoin was stolen, and you held it before August 2017, check to see if the BCH/BSV forks have been claimed.&nbsp; Do this immediately, before the crooks do.</p>

<p>“[B]y coordinating more with Facebook, we’ll be able to do things like track basic metrics about how often people use our services and better fight spam on WhatsApp.
And by connecting your phone number with Facebook’s systems, Facebook can offer better friend suggestions and show you more relevant ads if you have an account with them.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><small> Brian Acton and Jan Koum, August 2016<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></small></p>
<hr>

<p>WhatsApp started out full of dreams: “we want WhatsApp to be the product that keeps you awake…and that you reach for in the morning. No one jumps up from a nap and runs to see an advertisement”<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>. When they thought of WhatsApp, Brian Acton and Jan Koum were very keen on <em>not</em> selling our user data for targeted advertisement purposes. So they charged a nominal rate for the use of their service, rightfully pointing out the hidden cost of using free services.</p>
<p>In the year of 2014 however, WhatsApp was bought by Facebook, thus joining the social network’s happy and expanding family of venture capital investments, a family including Instagram, purchased in April 2012, and Oculus VR, purchased the month before. At the time, many, and with good reason, worried about the changes this acquisition could entail for WhatsApp. Eventually, in August 2016, WhatsApp users everywhere learned about what was in fact unavoidable. The company that built its reputation upon an ad-free ethic, would now be sharing private user information with Facebook, its parent company. So we, the users, are the product after all, and as expected, this is presented in the form of an <em>improvement</em> of the user experience. Thanks to the tighter coordination between WhatsApp and Facebook, we can now more easily find our friends or see more valuable messages from the companies that truly matter to us. Of course, small footnote, these ‘benefits’ comes at the price of sharing our phone number and other private data with Facebook—though, trusting their word, not the content of the messages themselves.</p>
<p>Facebook does this for the simple reason that it needs to increase its market share on mobile devices<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>; the family of Whatsapp, Facebook and Instagram are all <em>different</em> channels leading to this same purpose. One of the consequences of this is that while Facebook’s chat function can still be used on their mobile website, plans are that we will soon be forced to install Facebook Messenger should we wish to continue using it on our mobile phones<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>. Once again, in a stroke of pure genius and creativity, this move is being marketed as a way to provide us with the best experience ever.  And we can use it with just a phone number, we don’t even need a Facebook account. That way, their user base expands along with their profits.</p>
<p>Every time there is a breach of user trust —read: a change in the Terms of Service— or news regarding network surveillance, people are on the lookout for an alternative, and rightfully so. In these moments there are many also willing to promote such <em>alternatives</em>, usually in the form of yet another disruptive app.  After the purchase of Whatsapp, for example, Telegram was advertised as the alternative. After it became clear that Telegram had dreadful security, people promoted Viber. Then Snapchat, then Threema, then Allo and now Signal. There is a reason why we’re falling into this pattern of needing alternatives to the alternatives. And that is because…</p>

<p>There’s a tendency to oversimplify the issues related to the use of these apps as merely a privacy matter, and not even that is sufficiently addressed. While each of the aforementioned apps are alternative companies and brands, what these alternatives all have in common is that they share the same model. A model that revolves around centralized services, vendor lock-in and marketing related surveillance, and all of that within a neoliberal context of the free market. These alternatives therefore promote themselves as more than just an alternative, but also as competing products, usually highlighting a particular feature lacking in rivals’ products. Remember that ill-fated, super cool, nice looking alternative to Facebook, Ello? It gained a lot of traction out of legitimate concerns with Facebook’s modus operandi, promoting itself as an alternative for its nice features and its promise not to use advertising. But as Aral Balkan was quick to point out, allowing investments by venture capital firms meant the project was dead before it really began<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup>. Taking these investments, which allowed them to scale as a platform, also meant that they would, at some point, <em>have</em> to make a lot of money for their investors. How? By selling ad space or information about their users. The reason the pattern keeps repeating itself is not because the makers of these apps always secretly intended to sell your data while saying they wouldn’t. The reason is that they have no choice within the economic system they choose to operate in.</p>

<p>The latest competitive feature—one might even say, marketing trick—to make concerned users switch from one alternative to another is cryptography, the act of coding messages during communication. This strategy works well because the vast majority of people are not really informed when it comes down to the technicalities of cryptography, so this discourse mostly serves to throw bedazzling sparkles in our eyes. To be sure, cryptography is fundamental for privacy. However, the main privacy threat in the context of using these apps isn’t the potential of a government eavesdropping on our communications. The privacy threat is the wholesale and increasing dependence on centralized services which revolve around the surveillance and monetization of user information. In 2016, both WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger enabled end-to-end encryption<a href="http://homebrewserver.club/beginners-guide-to-xmpp-speak.html#e2e"><sup>?</sup></a> to address increasing privacy concerns. Adding <em>crypto</em> to a communication app in this case merely obfuscates a concern about the hegemony of these platforms. In essence, the issue of privacy is much larger than just the lack of cryptography; the conditions that threaten privacy are structural and economic and not resolved by a <em>patch</em> or a new feature.</p>
<p>This issue is further stressed when looking at the question of metadata, that is to say, data about data, which in the case of communication applications is everything but the communication data itself. When WhatsApp started sharing, among other things, its users’ phone numbers with its parent company, Facebook, it went to great lengths to guarantee us that the content of our messages was still perfectly secure, impossible to be read by both WhatsApp and Facebook. The argument stating that “It’s only metadata, don’t worry” has been however debunked numerous times. Even though these platforms would love us to believe otherwise, metadata is neither a trivial disposable by-product, nor it is anonymous. And assuming that the crypto is sound and that the app running this crypto is not flawed, cross-referencing several databases containing metadata will always produce an array of very personal information, that in itself is much more valuable than encrypted naked selfies. Thus it should be no surprise that former NSA director Michael Hayden infamously said in 2012 “we kill based on metadata”<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8">8</a></sup> and later argued in 2015 that metadata should be the main area of focus of surveillance activities, and not the creation of backdoors within crypto, or the banning of the latter<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9">9</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In short, both Whatsapp and FacebookMessenger can afford to deploy end-to-end encryption for your messages because it won’t hurt their bottom line, which is making money based on the surveillance of your behavior and your social graph. Adding crypto thus merely patches your privacy worries, but not the threat to it.</p>

<p>The end-to-end encryption enabled in WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger has been developed by Open Whisper Systems, a non-profit run by crypto-celebrity Moxie Marlinspike. OWS also developed the algorithm for their own instant messaging application, Signal, and then open-sourced it. Signal itself is now the latest app being promoted as an alternative to WhatsApp and is hailed as the panacea of both security and usability. It even has the backing of members of the dissident elite such as Edward Snowden.</p>
<p>While OWS provides thorough expertise in the field of cryptography, Marlinspike is currently advocating centralisation as the only answer towards user-friendly, fast and secure messaging apps. Decentralisation, according to him, has no place in the modern world and apparently hampers innovation. However, some of his arguments have not remained unchallenged. In particular, where Marlinspike accuses federation of stalling evolution<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11">11</a></sup>, Daniel Gultsch<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12">12</a></sup> provides a counter argument by using the Web as an example of successfully federated system<a href="http://homebrewserver.club/beginners-guide-to-xmpp-speak.html#federated"><sup>?</sup></a>. Furthermore, Gultsch states that the problem is not that federation doesn’t adapt, but rather that there are problems with its implementation for a very significant reason: software developers working on federated systems mostly work for free in their spare time or with little means, given the difficulty to monetise a system which design can only succeed if it is open and can be appropriated easily beyond its original scope, and thus making its capitalisation particularly challenging. In that sense, the most interesting aspect of this debate is that while Marlinspike seems to defend his product from a technological perspective, Gultsch’s counter argument moves back the discussion to the context of political economy.</p>

<header><p>7 Jan 2021</p></header><p>Apple’s latest line of Macs includes their in-house “M1” system-on-chip, featuring a custom GPU. This poses a problem for those of us in the <a href="https://asahilinux.org/">Asahi Linux</a> project who wish to run Linux on our devices, as this custom Apple GPU has neither public documentation nor open source drivers. Some speculate it might descend from PowerVR GPUs, as used in older iPhones, while others believe the GPU to be completely custom. But rumours and speculations are no fun when we can peek under the hood ourselves!</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I purchased a Mac Mini with an M1 GPU as a development target to study the instruction set and command stream, to understand the GPU’s architecture at a level not previously publicly understood, and ultimately to accelerate the development of a Mesa driver for the hardware. Today I’ve reached my first milestone: I now understand enough of the instruction set to disassemble simple shaders with a free and open-source tool chain, <a href="https://github.com/AsahiLinux/gpu">released on GitHub here</a>.</p>
<p>The process for decoding the instruction set and command stream of the GPU parallels the same process I used for reverse-engineering Mali GPUs in the Panfrost project, originally pioneered by the Lima, Freedreno, and Nouveau free software driver projects. Typically, for Linux or Android driver reverse-engineering, a small wrap library will be written to inject into a test application via <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> that hooks key system calls like <code>ioctl</code> and <code>mmap</code> in order to analyze user-kernel interactions. Once the “submit command buffer” call is issued, the library can dump all (mapped) shared memory for offline analysis.</p>
<p>The same overall process will work for the M1, but there are some macOSisms that need to be translated. First, there is no <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> on macOS; the equivalent is <code>DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES</code>, which has some extra security features which are easy enough to turn off for our purposes. Second, while the standard Linux/BSD system calls do exist on macOS, they are not used for graphics drivers. Instead, Apple’s own <code>IOKit</code> framework is used for both kernel and userspace drivers, with the critical entry point of <code>IOConnectCallMethod</code>, an analogue of <code>ioctl</code>. These differences are easy enough to paper over, but they do add a layer of distance from the standard Linux tooling.</p>
<p>The bigger issue is orienting ourselves in the IOKit world. Since Linux is under a copyleft license, (legal) kernel drivers are open source, so the <code>ioctl</code> interface is public, albeit vendor-specific. macOS’s kernel (XNU) being under a permissive license brings no such obligations; the kernel interface is proprietary and undocumented. Even after wrapping <code>IOConnectCallMethod</code>, it took some elbow grease to identify the three critical calls: memory allocation, command buffer creation, and command buffer submission. Wrapping the allocation and creation calls is essential for tracking GPU visible memory (what we are interested in studying), and wrapping the submission call is essential for timing the memory dump.</p>
<p>With those obstacles cleared, we can finally get to the shader binaries, black boxes in themselves. However, the process from here on out is standard: start with the simplest fragment or compute shader possible, make a small change in the input source code, and compare the output binaries. Iterating on this process is tedious but will quickly reveal key structures, including opcode numbers.</p>
<p>The findings of the process documented in the free software disassembler confirm a number of traits of the GPU:</p>
<p>One, this is a scalar architecture. Unlike some GPUs that are scalar for 32-bits but vectorized for 16-bits, the M1’s GPU is scalar at all bit sizes. Yet Metal optimization resources imply 16-bit arithmetic should be significantly faster, in addition to a reduction of register usage leading to higher thread count (occupancy). This suggests the hardware is superscalar, with more 16-bit ALUs than 32-bit ALUs, allowing the part to benefit from low-precision graphics shaders much more than competing chips can, while removing a great deal of complexity from the compiler.</p>
<p>Two, this seems to handle scheduling in hardware, common among desktop GPUs but less so in the embedded space. This again makes the compiler simpler at the expense of more hardware. Instructions seem to have minimal encoding overhead, unlike other architectures which need to pad out instructions with <em>nop</em>’s to accommodate highly constrained instruction sets.</p>
<p>Three, various modifiers are supported. Floating point ALUs can do clamps (saturate), negates, and absolute value modifiers “for free”, a common shader architecture trait. Further, most (all?) instructions can type-convert between 16-bit and 32-bit “for free” on both the destination and the sources, which allows the compiler to be much more aggressive about using 16-bit operations without risking conversion overheads. On the integer side, various bitwise complements and shifts are allowed on certain instructions for free. None of this is unique to Apple’s design, but it’s worth noting all the same.</p>
<p>Finally, not all ALU instructions have the same timing. Instructions like <code>imad</code>, used to multiply two integers and add a third, are avoided in favour of repeated <code>iadd</code> integer addition instructions where possible. This also suggests a superscalar architecture; software-scheduled designs like those I work on for my day job cannot exploit differences in pipeline length, inadvertently slowing down simple instructions to match the speed of complex ones.</p>
<p>From my prior experience working with GPUs, I continue to expect to find some eldritch horror waiting in the instruction set, to balloon compiler complexity. Though the above work currently covers only a small surface area of the instruction set, so far everything seems sound. There are no convoluted optimization tricks, but doing away with the trickery is creating a streamlined, efficient design that does one thing and does it well. Maybe Apple’s hardware engineers discovered it’s hard to beat simplicity.</p>
<p>Alas, a shader tool chain isn’t much use without an open-source userspace driver. Next up: dissecting the command stream!</p>

  <article>
	<header>

	</header>

		<p>
		My stack requires no maintenance, has perfect Lighthouse scores, will never have any security vulnerability, is based on open standards, is portable, has an instant dev loop, has no build step and… will outlive any other stack.
		</p>
		<p>
		It’s not LAMP, Wordpress, Rails, MEAN, Jamstack... I don’t do CSR (Client-side rendering), SSR (Server Side Rendering), SSG (Static Site Generation)...
		</p>
		<p>
		My stack is <b>HTML+CSS</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
		And because my sources are in git, pushed to GitHub, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> is my host.
		</p>
		<p>
		Of course, I’m being a bit provocative here. I should rather say that, for some specific use cases, I concluded that to get top performances and to guatantee long term support, HTML+CSS was the best choice, instead on relying on technologies currently more popular. Because I’m done rewriting my site every couple of years.
		</p>

		<h3>Why HTML+CSS?</h3>
		<p>
		It all started with <a href="https://labs.steren.fr/">a blog</a>, that I was hosting on Wordpress.com (which is "Wordpress-as-a-Service", because the last thing I want to do is administer a Wordpress installation on my own server). I <strong>paid</strong> Wordpress.com to do one job: host my blog. And one day I looked at its sources and Lighthouse scores:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="https://blog.steren.fr/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/wordpress-sources.png" alt="Sources of my Wordpress.com blog, showing a lot of inlined unreadable scripts">
			<figcaption>Sources of my Wordpress.com blog, what is all this?</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<figure>
			<img src="https://blog.steren.fr/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/wordpress-lighthouse.png" alt="Lighthouse scores of my Wordpress.com blog, showing 19/100 for Performance">
			<figcaption>Lighthouse score of my blog hosted on Wordpress.com</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
		What have we done?
		</p>
		<p>
		Sure, these are the problems of one specific blogging platform. I’m pretty sure others are better, at least in terms of performance. But isn’t there something fundamentally wrong if displaying a short text with images takes seconds, loads countless render-blocking scripts, and has unreadable sources?
		</p>
		<p>
		My requirements were:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>performance</li>
			<li>simplicity</li>
			<li>long long term support</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		It was time to say goodbye to Wordpress. I didn’t need 99% of its features anyway. Other blogging platforms didn’t meet expectations either (I seriously have no idea why so many people publish on Medium… behind a login wall). I looked at static site generators like Jekyll, Hugo, 11ty, but all of these require tooling installed, have a build step and will ultimately need some updates or be abandonned by their maintainer. What if we also get rid of these?
		</p>
		<p>
		The best tool is no tool, the best build step is no build step, the best update is no update. HTML gives us all that, and more.
		</p>

		</figure>

		<h3>What is the HTML+CSS stack good for?</h3>
		<p>
		Let’s first differentiate between what I call a web <em>page</em> and a web <em>app</em>: The goal of a web <em>page</em> is to serve content, on the other hand, the goal of a web <em>app</em> is to enable the user to perform interactive tasks. Of course, there are in-betweens, often in the form of content that might need customization depending on the logged in user and content that might allow some interactions.
		</p>
		<p>
		HTML+CSS fits the web <em>page</em> use case. Wow, what a revelation! It might seem obvious, but it seems we’ve all forgotten this these days. HTML+CSS does not fit the web <em>app </em>use case, or any in between.
		</p>
		<p>
		We said a web <em>page</em> serves content, but let’s dive into more concrete use cases:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Product / Company / Business landing page and marketing sites</li>
			<li>Personal portfolio / bio</li>
			<li>Blog</li>
			<li>Documentation</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>How to develop for HTML+CSS?</h3>
		<p>
		Authoring a pure HTML+CSS site can be done in any text editor, in any environment (any desktop OS, any smartphone, or even directly using GitHub’s single file editor) and previewed by simply opening the file in any browser.
		</p>
		<p>
		Keep the HTML of every page minimal and semantic. First, because there is no need for countless of &lt;div&gt;, but then because it makes sources more readable and easier to edit. See for example the <a href="https://github.com/steren/blog/blob/master/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/index.html">HTML sources of this page</a>: a total of 150 lines, 100 lines are for the content, the rest is metadata and page structure, nothing extra. 
		</p>
		<p>
		For consistency, all pages that need to share the same style can point to the same CSS file. This avoids  duplication when it comes to styling (but note that loading this file creates an extra HTTP request, which could be avoided if style was inlined).
		</p>
		<p>
		When not cluttered with unnecessary scripts, divs or classes, I have no issue writing HTML directly. Yes, the paragraph tags are a bit annoying and distracting, but proper indentation and syntax highlighting mitigate this.
		<br>
		Sometimes, for drafting long blog articles, I’m working in Google Docs, and when I’m happy, export the content to clean HTML using an add-on. Google Docs is awesome for collaboration, with powerful suggestions and commenting system. That’s ideal for the “draft” phase. 
		<br>
		Because all content is in git, final review and approval can be done via GitHub pull requests.
		</p>
		<p>
		When I publish a new page, I need to link to it manually from the index page. I’m OK with that. It’s done in one line. It also allows me to have more control over when I want the page to be “published”.
		</p>
		<p>
		I don't need to pay for custom themes, I have complete freedom in the style and layout of my site.
		I can embed anything I want without being restricted by the choice of the hosting platform: SVG images, 3D models, interactive JS experiences. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Creating a new page requires to clone an existing one.
		So... if I don’t use any templating system, how do I update my header, footer or nav? Well, simply by using the ”Replace in files” feature of any good text editor. They don’t need frequent updates anyway. The benefits of using a templating system is not worth the cost of introducing the tooling it requires.
		</p>
		
		<h3>In conclusion</h3>
		<p>
		You don’t need  Wordpress, or Hugo to put a blog online, or Angular, React or Next.js to put a web page online. Raw HTML and CSS do the job.
		</p>
		<p>
		That being said, you’ll need to pick up some tooling or framework if you want to build a web app or add more interactivity or customization to your web pages. And for that, I’m very glad to see that frameworks now seem to be prioritizing performance, notably by prioritizing serving the content first and leveraging caching whenever possible. The era of “download 5MB of JS first and then download content from a REST API” seems to be over for content web pages. (I personally think it’s still OK to do so for web apps, as the user’s intent and expectations are different).
		</p>
		<p>
		Is the “HTML+CSS only” approach a bit extreme? A bit, it’s basically saying “all software is terrible, how can I minimize my dependencies on software”. Web standards are a model of backward compatibility. I’m pretty confident that my web pages written in raw HTML+CSS will have no issue being accessed and authored 10 years from now, without me having to do anything.

    One Day on Slack...</h2><blockquote>
<p>1.3gb for a web app?! The size of your Docker image is getting out of control!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Uh-oh... The infrastructure team is <em>calling you out</em> for your Docker image size! Larger images means...</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/garbage-collection/">Garbage collection of stale images &amp; containers</a> takes longer*</li>
<li>Node storage runs out faster*</li>
<li>It takes longer to build the image</li>
<li>It takes longer to send the image over the wire</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these are small problems but <strong>they add up!</strong> So your image is too big–don't panic! Following a few simple steps, you can cut your Docker image down to size in next to no time.</p>
<p>*<em>this post assumes you are running Docker images in Kubernetes.</em></p>

    </a>
    Analyzing Your Image</h2><p>How big is your image? Assuming you've run <code>docker build</code> to build your image locally, this is easy to check with <code>docker images</code>:</p>
<pre><code>➜ docker images
REPOSITORY                           TAG      IMAGE ID      CREATED       SIZE
gcr.io/ns-1/toodle-app               d82c28d  e4f0fd00de6d  4 months ago  1.32GB
gcr.io/ns-2/go-af                    v0.12.1  d665db43eb95  4 months ago  911MB
</code></pre>
<p>Our <code>toodle-app</code> image is <code>1.32 GB</code>. But why is it so big? To figure that out, we'll use a handy tool called <a href="https://github.com/wagoodman/dive">dive</a> to analyze the image layer by layer.</p>
<pre><code>➜ dive gcr.io/ns-1/toodle-app:d82c28d
Image Source: docker://gcr.io/ns-1/toodle-app:d82c28d
Fetching image... (this can take a while for large images)
</code></pre>
<p>When it completes it will show a view like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://sequoia.makes.software/img/docker-dive-1.png" alt="dive command output"></p>
<p>There's a lot going on here!</p>
<ul>
<li>The top-left panel shows you <strong>layers</strong>, each of which corresponds to a Dockerfile command. (If the command if it's truncated, find the <em>full</em> command below in the "Layer Details" section.)</li>
<li>The right column shows the filesystem tree for the <strong>currently selected layer</strong>–more on this later</li>
<li>The bottom left is <strong>Image Details</strong> and does not change as you navigate through the layers</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the arrow keys to navigate up and down in the currently selected pane. Use <code>tab</code> to switch from the Layers pane to Current Layer Contents and back. Here I've pressed the down arrow several times to get to the 309 MB <code>RUN make build/bin/server</code> layer, then used <code>tab</code> to switch focus to the Current Layer Contents panel:</p>
<p><img src="https://sequoia.makes.software/img/docker-dive-2.png" alt="dive command output: &quot;RUN make build/bin/server&quot; layer"></p>
<p>By default, the Current Layer Contents shows you a full tree of the filesystem up to and including the selected layer. What's typically more useful when analyzing your image size by layer is to see what files were added by <em>that</em> layer. Use <code>ctrl+u</code> (see "^U Unmodified" in the bottom right of the screenshot) to toggle that option <em>off</em>, which <strong>hides files unmodified by the current layer</strong>. This leaves visible only files that were Added, Removed, or Modified by <em>this</em> layer:</p>
<p><img src="https://sequoia.makes.software/img/docker-dive-3.png" alt="dive command output: &quot;RUN make build/bin/server&quot; layer with unmodified files hidden"></p>
<p>Hello, what's this–this layer (which runs <code>go build</code> to build the actual toodle-app binary) add 309MB, but 237MB of that is <a href="https://golang.org/ref/mod#module-cache">go mod cache</a>, which <strong>we do not need after the binary has been built!</strong></p>
<p>Now we know why this layer is larger than it should be and we can see about cleaning it up (we'll do this <a href="#remove-build-tools-and-assets-after-the-build-completes">below</a>). Repeat the process for other large layers, or just poke around and see what each layer is adding or modifying.</p>
<p>Now that we know how to figure out <em>why</em> it's big, let's look at some strategies to cut down an image's size...</p>
<h2 id="chopping-your-image-in-twain">
    <a href="#chopping-your-image-in-twain">
      
    </a>
    Chopping Your Image in Twain</h2><p>When we build a project inside a docker image, each of the things we pull or copy into that image falls into one of two categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stuff we need to <strong>build</strong> the application</li>
<li>Stuff we need to <strong>run</strong> the application</li>
</ol>
<p>Some of the things we add to our toodle-app image, above:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>make</code>: needed to <strong>build</strong> the application</li>
<li><code>gcc</code>: needed to <strong>build</strong> the application</li>
<li>go modules: needed to <strong>build</strong> the application</li>
<li><code>nginx</code>: needed to <strong>run</strong> the application</li>
<li><code>./build/client/strings</code>: needed to <strong>run</strong> the application</li>
<li>the <code>build/bin/server</code> binary we create: needed to <strong>run</strong> the application</li>
</ul>
<p>The stuff we need only at build time (<code>make</code>, <code>gcc</code>, etc.) <strong>does not need to be shipped as part of the image</strong> because <strong>it is not needed at runtime</strong>. We could uninstall <code>make</code> <code>gcc</code> etc. after running the build, but there is an even cleaner way: <strong>create one image just for building the application and one image just for running the application</strong>.</p>
<p>This has become a common pattern, and there are two ways to do this:</p>
<h3 id="two-separate-docker-files-em-old-approach-should-not-be-needed-anymore-em-">
    <a href="#two-separate-docker-files-em-old-approach-should-not-be-needed-anymore-em-">
      
    </a>
    Two Separate Docker Files ❌ <em>(old approach, should not be needed anymore)</em></h3><p>With this approach you have one "builder" image and a separate "runtime" image. From a high level:</p>
<ol>
<li>A <code>Dockerfile.builder</code> Dockerfile defines your "builder" image. This builds an image based on....</li>
<li>A <em>separate</em> runtime <code>Dockerfile</code> contains <em>only</em> runtime dependencies</li>
</ol>
<p>Your CI step (e.g. on Google Cloud Build) loads the "Builder" image and <em>runs docker inside that image</em> to produce your runtime image.</p>
<h3 id="multi-stage-builds-em-current-approach-use-this-one-em-em-em-">
    <a href="#multi-stage-builds-em-current-approach-use-this-one-em-em-em-">
      
    </a>
    Multi-Stage Builds ✅ <em>(current approach: use this one</em> 😄<em>)</em></h3><p><a href="https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/">Multi-Stage Builds</a> vastly simplify this process! A multi-stage docker file has multiple <code>FROM</code> commands, the first one for the "builder" and the second one for the "runtime." Basically you install all the build dependencies in your builder, run your build, then in the runtime build you <code>COPY</code> the build artifact into your runtime image which you can then deploy.</p>
<pre><code>

<span>FROM</span> golang:<span>1.7</span>.<span>3</span> AS sequoiasbuilder
<span>WORKDIR</span><span> /tmp/foo
</span><span>COPY</span><span> src/main.go . 
</span>

go build -o my-application ./main.go



<span>FROM</span> alpine:latest 
<span>WORKDIR</span><span> /root/
</span>

<span>COPY</span><span> --from=sequoiasbuilder /tmp/foo/my-application .
</span><span>CMD</span><span> [<span>"./my-application"</span>]</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now only those things necessary for runtime will be shipped to kubernetes, and the go binary (and all the go modules that <code>go build</code> pulled in) etc. are discarded! Read <a href="https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/">this short article</a> for more.</p>
<h3 id="which-one-to-use-a-note-on-layer-caching">
    <a href="#which-one-to-use-a-note-on-layer-caching">
      
    </a>
    Which one to use? A note on layer caching</h3><p>The main reason to use the "multiple dockerfiles" approach is because the underlying "builder" image can be built once and reused across many builds. But Docker image layers by default, so why would you need this? You would need this if <strong>your (<abbr title="Continuous Integration">CI</abbr>) build environment is discarding Docker image layers after each build</strong>, as Google Cloud Platform does by default. Discard docker images after each build = build from scratch each time.</p>
<p>There is a simple fix for this, however: the Kaniko builder allows layers to be <strong>stored, cached, and reused.</strong></p>
<p>❗️ On <abbr title="Google Cloud Build">GCB</abbr>, using Kaniko is recommended for <strong>both</strong> builder <strong>and</strong> multi-stage patterns. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/kaniko-cache">Read more.</a></p>
<h2 id="cleaning-up-image-contents">
    <a href="#cleaning-up-image-contents">
      
    </a>
    Cleaning Up Image Contents</h2><p>Assuming you don't go the Multi-Stage route (above), or even if you did, you may be able to reduce your image size by <strong>removing stuff you don't actually need</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="ensure-you-em-actually-need-em-everything-you-39-ve-added">
    <a href="#ensure-you-em-actually-need-em-everything-you-39-ve-added">
      
    </a>
    Ensure you <em>actually need</em> everything you've added</h3><p>Did you start building your dockerfile by copying an existing one? If so, perhaps you have a command like this near the top</p>
<pre><code><span>RUN</span><span> apk add --no-cache make git curl bash nginx pkgconfig zeromq-dev \
     gcc musl-dev autoconf automake build-base libtool python</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Check that you <em>actually need</em> all these things! Some may be cruft from another project, or the dependency may have been replaced. <strong>This is especially important if you're building off a shared "base" image file.</strong> When using a shared base image, it's very likely that there's stuff in there you don't need. Easy money!</p>
<h3 id="remove-build-tools-and-assets-after-the-build-completes">
    <a href="#remove-build-tools-and-assets-after-the-build-completes">
      
    </a>
    Remove build tools and assets after the build completes</h3><p>As we saw above using <code>dive</code>, the toodle-app <code>go build</code> was downloading <strong>and caching</strong> 237 MB of go modules, which were needed during the build but not after:</p>

    Remove static assets when possible</h3><p>You may have static assets in your image that rarely change and are not actually needed <em>within</em> the application. For example, the toodle-app image contains various reports and media assets:</p>

<p>It's not huge, but this is 62MB that gets pulled by the Kubernetes controller for <em>every</em> deployment and copied into <em>every</em> container (the image upon which this post is based was running on 268 containers at the time of writing), all of which need garbage collection... it adds up!!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><label>Jan 7, 2021 • 10 min read</label><h2>No Meetings, No Deadlines, No Full-Time Employees</h2><p>I started Gumroad in 2011. In 2015, we reached a peak of 23 full-time employees. In 2016, after <a href="https://sahillavingia.com/reflecting">failing</a> to raise more money, I ended up back where I began: a one-person company.</p><p>Today, when I’m asked how many people work at Gumroad, I respond with “ten or so.” That’s how I convert the number of people we have into what others expect. But the truth is more complicated:</p><p>If we include everyone who works on Gumroad, it’s 25.</p><p>If we include full-time employees, it’s none. Not even me.</p><p>We have no meetings, and no deadlines either.</p><p>And it’s working: our creators earn over $175 million a year, and we generate $11 million in annualized revenue, growing 85% year-over-year.</p><p><img src="https://sahillavingia.com/2020-earnings.png"></p><p>That said, I don’t expect anyone to copy our way of working wholesale. We got here on accident, not some grand plan.</p><p>However, I do think there are pieces of our story and the way we work that could benefit other companies, their people, and–most importantly–their customers.</p><h2>Freedom at all costs</h2><p>After the layoffs in 2015, even though the team shrunk, Gumroad itself continued to grow.</p><p><img src="https://sahillavingia.com/2018-earnings.png"></p><p>But hiring people full-time and leasing a new office in San Francisco to work out of was untenable. Instead, I found an Indian firm called <a href="https://bigbinary.com/">BigBinary</a> and hired a few engineers as contractors.</p><p>These contractors saved the company. They fixed bugs and maintained the site while I answered support tickets, designed features, and wrote about new initatives.</p><p>Eventually, I hired back the same customer support person we had from before the layoffs, this time via an hourly contracting agreement too.</p><p>Meanwhile, I <a href="https://sahillavingia.com/bubble">moved to Utah</a> and attempted to become a full-time creator.</p><p>While Gumroad was no longer on track to become a billion-dollar company, I acquired a new asset: time. I used that time to take classes on writing and painting.</p><p>Because I was burned out and didn’t want to think about working any more than I needed to, I instituted a no-meeting, no-deadline culture.</p><p>For me, it was no longer about growth at all costs, but “freedom at all costs.”</p><p>This way, Gumroad stayed profitable, I could take a much-needed break to explore my hobbies, and the product continued to improve over time.</p><p><img src="https://sahillavingia.com/operating.png"></p><h2>How we work</h2><p>Today, working at Gumroad resembles working on an open source project like Rails. Except it’s neither open source, nor unpaid.</p><p>Instead of having meetings, people “talk” to each other via GitHub, Notion, and (occasionally) Slack, expecting responses within 24 hours. Because there are no standups or “syncs” and some projects can involve expensive feedback loops to collaborate, working this way requires clear and thoughtful communication.</p><p>Everyone writes well, and writes <em>a lot</em>.</p><p>There are no deadlines either. We ship incrementally, and launch things whenever the stuff in development is better than what’s currently in production. The occasional exception does exist, such as a tax deadline, but as a rule, I try not to tell anyone what to do or how fast to do it. When someone new joins the company, they do what everyone else does: go into our Notion queue, pick a task, and get to work, asking for clarification when needed.</p><p>Instead of setting quarterly goals or using OKRs, we move towards a single north star: maximizing how much money creators earn. It’s simple and measurable, allowing anyone in the company to do the math on how much a feature or bug-fix might be worth.</p><p>But we don’t prioritize ruthlessly.</p><p>People can work on what’s fun or rely on their intuition, because as long as we remain profitable and keep shipping, we tend to get to the important stuff eventually. Our <a href="https://www.notion.so/gumroad/Roadmap-ce2ad07c483046e7941227ad7810730d">public roadmap</a> helps Gumroad's creators hold us accountable.</p><p>We ship big things this way too.</p><p>In November 2020, we shipped <a href="https://gumroad.com/gumroad/p/introducing-gumroad-memberships">Gumroad Memberships</a>, a year in the works and now used by hundreds of creators to earn over $1,500,000 per month.</p><p>This is a screenshot from our roadmap to show what it looks like in practice:</p><p><img src="https://sahillavingia.com/memberships-roadmap.png"></p><p>For more, I recorded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PcIC1DKBU0">an hour-long video</a> about how we ship something as large as Gumroad Memberships.</p><p>Gumroad engineer Helen Hood, who shipped Memberships, says, “it’s one of the biggest product launches of my career, and we shipped it without a single meeting or video call. I've worked at your typical startup, with an open floor plan, lots of whiteboards, standups and sprint planning, beers after work. I’ve also worked on a remote team with little communication and engineers largely siloed on their own projects. The way we work at Gumroad is ideal for me. It lets me maximize my productive hours, and clock out when I've hit my limit.”</p><p>Those are the broad strokes, but we’ve published more specific documentation about the way we work:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.notion.so/gumroad/How-do-we-decide-what-to-work-on-f2064b8ab16c4cbcac1077e16c8cf33b">How do we decide what to work on?</a><p>“At the end of the day there's a lot of emotion that goes into Gumroad, that's not dissimilar from an art project. We sometimes pick what's fun and feels good to work on! We love listening to creators! We don't do tons of data analysis to decide what's worth working on.”</p></li><li><a href="https://www.notion.so/gumroad/How-do-we-communicate-06f2032bfdae4552a38149c99c68e3df">How do we communicate?</a><p>“Turn off all notifications from your phone!”</p></li><li><a href="https://www.notion.so/gumroad/What-does-working-at-Gumroad-feel-like-7d9fd1c9548245a58afe5569d76a7960">What does working at Gumroad feel like?</a><p>“We ship incrementally, iteratively, and have one massive tentpole launch a year. Every month we see how much creators got paid, then we move on. The journey is the fun part, we're not waiting to arrive at some destination.”</p></li><li><a href="https://www.notion.so/gumroad/What-s-not-so-good-at-Gumroad-847e3c285b1f45ab955ebacf52867900">What’s not so good at Gumroad?</a><p>“There's not a lot of room for growth. We're staying profitable, and not planning to double the team every year. While there will likely be a few leadership roles, there aren't plenty of them and they aren't built into the career path of working at Gumroad.”</p></li></ul><p>Gumroad’s Chris Maximin says, “this way to work is responsible for the highest level of productivity I've ever experienced. The ability to focus on actual work creates a virtuous circle benefiting both the company and the workers: 1) the company does not have to pay expensive engineers to sit around in endless, useless meetings, and 2) the engineers get to do more and learn more, which benefits them in the long term.”</p><p>This isn’t just for engineers.</p><p>Justin Mikolay, a writer at Gumroad, ships each of our <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/BCMDz">Creator Spotlights</a> this way, even though each one requires at least three people–plus the creator.</p><p><em>Everything</em> is handled this way: support, risk, content, growth, product prioritization, board decks, design feedback, and more.</p><h2>Minimum viable culture</h2><p>This way of working isn’t for everyone.</p><p>There are no retreats planned, and no social channels in Slack. There are limited opportunities for growth. And we can’t compete with the comp packages that big tech companies can provide.</p><p>But we can compete–and win–on flexibility.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/sidyadav">Sid Yadav</a>, former VP of Product at Teachable, joined Gumroad in 2018.</p><p>In his words, “most entrepreneurs have two options: work a full-time job and hustle nights/weekends, or leave your job and risk everything to start the company. Gumroad provided a third way: I could contract 20-35 hours a week, and for a couple days a week, incubate ideas and work on my next thing.”</p><p>In 2020, Sid left Gumroad to start his own creator economy company, <a href="https://circle.so/">Circle</a>, together with former Gumroad coworker <a href="https://community.circle.so/u/45ef416b">Rudy Santino</a>:</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m starting a new company: <a href="https://t.co/BW40WmGBlF">https://t.co/BW40WmGBlF</a>! I’ll be sharing more about it in the coming weeks, but today I wanted to show gratitude to the life situation that made this possible: contracting for a flexible remote startup — <a href="https://twitter.com/gumroad?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@gumroad</a>. It wouldn’t have happened without it.</p>— Sid Yadav (@sidyadav) <a href="https://twitter.com/sidyadav/status/1216761573479473152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 13, 2020</a></blockquote> <p>Working on Gumroad isn't a majority of anyone's identity.</p><p>People work at Gumroad as little as they need to sustain the other parts of their lives they prefer to spend their time and energy on: a creative side-hustle, their family, or anything else.</p><p>Gumroad engineer Nathan Chan says, “I produce more value for my time than at any other company in my career, and I’m able to fully participate in parenting and watching my kiddo grow up.”</p><p>That includes me.</p><p>From 2011 to 2016, building Gumroad was my singular focus in life. But today, it is just a part of my life, like a hobby might be. For example, I paint for fun, and every once in a while, I sell a painting.</p><h2>A company of creators</h2><p>One day, out of the blue, I received an email from <a href="https://twitter.com/dvassallo">Daniel Vassallo</a>. I knew Daniel; he was a creator who had made over $250,000 on Gumroad in less than a year.</p><p>He was already using the product–so he understood what problems Gumroad ought to solve next–and he had some ideas for how he could help out:</p><blockquote>I love Gumroad (and I’m living off it!), I enjoy product scoping and strategy, and I think I can take over your PM tasks. I would only be able to dedicate around 2hrs/day on average, but I’d be available daily. Don’t know if this is the type of commitment you had in mind, but I figured if there’s a place where this arrangement can work, it’s Gumroad :)</blockquote><p>It was a perfect fit. Daniel became our new Head of Product.</p><p>It can be a great deal for Gumroad too. Before Daniel quit his job at Amazon, he was making over $400,000 a year. We pay him $120,000 a year.</p><p>How? He works ten hours a week for us. In his words:</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Almost nobody is seeing this trend as an opportunity to work less, rather than to earn more. <a href="https://t.co/U9YBqp1ebn">https://t.co/U9YBqp1ebn</a></p>— Daniel Vassallo (@dvassallo) <a href="https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1334288446697865216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2020</a></blockquote> <h2>Getting paid</h2><p>In practice, we pay everyone hourly based on their role. The range varies from $50 (customer support) to $250 (Head of Product) an hour.</p><p>Recently I standardized our rates world-wide:</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">🌍🌎🌏 Excited to announce we've deprecated all location-based pay! Gumroad will now pay you the same salary, no matter if you live in San Francisco, Bangalore, Lagos, or anywhere else.</p>— Sahil (@shl) <a href="https://twitter.com/shl/status/1334201934702493697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2020</a></blockquote> <p>This rate is agreed upon during our interview process:</p><ol><li>Apply via a form.</li><li>An unpaid, few-hour challenge, that resembles the high-level work we do at Gumroad. This may include breaking down a large shipment (like Gumroad Memberships) into its atomic parts, planning the schema associated with a new feature, or writing up a Help Center article.</li><li>A paid, few-week trial period, that resembles the day-to-day work we do at Gumroad.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>By November 5, 2020, as election results continued to be tallied, it was becoming certain that Joe Biden would go on to become the winner of the 2020 US presidential election. But the outcome was far more nail-biting than expected. After all, surveys projected him to win by <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/national/">8% points nationally</a>, high single digit margins in all swing states, including by 8.4% in Wisconsin 7.9%, in Michigan, and 2.5% in Florida.</p>
<p>Bidenâ€™s presumed strength was such that even when gold-rated pollster Anne Selzer came out with a <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2020/10/31/election-2020-iowa-poll-president-donald-trump-leads-joe-biden/6061937002/">+7 Trump rating in Iowa</a>, she was loudly panned â€” NYTimesâ€™ Nate Cohn <a href="https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn/status/1322684447817453569">commented</a> â€œSelzer can be wrong, and has been before,â€� with other commentators piling on as well.</p>
<p>What happened of course was different. Trump outperformed polling by 6% in Florida, 7.7% in Wisconsin, and 7.3% in Ohio. Seltzer of Iowa ended up right, when Trump beat the Iowa consensus polling by 6.9%.</p>
<p>Whatâ€™s shocking in these results isnâ€™t that polls can be off â€” that happens. Whatâ€™s shocking is the breadth of the error, across presidential, senatorial, and house levels; across geographies; across pollsters. This miss was in the same direction, of the same intensity, as the miss in 2016, despite all the hand-wringing and adjustments and model updates that happened in the interim.</p>
<p>How did the most generously-funded, highest-quality, and highest-frequency election polling in history get it wrong? While the eulogy is still being written, many theories point to a fundamental problem â€” a response sample that turned out to be non-random.</p>
<p>For anyone who has taken a beginnerâ€™s statistics course, the foundation of all calculations rely on random sampling. Confidence intervals and margins of error are meaningless if your sample isnâ€™t random.</p>
<p>While weâ€™d like to believe polls are random samples â€” they are not. Non-responsive bias and self-selection are two of many ways samples can be improperly collected; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/upshot/polls-what-went-wrong.html">a leading theory</a> is that Trump voter social disaffection led to the polling misses.</p>
<p>We, the voting public, believed that polling firms who were well-funded and staffed to the brim with PhDs, would figure out techniques around this. As is now obvious, that assumption was dead wrong, as wrong in 2020 as it was in 2016.</p>
<h2 id="whatdoestheelectionresulthavetodowithuserresearch">What does the election result have to do with user research?</h2>
<p>If the best polling firms in the world can come to the wrong conclusions, what does this mean for user research?</p>
<p>User research often manifests itself as independent functions within larger corporations. Or, it refers to the products of companies like User Leap, User Testing, and others who promote the idea of â€œcontinuousâ€� research, promising Web app developers with the data they need to understand how users use their product.</p>
<div>

  <p><img src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/survey-box.png"><br>
  <span>Does this <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=foresee+survey&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwja8Ournu_tAhVKsFMKHQGHDKgQ2-cCegQIABAA&amp;oq=foresee+s&amp;gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQARgAMgQIIxAnMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADIGCAAQCBAeMgYIABAIEB4yBggAEAgQHjIECAAQGDIECAAQGDoECAAQQzoFCAAQsQM6CAgAELEDEIMBOgcIABCxAxBDUNJhWKFsYORwaAFwAHgAgAFdiAGGBZIBAjEwmAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWfAAQE&amp;sclient=img&amp;ei=PA7pX9riH8rgzgKBjrLACg&amp;bih=699&amp;biw=1440&amp;hl=en#imgrc=pySAZ-pP94o7hM&amp;imgdii=CoQbW0vptoztuM">annoying window</a> ring a bell?</span>

</p></div>
<p>Regardless of the tool, these approaches have the same fault at their core â€” the lack of a random sample. Most users dismiss survey prompts on web sites. Most users will never fork over our time to conduct an in-person research survey. The people that do respond are self-selecting by definition â€” maybe theyâ€™re overly pissed off about something or maybe theyâ€™re bored, but theyâ€™re definitely not random.</p>
<p>If the data youâ€™re using isnâ€™t randomly sampled, your conclusions are going to be invalid. And that can be costly â€” for your time, your team, and your business.</p>
<h2 id="howdoyoudouserresearchtherightway">How do you do user research the right way?</h2>
<h3 id="lookatyouranalyticsmorecarefully">Look at your analytics more carefully.</h3>
<p>User research purports to answer â€œwhyâ€� people behave in the ways that you see them behave in your analytics. But as we know, the whys are based on non-random samples and therefore are unsound.</p>
<p>The good news is, analytics tools like Google Analytics (or <a href="https://usefathom.com/" rel="nofollow">Fathom</a> for the privacy-minded) track nearly all users, so thereâ€™s no need to randomly sample (and when they do, itâ€™s a real random sample). They also go a long way to answer the â€œwhys.â€� Sometimes metrics differ by desktop or mobile â€” which points to device type as influential. Sometimes metrics differ by browser, which could point to specific browser bugs. With the right cut of the data, an analytics tool can often answer the why through data alone. In our case, to develop our product roadmap, we used search trends and our internal analytics to get insights that solitaire players also played <a href="https://solitaired.com/mahjong">Mahjong</a>, <a href="https://solitaired.com/freecell">FreeCell</a>, and <a href="https://solitaired.com/spider">Spider Solitaire</a>.</p>
<p>Going further, tools like HotJar record randomly-sampled screens and create heatmaps, so you can actually see what a random sample of users does on your site, which arguably is multiples more valuable than getting a response from a self-selected user or someone in a user research lab. (Note, the privacy-minded out there may not like these sorts of recording software tools â€” which is a worthy debate to have).</p>
<h3 id="experimentmore">Experiment more.</h3>
<p>Ultimately, what someone may say in a survey or explain in a lab will differ from how theyâ€™ll react in real life. The only way to know if something is working is to try it. There are many low-cost ways to try new things, including a/b testing and painted door testing (link to other post), that will minimize the time it takes for you to learn about user behavior.</p>
<p>The benefits of experimentation go beyond simply user-testing. Building an organization that can execute tests quickly means that you can iterate faster. Waiting for user research feedback can often have the opposite effect â€” adding an additional bottleneck into an often already complex software development process. <a href="https://thestartup.substack.com/p/unicorn-traits" rel="nofollow">Innovating early and often is good</a>.</p>
<h3 id="builduserresearchintoyourui">Build user research into your UI.</h3>
<p>Some sites, like Stitchfix, donâ€™t guess what their users want â€” they just ask. Integrating a survey into the actual user experience, which more or less forces users to respond and reduces bias, is another way of learning a userâ€™s intent.</p>

<h2 id="whendoestraditionaluserresearchwork">When does traditional user research work?</h2>
<p>One of the few times when user research is beneficial is when you donâ€™t need a random sample â€” aka, you have big, enterprise customers that account for a majority of your revenue.</p>
<p>Another area where user research can be important is when you have zero product and are only exploring a market. Here, however, the most important part is building relationships with potential customers â€” user research here is less about actual product workflows and more about building the customer relationships you need to get started.</p>
<p>Most importantly, user research is not just a standard stage in the product development process, where you are interviewing individual customers and relying on non-random feedback. User research should be thought about more holistically, encompassing all the tools that you have, and relying on the ones that can give you a more complete picture of user behavior â€” that includes analytics, experimentation, and data-yielding product workflows. Perhaps Googleâ€™s embrace of <a href="https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/96893097926894278-quantitative-user-experience-researcher/">quantitative user research</a> will move product development further in this direction.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>At an early hour of the morning, Tesla &amp; SpaceX CEO Elon Musk tweeted “Use Signal” — the precursor for this tweet was an earlier reply to WhatsApp’s recent policy that forcefully asks to comply to data sharing with Facebook.</p>

<p>WhatsApp is actually owned by Facebook Inc. (FB), now Facebook is apparently trying to widen its human data research to the next level. With the past scandals like Cambridge Analytica, the social media platform’s credibility has been shaken.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the Cambridge Analytica scandal surfaced within a few weeks after Elon Musk <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/23/17156402/elon-musk-deleted-tesla-and-spacex-facebook-pages-twitter-challenge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ordered</a> to remove <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/spacex/">SpaceX</a>, <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/">Tesla</a>, and his official page from Facebook. Musk has been a staunch opposer of Facebook and regularly criticizes the social media platform for bad user experience and possible misuse of personal data.</p>

<p>In the new WhatsApp terms of use agreement (screenshot above), it’s clearly mentioned that if you do not agree with Facebook data sharing otherwise you will not be granted permission to use WhatsApp (a little rephrased I know but that’s what Facebook meant actually).</p>



<p>Now with WhatsApp’s mandatory data sharing with Facebook, <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a> decided to give a boost to Signal Private Messenger. As of this writing, Signal Messenger 570k+ users on Google Playstore vs. 127 million+ WhatsApp users. With Musk’s more than 41 million followers on Twitter, the number of Signal users is likely to hike in the coming hours, days, and weeks.</p>



<p>Another interesting bit is that Elon Musk has now <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-06/musk-close-to-surpassing-bezos-as-world-s-richest-person" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">become</a> the world’s richest person with Tesla stock reaching an all-time high of $796.12 ($3,980.6 pre-split) at the time of this writing.</p>



<p>However, Signal offers real end-to-end encryption for enhanced security and privacy. <a href="https://signal.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Signal Messenger</a> has no social media partners to share data for profit and that’s even better.</p>



<p>The dilemma is, how we are going to convince our friends and family to migrate to Signal when they are addicted to WhatsApp, I don’t see that happening very soon.</p>

<pre><em>Today we’ll take a turn and showcase a personal project developed by our Tech Lead, Bruno, who took the multiple hours of lockdown we experienced last year and turned them into an initiative that allowed him to communicate with his 6 year old daughter. Below you’ll be able to review his experience and gather all of the details of his project (in case you want to replicate his system).</em></pre>



<p>In terms of social interactions, 2020 was an odd year, with cyclic lockdowns and openings. <strong>Keeping in touch with our close ones was one of the main challenges for all of us</strong>. The lockdowns are a bizarre experience in itself, but one of the strangest parts for me was when I topped it all up with a fever. It ended up being just a regular flu in the end, but for precaution my doctor ordered me to lock me down in a room for two weeks. Being there just a few meters away from my family and not being able to hug them or have a direct conversation was <strong>hard for all of us, but especially for my six-year-old daughter who wasn’t able to wrap her head around the reasons we couldn’t just see each other.</strong></p>



<p>So this time I decided to build something for her to keep us in touch in case something similar happens. The basic concept is a <strong>simplified interface for a Telegram voice chat with only a few (big) buttons: it should allow to easily and intuitively send and receive voice messages</strong>. Of course having a raspberry-pi as the core of this device was a no-brainer, since It has everything that’s needed for the project: WiFi connectivity, low level interface to control leds and buttons, and of course a complete OS where to run a Python interpreter to control everything.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_blueprint-300x217.jpg" alt="" width="538" height="389" srcset="https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_blueprint-300x217.jpg 300w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_blueprint-1024x739.jpg 1024w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_blueprint-768x555.jpg 768w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_blueprint-640x462.jpg 640w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_blueprint-100x72.jpg 100w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_blueprint.jpg 1108w" sizes="(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px"></figure></div>



<h3>TUI</h3>



<p>A good idea when dealing with electronic projects is to <strong>start small and have a proof of concept working before getting all the components</strong> and wire the whole thing together. In this case I started by creating the main program but replacing the physical button interface with a <em>TUI</em> (terminal user interface). The code can be found <a href="https://gitlab.com/daylanKifky/daddy-box-python-module" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in this repository</a>, you should be able to test it by running it using the <code>--tui</code> flag like this:</p>



<pre>python -m daddy_box --tui</pre>



<div><figure><img src="https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_tui.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_tui.jpg 575w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_tui-300x242.jpg 300w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_tui-100x81.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px"></figure></div>



<h3>Telegram bot setup</h3>



<p>The first time you run it you will need to give it a telegram bot key. Follow <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this steps</a> to create your instance of a Bot, and then run it with the <code>--setup-bot</code> flag and input the information the <em>BotFather</em> gave you.</p>



<p>You should now be able to search for the bot’s username in telegram and exchange some messages with it. You will first find that you get “not allowed” responses. The <strong>idea behind this bot is to exchange messages privately with just one user</strong>, so you have to tell the bot which is the allowed user id to interact with.</p>



<p>Take a look at the terminal where the bot is running, you will see some printed messages like this one:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_user_id.png" alt="" srcset="https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_user_id.png 571w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_user_id-300x66.png 300w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_user_id-100x22.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px"></figure></div>



<p>Copy your user-id from there and give it to the bot using the <code>--setup-user</code> flag.  You should now be able to send and receive voice messages, so we are ready to start with the physical part of the project.</p>







<h3>Raspberry pi HAT</h3>



<p>When doing a one-shot project like this I normally use breadboards or perfboards to assemble all the components. I used that approach a bunch of times in the past to handle a few backlitghted buttons, and the process was always frustrating: I ended up spending lots of time with the soldering and wiring of the components. So this time I decided to actually do what I promised myself each one of those times: design a <strong>breakout HAT for the raspberry with screw terminals where to easily connect everything.</strong></p>



<p>Since I was at it I added a darlington array and a number of selectable power sources in order to potentially handle bigger loads. I designed it in Kicad and then ordered a few PCBs. You can find the project files <a href="https://gitlab.com/daylanKifky/daddy-box-raspberry-pi-hat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_HAT-1024x681.jpg" alt="" width="583" height="388" srcset="https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_HAT-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_HAT-300x199.jpg 300w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_HAT-768x511.jpg 768w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_HAT-640x425.jpg 640w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_HAT-100x66.jpg 100w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_HAT.jpg 1053w" sizes="(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px"></figure></div>



<h3>Audio</h3>



<p>One little detail I wasn’t taking into consideration when I started the project was the fact that a <strong>raspberry pi doesn’t have an audio input</strong>.<strong> So I had to buy an USB microphone.</strong> A cheap one from a local store did the trick. I removed all the plastic parts and shortened the cable to avoid unnecessary EM interference.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_mic.jpg" alt="" width="322" height="443" srcset="https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_mic.jpg 581w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_mic-218x300.jpg 218w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_mic-349x480.jpg 349w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_mic-73x100.jpg 73w" sizes="(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px"></figure></div>



<p>Before using it I also tried a small USB audio card but I had a lot of conflicts being raised by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/" target="_blank">pyaudio,</a> the library I used to handle the recording and playing of audio files in python.</p>



<p>For the audio output I connected a small speaker directly to the RPi audio output jack. The volume is a little low, but it gets the work done.</p>



<h3>Final assembly</h3>



<p>Once the PCBs and all the components arrived it was time to replace the <em>TUI</em> with a Button UI. I used the handy <a href="https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gpiozero</a> library to handle button press and leds. For the external case I used a shoe box to which I made holes for the buttons and speaker.</p>

<p>Once everything was set and tested I disassembled and packed all the components inside the box, wrapped the whole thing as a gift to prepare it for the best part.</p>



<h3>XMAS</h3>



<p>I gave the box as a present to my daughter to be opened on Christmas eve without telling her what the purpose of all those parts were. <strong>The next morning we spent a couple of hours putting it all together, so she discovered the purpose of the device, its final shape and got a glimpse of the internal functionality during the process.</strong></p>



<div><figure><img src="https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_assemblykid-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="510" height="286" srcset="https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_assemblykid-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_assemblykid-300x169.jpg 300w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_assemblykid-768x432.jpg 768w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_assemblykid-640x360.jpg 640w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_assemblykid-100x56.jpg 100w, https://chordata.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daddy_box_assemblykid.jpg 1422w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px"></figure></div>



<p>When it was done my kid liked it way more than I could ever expect. What I conceived as an utilitary tool to keep us connected when I wasn’t close soon became a part of a game of exchanging messages about every little action in the everyday routine, even when we are just a few meters away 😅.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I’m quite happy with the result. Not only did this object help strengthen our relationship, it ended up being a <strong>cool way to transmit the hacker-maker values and habits to a young mind.</strong></p>



<p>I hope some of you find this useful and if you try to build this at home I would love to know how it went for you, please share your experience in <a href="https://forum.chordata.cc/">our forum</a> using the <em>offtopic</em> tag.</p>



<p>And above all, have a great starting of the year!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The images of the storming of the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C., are painful to the soul of every friend of democracy. The democratic world is shocked and appalled. But that’s not enough. We need all democrats around the world to stand shoulder to shoulder. The struggle against narrow-minded delusion, against intolerance, against the division of our societies is our common struggle. Indeed, it would be self-righteous to point the finger solely at America right now. Here in Germany, too, in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/when-far-right-hatred-turns-into-terrorism-a-e58ac378-bc7c-442e-a024-c801296d2b9c" data-link-flag="english">Hanau</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/far-right-terrorism-in-germany-shooting-exposes-lapses-in-security-apparatus-a-1291075.html" data-link-flag="english">Halle </a>and on the steps of Reichstag (in coronavirus protests last summer), we have seen how agitation and inflammatory words can spark hateful deeds.</p><div>
<p>This should be extremely clear: Those who, like Trump, have spent years using words to constantly inflame and incite their own supporters, ultimately bear responsibility for this attack on the heart of American democracy. We see all around the world what happens when radical populists come to power and systematically stir up resentment against democratic institutions. Yes, democracy thrives on contradiction, even disagreement. But it dies when brute force silences the other, when sheer hatred breaks all bounds of decency and respect.</p><p>The radical mob does not represent the majority in the United States. The vast majority of American voters stand firmly behind democracy and voted decisively against a right-wing populist. And it’s not just Donald Trump who needs to finally accept that. Every Republican with a modicum of responsibility needs to finally repudiate Trump once and for all. The American courts have ruled clearly that this was a lawful election. Those who disrespect that election result are disrespecting their own people.</p>
</div><div>
<p>America’s strength is its diversity. It is admired around the world for the freedom of its democracy. U.S. president-elect Joe Biden knows this. His call yesterday for mutual respect and reconciliation were the soothing words of a president. And the confirmation of the election of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris by the U.S. Congress was the best democratic response to those who sowed chaos and discord in Washington yesterday.</p><p>As friends of America and as friends of democracy, we wish Joe Biden and Kamala Harris great strength in the difficult task of overcoming America’s division. We stand together with them in the fight for democracy. In keeping with the quintessential American motto: "E pluribus unum" – out of many, one.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>As I have explored previously, various commentators in the early Trump era attempted to <a href="https://www.vox.com/features/2019/11/11/18273141/postmodernism-donald-trump-lyotard-baudrillard">link</a> the new president to the body of thought often known as “postmodern theory.” As a recap of this discussion, I will quote here from some of my <a href="https://arcdigital.media/the-irony-poisoner-88d3f15232b9">prior writing</a> on the subject:</p><p>“In early 2017 . . . Steve Bannon, a White House strategist at the time, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/top-wh-strategist-vows-a-daily-fight-for-deconstruction-of-the-administrative-state/2017/02/23/03f6b8da-f9ea-11e6-bf01-d47f8cf9b643_story.html">proclaimed</a> that the Trump administration would undertake the ‘deconstruction of the administrative state.’ Bannon’s invocation of this old buzzword of critical theory led to plenty of <a href="https://twitter.com/HeerJeet/status/834922404216360961">humorous</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/garymmorris/status/835132954712104962">Twitter takes</a>, many linking [deconstructive literary theorist Paul] de Man to Trump’s postmodern White House.</p><p>“Conservatives usually repudiate postmodernism, but this was not the first time an improbable alliance between these nemeses had been suggested. At least since a George W. Bush aide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality-based_community">dismissed</a> ‘the reality-based community,’ the notion that there is a ‘<a href="https://arcdigital.media/the-rise-of-post-modern-conservatism-53cf8651b052">postmodern turn</a>’ on the right has gained a certain currency. Many have found further evidence of a synthesis of conservatism and postmodernism in certain glib pronouncements emerging out of the Trump orbit, from Kellyanne Conway’s ‘alternative facts’ to Rudy Giuliani’s ‘truth isn’t truth.’”</p><p>Now, as the Trump era draws to a close, I would like to discuss a more concrete and, in my view, more interesting aspect of the admittedly tenuous linkage between Trump and “theory.” This is the presence of several individuals in the orbit of his White House who, in contrast to “folk postmodernists” like Conway and Giuliani, have an intellectual background and a sustained interest in “theory.”</p><p>I will focus on three such figures, but first, I will consider one other with a powerful spectral presence in the Trump-aligned political realm: Andrew Breitbart. Breitbart died before Trump’s political rise, but the eponymous publication he founded became an unofficial house organ of Trump’s campaign as well as a feeder of staff to his administration. One <em>Breitbart</em> alumna who ended up in the White House will be my second subject: Julia Hahn, previously a student of philosophy and psychoanalysis. Next, I’ll consider Darren Beattie, a former Trump speechwriter who wrote a doctoral dissertation on Martin Heidegger. Finally, I’ll return briefly to the theoretical interests of the so-called “philosopher-CEO” Peter Thiel, who has made regular appearances in my writing in the past. Thiel was never part of Trump’s administration, but he was an influential supporter, delegate, convention speaker, and member of the transition team in 2016.</p><h4>Andrew Breitbart</h4><p>Breitbart deserves mention here because although he helped establish the negative tenor of much of the contemporary right’s attitude to “theory,” he also pointed towards a different relationship between right-wing insurgents and the body of thought referred to by that term. In his 2011 autobiography <em>Righteous Indignation</em>, Breitbart wrote about his induction into “cultural Marxism” in college, specifically the work of the Frankfurt School theorists Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, and Herbert Marcuse, and his later realization that “it was everywhere, from the mainstream media to Hollywood to the educational system to the government.” He describes critical theory as a “mission to destroy society and culture using the Marxist dialectic.”</p><p>It is worth quoting Breitbart at greater length on this subject:</p><p>“[Critical theory] was . . . a theory of criticizing everyone and everything everywhere. It was an attempt to tear down the social fabric by using all the social sciences (sociology, psychology, economics, political science, etc.); it was an infinite and unending criticism of the status quo, adolescent rebellion against all established social rules and norms.”</p><p>This passage should be read against the grain of its overt anti-theory stance. Elsewhere, Breitbart tells us that American society and politics is controlled by the “Democrat-Media Complex,” the “the power structure of Hollywood, Washington, and New York,” which is infused with cultural Marxism. How does one respond to this? Presumably by way of  a “ruthless criticism of all that exists” – in other words, by using the methods that Breitbart views as the main vice of critical theory; perhaps, also, by engaging in “adolescent rebellion against all established social rules and norms,” which is to say, against the politically correct dogmas of hegemonic liberalism. (Breitbart’s publication, recall, went on to employ Milo Yiannopolous.)</p><p>This is the real task Breitbart sets for himself and for the American right, and in this way, he seeks to learn from the “cultural Marxists” he repudiates. This means learning from his enemies, the cultural Marxists, in order to defeat them, since “[a]s it stands, the Frankfurt School–taught left is fighting the political battle on both the political and the cultural battlefields. Conservatives are fighting it only on the political battlefield.” Breitbart’s famous motto, “Politics is downstream from culture,” proceeds from its founder’s belief that the right should embrace the approach he attributes to critical theory to reclaim the culture from the “Democrat-Media Complex.” (As is often noted, the motto is Breitbart’s spin on the work of the Italian political theorist Antonio Gramsci, a key figure in his “cultural Marxism” narrative.) To borrow the Hegelian terminology his Frankfurt School nemeses might find congenial, Breitbart set out to “negate the negation.”</p><p>What’s difficult to determine from <em>Righteous Indignation</em> is how fully Breitbart believes the just-so story he relates about a handful of relatively obscure philosophers single-handedly undermining American society by slowly meming their ideas into the mainstream through the universities. Perhaps this is a conscious act of mythmaking carried out in the service of Breitbart’s own meme warfare counterattack. Regardless, his ambivalent relationship to “theory” – both his primary antagonist and a crucial inspiration for his project – set the stage for later developments in the Trump era.</p><h4>Julia Hahn</h4><p>Julia Hahn is, as of the writing of this post, still Special Assistant to the President, having outlasted many other White House staffers. This includes the man who brought her into Trump’s orbit: Steve Bannon, Andrew Breitbart’s friend and successor at the media empire he launched. Hahn wrote for <em>Breitbart</em> throughout the 2016 primary and general elections, prior to entering the Trump administration. She was best known for her polemical coverage of establishment Republicans like Paul Ryan and for incendiary immigration reporting that repeatedly drew attention to crimes committed by immigrants.</p><p>What brings Hahn to our attention here, however, is her <a href="https://thepointmag.com/politics/uchicago-bannons-bannons-bannon/">prior career</a> as a student at the University of Chicago. Less than two years before taking a job at <em>Breitbart</em>, Hahn, as an undergraduate, appeared on a panel discussion at Chicago related to the work of Leo Bersani, a crucial figure in the development of queer theory. The video of this session is still available on <a href="https://youtu.be/39FMKMdoM18?t=2246">Youtube</a>. The moderator who introduces Hahn to the audience situates her research “at the intersection of psychoanalysis and post-Foucauldian philosophical inquiry” and explains that her senior thesis explores “how psychoanalysis reveals flaws in the neo-Kantian conception of autonomy.”</p><p>Hahn breaks the ice at the beginning of her presentation with a joke about anal sex (a theoretical interest of Bersani’s), then delivers a precisely argued reassessment of French social theorist Michel Foucault’s critique of Freudian psychoanalysis. For background, Foucault’s critique of psychoanalysis goes approximately as follows: Freud believed that by working through repressed desires in speech, suffering people might find relief from the harmful effects of repression; but according to Foucault, rather than offering liberation through the release of pent-up desires, psychoanalysis <em>produced</em> those desires as discursive phenomena available to be monitored by power for the purpose of social control; in this sense, it amounted to a new strategy of social discipline comparable to the Catholic confessional. Hahn’s goal is to nuance Foucault’s critique by showing that Freud anticipated some elements of it, and to propose a model of psychoanalysis that survives Foucauldian scrutiny. In the course of this discussion, Hahn argues that Foucault’s account of psychoanalysis as a technique of power does not truly discredit it. Power is unavoidable, she says; “the problem,” as she reads Foucault, “is when power becomes rigid, and leads to states of what he calls domination.”</p><p>Given Hahn’s later career, it’s hard not to hear a faint echo here of Andrew Breitbart’s attack on the “Democrat-Media Complex.” Perhaps someone deeply invested in Foucault’s criticism of the diffuse, invisible ways in which power is exercised in the modern world, as Hahn appeared to be, might find some appeal in Andrew Breitbart’s account of the full-spectrum liberal “domination” of education, entertainment, and other industries and institutions, just as Breitbart himself was unmistakably attracted to aspects of the “culture industry” critique of the Frankfurt School theorists he detested.</p><p>Hahn’s presentation gives the impression of a nuanced and even-handed style of thought that contrasts with her overtly propagandistic work for <em>Breitbart</em>. Yet her paper might be read as offering a preemptive retort to this criticism, which goes something like this: no doubt, <em>Breitbart</em> is a purveyor of political propaganda, just as Freudian psychoanalysis is a technique of power. But if, as Foucault argues (and Breitbart would concur), the operations of power are omnipresent, perhaps university lectures and subtle literary essays are no less propagandistic than incendiary anti-immigration screeds. Hence, just as, for Hahn, the investment of psychoanalysis in power relations does not discredit it, especially if it can offer a means for resisting “domination,” the same might be said of outrage clickbait. Indeed, the latter’s …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content"><article><div><div><p><img src="https://pachdm.com/images/blog-images/Pachyderm-1-12-announcment.jpg" alt="Pachyderm 1.12 GA Announcement"></p><p>2020 was a crazy year, to say the least. That’s why we thought it best not to tempt fate by trying to squeeze in a major release during the last few weeks of December. And so, with a renewed sense of optimism, and 2020 now officially in the history books (hooray!), we’re excited to announce the release of Pachyderm 1.12.</p><p>Here’s a look at what’s new:</p><h3 id="new-pipeline-input-type-groups">New Pipeline Input Type: Groups</h3><p>Groups give you a brand new way to combine data from multiple sources on Pachyderm. Similar to a database <em>group-by</em>, <strong><a href="https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/concepts/pipeline-concepts/datum/group/">Groups in Pachyderm</a></strong> are a special type of pipeline input that enables you to aggregate files from one or more Pachyderm repositories via a particular naming pattern. For example:</p><p><strong>Groups within a single repo</strong></p><pre><code>$ pachctl list file repo@master
/labs/patientID1-labID1.txt
/labs/patientID2-labID1.txt
/labs/patientID1-labID2.txt
/labs/patientID3-labID1.txt
</code></pre><p>By configuring our pipeline input type to <code>group</code> and defining our <code>capture group</code> to match on <code>patientID</code>, we can <strong>aggregate all of patientID1 lab results into a single datum</strong> and create separate datums for all of patient 2 and 3. Neat!</p><p>Where Pachyderm Groups really start to shine is when you want to combine data from multiple repos and return the result as a single datum to be processed independently. For example, imagine we have a retail department store chain with multiple stores and different repos storing purchase information, return information and store identity information:</p><p><strong>Groups using multiple repos</strong></p><pre><code>Repo 1: Purchases
/ORDERW078929_STOREID2.txt file 64B  
/ORDERW080231_STOREID5.txt file 65B  
...
</code></pre><pre><code>Repo 2: Returns
NAME                       TYPE SIZE 
/ORDERW080231_STOREID5.txt file 65B  
/ORDERW080520_STOREID1.txt file 65B  
...
</code></pre><pre><code>Repo 3: Stores
/STOREID1.txt file 85B  
/STOREID2.txt file 85B  
/STOREID3.txt file 84B
</code></pre><p>Let’s say we wanted to get a list of all transactions (purchases or returns) grouped by storeID. Thanks to the new Pachyderm Group input type, this is easy. We simply specify our matching criteria and let Pachyderm handle the rest.</p><p>For those familiar with Pachyderm <code>joins</code>, you might be wondering how groups are different? In a nutshell, <code>joins</code> will return a single datum per match. Groups, on the other hand, will return all matches as a single datum.</p><p><strong><a href="https://pachdm.com/3omRJX0">Try groups out for yourself with this great example.</a></strong></p><h3 id="automated-deferred-processing-with-triggers">Automated Deferred Processing with Triggers</h3><p>Another exciting addition to Pachyderm 1.12 is Triggers, which gives users greater control over how and when to process data.</p><p>Take our retail example from earlier. Throughout the day we have lots of transactions happening; for each transaction the company has to pay anywhere from 1-3% of the total plus a flat fee to the bank (aka interchange-rates). A Pachyderm Trigger could help reduce those costs by automatically deferring each transaction’s processing using a predefined set of criteria – For example, every night at 10pm, or in batches of 20.</p><p>Now, instead of paying a processing fee for each transaction, we only pay it once. Cha ching!</p><p><strong><a href="https://pachdm.com/3pPjWG6">Give Pachyderm Triggers a try.</a></strong></p><h3 id="pachyderm-112-enterprise-additions">Pachyderm 1.12 Enterprise Additions:</h3><p>Pachyderm Enterprise includes everything mentioned so far as well as a few other goodies:</p><ul><li><a href="https://pachdm.com/3be5i7c">Group support for OIDC</a></li><li>Auth-enabled Extract/Restore</li></ul><h3 id="other-noteworthy-items">Other Noteworthy Items:</h3><p><strong><a href="https://pachdm.com/35gQUYm">Improved Spouts</a></strong>
We re-architected spouts to improve stability and security while also making it easier to integrate with external data sources.</p><p><strong><a href="https://pachdm.com/2MxA0hm">New “outer joins”</a></strong>
Where inner joins in Pachyderm will only return matched results, outer joins will return a result regardless of whether there’s a match or not.</p><p><strong><a href="https://pachdm.com/35gkDAA"><code>pachctl list datum</code></a></strong>
Now includes a dry run option for testing glob patterns.</p><p><strong><a href="https://pachdm.com/2Xjun8S"><code>pachctl update pipeline</code></a></strong>
Now supports transactions.</p><p>Interested in learning more about Pachyderm? <strong><a href="https://pachdm.com/3ogNTP3">Schedule some time with one of our experts</a></strong></p></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

<p>
Recently, I had the pleasure of talking with KC Sivaramakrishnan - one
of the lead developers of the OCaml multicore project - when he came
to NUS to give us a talk on his work on multicore and a potential new
language feature for OCaml: <b>Algebraic effects</b>.  At a high level, the
run-down on algebraic effects is that they can be considered as a sort
of alternative to monads,<sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> however with the key benefit that they
<i>play a lot nicer</i> with existing direct-style code and thus might be a
<i>more fluid</i> and <i>ergonomic</i> tool.  One of my most surprising takeaways
from meeting KC was in realising the significant amount of progress
that had already been made on implementing algebraic effects in
OCaml - in fact, algebraic effects, far from just being a far-off
pipe-dream (cough, modular implicits, cough), are actually at a point
where it is possible (<i>fairly easy even</i>) to play with them right now
(albeit using an experimental fork of the OCaml compiler).
</p>

<p>
Indeed, this is exactly what I have been working on over the past few
weeks - so moved was I by the world of possibilities opened up by this
development, I immediately set about experimenting on inserting
algebraic effects into various OCaml projects that I happened have
handy at the time.  Over the course of these experiments, I ended up
considering the application of algebraic effects to functional game
development, and in the process stumbled upon a rather elegant pattern
for representing animations in a functional style.  In fact, this
pattern actually ended up solving a longstanding issue I was having
with managing the control flow for animations alongside game logic,
and so I think it forms a rather nice setting for exploring the
benefits of algebraic effects, hence this post.
</p>

 


<p>
In the rest of this blog post, I'm going to provide a <i>gentle
introduction</i> to algebraic effects, provided in the context of their
use in implementing <b>functional game animations</b> - we'll look at using
algebraic effects to implement 3 different case studies of <i>relatively
complex</i> animations (see above) for games in a fluid and elegant way.
Hopefully, through exploring these case-studies, you should be able to
gain a better understanding of the pros and cons of algebraic effects
and why they are certainly something to be excited about.

<h3 id="orgbc783f7">The vision: Functional Game Development</h3>
<div id="text-orgbc783f7">
<p>
While our final code uses a mix of functional and imperative code (as
is idiomatic OCaml style), our journey really begins in the world of
pure functional games.
</p>

<div> 
<p><img src="https://gopiandcode.uk/images/functional_update.png" alt="functional_update.png"></p><div><p> 
Fundamentally, functional games work by separating
the execution of a game into two distinct functions representing the main phases of the game loop:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>an update function</b> that takes user input and time and updates the state of the world</li>
<li><b>a draw function</b> that displays the current state of the world to the
screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The idea here is that while the state of the game may change over time, the individual update and draw functions are pure and referentially transparent, and thus come with all the usual benefits of functional code (modularity and compositionality, reusable code, easier to reason about etc.).
</p></div> 
</div> 


<p>
To see these ideas in practice, suppose we wanted to implement a simple menu for a game:
</p><p><img src="https://gopiandcode.uk/images/a_game_menu.png" alt="a_game_menu.png">
</p> 


<p>
Following the functional approach, we could define the state of our menu as follows:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>type</span> <span>menu</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> selected<span>:</span> int<span>;</span> options<span>:</span> string list<span>;</span> <span>}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Using this fairly simple state, we can easily
write a pure draw function for the menu as follows:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>let</span> <span>draw_item</span><span> </span><span>~</span><span>pos </span><span>~</span><span>is_active txt</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span> <span>(* </span><span>draw an individual menu item </span><span>*)</span>

<span>let</span> <span>draw</span> <span>{</span>selected<span>;</span>options<span>}</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>List.</span>iteri <span>(</span><span>fun</span> <span>ind option</span> <span>-&gt;</span>  
       draw_item <span>~pos</span><span>:</span>ind <span>~is_active</span><span>:(</span>ind <span>=</span> selected<span>)</span> option
    <span>)</span> options
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Similarly, if we wanted to make the menu respond to user inputs, we
can write a functional update operation for the menu as follows:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>let</span> <span>update</span><span> menu key</span> <span>=</span> 
   <span>let</span> <span>len</span> <span>=</span> length menu.options <span>in</span>
   <span>let</span> <span>next</span><span> pos</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span>pos <span>+</span> 1<span>)</span> <span>mod</span> len <span>in</span>
   <span>let</span> <span>prev</span><span> pos</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span>pos <span>-</span> 1 <span>+</span> len<span>)</span> <span>mod</span> len <span>in</span>
   <span>match</span> key <span>with</span>
   <span>|</span> <span>Up</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>{</span>menu <span>with</span> selected <span>=</span> next menu.selected<span>}</span>
   <span>|</span> <span>Down</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>{</span>menu <span>with</span> selected <span>=</span> prev menu.selected<span>}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Hooking these all up together, the main loop for our program might then look as follows:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>let</span> <span>main</span><span> </span><span>()</span> <span>:</span> <span>unit</span> <span>=</span> 
   <span>let</span> <span>rec</span> <span>loop</span><span> menu</span> <span>=</span> 
      draw menu<span>;</span>
      <span>let</span> <span>input</span> <span>=</span> get_input <span>()</span> <span>in</span>
      <span>let</span> <span>menu</span> <span>=</span> update menu input <span>in</span>
      loop menu <span>in</span>
   loop <span>{</span>selected<span>=</span>0<span>;</span> options<span>=[</span><span>"A"</span><span>;</span> <span>"B"</span><span>;</span> <span>"C"</span><span>]}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
And tada! We now have a fully functional menu that <i>dynamically</i>
responds and updates to user inputs, and we were able to do it all
without having to ever dirty our hands with any <b>evil impure code</b>.
</p>

<p><img src="https://gopiandcode.uk/images/functional_menu.png" alt="functional_menu.png">
</p> 


<p>
Functional game development sounds great, right?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge7daf0a">
<h3 id="orge7daf0a">The challenge: Managing animations</h3>
<div id="text-orge7daf0a">
<p>
The stuff that I presented in the previous section is nothing new -
there are countless prior blog posts and videos on the web that all
describe this style of a game engine, and it paints a very pretty
picture.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, I am afraid to say, not all is as it seems in the land
of functional game development, and when you start using this
methodology to develop any kind of <i>non-trivial</i> games, you can quickly
find yourself running into edge-cases, and one <i>particularly nefarious</i>
example of such issues is handling animations.
</p>

<p>
Returning back to our running example of a game menu, suppose we now
wanted to come back and add a <i>simple</i> quality of life feature to our
menu - nothing complex, just a <b>fade-in</b> between states of the menu.
</p>

<p>
In other words, when the user presses a button, there should be small
<b>time-delay</b> as the menu <i>gradually transitions</i> from the original state
to the new one:
</p>

<p><img src="https://gopiandcode.uk/images/functional_animation.png" alt="functional_animation.png"> 
</p> 


<p>
<i>Okay, sure - that's not a complex transformation - so this should be
simple to implement within our framework, right?</i>
</p>

<div> 
<p><img src="https://gopiandcode.uk/images/functional_update_q.png" alt="functional_update_q.png"></p><div> 


<p>
<b>Unfortunately, no.</b>
</p>

<p>
Our methodology so far was based entirely around the assumption that
the update function is <i>pure</i> and <i>stateless</i> and should be called on each
frame of the game.
</p>

<p>
As such, if we were to return a new menu with the next item selected
when the user presses down, the <b>transformation would be immediate</b>
rather than the <i>gradual change</i> we want.
</p>

<p>
<i>So what exactly should we return from our update function then?</i>
</p></div> 
</div> 


<p>
If one were to strictly adhere to the functional game development
paradigm, then one hacky way to achieve this would be to explicitly
track the state of animations in the menu.
</p>

<p>
For example, we can update our definition of menu to be as follows:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>type</span> <span>time</span> <span>=</span> int
<span>type</span> <span>state</span> <span>=</span> <span>Static</span> <span>of</span> int <span>|</span> <span>MovingBetween</span> <span>of</span> int <span>*</span> int <span>*</span> time
<span>type</span> <span>menu</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> selected<span>:</span> state<span>;</span> options<span>:</span> string list<span>;</span> <span>}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The idea here is that the <code>state</code> type tracks the two possible states of the menu and its animations:
</p>
<ul>
<li>either the animation is complete and the menu is static</li>
<li>or the menu is in the middle of an animation between two states
with some amount of <code>time</code> (in ms) remaining.</li>
</ul>

<p>
With this change, we can then write our update function as follows
(now updated to take an additional time parameter tracking the time
between frames):
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>let</span> <span>update</span><span> menu key delta</span> <span>=</span> 
  <span>let</span> <span>len</span> <span>=</span> length menu.options <span>in</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>next</span><span> pos</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span>pos <span>+</span> 1<span>)</span> <span>mod</span> len <span>in</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>prev</span><span> pos</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span>pos <span>-</span> 1 <span>+</span> len<span>)</span> <span>mod</span> len <span>in</span>
  <span>match</span> menu.state <span>with</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>MovingBetween</span> <span>(</span>old_ind<span>,</span>new_ind<span>,</span> remaining<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>remaining</span> <span>=</span> remaining <span>-</span> delta <span>in</span>
    <span>if</span> remaining <span>&lt;</span> 0 <span>(* </span><span>is animation completed? </span><span>*)</span>
    <span>then</span> <span>{</span>menu <span>with</span> selected <span>=</span> <span>Static</span> new_ind<span>}</span> <span>(* </span><span>yes: return to static </span><span>*)</span>
    <span>else</span> <span>{</span>menu <span>with</span> selected <span>=</span> <span>MovingBetween</span> <span>(</span>old_ind<span>,</span> new_ind<span>,</span> remaining<span>)}</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Static</span> ind <span>-&gt;</span>
    <span>match</span> key <span>with</span> <span>(* </span><span>only process inputs when animations completed </span><span>*)</span>
    <span>|</span> <span>Up</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>{</span>menu <span>with</span> selected <span>=</span> <span>MovingBetween</span> <span>(</span>ind<span>,</span> next menu.selected<span>,</span> 100<span>)}</span>
    <span>|</span> <span>Down</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>{</span>menu <span>with</span> selected <span>=</span> <span>MovingBetween</span> <span>(</span>ind<span>,</span> prev menu.selected<span>,</span> 100<span>)}</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
So this will work decently well, however, we're now starting to mix
our animation code with the logic of the program, making it harder to
understand and also more probable for bugs to creep in.  Additionally,
while this happens to work for our simple example, the pattern isn't
scalable - adding more animations would require rewriting the entire
function.
</p>

<p>
Clearly, taking this purely functional approach to games development
has some <b>serious difficulties</b> with managing animations, but it would
be unfair to say that this is uniquely due to the functional
approach:
</p>

<p><b><i>The challenge of balancing animations flow with logic is inherent to the domain</i></b>
</p>


<p>
For the rest of this blog post, we'll shift gears to investigate how
algebraic effects can be used to implement animations when dealing
with a slightly more imperative game structure, however this is mainly
to simplify the implementation: the core ideas presented below can be
easily ported to a pure implementation.

<div id="outline-container-org0873648">
<h3 id="org0873648">Algebraic effects to the rescue</h3>
<div id="text-org0873648">
<p>
Taking a step back from our previous example, the fundamental issue
was that we were trying to mix <b>two</b> separate threads of control - one
for the core logic, and a separate one for the animation - in other
words, what we need is some kind of <b>non-local control flow</b>.
</p>

<p>
….as it just so happens, this is exactly the functionality that
algebraic effects provide.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7da722a">
<h4 id="org7da722a">What are algebraic effects?</h4>
<div id="text-org7da722a">
<p>
We'll sidestep a more detailed discussion of the theory, and instead
focus on the general picture for the end user: algebraic effects as
effectively "resumable" exceptions.<sup><a id="fnr.3" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
When defining an effect, the user specifies the type of the input
supplied by the caller, and the type of the output that the effect
should return on completion:
</p>


<p>
To perform an effect, we can use the builtin primitive perform:
</p>

<p>
At this point, the execution of the current program is stopped (much
like an exception), and control changes up the stack until the nearest
effect handler:

   <span>...</span>

  <section>
    <p>Following our <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/elementary-os-on-pinebook-pro">efforts to bring elementary OS to the ARM-based Pinebook Pro</a>, we’ve added experimental builds for the ARM-based Raspberry Pi 4 series—including the recently-launched Raspberry Pi 400—to our <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://builds.elementary.io/">Early Access</a> program. Like Pinebook Pro builds, Raspberry Pi support is considered an experiment and is not something we have committed to officially support indefinitely. However, if you’re one of the many folks with a Raspberry Pi 4 sitting around and wanted to see how a full, modern desktop operating system runs, elementary OS is now an option!</p>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/elementary-os-on-raspberry-pi/desktop.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi 4 running elementary OS"></p>
  <figcaption>My current desktop, powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 running elementary OS</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Personally, I typically use Raspberry Pi 4 as a network device, e.g. a DNS server and for network-attached storage. However, I’ve been using elementary OS builds on it for the past week, and I’m impressed. While it won’t compete experience-wise with a high end desktop, it is a real option for casual computing, development, and writing. In fact, this blog post was written entirely on my Raspberry Pi 4 running elementary OS. It would even be possible to run the same network services on the hardware from within elementary OS just so you get a nice modern GUI when doing any local management.</p>

<p>Like with <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/elementary-os-on-pinebook-pro">Pinebook Pro</a>, there are some things you should know if you plan to use elementary OS Early Access builds on Raspberry Pi:</p>

<h2 id="kernel">Kernel</h2>

<p>Since Ubuntu has released Raspberry Pi images, we are able to rely on that work to ship a supported and updated kernel. Thanks to all of the folks at Canonical and in the Ubuntu community who have worked to make that happen!</p>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>elementary OS on Raspberry Pi 4 is not going to match the polished experience of a full modern desktop computer, largely due to our current software stack. GTK3 does not offer GPU-accelerated animations, so animations within apps are less smooth than we would like. Still, for a computer coming in at under $100, it’s impressive and perfectly usable for several tasks.</p>

<p>There are also some things you can do to improve performance. We would definitely recommend using some sort of cooling with your Raspberry Pi, whether that’s a a heatsink and fan (like the recently-announced <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/new-raspberry-pi-4-case-fan/">Raspberry Pi 4 Case Fan</a>), or a passive case like one from <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://flirc.tv/">Flirc</a>—my favorite for its looks and silence. Since Raspberry Pi 4 tends to throttle due to heat under desktop loads, cooling will help it stay more responsive. We also recommend trying USB3 storage as your boot drive, as it should be faster than a microSD card. Using a 1080p (or lower) resolution also works a fair bit better than trying to push a 1440p or 4K display, but your mileage may vary based on your use case.</p>

<h2 id="supported-raspberry-pi-models">Supported Raspberry Pi Models</h2>

<p>We recommend Raspberry Pi 4 or Raspberry Pi 400 with 4 GB RAM at a minimum—but the more, the better. (We don’t even recommend less than 8 GB for computers with much faster CPUs, graphics, and storage.)</p>

<p>Older models of Raspberry Pi (like the original, Raspberry Pi Zero, Raspberry Pi 2 series, and Raspberry Pi 3 series) are not supported; elementary OS requires the faster processor, additional RAM, and 64-bit architecture of the Raspberry Pi 4 series. For older models, we recommend sticking to Raspberry Pi OS or a “headless” OS like Ubuntu Server.</p>

<h2 id="run-elementary-os-on-raspberry-pi">Run elementary OS on Raspberry Pi</h2>

<p>In its current state, we would not consider elementary OS on Raspberry Pi as polished of an experience as running on well-supported AMD- or Intel-based hardware.</p>

<p>That said, the audience for Raspberry Pi leans toward tinkerers and experimenters; as such, we’ve decided to publish our builds under our <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://builds.elementary.io/">Early Access builds</a> program. This means dedicated <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/elementary">sponsors</a> of elementary OS who wish to run elementary OS on Raspberry Pi can download it from the same place as Early Access builds of elementary OS. As a note, all of this work has been focused on bringing the <strong>pre-release of elementary OS 6</strong> to Raspberry Pi, so all the usual disclaimers about pre-release builds apply here as well.</p>



<p>Once you have access to Early Access builds, head over to the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/elementary/os/wiki/Raspberry-Pi">elementary OS wiki</a> to get it installed on your own hardware. If you find and file any issues, please remember to specify the build of the OS you downloaded as well as that you are running on Raspberry Pi—it will help us validate and triage issues much more quickly.</p>

<h2 id="thanks-to-andrew-david-hewitt-and-marius-meisenzahl">Thanks to Andrew, David Hewitt, and Marius Meisenzahl</h2>

<p>Bringing elementary OS to Raspberry Pi was a collaborative effort. <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/andrewc910">Andrew</a>, <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/davidmhewitt">David Hewitt</a>, and <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/meisenzahl">Marius Meisenzahl</a> specifically worked to prototype, improve, and ultimately ship these builds. And of course countless folks across the Raspberry Pi Foundation, Debian, Canonical, Ubuntu, and more have worked for years on making the underlying system work well for us to build on.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>During the COVID-19 crisis, The birth of the first open source data enabled ventilator. </p><article>
      
<p>Back to March 20, 2020. <a href="https://twitter.com/waxzce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quentin Adam</a>, with some friends living in Nantes, is trying to build a ventilator prototype with 3D printing and Arduino, in response to a shortage of equipment. </p>



<p><strong>Project MakAir is started</strong>. </p>



<p>Quentin, a software expert and CEO of <a href="https://www.clever-cloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clever Cloud</a>, is struggling with the electronics part and looking for electronics engineers. Among his friends is Mathias, SenX CTO. That is how Mathias asked me to review the electronics part of the project. My first call with Quentin was to help him connect an old pressure sensor to an Arduino, during the late evening of March 20.</p>



<p><strong>The goal was clear: to mass-produce an open-source medical ventilator</strong>. Crazy! Looking at the project that day, it looked like an "amateur" project. So I did the first real schematics, the first BOM, the first Radiospares, and Farnell reference list during the weekend, discussing with more and more people on the MakAir Slack. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h3>Amateur? Not really...</h3>



<p>Next Thursday, I understood that the small "amateur" project is quickly getting big. Two electronics companies detached people, and a whole regulatory team was up. In this team, there were some experts in medical devices. We also knew that we were on a shortlist of projects that the French government is looking at closely.</p>



<p>I soon realized that in Nantes, there is no one able to actually make the prototypes. <a href="https://blog.senx.io/connecting-a-beertender-to-warp-10-using-mqtt-on-lorawan-with-thethingsnetwork/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Engineers with prototyping knowledge</a> are scarce, I just know a few of them like me. So, on the 25th during the evening, in a few minutes, I convinced Cherine, a former Renault Sport colleague living near Paris who has the same knowledge of prototyping as me, to join the project as well.</p>



<p><strong>On the 26th, I joined the MakAir core team, choosing to confine myself with 17 other people to make project MakAir a reality</strong>. Cherine came from Paris the same day I came from Brest. At the same time in France, 100 people were already helping us remotely. </p>



<p>I brought with me all my personal tools, from soldering iron to oscilloscope, and tons of components. </p>



<figure><blockquote><p>If I had been told this would last 25 days, I would have brought more than 3 days of clothing!</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>Three days later, <strong>the <a href="http://www.cea.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CEA</a></strong> (french government agency for atomic energy) is now supporting us. On the 31<sup>st</sup> of March, we all moved from Nantes to Grenoble CEA facility, traveling on a nearly empty motorway.</p>



<p>The first prototype had basic electronics: STM32 Nucleo, a small 4 lines screen, a few buttons, a good precision pressure sensor, and several servo outputs. <strong>This first prototype allows us to make a pig breath for 4 hours</strong> on the 3rd of April, only 2 weeks after the project started.</p>

<h2>Enters the Raspberry Pi</h2>



<p>What we learned from the first test on a pig:</p>



<ul><li>The ventilator did the job. The pig was alive and woke up correctly.</li><li><strong>There is a huge UX problem.</strong></li><li>The airflow measurement is really helpful.</li></ul>



<p>The experts from the medical world are now used to high-tech screens displaying curves with not only pressure, but real-time air volume blown into the patient lungs. Even in crisis time, we understand that our product does not meet their minimum UI/UX needs.</p>

<p>Always listen to the users. Even if we succeed in mass production of an open-source ventilator, if doctors want curves and measures of the number of air liters entering the lungs, we must do it. </p>



<p>Since the beginning, this project is time driven. We never consider the price, but we always look at worldwide stocks. In a time where lots of plants are closed in Europe, <strong>the supply chain is leading the project.</strong></p>

<p>As I just said, the supply chain rules the project. MakAir will have a raspberry to display curves. Nice coincidence for an open-source project!</p>



<p>By the way, the mass flow meter sensor was a huge problem. Since the beginning, MakAir did not want to disturb the production of existing ventilators. But this component is on the airway, it should be approved for medical use. In April, it was impossible to source any Sensirion or Honeywell mass flow sensors... Anyway, the next test will be done with a raspberry connected to the STM32. </p>







<h2>Enter Warp&nbsp;10</h2>



<p>On the 17th of April, the first batch of ventilators built in the CEA clean-rooms was ready. This batch was used for the 1st clinical tests. </p>



<p><strong>The pressure switches from the technical team to the regulatory team, remotely working on the project since the beginning. </strong></p>



<p>To prepare the next batch, we came back to Nantes. After 25 days, we switched from commando mode (18h/day, 7 days a week) to a more standard week (14h/day, the weekends with the family).</p>

<p>On the 30<sup>th</sup> of April, the prototype with a Raspberry Pi is ready for the next animal test. Two people had to fly to Grenoble CEA with this prototype, but the rest of us, and all the people remotely working on the project wanted to follow the experience. </p>



<p>So, the night before the test, I quickly deployed Warp&nbsp;10 on the raspberry and wrote a small script to copy data every 10s to another Warp&nbsp;10 server.</p>

<p>What is <a href="https://www.warp10.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warp&nbsp;10</a>? It is a time series platform. But unlike other TSDB (Time Series Database), there is a full analysis environment behind, and even a task scheduler. Compress time series, replicate to another server while managing network outage is really easy. Same tooling on the server and the connected object, that what I call easy IoT. To stream data, you just need a few WarpScript functions among <a href="https://www.warp10.io/doc/functionList" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the thousand available</a>.</p>



<p>Basically, the WarpScript pseudo code is:</p>



<pre><code>- Read the last value of makair.lastupload GTS
- take the last tick as start
- take now as end
- fetch locally all the makair GTS from start to end
- WRAP all the GTS
- build a script that UNWRAP and UPDATE the data
- do a remote execution of the script with REXEC 
- if the REXEC was a success, store end in makair.lastupload</code></pre>



<p>You can follow the <a href="https://www.warp10.io/content/04_Tutorials/01_WarpScript/30_Server_to_Server" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">server to server tutorial</a> to implement such a WarpScript, then save it as $WARP10HOME/warpscripts/makair/10000/upload_data.mc2 to schedule an execution every 10s.</p>



<p>To display data in real-time, <a href="http://studio.senx.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WarpStudio</a> did the job easily too. Autorefresh of the DataViz every 10s is a built-in function:</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>



<p>MakAir ventilators are designed to store everything in the <a href="https://warp10.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warp&nbsp;10</a> time series database. They also have built-in WiFi and LoRa. All these features are not yet available, because the priority is still to make an open-source approved ventilator. </p>

<p>Connected features + open-source software is an enabler for doctors and researchers to perform extensive data collection and try new algorithms in the machine. Warp&nbsp;10 is the best open source time series database to <a href="https://blog.senx.io/warp-10-for-iot-gdpr-compliant-before-gdpr-even-existed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">securely</a> store medical data and analyze it. It's not a walled garden.</p>



<p>If you need to connect medical devices to a time series database, <a href="mailto:contact@senx.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just ask us</a>.</p>



<p>MakAir is now entering the second phase of clinical tests. We can consider we are halfway to the goal. Keep in mind that among all the projects of ventilators announced by big companies, MakAir is the only one to reach the clinical tests step. <a href="https://makair.life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">200 people, backed up by CEA and a few french companies</a> are about to make a commercially available open source ventilator... </p>



<p>That's crazy when you think about it!</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>In this article we'll look at several case studies of data science being used to optimize marketing efforts at companies like Lyft, Airbnb, Netflix, Doordash, Wolt, Rovio Entertainment.</p><p>In large and analytically mature organizations, the <em>optimization</em> piece usually comes as a part of a larger <em>marketing automation</em> system, but as we'll see it's not always the case. Doing budget allocation to channels and campaign manually, but with the aid of data science tool set can be hugely profitable and might be a good first step towards a fully automated workflow.</p><p>Before diving into details, let's look at high level architecture of an automated process for online marketing. As a result of streamlining the process that's largely determined by the way online advertising platforms work, marketing automation platforms look very much alike across different companies. In general, these platforms are large systems that comprise the following:</p><ol><li>Data tracking system <br>Track conversion events (customer signups, payment events, subscriptions, micro-transactions, etc).</li><li>Attribution system<br>Connect conversion events with the user acquisition source. That is, for each user we want to know exactly the marketing channel and the campaign that brought them in.</li><li>Performance estimation system<br>Let's say a campaign brought in 1000 users. We want to know if it paid off. We know how much we spent on it, but how do we know how much revenue the users will bring us over their lifetime. LTV and conversion modelling comes into play here.</li><li>Campaign management system<br>Online ads are a very fertile field for variation testing and content generation. But even without testing multiple you variations of the same ad, companies typically target different segments in different ways, easily resulting in dozens or hundreds ads running simultaneously. Companies like Airbnb and Netflix invest heavily in systems that support ad creation and management (<a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/growing-our-host-community-with-online-marketing-9b2302299324">Airbnb article</a>, <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/https-medium-com-netflixtechblog-engineering-to-improve-marketing-effectiveness-part-2-7dd933974f5e">Netflix article</a>).</li><li>Automated bidding and budget optimization<br>The largest ad serving platforms provide you with near real-time feedback on your ad performance. Connect this with the spend and projected LTV and you can get your ROI predictions and adjust budgets accordingly. With dozens or hundreds of campaigns and variations, the benefits of automation and optimization at this steps can be huge.</li></ol><p>In article we're interested in what role data science can play in the overall ad lifecycle, so we'll focus on the two parts that tend to benefit the most from mixing in data science: 1) performance estimation and 2) automated bidding and budgeting.</p><p>Before diving in, it's imporant to understand the<em> channel/campaign </em>nomenclature. By <em>channel</em> we consider an advertising platform, such as Google AdWords, Facebook, Youtube, etc. A <em>campaign</em> is a single piece of advertising aimed at specific audience, according to segments available on the <em>channel, </em>with a preset starting and end time.</p><p>When evaluating marketing performance, we might want to look at investment and ROI at the level of a channel, a single campaign or a group of similar campaigns. We'll see how these different levels of granularity influence the amount and quality of available data, and in consequence how that determines the approaches that can be taken.</p><h2 id="performance-estimation">Performance Estimation</h2><p>Ideally, for the purpose of marketing optimization we're interested in LTV and CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) as the factor in the ROI equation: $$ROI=\frac{LTV}{CAC}$$</p><p>LTV modelling is a fundamental problem in business analytics and it is far from trivial to get it completely right. The exact models depend heavily on the type of business and the intended application. LTV models are generally more valuable if we can give good estimates very early in the user lifetime. However, the earlier we do it the less data we have at our disposal.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.appsflyer.com/blog/overcoming-ltv-modeling-pitfalls/">Pitfalls of Modeling LTV and How to Overcome Them</a>, Dmitry Yudovsky outlines several challenges that make it impossible for a cookie-cutter approach for LTV estimation to exist:</p><ul><li>Machine learning approaches are sometimes completely inadequate.<br>There might be lack of data necessary for long term LTV predictions. Also, even if we do have a large business with tons of historical data, there are cases when training models on year old data doesn't work well - maybe the product or the entire market is very different than a year or two ago.</li><li>Depending on whether we want to use LTV estimates for ad optimization, CRM efforts or corporate financial projections, we might have different requirements for model accuracy and cohort granularity at which we're making predictions (eg. single user, single campaign, group of campaigns, all users, etc.)</li></ul><p>Of course the problem is not intractable, and there are several common approaches. We'll look at a few case studies found in tech blogs from DoorDash, Airbnb and Lyft Engineering teams.</p><p>In <a href="https://doordash.engineering/2020/07/31/optimizing-marketing-spend-with-ml/">Optimizing DoorDash’s Marketing Spend with Machine Learning</a>, Doordash Engineering present their approach, where instead of directly estimating LTV, they model conversion rates as a function of marketing spend. We'll see later how these cost curves help to neatly optimize budget allocation across channels and campaigns.</p><p>Experience (data) tells us that any marketing channel will reach saturation at some point, so we can model cost curves, ie. $Conversion=f(Spend)$<em> </em>using a power function of the form $a\cdot Spend^{b}$.</p><figure><img src="https://blogboard.io/blog/content/images/2021/01/image.png" alt=""><figcaption>Cost curve of the shape $a\cdot Spend^{b}$. Image credit: <a href="https://doordash.engineering/2020/07/31/optimizing-marketing-spend-with-ml/">DoorDash Engineering</a></figcaption></figure><p>We can fit cost curves at any cohort level, and it's typically done at the granularity of a channel or campaign. Simply put, if for a given campaign we spent $x$ amount of money, and that brought us $y$ users, we have one data point, $(x, y)$.</p><p>However, when allocating budgets at a later stage, we might need to make decisions at the <em>campaign </em>level, which cause problems with insufficient amount of data. In the DoorDash Engineering article, Aman Dhesi explains this problem:</p><blockquote>For some channels like search engine marketing, we have thousands of campaigns that spend a small amount of money every week. This makes the weekly attribution data noisy. Some weeks these campaigns don’t spend at all, which makes the data sparse. Using this data as-is will result in unreliable cost curves and in turn suboptimal (potentially wildly so) allocation.</blockquote><p>At DoorDash they solve this problem by training separate models which use similar campaigns to fill in the gaps in the dataset with synthetic data. This approach brings with itself certain tradeoffs, described in the <a href="https://doordash.engineering/2020/07/31/optimizing-marketing-spend-with-ml/">original article</a>.</p><p>In a similar manner, as described in <a href="https://eng.lyft.com/lyft-marketing-automation-b43b7b7537cc">Building Lyft’s Marketing Automation Platform</a>, data scientists at Lyft would fit an LTV curve of the shape $LTV=a\cdot Spend^{b}$. However, they incorporate an additional degree of randomness by modelling $a$ and $b$ as random variables and estimating their parameters $(\mu_a, \sigma_a)$ and $(\mu_b, \sigma_b)$ from historical data. This helps them implement an explore-exploit approach in the bidding step, by instantiating LTV curves after sampling $a$ and $b$ from their respective distributions. We'll revisit this approach briefly at the end of next section.</p><p>As described in <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/growing-our-host-community-with-online-marketing-9b2302299324">Growing Our Host Community with Online Marketing</a>, at Airbnb they face a problem stemming from the nature of their product and the market. When predicting LTV for an Airbnb home listing, two major problems are:</p><ol><li>Ad conversions for hosts are a very rare event. This poses problems with building large enough data sets. It also influences data tracking and attribution, where these systems have to be as precise as possible in order not to lose or wrongly attribute any data points.</li><li>Time from ad impression (user seeing an ad) to conversion (home listed on Airbnb) can be very long, sometimes weeks. This is a problem if you want to optimize and re-budget your campaigns soon after rollout - you simply don't have enough data yet.</li></ol><p>In the same post, Tao Cui describes the architecture of each part of Airbnb's marketing platform as well as the motivation for building the entire thing, along with choices of tech stack. </p><p>In another article dating from 2017, <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/using-machine-learning-to-predict-value-of-homes-on-airbnb-9272d3d4739d">Using Machine Learning to Predict Value of Homes On Airbnb</a>, Robert Chang describes how they use machine learning (ending up using XGBoost in production) to estimate LTV of each listing. Framing it as a typical regression problem, they use hundreds of features, such as <em>location data, price with all the partial costs (eg. cleaning fee, discounts), availability, previous bookings, </em>to predict revenue from a listing after some fixed amount of time (eg. 1-year revenue). If you're curious, the post also describes some of the pieces of infrastructure used by the system and gives a high-level code examples of training pipeline construction.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.appsflyer.com/resources/gaming/predictive-modeling-app-marketers-guide/pros-and-cons-of-different-ltv-based-predictive-models-insights-from-top-marketers/">Insights on the Pros and Cons of LTV-based Predictive Models</a> an article from AppsFlyer, we can find a summary of pros and cons of the three common LTV modelling approaches for app-based businesses:</p><ol><li>Retention/ARPDAU model<br>If we have a fairly old and stable product with some historical data, we can leverage the fact that we know the shape of the retention curve and can fit a power curve to several early-retention data points. We also know the <em>Average Revenue Per Daily Active User (ARPDAU) </em>which tends to be stable over time for most freemium and micro-transaction apps (such as free to play games). With some math we can arrive at an estimate of the expected LTV using these two measures. For example, to estimate LTV by day 90 of user's lifetime we would use the following equation: &nbsp;$$LTV_{90}=ARPDAU\cdot\sum_{d=0}^{90}retention[d]$$</li><li>LTV ratio model<br>As a simple example, in order to get $LTV_{90}$ we'll use historical data to estimate the ratio $\frac{LTV_{90}}{LTV_{7}}$ and use the observed 7-day LTV to predict the 90-day LTV</li><li>Behavior driven/user-level models<br>We'd use user-level features to train our favorite machine learning model for regression. …</li></ol></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>It's counterintuitive, but is it right?</p>


<p>In our paper <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/presentation/brooker">Millions of Tiny Databases</a>, we say this about the availability of quorum systems of various sizes:</p>

<blockquote><p>As illustrated in Figure 4, smaller cells offer lower availability in the face of small numbers of uncorrelated node failures, but better availability when the proportion of node failure exceeds 50%. While such high failure rates are rare, they do happen in practice, and a key design concern for Physalia.</p></blockquote>

<p>And this is what Figure 4 looks like:</p>

<p>The context here is that a <em>cell</em> is a Paxos cluster, and the system needs a majority quorum for the cluster to be able to process requests<sup><a href="#foot1">1</a></sup>. A cluster of one box needs one box available, five boxes need three available and so on. The surprising thing here is the claim that having smaller clusters is actually <em>better</em> if the probability of any given machine failing is very high. The paper doesn't explain it well, and I've gotten a few questions about it. This post attempts to do better.</p>

<p>Let's start by thinking about what happens for a cluster of one machine (<em>n=1</em>), in a datacenter of <em>N</em> machines (for very large <em>N</em>). We then fail each machine independently with probability <em>p</em>. What is the probability that our one machine failed? That's trivial: it's <em>p</em>. Now, let's take all <em>N</em> machines and put them into a cluster of <em>n=N</em>. What's the probability that a majority of the cluster is available? For large <em>N</em>, it's 1 for <em>p &lt; 0.5</em>, and 0 for <em>p &gt; 0.5</em>. If less than half the machines fail, less than half have failed. If more than half the machines fail, more than half have failed. Ok?</p>

<p><img src="https://mbrooker-blog-images.s3.amazonaws.com/quorum_avail_a.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Notice how a cluster size of 1 is worse than N up until <em>p = 0.5</em> then better after. <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.38.5629&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Peleg and Wool</a> say:</p>

<blockquote><p>... for <em>0 &lt; p &lt; ½</em> the most available NDC<sup><a href="#foot2">2</a></sup> is shown to be the "democracy" (namely, the minimal majority system), while the "monarchy" (singleton system) is least available. Due to symmetry, the picture reverses for <em>½ &lt; p &lt; 1</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here, the <em>minimal majority system</em> is the one I'd call a <em>majority quorum</em>, and is used by Physalia (and, indeed, most Paxos implementations). The <em>monarchy</em> is where you have one leader node.</p>

<p>What about real practical cluster sizes like <em>n=3</em>, 5, and 7? There are three ways we can do this math. In <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.38.5629&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">The Availability of Quorum Systems</a>, Peleg and Wool derive closed-form solutions to this problem<sup><a href="#foot3">3</a></sup>. Our second approach is to observe that the failures of the nodes are Bernoulli trials with probability <em>p</em>, and therefore we can read the answer to "what is the probability that 0 or 1 of 3 fail for probability <em>p</em>" from the distribution function of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution">binomial distribution</a>. Finally, we can be lazy and do it with Monte Carlo. That's normally my favorite method, because it's easier to include correlation and various "what if?" questions as we go.</p>

<p>Whichever way you calculate it, what do you expect it to look like? For small <em>n</em> you may expect it to be closer in shape to <em>n=1</em>, and for large <em>n</em> you may expect it to approach the shape of <em>n=N</em>. If that's what you expect, you'd be right.</p>

<p><img src="https://mbrooker-blog-images.s3.amazonaws.com/quorum_avail_b.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I'll admit that I find this result deeply deeply counter-intuitive. I think it's right, because I've approached it multiple ways, but it still kind of bends my mind a little. That may just be me. I've discussed it with friends and colleagues over the years, and they seem to think it matches their intuition. It's counter-intuitive to me because it suggests that smaller <em>n</em> (smaller clusters, or smaller cells in Physalia's parlance) is better for high <em>p</em>! If you think a lot of your boxes are going to fail, you may get better availability (not durability, though) from smaller clusters.</p>

<p>Weird.</p>

<p><strong>Correlation to the rescue!</strong></p>

<p>It's not often that my statistical intuition is saved by introducing correlation, but in this case it helps. I'd argue that, in practice, that you only lose machines in an uncorrelated Bernoulli trial way for small <em>p</em>. Above a certain <em>p</em>, it's likely that the failures have some shared cause (power, network, clumsy people, etc) and so the failures are likely to be correlated in some way. In which case, we're back into the game we're playing with Physalia of avoiding those correlated failures by optimizing placement.</p>

<p>In many other kinds of systems, like ones you deploy across multiple datacenters (we'd call that <em>regional</em> in AWS, deployed across multiple <em>availability zones</em>), you end up treating the datacenters as units of failure. In that case, for 3 datacenters you'd pick something like <em>n=9</em> because you can keep quorum after the failure of an entire datacenter (3 machines) and any one other machine. As soon as there's correlation, the math above is mostly useless and the correlation's cause is all that really matters.</p>

<p>Availability also isn't the only thing to think about with cluster size for quorum systems. Durability, latency, cost, operations, and contention on leader election also come into play. Those are topics for another post (or section 2.2 of <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/presentation/brooker">Millions of Tiny Databases</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Updates</strong></p>

<p>JP Longmore sent me this intuitive explanation, which makes a lot of sense:</p>

<blockquote><p>Probability of achieving a quorum will increase when removing 2 nodes from a cluster, each with failure rate p&gt;.5, since on average you're removing 2 bad nodes instead of 2 good nodes. Other cases with 1 good node &amp; 1 bad node don't change the outcome (quorum/not). Repeat reasoning till N=1 or all remaining nodes have p&lt;=.5 (if failure rate isn’t uniform).</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><a name="foot1"></a> Physalia uses a very naive Paxos implementation, intentionally optimized for testability and simplicity. The quorum intersection requirements of Paxos (or Paxos-like protocols) are more subtle than this, and work like Heidi Howard et al's <a href="https://fpaxos.github.io/">Flexible Paxos</a> has been pushing the envelope here recently. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.06696v1.pdf">Flexible Paxos:  Quorum intersection revisited</a> is a good place to start.</li>
<li><a name="foot2"></a> Here, an NDC is a <em>non-dominated coterie</em>, and a <em>coterie</em> is a set of groups of nodes (like <em>{{a, b}, {b, c}, {a, c}}</em>). See Definition 2.2 in <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/bb/cs542-20Spr/readings/reliability/How%20to%20assign%20Votes-JACM-garcia-molina.pdf">How to Assign Votes in a Distributed System</a> for the technical definition of domination. What's important, though, is that for each <em>dominated coterie</em> there's a <em>non-dominated coterie</em> that provides the same mutual exclusion properties, but superior availability under partitions. The details are not particularly important here, but are very interesting if you want to do tricky things with quorum intersection.</li>
<li><a name="foot3"></a> Along with a whole lot of other interesting facts about quorums, majority quorums and other things. It's a very interesting paper. Another good read in this space is Garcia-Molina and Barbara's <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/bb/cs542-20Spr/readings/reliability/How%20to%20assign%20Votes-JACM-garcia-molina.pdf">How to Assign Votes in a Distributed System</a>, which both does a better job than Peleg and Wool of defining the terms it uses, but also explores the general idea of assigning <em>votes</em> to machines, rather than simply forming quorums of machines. As you read it, it's worth remembering that it predates Paxos, and many of the terms might not mean what you expect.</li>
</ol>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article class="page">







<div id="pagebody">

<section id="content" role="main">
<p>Backup systems could do with a common backup interchange format.</p>
<p>Many version control systems support the git “<a href="https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-fast-export">fast-export</a>” format. It’s a simple format for exporting the contents of a version control repository so that it can be imported into another. It’s a fundamental basis for converting from one system to another.</p>
<p>Backup systems could have something similar. It would be a good to everyone as it frees people to change backup systems without having their backup history locked into their old system. There are several scenarios in which this could be useful:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Migrating to a new backup system that can’t read backups made with the old backup system.</p></li>
<li><p>Migrating from one backup repository to another, when a straight copy of the repository files is not possible, for whatever reason. For example, if there is no file-level access to the backup repository, only a constrained API.</p></li>
<li><p>Migrating to a new configuration that can’t read backups made with the old backup system. For example, changing encryption secrets in a system that only allows one per repository.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>My initial requirements for such a format:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It’s as simple as possible while still working. It doesn’t need to be efficient, only efficient enough to be practical to use.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s possible to stream the format: something like <code>oldbackup export | newbackup import</code> should be possible.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s as independent of the backup systems as possible, and doesn’t embed unnecessary assumptions of the design or implementation of the system.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>My first sketch of a backup interchange format:</p>
<ul>
<li>A sequence of backup generations in order they were made.</li>
<li>Each generation has some metadata, and a list of files and hardlinhks.</li>
<li>Each file has an identifie unique to the generation, metadata (inode) and file content.</li>
<li>File content is a sequence of (offset, blob) pairs, to support sparse files.</li>
<li>Hard links are represented as (pathname, inode) pairs, where the first pathname is the name of the hard link, the</li>
<li>No attempt at de-duplication or re-using files from a previous generation.</li>
</ul>
<p>As YAML, this would look something like this:</p>

<p>YAML used here as an example, actual format may be something else.</p>

<p><em>It is interesting again at the cryptocurrency market if you have missed the latest news. The price of Bitcoin has broken records of the three-year remoteness, with a rate of over $30,000. Opinions about the future of the coin are divided – some believe that we are facing another bubble. In contrast, others believe that the financial market will no longer be the same and that Bitcoin will be much more expensive in the long run. I admit I am not quite sure what is going on. But I am sure ignoring it is at least weird, so I tried to figure out a little bit about what is going on, and in this article, I am going to share my thoughts on whether it is worth invest in Bitcoin.</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="846" src="http://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coindesk-BTC-chart-2021-01-05-1024x846.png" alt="Bitcoin to dollar rate - Should you invest in Bitcoin?" title="Bitcoin to dollar rate" srcset="https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coindesk-BTC-chart-2021-01-05-1024x846.png 1024w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coindesk-BTC-chart-2021-01-05-300x248.png 300w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coindesk-BTC-chart-2021-01-05-768x634.png 768w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coindesk-BTC-chart-2021-01-05-1536x1269.png 1536w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coindesk-BTC-chart-2021-01-05-700x578.png 700w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coindesk-BTC-chart-2021-01-05.png 1770w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><strong><em>Bitcoin to dollar rate</em></strong></figcaption></figure>



<h2>Reasons to pay attention to Bitcoin</h2>



<p>If you have entirely closed financial affairs, enough life savings, and complete confidence in the reliability of the financial instruments you use, then you do not have to.</p>



<p>Similarly, if you believe that your daily needs are at the level you need at any time in your life, they will always be closed by your salary or business income. Namely, you are the kind of person who believes that there is real stability in our rapidly changing world with the regularly appearing “The Black Swan”.</p>



<p>Put, you either have enough money, or you have modest needs and indiscreet self-confidence. In that case, I guess you do not have to.</p>



<p>I am in a different situation. I do not believe in stability and see the absence of demand for many “lifelong professions” and the devaluation of savings and the meager pensions that people have worked for decades.</p>



<p>For that reason, I am interested in risk diversification. In professions, in businesses, in financial instruments. The latter today is the talk. I am willing to explore and consider any possibility to save the money I make and multiply it.</p>



<p>Bitcoin is such a tool. Subprime, perhaps with a foggy future – but a tool. And therefore – it is, at least, worthy of study.</p>



<h2>How to save money</h2>



<p>Some «experts» <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-6-bitcoin-price-predictions-to-watch-in-2021">claim</a> that the price of Bitcoin will reach $100,000, others forecast $300,000, of course, some say that even the figure of $1,000,000 for BTC is quite real. But what (and when, which is no less critical) will be the course, no one knows. All these statements are more like the publicity move of those who make them.</p>



<p>I am more interested in the other thing. When we talk about the Bitcoin rate, we peg it, for example, to US dollar. As we think it is the most reliable currency. But if we are talking about retaining the money for a long time, no financial advisor will ever advise you to keep all the money in it. The investment code indicates that it is necessary to buy different currencies and use other financial instruments (for example, stocks and bonds) to cover risks.</p>



<p>The dollar is rapidly going cheaper. Or everything becomes expensive. You can call it anything you want, but the point is the same. Everyone has examples. Some people rely on official statistics. I will bring out my life’s specifics by just looking at the significant expenses in my wallet. Ten years ago, the iPhone was sold for $499. A standard hotel room could be rented for $50. The price of real estate 20-30 years ago is not even worth remembering.</p>



<p>It is about inflation and about the complex interest that is often the problem. We may think that the numbers are changing slowly, but how in investment capitalisation of interest rates creates miracles and inflation produces a rapid depreciation of savings.</p>



<p>Let us talk about the US. The country with a strong economy, producing the dollar we are talking about. The average annual official <a href="https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/">inflation</a> is 2.06%. Many may even say that it can be neglected. Perhaps. If it were not for the capitalization of interest. The purchasing power of $100 in 2000 is equal to the purchasing power of $150 in 2020. And that’s average, groceries have gone up less, and for example, education have gone up much more.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="649" src="http://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/usdinflation-1024x649.png" alt="The purchasing power of the dollar considering «small» inflation 2% annual - Should you invest in Bitcoin?" title="The purchasing power of the dollar considering «small» inflation 2% annual - Should you invest in Bitcoin?" srcset="https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/usdinflation-1024x649.png 1024w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/usdinflation-300x190.png 300w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/usdinflation-768x487.png 768w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/usdinflation-1536x974.png 1536w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/usdinflation-700x444.png 700w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/usdinflation.png 1820w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><strong><em><strong><em>The purchasing power of the dollar considering «small» inflation 2% annual&nbsp;</em></strong></em></strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>And so, again, back to the primary council on finance: to save, you must diversify risks. Real estate, gold, stocks – everyone chooses their instruments.</p>



<blockquote><p>We must remember – person who does not choose any financial instruments and keeps his dollars in bank account is getting poorer.</p></blockquote>



<p>The stock market has been considered a haven for many years. If you do not take a significant risk and do not try to overplay the market – it does help save, at least by covering inflation and, as a maximum allowing you to make money on investments.</p>



<p>But what we see today? Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, vast numbers of people were unemployed, and governments began to pay them various benefits. To cover the budget deficit, $3.5 trillion was <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/money/2020/05/12/coronavirushow-u-s-printing-dollars-save-economy-during-crisis-fed/3038117001/">printed</a> only in the United States. Just think about the number of new money that was newly printed and put on the market. We will not even talk about the fact that the dollar <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/gold-standard.asp">has not been backed </a>by gold for 50 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What happened in the stock market in 2020 could not be imagined by even the most optimistic analyst. In a year of pandemics, mass unemployment, and stagnant economies, it grows like crazy.</p>

<p>There is no tourism. Restaurants are closed. The State prints and gives out money. People spend it on stocks. Now it’s so conveniently done on the mobile app that even regulators already have <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/17/investing/robinhood-sec-settlement-deceptive-practices/index.html">questions</a> about this simplicity and gameplay.</p>



<p>People who never cared about stocks went to the stock market. And they started buying familiar brands. Economics? No, no one else cares. All that matters are the names that are in the public eye. Tesla’s case study is that the capitalization of the company has grown almost tenfold over the year. And its sales <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/revenue">went</a> up…15 percent.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="518" src="http://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/teslachart2020-2048x1035-1-1024x518.png" alt="Tesla stock price in 2020 - Should you invest in Bitcoin?" title="Tesla stock price in 2020 - Should you invest in Bitcoin?" srcset="https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/teslachart2020-2048x1035-1-1024x518.png 1024w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/teslachart2020-2048x1035-1-300x152.png 300w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/teslachart2020-2048x1035-1-768x388.png 768w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/teslachart2020-2048x1035-1-1536x776.png 1536w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/teslachart2020-2048x1035-1-700x354.png 700w, https://orujaliev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/teslachart2020-2048x1035-1.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><strong><em>Tesla stock price in 2020</em></strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>Whether there will be a collapse is not a valid question. A more appropriate question is when it will be. Even the most experienced experts are difficult to answer. Politicians have come into play, and the printing press is not yet scheduled to shut down. I do not doubt that there is a bubble in the stock market.</p>



<h2>And Bitcoin growth in 2020 is not a bubble?</h2>



<p>Now let us look at what is going on in the cryptocurrency market. At first glance, the situation there is remarkably similar to the stock market. Coins are rapidly expensive, and events are reminiscent of 2017. But there are several significant differences.</p>



<h3>Bitcoin has not risen in price due to media publications</h3>



<p>It only got on the news agenda after the price exceeded the three-year-old record. And if in 2017 the attention of «housewives» was focused on cryptocurrencies, today they do not invest in bitcoin – their focus is the stock market. In Google Trends, Bitcoin awareness has <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;geo=US&amp;q=bitcoin">increased</a>, but it is by order of magnitude less than three years earlier.</p>

<h3>Institutional investors join the Bitcoin market</h3>



<p>The growth of 2020 is mainly due to the investment business entry. Quoted on the stock market, MicroStrategy also invest in bitcoin – company <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-07/microstrategy-to-raise-400-million-to-buy-even-more-bitcoin">purchased</a> 38,250 btc this year (at current rates of $1 billion). The largest payment services, Stripe and PayPal, began working with this cryptocurrency. Square allows customers to use the cryptocurrency as payment, and PayPal <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2020-10-21-PayPal-Launches-New-Service-Enabling-Users-to-Buy-Hold-and-Sell-Cryptocurrency">permitted</a> customers to buy Bitcoin directly from their PayPal accounts.</p>



<p>More and more professional invest in Bitcoin. Even the conservative Ray Dalio (the CEO of one of the largest funds) recently stated that he might have been very categorical and not even right about the future of Bitcoin. “I need to look at the Bitcoin and study it more”, – he recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ray-dalio-bitcoin/">stated</a>. Cryptocurrencies are added to the portfolios of Ark Investment Management, Fidelity Investments, and other funds. And not just investments funds. Even some pension funds are <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/pension-funds-double-crypto-asset-exposure-in-morgan-creeks-fund-to-1">starting</a> to invest in Bitcoin a small portion of their capital.</p>



<h3>Bitcoin is an alternative</h3>



<p>As mentioned earlier, in 2020, everything around us is volatile. Everything is feverish. Somewhere, bubbles are blowing up; somewhere; economies are falling. And capital, again, is looking for diversification. Because there is a lot of money globally, even a tiny fraction of it going to Bitcoin can cause the too high growth we see right now. Growth is driven by investment demand.</p>



<h2>Why bitcoin?</h2>



<p>Even those who are not familiar with the subject of cryptocurrencies have heard that <a href="https://orujaliev.com/invest-in-bitcoin/">Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency</a>. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies. So why we talk about Bitcoin?</p>



<p>Bitcoin is finite. It is digital gold. Only much more convenient and liquid. The algorithm is programmed to make just 21 million coins. Now 18.5 million have been mined, but let us not forget that about 4 million are irretrievably lost according to various estimates. Theoretically, the algorithm can be modified, but to do so, 51% of the miners must join and vote for it. The situation is almost impossible because it will make their assets cheaper. </p>



<p>If you invest in bitcoin, bought one coin, you have and will have one. No State or politician can turn on the printing press and blur your share. Bitcoin is popular. There are hundreds of social networks globally, but Facebook owns the market because it overcame the critical group of users, and eventually, more people come there. Cryptocurrencies are similar. There are thousands coins. But <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/markets/cryptocurrencies/global-charts/">70 percent of all capitalization is Bitcoin</a>. If I may say so, it is a market standard. Attempts to create an alternative have been made and are underway, but none of them have succeeded precisely for that reason.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is convenient. No, it is not suitable to buy pizza in a restaurant. It has other challenges and opportunities. For example, it is useful to transfer large amounts of money between countries or to carry capital. You can have as many millions as you want in the account, fly to wherever you want …</p></div></div>

              <!--文章正文--><div><div><div><p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="+0"><p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="+0">The Beijing-Shanghai Backbone Network (BSBN), the world’s first long-distance quantum-secured communication route, was put into service on Aug. 30. It links the two cities with a highly-reliable and expandable secure communication expressway</span></span>.</p><p><span size="+0"><span size="+0"><span lang="EN-US">The node in Beijing will also cooperate with Micius, an experimental quantum satellite launched early last year, to lay the foundation for </span><span lang="EN-US">an integrated space-earth</span><span lang="EN-US"> quantum communication network as well as a global quantum communication network.</span></span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="+0">BSBN was developed under the leadership of the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). Several organizations have cooperated in the construction of BSBN, including the China Cable TV Network Co. Ltd., the Shandong Institute of Information and Communication Technology, the USTC Advanced Technology Institute, and the China Bank Regulatory Commission, among others.</span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><b><span lang="EN-US"><span size="+0">What is BSBN?</span></span></b>&nbsp;</p><p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="+0">BSBN, known officially as the National Demonstration Project of Verification and Application of Quantum Secure Communication between Beijing and Shanghai, has been called the “information security expressway.” </span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="+0">The inter-city quantum communication line, which measures over 2000 km and comprises 32 relay stations, connects the cities of Beijing, Jinan, Hefei and Shanghai. Data can be transferred through the network with absolute security.</span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span size="+0"><span size="+0"><span>“</span><span lang="EN-US">On the basis of the original fiber line, we utilized quantum key technology to give every message a unique encryption, and then transferred [the messages] through the traditional communication network,” said CHEN Yu’ao, a professor from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), and also Chief Designer of BSBN.</span></span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="+0">Relay stations were built to solve the problem of signal attenuation during the transmission of the quantum key. In contrast with traditional transmission technology, BSBN’s relay stations will not receive then resend messages in transit. As a result, the whole transfer process will remain under direct control, according to CHEN.</span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><b><span lang="EN-US"><span size="+0">Promising Prospect</span></span></b>&nbsp;</p><p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="+0">A pilot project of BSBN was launched in January in Shanghai. The network uses quantum-secured fiber lines to connect seven financial institutes in Lujiazui’s Quantum Communication Industrial Park. Already, device adjustment for two of the institutes has been completed.</span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="+0">Meanwhile, a command center and a big data center are also under construction.</span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="+0">As part of the project, embedded control software for high-speed detection and quantum key distribution were developed for these centers, respectively.</span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="+0">Several trials for the quantum communication network are now under way. As part of this process, data is transferred from the data center to another server in the same city, with quantum encryption by USTC. “Theoretically, it is impossible for data encrypted with quantum keys to be intercepted or interpreted. This is critically important for the transfer of financial data,” said REN Changqing, manager of the ICBC Data Center Network Department, one of the units involved in the trials.</span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="+0">BSBN was constructed with fiber lines at relatively low cost, offering many promising application prospects. According to Prof. CHEN, BSBN can currently provide bandwidth of 100G, with a base project cost of less than RMB 600 million. In contrast, the current cost of comparable bandwidth is RMB 2 billion.</span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="+0">More quantum communication lines will be built in the future to finally form a network, according to CHEN. “The changes will take place unnoticed; people will enjoy absolute information security without even realizing it,” he said.</span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="+0">Prof. LU Zhaoyang, also from USTC, said he is expecting mass practical use of quantum communication within a few years. Traditional communication network hardware will be improved, rather than replaced. By installing quantum encrypting devices such as single photon detectors and quantum gateways on both the sender and receiver of the transmission, traditional communication networks can also conduct quantum communication, with obvious security improvements.</span></span>&nbsp;</p></span></span></p></div></div></div><!--文章正文-->

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>This story starts with me having to simulate a faulty disk device for testing.
The Linux Kernel Device mapper is a good solution for this, so i created a
faulty device with a simple file backend:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> <span>truncate</span> <span>-s</span> 1G /tmp/baddisk
 losetup /dev/loop2 /tmp/baddisk
 dmsetup create baddisk <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>EOF</span><span> 
    0 6050 linear /dev/loop2 0
    6050 155 error
    6205 2090947 linear /dev/loop2 6205 
 EOF</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>These commands setup a new device on <em>/dev/mapper/baddisk</em> with <em>1GB</em> of size.
Starting from sector <em>6050</em>, there are <em>155</em> faulty sectors, where any write and
read operation should cause I/O errors.</p>

<p>I went on and used <em>dd</em> to write to the device, as the first faulty block
should start around <em>3MB</em>, i used the following command:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">  <span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>/dev/mapper/baddisk <span>bs</span><span>=</span>4096 <span>count</span><span>=</span>1000
  4096000 bytes <span>(</span>4.1 MB, 3.9 MiB<span>)</span> copied, 0.0107267 s, 382 MB/s</code></pre></figure>

<p>To my surprise, the command succeeded. I assumed some error in my setup and
after re-creating the device mapper target, i tried again. This time with the
following command:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> <span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>/dev/mapper/baddisk
 <span>dd</span>: writing to <span>'/dev/mapper/baddisk'</span>: Input/output error
 3096576 bytes <span>(</span>3.1 MB, 3.0 MiB<span>)</span> copied, 0.0238947 s, 130 MB/s</code></pre></figure>

<p>Nice, the device behaves as expected! While taking notes in another terminal
and switching back and forth workspaces, i issued the following command again:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">  <span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>/dev/mapper/baddisk <span>bs</span><span>=</span>4096 <span>count</span><span>=</span>1000
  4096000 bytes <span>(</span>4.1 MB, 3.9 MiB<span>)</span> copied, 0.0107267 s, 382 MB/s</code></pre></figure>

<p>What? It succeeded writing <em>4.1MB</em> of data to a faulty segment of the disk
which should clearly fail! This was strange, but still, after many attempts
with this command writing to the complete device until it got end of space, no
I/O errors were reported by <em>dd</em>.</p>

<p>Looking at the <em>dmesg</em> output, the kernel correctly reported errors with the
underlying device:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> Buffer I/O error on dev dm-3, logical block 757, lost async page write
 <span>[</span>..]</code></pre></figure>

<p>And running <em>badblocks</em> on the device also correctly reported them.</p>

<p><em>Why</em> does dd not report this error?</p>

<p>The difference between the commands is the used block size, so i assumed some
caching beeing the cause for this situation, or maybe dd opening the file with
different flags like O_DIRECT or O_SYNC if smaller block sizes are used?</p>

<p>I straced the <em>dd</em> command and the openat/write and close functions behaved
exacly the same, this time i used a <em>5MB</em> block size for simpler debugging:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> openat<span>(</span>AT_FDCWD, <span>"/dev/mapper/baddisk"</span>, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666<span>)</span> <span>=</span> 3
 write<span>(</span>1, <span>"</span><span>\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0</span><span>"</span>..., 5242880<span>)</span> <span>=</span> 5242880
 close<span>(</span>1<span>)</span>                                <span>=</span> 0</code></pre></figure>

<p>The strace output shows that the succeeding command opens the file without any
notable difference to the command writing with 512 bytes block size.  The write
and close functions return with no error whatsoever. <em>dd</em> simply does not
notice the data loss while writing to the storage!</p>

<p>Making <em>dd</em> use the <em>O_DIRECT</em> flag during file open, or the <em>O_SYNC</em> option
catches the error:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> <span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>/dev/mapper/baddisk <span>bs</span><span>=</span>5M <span>oflag</span><span>=</span>direct
 <span>dd</span>: error writing <span>'/dev/mapper/baddisk'</span>: Input/output error</code></pre></figure>

<p>What is the reason for this? I assume dd, with its standard block size of 512
bytes does not the hit the linux kernels buffered I/O. And with bigger block
sizes, the I/O becomes buffered, async, and as it stands, dd as user space
application does not validate the write operation (using fsync) to notice
errors during buffered I/O operations by default.</p>

<p>This leads us to my next finding: “the linux fsync() gate” that dates back to
2018, starting with the following question on stackoverflow:</p>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42434872/writing-programs-to-cope-with-i-o-errors-causing-lost-writes-on-linux">Writing programs to cope with I/O errors causing lost writes on Linux
</a></p>

<p>And resulting LWN articles:</p>

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/724307/">Improved block-layer error handling</a></p>

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/752063/">PostgreSQL’s fsync() surprise</a></p>

<p>which provide great insight into the linux kernels error handling and how these
errors are upstreamed to user space applications while writing data to faulty
devices.</p>

<p>Long story short: If one uses <em>dd</em> with a bigger block size <em>(&gt;= 4096)</em>, be
sure to use either the <em>oflag=direct</em> or <em>conv=fsync</em> option to have proper
error reporting while writing data to a device. I would prefer <em>conv=fsync</em>, dd
will then <em>fsync()</em> the file handle once and report the error, without having
the performance impact which <em>oflag=direct</em> has.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>/dev/mapper/baddisk <span>bs</span><span>=</span>4096 <span>count</span><span>=</span>1500 <span>conv</span><span>=</span>fsync
<span>dd</span>: fsync failed <span>for</span> <span>'/dev/mapper/baddisk'</span>: Input/output error</code></pre></figure>

our JavaScript code where we parse POST request, do some custom logic and call <code>sendEmail(...)</code> on SES service.</p>
<h3 id="0-verify-e-mail-address">0. Verify e-mail address</h3>
<p>E-mail address verification can be done <a href="https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ses/home?region=eu-west-1#verified-senders-email:">here (eu-west-1)</a></p>

<h3 id="1-lambda-function">1. Lambda Function</h3>
<p>We will start with creating Lambda function and choosing NodeJS 8.1 environment.</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/jpomykala/a3548903e3454f7d65443053ec412b65">The full code can be found on GitHub Gist</a></p>
<h6 id="import-aws-sdk">import <code>aws-sdk</code></h6>
<p>When we have prepared environment we can start to implement the function. First important thing is that we need to import <code>aws-sdk</code> to use SES and other Amazon services.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>var</span> <span>aws</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>aws-sdk</span><span>"</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>
<p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/index.html">Link to <code>aws-sdk</code> documentation</a></p>
<h6 id="lambda-responses">Lambda responses</h6>
<p>Success and error responses. This part is more important than you think. If we return wrong JSON from lambda function to API Gateway,
the client (contact form in this case) will get HTTP 500 status. Code will be invoked and email sent anyway, but itâ€™s just a good practise to
follow the documentation.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>successResponse</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>

<p>By using this function we can easily turn on and off e-mail sending from certain domains.</p>

<p>Now we can deploy our function and move to API Gateway.</p>
<p><img src="https://jpomykala.com/assets/2018-08-04/send-mail-fuction-aws.png" alt="aws-lambda-function"></p>
<h3 id="2-api-gateway">2. API Gateway</h3>
<p>Setting up API Gateway for Lambda functions, should be straightforward. There is no need to code any thing, just click-and-play configuration.
In this case I setup my endpoint to receive any http method. For working contact form you will need only <code>http/post</code> method.

<h6 id="things-to-remember">Things to remember</h6>
<ul>
<li>Every time we change something on endpoint configuration we need deploy API again to see changes. <code>Actions -&gt; Deploy API</code></li>
<li>Remember about setting up CORS while using API Gateway. <code>Actions -&gt; Enable CORS</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>We can scale this technique to multiple web pages with ease, but this solution in current form has few downsides.
For now the only one protection against DDoS or some similar attack is rate limiter included in Lambda function.
Right now there is no bot protection, no captcha or something like that. We can add Google re-captcha on the contact
form and setup rate limiting on both API Gateway and Lambda function, to avoid unnecessary costs.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><figure><div></div></figure><p><span>On Friday, September</span> 13, 2019, Matthew Prince and Michelle Zatlyn, cofounders of the San Francisco  <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/cloudflare/">internet security firm Cloudflare</a>, stood on a slim marble balcony overlooking the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. A cluster of the company's executives stood near Prince, ready to shout out a countdown. “Louder! Loud!” Prince urged them. “Five! Four! Three! …” At 9:30 am sharp, the founders reached down to ring the exchange's famous bell, kicking off the day's trading and offering their 10-year-old company on the public market. It was a rite of passage and also their payday, a moment that unlocked many millions of dollars in newfound wealth.</p><p>More than 100 employees and investors cheered from the trading floor below, their phones held high to capture the scene. Kristin Holloway, employee number 11, looked up at the balcony and snapped photos, then popped them into a text to her husband, Lee Holloway, the company's third cofounder. He was home in California. Every so often, a familiar face pushed through the throng to say to her, “Lee should be here.”</p><p>In Cloudflare's early years, Lee Holloway had been the resident genius, the guy who could focus for hours, code pouring from his fingertips while death metal blasted in his headphones. He was the master architect whose vision had guided what began as a literal sketch on a napkin into a tech giant with some 1,200 employees and 83,000 paying customers. He laid the groundwork for a system that now handles more than 10 percent of all internet requests and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cloudflare-matthew-prince-wired25/">blocks billions of cyberthreats</a> per day. Much of the architecture he dreamed up is still in place.</p><p>But some years before the IPO, his behavior began to change. He lost interest in his projects and coworkers. He stopped paying attention in meetings. His colleagues noticed he was growing increasingly rigid and belligerent, resisting others' ideas, and ignoring their feedback.</p><p>Lee's rudeness perplexed his old friends. He had built his life around Cloudflare, once vowing to not cut his hair until the startup's web traffic surpassed that of Yahoo. (It took a few short months, or about 4 inches of hair.) He had always been easygoing, happy to mentor his colleagues or hang out over lunch. At a birthday party for Zatlyn, he enchanted some children, regaling them with stories about the joys of coding. The idea of Lee picking fights simply didn't compute.</p></div></div><div><div><p>He was becoming erratic in other ways too. Some of his colleagues were surprised when Lee separated from his first wife and soon after paired up with a coworker. They figured his enormous success and wealth must have gone to his head. “All of us were just thinking he made a bunch of money, married his new girl,” Prince says. “He kind of reassessed his life and had just become a jerk.”</p><p>The people close to Lee felt tossed aside. They thought he'd chosen to shed his old life. In fact, it was anything but a choice. Over the next few years, Lee's personality would warp and twist even more, until he became almost unrecognizable to the people who knew him best. Rooting out the cause took years of detective work—and forced his family to confront the trickiest questions of selfhood.</p><p>On the floor of the stock exchange that September morning, Lee's younger brother Alaric weathered the morning in a state of low-grade panic. He snapped selfies with early employees and fired them off in texts to his brother. Alaric had never worked at Cloudflare, and he knew barely anyone there. But his dark hair flopped over his forehead with the same distinctive swoop as his brother's, and his long, tapering face had the same dark eyes and olive skin. “It was surreal,” Alaric says. “People kept looking at me like they knew me.”</p><p>At home with his parents in San Jose, Lee, 38, was restless. He paced the rooms and hallways of the 1,550-square-foot house, a loop he'd been tracing since he'd moved in with them two years earlier. He didn't speak. His parents had the TV on, and they called him over whenever Prince or Zatlyn appeared onscreen.</p><p>Later, he paused at the family's Roku to search YouTube for videos of Cloudflare. Then he resumed his circuit: walking the halls, buzzing his lips, snacking on cashews.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Lee Holloway spends time with his youngest son at home on California's Central Coast.</span><span>Artwork by Amy Friend; Photograph by Jack Bool</span></figcaption></figure><p><span>What makes you</span>  <em>you</em>? The question cuts to the core of who we are, the things that make us special in this universe. The converse of the question raises another kind of philosophical dilemma: If a person <em>isn't</em> himself, who is he?</p><p>Countless philosophers have taken a swing at this elusive piñata. In the 17th century, John Locke pinned selfhood <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/memory/">on memory</a>, using recollections as the thread connecting a person's past with their present. That holds some intuitive appeal: Memory, after all, is how most of us register our continued existence. But memory is unreliable. Writing in the 1970s, renowned philosopher Derek Parfit recast Locke's idea to argue that personhood emerges from a more complex view of psychological connectedness across time. He suggested that a host of mental phenomena—memories, intentions, beliefs, and so on—forge chains that bind us to our past selves. A person today has many of the same psychological states as that person a day ago. Yesterday's human enjoys similar overlap with an individual of two days prior. Each memory or belief is a chain that stretches back through time, holding a person together in the face of inevitable flux.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The gist, then, is that someone is “himself” because countless mental artifacts stay firm from one day to the next, anchoring that person's character over time. It's a less crisp definition than the old idea of a soul, offering no firm threshold where selfhood breaks down. It doesn't pinpoint, for example, how many psychological chains you can lose before you stop being yourself. <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/neuroscience/">Neuroscience</a> also offers only a partial answer to the question of what makes you <em>you</em>.</p><p><a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/neural-networks/">Neural networks</a> encode our mental artifacts, which together form the foundation of behavior. A stimulus enters the brain, and electrochemical signals swoosh through your neurons, culminating in an action: Hug a friend. Sit and brood. Tilt your head up at the sun and smile. Losing some brain cells here or there is no big deal; the networks are resilient enough to keep a person's behaviors and sense of self consistent.</p><p>But not always. Mess with the biological Jell-O in just the right ways and the structure of the self reveals its fragility.</p><p>Lee's personality had been consistent for decades—until it wasn't.</p><p>From an early age, he was a person who could visualize sprawling structures in his mind. Growing up in the 1990s in Cupertino, where his dad worked at Apple, Lee had early access to the latest computers, and he and his brother grew up bingeing on videogames. As a gamer, he was legendary among his friends for being able to read a complex situation, rapidly adjust strategies, and win match after match. And it wasn't just videogames. His childhood friend Justin Powell remembers Lee strolling into a middle school chess club tournament cold. He wasn't a member of the club, but he won the tournament anyway. Lee avoided becoming insufferable by channeling his wit into snarky commentary. “Watching a movie with him was like a version of <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000</em>,” Powell says. “His very presence challenged you to keep up with him.”</p><p>Lee and his friends would cart their computers to each other's houses to play games together. He became curious about the machines themselves and started learning computer science, first in high school, then at a local community college and UC Santa Cruz, where an unlikely set of circumstances connected him with Matthew Prince.</p><p>Then a young entrepreneur, Prince was pursuing an idea for an antispam software tool when he encountered Arthur Keller, a UC Santa Cruz computer science professor. Keller and his students had already worked out a very similar concept. Prince and Keller agreed to share a patent, along with Keller's students. One of those students was Lee, and Prince hired him on the spot. “I had no idea this school project would turn into something much bigger,” Lee later said in a video interview with a group called Founderly.</p><p>Prince set up the company, Unspam Technologies, in Park City, Utah, about a mile from a cluster of slopes where he could indulge his passion for skiing. Lee moved into Prince's basement, at first working for free in exchange for food and housing. But Lee and the other Unspam engineers grew restless, and they started spinning up side projects, including one called Project Honey Pot, which tracked spammers as they crawled the web. That's all it did—it collected and published data on spammers, but it didn't do anything to stop them. Still, the project quickly amassed a loyal following.</p><p>In 2007, Prince left Utah to start business school at Harvard, and Lee moved to California to live with his girlfriend, Alexandra Carey. They'd known each other as undergrads, when she was a teaching assistant in his computer architecture class. Lee had goofed off in that class, once pranking the professor by scrawling childish notes on the transparencies of an overhead projector. Alexandra had been amused, but it wasn't until after college that a relationship bloomed. Living in different cities, they fell for each other while playing and chatting within a multiplayer videogame called <em>Savage</em>. Now, with Prince leaving Utah, it seemed a natural time for Lee to join Alexandra. They married in 2008.</p><div><div><p><span><picture><img alt="This image may contain Electronics, Computer, and Pc" src="https://media.wired.com/photos/5c098e5fd146d62d209935fc/1:1/w_775%2Cc_limit/Data-Breaches.png" srcset="https://media.wired.com/photos/5c098e5fd146d62d209935fc/1:1/w_775%2Cc_limit/Data-Breaches.png 775w, https://media.wired.com/photos/5c098e5fd146d62d209935fc/1:1/w_775%2Cc_limit/Data-Breaches.png 775w, https://media.wired.com/photos/5c098e5fd146d62d209935fc/1:1/w_768%2Cc_limit/Data-Breaches.png 768w, https://media.wired.com/photos/5c098e5fd146d62d209935fc/1:1/w_768%2Cc_limit/Data-Breaches.png 768w, https://media.wired.com/photos/5c098e5fd146d62d209935fc/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/Data-Breaches.png 640w" sizes="100vw"></picture></span></p><div><h3><a href="https://weekly.statuscode.com/story/wired-guide-to-data-breaches">The WIRED Guide to Data Breaches</a></h3><p>Everything you ever wanted to know about Equifax, Mariott, and the problem with social security numbers.</p></div></div></div><p>Lee and Prince kept working at Unspam from their respective cities, but as Prince was wrapping up business school, Lee called to tell him he was considering other job offers.

            <h3>Reed-Solomon error recovery in RAID-6</h3>
        </p>

        <p>
            https://anadoxin.org/blog/error-recovery-in-raid6.html
        </p>

        
        
        
        

        
        
        
        

        
        <p>There are lots of resources on the Internet about RAID-6 error recovery and how you can create your own implementation of it, but most of those resources require spending a lot of time fighting with mathematical equations and figuring out the real algorithm.</p>
<p>In this post I'll try to give you a simple example how you can create your own error recovery solution based on what is used in RAID-6. More specifically, if you need to provide rendundancy across your mediums so that a failure of 1 or 2 mediums will be tolerated, look no further! ;)</p>
<p>If you'll read this post, as a bonus you'll gain knowledge about how RAID-5 error recovery works, because RAID-6 is an improved version of RAID-5 error recovery system.</p>

<p>Let's assume you have 3 disk drives with some data. Let's name those drives as <code>D1</code>, <code>D2</code> and <code>D3</code>. In order to use the same error recovery technique as RAID-6 uses, you'll need two additional disk drives, the <code>PD</code> drive, and the <code>RS</code> drive. I'll describe what <code>PD</code> and <code>RS</code> means in few moments. So, you'll need a total of 5 disk drives: <code>D1</code>, <code>D2</code>, <code>D3</code>, <code>PD</code> and <code>RS</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://anadoxin.org/blog/error-recovery-in-raid6.html/image1.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>So, here's the situation:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>D1</code>, <code>D2</code> and <code>D3</code> contain <em>arbitrary user data</em>, and it doesn't matter what their contents are. FWIW you can assume those drives are full of cat pictures.</li>
<li>The special <code>PD</code> drive (named after <code>Parity Drive</code>, sometimes called <code>P</code> in whitepapers) contains the XOR data, generated automatically from <code>D1</code>, <code>D2</code> and <code>D3</code>.</li>
<li>The second special <code>RS</code> drive (named after <code>Reed-Solomon Drive</code>, sometimes also called <code>Q</code>) contains the Reed-Solomon codes, calculated from the same data as <code>PD</code>, namely from drives <code>D1</code>, <code>D2</code> and <code>D3</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's see how we can perform some basic operations on such disk array.</p>

<p>If we have properly calculated <code>PD</code> and <code>RS</code> drives, we can lose up to 2 drives. How we recover from failures depends on which drives will fail. There are generally 7 cases that RAID-6 can handle. Next points will describe the scenarios, sorted from the easiest case, to the most complicated.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Loss of the <code>PD</code> drive (failure of only one drive).</p>
<p><img src="https://anadoxin.org/blog/error-recovery-in-raid6.html/image-losspd.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>This case is very straightforward. The <code>PD</code> drive contains only autogenerated data, so in case we lose the <code>PD</code> drive, we can regenerate it by using only user data (stored on disks <code>D1</code>, <code>D2</code> and <code>D3</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loss of one of the data drives: either <code>D1</code>, <code>D2</code> or <code>D3</code> (failure of only one drive).</p>
<p><img src="https://anadoxin.org/blog/error-recovery-in-raid6.html/image-datadrive.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>In this case we're losing data, but since we only lose 1 disk, the recovery scenario is the same as in RAID-5 error recovery: we'll use <code>PD</code> drive <em>together with two non-missing data drives</em> to recover data from the missing data drive. It doesn't matter which data drive we lose, because if we have 2 data drives and the <code>PD</code> drive, we can always generate data for the third drive. The <code>RS</code> drive is not needed to regenerate the data drive in this case (and is not used at all in this failure case).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loss of the <code>RS</code> drive (failure of only one drive).</p>
<p><img src="https://anadoxin.org/blog/error-recovery-in-raid6.html/image-lossrs.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>Similar to the situation from point 1: we have all the data drives, and we can simply regenerate the <code>RS</code> drive by calculating Reed-Solomon codes from drives that did not fail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loss of the <code>PD</code> drive and the <code>RS</code> drive (failure of two drives).</p>
<p><img src="https://anadoxin.org/blog/error-recovery-in-raid6.html/image-losspdrs.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>This case is very similar to points 1 or 3, we have all the data intact, so we can generate contents of <code>PD</code> drive and then <code>RS</code> drive very easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loss of the <code>RS</code> drive and one data drive (failure of two drives).</p>
<p><img src="https://anadoxin.org/blog/error-recovery-in-raid6.html/image-lossdatars.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>In this case we're losing two disks, but only one lost disk is filled with data. Since we have <code>PD</code> drive intact, we can use it to regenerate data from missing data drive, so this case is not so different than case #2. After that, we will have all the data drives, so we can regenerate the <code>RS</code> drive easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loss of the <code>PD</code> drive and one data drive (failure of two drives).</p>
<p><img src="https://anadoxin.org/blog/error-recovery-in-raid6.html/image-lossdatapd.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>This case is more complicated. We lose one user data drive (in this example <code>D3</code>), and we don't have the <code>PD</code> drive to aid with recovery, because we've lost it as well. We have to use the <code>RS</code> drive in conjunction with all user data drives that are still available (<code>D1</code> and <code>D2</code>) to regenerate the missing data drive <code>D3</code>. After we'll have all data drives regenerated, we can calculate the missing <code>PD</code> drive. This is the first case where recovery using Reed-Solomon codes comes into play.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loss of two data drives (failure of two drives).</p>
<p><img src="https://anadoxin.org/blog/error-recovery-in-raid6.html/image-lossdatadata.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>This is the most complicated scenario. We need to use both <code>PD</code> and <code>RS</code> to regenerate both data drives. Reed-Solomon coding makes this case possible.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the following sections, I'll try to describe those cases above with more detail, and provide some source code (in Python :P) that will perform actual recovery of data.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that real RAID-6 arrays don't really dedicate whole disk for <code>PD</code> or <code>RS</code>. Real arrays span this additional checksum data across all disks. There are multiple methods used by various controllers: left asynchronous, right synchronous, there can be an offset to the RAID data, there can be pattern delays, etc. Why it's done this way, and how exactly RAID-6 stripes looks like is beyond the scope of this blog post. So let's stick only to Reed-Solomon codes.</p>
<h2 id="test-data">Test data</h2>
<p>Let's define how our "user data" looks like. To keep things simple, let's pretend that our "disk drives" are 5 bytes big.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Disk</th><th>Data in ASCII</th><th>Data in HEX</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><code>D1</code></td><td>f i r s t</td><td>0x66, 0x69, 0x72, 0x73, 0x74</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>D2</code></td><td>s e c n d</td><td>0x73, 0x65, 0x63, 0x6e, 0x64</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>D3</code></td><td>t h i r d</td><td>0x74, 0x68, 0x69, 0x72, 0x64</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Let's go into the scenarios mentioned above in more details.</p>

<p>In order to generate the <code>PD</code> data, we need only the user data drives. In our case it's <code>D1</code>, <code>D2</code> and <code>D3</code>. The <code>PD</code> drive consists of nothing more than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR">XOR</a> of all user data.</p>
<ul>
<li>To generate offset 0 of the <code>PD</code> drive, you need to XOR all bytes from offset 0 from all disk drives.</li>
<li>Then, to generate offset 1 of the <code>PD</code> drive, you need to XOR bytes from offset 1 from all disk drives. E.g.:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code><span>PD[0] = D1[0] xor D2[0] xor D3[0]
PD[1] = D1[1] xor D2[1] xor D3[1]
PD[2] = D1[2] xor D2[2] xor D3[2]
PD[3] = D1[3] xor D2[3] xor D3[3]
PD[4] = D1[4] xor D2[4] xor D3[4]
</span></code></pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code><span>PD[0] = 0x66 xor 0x73 xor 0x74  =&gt;  0x61
PD[1] = 0x69 xor 0x65 xor 0x63  =&gt;  0x64
PD[2] = 0x72 xor 0x63 xor 0x69  =&gt;  0x78
PD[3] = 0x73 xor 0x6e xor 0x72  =&gt;  0x6f
PD[4] = 0x74 xor 0x64 xor 0x64  =&gt;  0x74
</span></code></pre>
<p>Yes, it's that simple. Do it for the whole drives (in our case, 5 bytes), and you'll have the properly generated <code>PD</code> drive:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Disk</th><th>Data in HEX</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><code>PD</code></td><td>0x61, 0x64, 0x78, 0x6f, 0x74</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>So, in case when only your <code>PD</code> drive will fail, you can see it's trivial to regenerate it from the data drives <code>D1</code>, <code>D2</code> and <code>D3</code>.</p>

<p>By the way, this is how RAID-5 error recovery works. If only one drive with user data will fail, we can use the <code>PD</code> drive to recalculate missing user data.</p>
<p>Let's say we're losing <code>D2</code>, so the drives that are still working are: <code>D1</code>, <code>D3</code>, <code>PD</code> and <code>RS</code>. In this case, we don't even look at <code>RS</code>. All we need are the <code>D1</code>, <code>D3</code> and <code>PD</code> drives. To calculate missing data, you can use the XOR function again, like in the previous point.</p>
<p>To recover user data from offset 0, XOR the bytes from offsets 0 of disks with user data you haven't lost (<code>D1</code> and <code>D3</code>) together with the byte from offset 0 from the <code>PD</code> drive. Do the same thing for offset 1, like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>D2[0] = D1[0] xor D3[0] xor PD[0]
D2[1] = D1[1] xor D3[1] xor PD[1]
D2[2] = D1[2] xor D3[2] xor PD[2]
D2[3] = D1[3] xor D3[3] xor PD[3]
D2[4] = D1[4] xor D3[4] xor PD[4]
</span></code></pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code><span>D2[0] = 0x66 xor 0x74 xor 0x61  =&gt;  0x73 (s)
D2[1] = 0x69 xor 0x63 xor 0x64  =&gt;  0x65 (e)
D2[2] = 0x72 xor 0x69 xor 0x78  =&gt;  0x63 (c)
D2[3] = 0x73 xor 0x72 xor 0x6f  =&gt;  0x6e (n)
D2[4] = 0x74 xor 0x64 xor 0x74  =&gt;  0x64 (d)
</span></code></pre>
<p>As you can see, we can easily recover data from the missing drive. It doesn't matter which drive is missing; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR">XOR function</a> will work anyway.</p>

<p>Now we enter the realm of the Reed-Solomon codes and Galois fields. But don't worry, you don't have to be a mathematician in order to <em>use</em> it.</p>
<p>When we lose only <code>RS</code> drive, or when we initialize a new RAID-6-like redundation system, we simply need to regenerate it. In order to do that, we need to use the <code>gflog</code> and <code>gfilog</code> tables, which are always constant, plus data from our existing data drives <code>D1</code>, <code>D2</code> and <code>D3</code>.</p>
<p>This is the <code>gflog</code> table, it always stays the same:</p>
<pre><code><span>    0x00, 0x00, 0x01, 0x19, 0x02, 0x32, 0x1a, 0xc6, 0x03, 0xdf, 0x33, 0xee, 0x1b, 0x68, 0xc7, 0x4b,

cryptographic functions and it provides <em>Transport Layer Security</em> (<em>TLS</em>) and <em>Secure Sockets Layer</em> (<em>SSL</em>) protocols to applications.</p><p>According to the <em>Arch Linux</em> <a href="https://archlinux.org/packages/core/x86_64/openssl/">OpenSSL package</a>, <strong>355</strong> packages, out of the
<em>11523</em> available, depend on it. You can find it installed on any Unix system
(and on Windows too!).</p><p>It started in 1998 as a fork of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSLeay">SSLeay</a> and it has been in development since.
Two full-time developers work on it, as well as many volunteers.</p><p>Fast forward to 2014: a <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures">CVE</a></em> had been issued regarding a high risk
vulnerability found in OpenSSL. It has been given the name <strong><a href="https://heartbleed.com/">Heartbleed</a></strong>,
because it has been found in the <em>TLS</em>/<em>DTLS</em> heartbeat extension (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6520">RFC6520</a>).
This vulnerability allowed attackers to steal sensitive data, such as secret
keys, user names and passwords.</p><p>All the community turned to the OpenSSL project, weighting its implementation
and security policy. Heartbleed have been promptly fixed, but there could be new
vulnerabilities in the future, if security was not properly prioritized during
development.</p><p>At this point, OpenBSD’s folks forked OpenSSL and started a new project:
<a href="https://www.libressl.org/">LibreSSL</a>. It primary goals were to <strong>modernize the codebase and to improve
its security</strong>. This new project hasn’t been adopted by big distributions such
Ubuntu and Arch Linux; instead smaller distributions (at that time) replaced
OpenSSL with LibreSSL on their default configuration, such as Alpine and Void.</p><p>In the last years, LibreSSL have seen a decline in its usage. Alpine switched
back to OpenSSL (<a href="https://lists.alpinelinux.org/~alpine/devel/%3C20181011171746.4c01f758%40ncopa-desktop.copa.dup.pw%3E">link to the thread</a>). Many people and distributions are
considering doing the same, since OpenSSL got the improvement that LibreSSL
aimed for. And it’s still the <em>de facto standard</em> cryptographic library on Unix.</p><h2 id="why-replacing-openssl-now">Why replacing OpenSSL now?</h2><p>OpenSSL works fine, there is no denying that. Every software has <em>out of the box
support for it</em> so it costs no effort in term of additional mainteinance.
However, there are <strong>newer and lighter TLS and SSL implementations</strong>, which many
folks might prefer over the heavy OpenSSL’s one. I, too, prefer lightweight
libraries.</p><p>I am uninstalling LibreSSL on my systems, therefore this might be the perfect
time to experiment with something different. I have found an interesting (and
well done!) library called <em><strong><a href="https://wolfssl.com/">wolfSSL</a></strong></em> that claims to have an <em>OpenSSL
compatibility layer</em>. It also claims to be 20 times smaller than OpenSSL.</p><h2 id="installation">Installation</h2><p><strong>wolfSSL</strong> is a small C library; It uses <em>autotools</em> to build and <strong>CMake</strong>
support is being added (sigh!). Upon running <code>configure</code>, I am overwhelmed by
the quantity of compile options available.</p><figure><img src="https://danyspin97.org/img/replacing-openssl-part-1-wolfssl/wolf-ssl-configure.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>some of the wolfSSL configure options</figcaption></figure><p>Fortunately, there is one comfy option which I’ve used
when compiling wolfSSL: <code>--enable-all</code>. It enables all options, including
the OpenSSL compatibility layer and leaves out the <em>SSL 3</em> protocol.</p><p>Upon completing the build and installation (which takes a couple of
minutes), a library <code>libwolfssl.so</code> will be installed into <code>/usr/lib</code>, as
well as a pkgconfig file (<code>wolfssl.pc</code>) and all the headers.</p><h2 id="out-of-the-box-support">Out of the box support</h2><p>Key applications provide support for different SSL implementations other than
OpenSSL. For example <em>curl</em> supports <em>mbedTLS</em>, <em>BearSSL</em> and our <strong>wolfSSL</strong>.
To compile <em>curl</em> using wolfSSL, we just need to add <code>--with-ssl=wolfssl</code> and
we’re done. I am aware of only two packages that have out of the box support
for wolfSSL and they are <em>curl</em> and <em><a href="https://gitlab.com/gnuwget/wget2">wget2</a></em> (not the legacy version!).</p><h2 id="openssl-compatibility">OpenSSL compatibility</h2><p><code>--enable-all</code> configure option enabled the OpenSSL compatibility layer.
To use this layer, according to the <a href="https://www.wolfssl.com/docs/wolfssl-manual/ch13/">documentation</a>, we need to link the wolfssl
library manually by adding <code>-lwolfssl</code> as link argument. We also need to
include the path <code>/usr/include/wolfssl</code> so that the OpenSSL headers in
<code>/usr/include/wolfssl/openssl</code> will be picked up.</p><p>This way both wolfSSL and OpenSSL can coexist on the same system and the latter
can be replaced on a per project basis. However, that’s not what we want since
want to replace OpenSSL at a system level.</p><p>Adding the link flag to each package on the system or patching one by one
is not an option as it would take too much time. Let’s instead apply some
workarounds.</p><p>First, we create a symlink for the headers:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ sudo ln -sf /usr/include/wolfssl/openssl /usr/include/openssl
</code></pre></div><p>Then we create a symlink for each library. OpenSSL provides the following
libraries:</p><ul><li><code>libssl.so</code></li><li><code>libcrypto.so</code></li></ul><p>So we can run:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/libwolfssl.so /usr/lib/libssl.so
$ sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/libwolfssl.so /usr/lib/libcrypto.so
</code></pre></div><h3 id="fixing-pkg-config">Fixing pkg-config</h3><p>Some software rely on pkg-config for checking OpenSSL dependency since
it provides the following pkg-config files:</p><ul><li><code>libssl.pc</code></li><li><code>libcrypto.pc</code></li><li><code>openssl.pc</code></li></ul><p>My system doesn’t currently have either OpenSSL or LibreSSL installed, so any
attempt to include OpenSSL by using pkg-config will fail. We can fix this by
adding a pkg-config file in <code>/usr/lib/pkgconfig/openssl.pc</code>:</p><pre><code>prefix=/usr/x86_64-pc-linux-musl
includedir=${prefix}/include/wolfssl

Name: openssl
Description: wolfssl C library.
Version: 4.6.0
Requires: wolfssl
Cflags: -I${includedir}
</code></pre><p>Our pkg-config file will include the correct directory containing the OpenSSL
headers. It will also import cflags and link flags from the wolfssl pkg-config.
Let’s try if it works as intended:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ pkg-config --cflags --libs openssl
-I/usr/x86_64-pc-linux-musl/include/wolfssl -lwolfssl
</code></pre></div><p>Yes! Now we just need create symlinks the other two pkg-config files:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/pkgconfig/openssl.pc /usr/lib/pkgconfig/libssl.pc
$ sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/pkgconfig/openssl.pc /usr/lib/pkgconfig/libcrypto.pc
</code></pre></div><p>Now we’re ready to compile system packages.</p><h2 id="compiling-system-packages">Compiling system packages</h2><p>Before actually going further into the various compile results, there are few
general changes that I’ve done:</p><ol><li>Include the default <code>/usr/include/wolfssl/option.h</code> provided in
<code>/usr/include/wolfssl/wolfcrypt/setting.h</code>. This way we will have a bunch of
defines already included that enable many wolfSSL features.</li><li>Remove some defines from <code>option.h</code> that disable old OpenSSL features, like
old SSL names. While I understand that these features are plainly old (or even
deprecated), projects will still use them as long as they haven’t been
removed upstream.</li><li>Define <code>OPENSSL_NO_WHIRPOOL</code> in the same header as above, since this feature
ins’t implemented in wolfSSL. There are other <code>OPENSSL_NO_*</code> defines there for
unimplemented features, but this one was missing.</li></ol><h3 id="wget">wget</h3><p><em><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/">wget</a></em>, which comes installed on any Unix system, is the first software we’ll
try building with wolfSSL and its OpenSSL compatibility layer.</p><figure><img src="https://danyspin97.org/img/replacing-openssl-part-1-wolfssl/wget-error-1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>wget compile error</figcaption></figure><p>wget complains about two undeclared identifiers:</p><ul><li><code>CONF_MFLAGS_DEFAULT_SECTION</code></li><li><code>CONF_MFLAGS_IGNORE_MISSING_FILE</code></li></ul><p>We can fix this by adding the defines from the OpenSSL file <code>openssl/conf.h</code>
to <code>/usr/include/wolfssl/option.h</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span># define CONF_MFLAGS_IGNORE_MISSING_FILE 0x10
</span><span># define CONF_MFLAGS_DEFAULT_SECTION     0x20
</span></code></pre></div><figure><img src="https://danyspin97.org/img/replacing-openssl-part-1-wolfssl/wget-error-2.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>wget link-time errors about missing symbols</figcaption></figure><p>We arrived at link-time, that’s huge! However, there are 8 undefined symbols:
6 symbols about unimplemented features in wolfSSL, such as <code>i2d_x509_PUBKEY</code>
and <code>a2i_IPADDRESS</code>; 2 symbols regarding wolfSSL functions. The latter could
probably be fixed by adding the proper compile time option to wolfSSL, like
<code>--enable-sslv3</code>.</p><h3 id="rhash">rhash</h3><p>rhash is an utility that calculates and verifies message digests, such as
<em>SHA256</em> and <em>MD5</em>. It is required by CMake, so we can consider it an essential
package. Compiling rhash led to many errors. Let’s look in depth at some of
them.</p><figure><img src="https://danyspin97.org/img/replacing-openssl-part-1-wolfssl/rhash-error-1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>rhash compile error about RIPEMD160_CTX</figcaption></figure><p><em>rhash</em> uses <code>RIPEMD160_CTX</code> which is not implemented by wolfSSL.</p><figure><img src="https://danyspin97.org/img/replacing-openssl-part-1-wolfssl/rhash-error-2.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>rhash compile error about WOLFSSL_MD5_CTX</figcaption></figure><p>This time, rhash access a member of <code>MD5_CTX</code> (which wolfSSL has replaced by
<code>WOLFSSL_MD5_CTX</code>) using <code>offsetof</code>. The original <code>MD5_CTX</code> struct looks like
this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>MD5state_st</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>MD5_LONG</span> <span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>,</span> <span>C</span><span>,</span> <span>D</span><span>;</span>
    <span>MD5_LONG</span> <span>Nl</span><span>,</span> <span>Nh</span><span>;</span>
    <span>MD5_LONG</span> <span>data</span><span>[</span><span>MD5_LBLOCK</span><span>];</span>
    <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>num</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>MD5_CTX</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div><p><code>WOLFSSL_MD5_CTX</code> instead looks like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>WOLFSSL_MD5_CTX</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>/* big enough to hold wolfcrypt md5, but check on init */</span>

<span>#endif
</span><span></span><span>}</span> <span>WOLFSSL_MD5_CTX</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>I think that this incosistency between OpenSSL and wolfSSL structs <em>will</em>
happen again with different data types.</p><h3 id="libssh2">libssh2</h3><p>From the official <a href="https://www.libssh2.org/">libssh2</a> site:</p><blockquote><p><em>libssh2 a client-side C library implementing the SSH2 protocol</em></p></blockquote><p>curl has a hard dependency on libssh2, so we can consider it another essential
package.</p><figure><img src="https://danyspin97.org/img/replacing-openssl-part-1-wolfssl/libssh2-error-1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>libssh2 build errors</figcaption></figure><p>This time there are only 2 errors, both about unimplemented features:
<code>EVP_bf_cbc</code> and <code>EVP_cast5_cbc</code>. The man pages are the best source of
information about OpenSSL functions; we can browse them by running:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ man EVP
$ man EVP_bf_cbc
$ man EVP_cast5_cbc
</code></pre></div><p>Let’s split the names and study each part:</p><ul><li><code>EVP</code> is a high-level interface to cryptographic functions</li><li><code>bf</code> and <code>cast5</code> are the name of the algorithms, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_(cipher)">blowfish</a></em> and <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAST-128">CAST</a></em>
respectively.</li><li><code>cbc</code>, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#:~:text=Cipher%20block%20chaining%20(CBC),-CBC&amp;text=In%20CBC%20mode%2C%20each%20block,used%20in%20the%20first%20block.">Cipher Block Chaining</a></em>, is a mode of operation that tells OpenSSL
to operate on each block seperately from the others.</li></ul><p>Operating cryptographic functions in <em>CBC</em> mode isn’t really safe nor the
two algorithms above are really popular, so I understand why wolfSSL developers
might have prioritized other things over implementing the two functions above.</p><h3 id="ffmpeg">ffmpeg</h3><p><em><a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a></em> is a powerful library and a collection of utilities for handling
images, audio and videos. It is required by <em>Firefox</em>, <em>Chromium</em>, <em>mpv</em> and
another hundred and a half software (at least). We surely don’t want a system
without this library.</p><figure><img src="https://danyspin97.org/img/replacing-openssl-part-1-wolfssl/ffmpeg-error.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>ffmpeg build error</figcaption></figure><p>This time there is only one error (but others may still pop up later while
building!). The function <code>BN_sub_word</code> is missing. According to the man pages,
it is the arithmetic function that perform subtractions on big integers.
This seems pretty straightforward …</p></div></div>

<p>So in this situation I don’t have a lens on the front of the camera. So if the camera is going to fire without a lens on it, you have to go to the menus and you’ve have to turn on the setting which will allow the camera to fire when there’s no lens attached. There’s no coupling here. <img loading="lazy" src="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_26.png" alt="" width="1071" height="600" srcset="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_26.png 1071w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_26-300x168.png 300w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_26-768x430.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1071px) 100vw, 1071px">This is just a space between the lens and the front of the camera. I did have to turn that feature on that will allow me to shoot without a lens in order to make this work.</p>

It almost has a tilt shift kind of quality like it’s you’re focusing on one point. <img loading="lazy" src="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_31.png" alt="" width="1072" height="599" srcset="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_31.png 1072w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_31-300x168.png 300w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_31-768x429.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1072px) 100vw, 1072px">When you get somebody up front like this, it gives you a blur all the way around.

<p>I’m learning as we go along here, it doesn’t have a flat plane of focus, but I think that’s because of the way I mounted the camera back there. It’s a little bit like a tilt shift. So I didn’t get them quite square, which is kind of cool because I get the face in focus, but the hands or the body go out of focus in the foreground. It’s just kind of cool looking.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_39.png" alt="" width="1067" height="596" srcset="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_39.png 1067w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_39-300x168.png 300w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_39-768x429.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1067px) 100vw, 1067px"></p>
<p>One of the reasons I love to carry a light in my bag is anytime I’m doing a street portrait or something, a continuous light is so easy to flip up really fast. It gives us a little bit of light on the face and opens up the shadows. The <a href="https://bhpho.to/32nCIvK">LitraStudio</a> is perfect for that because it’s easy. <img loading="lazy" src="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_40.png" alt="" width="1074" height="601" srcset="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_40.png 1074w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_40-300x168.png 300w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_40-768x430.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1074px) 100vw, 1074px">Turn it on and it’s so powerful, it’s worth the weight. It’s not like one of the little tiny ones Litra makes. I like the bigger heavier light because it just gives me so much more power. Especially in a situation like this where you have the sun to deal with.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_42.png" alt="" width="1072" height="601" srcset="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_42.png 1072w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_42-300x168.png 300w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_42-768x431.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1072px) 100vw, 1072px"></p>
<p>So there you have it. I’m going to do more of this. <img loading="lazy" src="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_44.png" alt="" width="1072" height="602" srcset="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_44.png 1072w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_44-300x168.png 300w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_44-768x431.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1072px) 100vw, 1072px">I want to adapt some other lenses to my EOS R and just try to get weird views and that kind of gritty look. This actually was way cleaner than I thought it was going to be. <img loading="lazy" src="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_46.png" alt="" width="1071" height="600" srcset="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_46.png 1071w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_46-300x168.png 300w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_46-768x430.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1071px) 100vw, 1071px">I don’t even have something blocking the light between the camera and the lens. I used just a little bit of tape in here. But it projects a great image on the sensor. It’s a little hard to focus but a lot of fun to shoot. <img loading="lazy" src="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_48.png" alt="" width="1071" height="600" srcset="https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_48.png 1071w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_48-300x168.png 300w, https://theslantedlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Imax_48-768x430.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1071px) 100vw, 1071px">So I hope you enjoyed this.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article"><header><p>January 06, 2021</p></header><section itemprop="articleBody"><p>Screen readers are an essential part of using the web for people who are vision impaired, illiterate or have a learning disability.</p>
<p>Today’s screen readers traverse web pages and applications and read out user interface elements, content and allow users to navigate and interact with the web.</p>
<p>There are many screen readers available for different devices and platforms, each with differing levels of functionality, interfaces and features. The most common are JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver and TalkBack.</p>
<p>According to the latest <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey8/">WebAIM Screen Reader User Survey</a>, when it comes to desktop screen reader usage, JAWS and NVDA are practically equal in usage, with around 40% of respondents reporting that they use one or the other.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://jaketracey.com/webaim-graph.png" alt="Line chart of primary screen reader usage since October 2009. JAWS has steady decline from 68% to 40%. NVDA has steady incline from 3% to 41%. VoiceOver has a slow incline from 10% to 13%.">
<figcaption>Source: WebAIM</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Based on the graph above, there’s a clear pattern over the course of the last 10 years, with NVDA usage increasing as JAWS usage drops, culminating in an inflection point in 2019 when NVDA surpassed JAWS usage for the first time.</p>
<p>As a developer regularly faced with time constraints, I have often wondered: what should be the baseline in terms of testing for screen readers, and what browser and screen reader combinations are the most important to cover in order to achieve the greatest level of WCAG compliance?</p>
<h2>An issue of time</h2>
<p>Given that almost all web applications developed in 2021 are also used on mobile and therefore require testing on both iOS and Android devices, as well as Windows and macOS for desktop users, providing adequate support for such a broad range of scenarios becomes quite difficult to manage.</p>
<p>Let’s say in a best-case scenario, a given page or feature will be tested on the following combinations:</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS / VoiceOver</li>
<li>Android / TalkBack</li>
<li>macOS / Chrome / VoiceOver</li>
<li>macOS / Safari / VoiceOver</li>
<li>macOS / Firefox / VoiceOver</li>
<li>Windows / Microsoft Edge / NVDA</li>
<li>Windows / Chrome / NVDA</li>
<li>Windows / Firefox / NVDA</li>
<li>Windows / Microsoft Edge / JAWS</li>
<li>Windows / Chrome / JAWS</li>
<li>Windows / Firefox / JAWS</li>
</ul>
<p>I should clarify that by “best-case”, I am conveniently leaving out any versions of Internet Explorer, but as frustrating as it may be, including it would add at least another 2 rounds of testing.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that WebAIM also recommends using Microsoft Edge with Narrator, but given its low usage, we’ll leave it out (more on this later).</p>
<p>Hypothetically, depending on the size of the functionality or page implemented, let’s say each round of testing takes one hour to complete, assuming the developer has experience with each of these browsers and screen readers.</p>
<p>In this scenario, comprehensively testing screen reader support across all these combinations adds 11 hours of development work – and that’s just to test!</p>
<h2>An issue of fragmentation</h2>
<p>Web developers will be familiar with the issues surrounding browser version fragmentation, and this problem is compounded when testing with screen readers. Contending with not only varying levels of HTML, Javascript and CSS support in the browser can be tough, and to combat this, polyfills and tools like <a href="https://caniuse.com/">caniuse.com</a> have made life a lot easier.</p>
<p>When it comes to screen reader version fragmentation, there is very little in the way of either documentation or support for developers. Fixing issues often comes down to a case of trial and error, retesting and hoping for the best.</p>
<p>A piece of information that would be incredibly useful in this area would be <em>penetration of screen reader updates</em> from the vendors. If, for instance, developers knew that there was a high adoption rate of updates among screen reader users, they could be confident that if a screen reader update resolved an issue, patches for older versions could be sunsetted. This approach has worked exceptionally well for browsers such as Chrome and Firefox.</p>
<p>Sadly, there’s not currently any way for a developer to identify the type or version of a screen reader that is being used, so implementing targeted fixes isn’t an option anyway right now.</p>
<h2>A case for dedicated accessibility testers</h2>
<p>Given the scope and time it takes to properly test across so many devices, browsers and screen readers, having dedicated accessibility testers embedded into teams can significantly increase the quality and speed with which properly accessible applications can be produced.</p>
<p>Let’s face it: developers already have a hard time keeping up with the pace of change in their own domain, let alone the level of knowledge required for comprehensive accessibility auditing.</p>
<p>That is not to say that developers should ignore accessibility completely. However, expecting someone to know about a specific bug on a particular combination of code, browser and screen reader is too much, even for the most experienced accessibility-focused developer.</p>
<h2>Why automation isn’t enough</h2>
<p>The old saying "a good programmer is a lazy programmer" comes to mind when I think about testing here. Being lazy myself (although possibly not that great of a programmer), I rely on automated tools like <a href="https://www.deque.com/axe/">axe</a> to do most of my accessibility for me. While the current range of tooling is excellent, and picks up the most obvious issues, when it comes to screen readers there’s no way around it: you need to manually test.</p>
<p>Why? Well, the current state of both browsers and screen reader support is all over the place. To highlight this, the Powermapper website has a neat <a href="https://www.powermapper.com/tests/screen-readers/aria/">list of screen reader support for WAI-ARIA attributes</a>. Not throwing shade at any one – things are continuously improving with updates to browsers and screen readers – but the point stands. Current automated testing tools are not going to catch these problems because they essentially test the validity of code, in much the same way as a code linter does.</p>
<h2>A compromise, so we can all still get stuff done</h2>
<p>Not every team has the luxury of a dedicated accessibility tester, or even a dedicated tester for that matter. Sometimes, you just need to do the best you can, with the resources that you have available.</p>
<p>"When can we stop supporting this?" has been the desperate cry of developers for years when it comes to Internet Explorer 9/10 and most recently 11, and as their usage has dropped, so has the rate of developers losing their hair trying to get their code working.</p>
<p>Which brings me back to Microsoft Edge with Narrator, as mentioned earlier. With 1% of users in that survey, and possibly 0% of users for your application or site, is it worth testing on this combination at all? More specifically, what number of users justifies support, and the testing and development overhead that comes with it?</p>
<h3>Windows - Chrome (latest version), NVDA</h3>
<p>As of December 2020, Chrome is by far the most popular browser in the world, with 65.3% of users. Later versions of Microsoft Edge utilize the same rendering engine, so there is a high likelihood that if it works in Chrome, it will work similarly in Edge.</p>
<p>Based on the WebAIM stats, it is a safe bet that NVDA will begin to increase its lead over JAWS over the next few years. Given that it is also open-source and free, I can’t help but draw a comparison to the way Firefox overtook Internet Explorer in the 2000s browser wars.</p>
<h3>macOS - Safari (latest version), VoiceOver</h3>
<p>Safari is a fair distance behind Chrome in terms of users, with 16.7% share as of writing, but it has the benefit of being the default browser in macOS. It is also free, and the support for accessibility features with VoiceOver is second to none. In addition to this, because of the similarity with its mobile counterpart, most likely any issues that are identified in the desktop version will have similar fixes.</p>
<h3>iOS - Safari (latest version), VoiceOver</h3>
<p>Safari is by far the most popular browser on iOS and all other browsers on iOS use the WebKit rendering engine. VoiceOver is the gold standard for mobile screen readers (and the only option for iOS devices), and as such it makes sense to use this combination for testing iOS accessibility.</p>
<h3>Android - Chrome (latest version), TalkBack</h3>
<p>In a similar vein to iOS, being the default browser and screen reader combination for Android makes this a simple choice, as it will cover the vast majority of users on this platform. Although manufacturers do include their own browsers and there are quite a few other options on Android, the vast majority of the time they use the inbuilt rendering engine, so the expectation in terms of accessibility should be similar, if not identical, to the Chrome experience.</p>
<p>This is by no means a catch-all solution for everyone. Each circumstance will be different, and the best course of action would be to engage your users and ask rather than trying to make the decision for them.</p>
<p>The reality is that if your site or application’s design or functionality looks bad or works poorly for a large enough number of your users because it does not support the software that they use, it can have potential ramifications to your business, through sales or reputation. Similarly, poor accessibility will have a negative impact if your users are using older versions of screen readers and browser combinations.</p>
<h2>But what about JAWS, ZoomText, System Access, <em>insert screen reader here</em>?</h2>
<p>At the risk of being slightly incendiary, I dislike the idea of paying for something that I can get for free. NVDA is a project that has brought screen readers to everybody – including those without the financial means to pay for it – so I support it. Along with the clear trajectory of its usage uptake, it is not unreasonable to expect that the majority of users will adopt it in the next 5 to 10 years.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, however, your best bet when it comes to identifying where your testing efforts should be placed is to talk to your users to find out what their needs are and what software they use. If you don’t have access to this information, the proposed testing scope above will suffice for the vast majority of your site or application’s users, and most likely will continue to do so in the years to come.</p></section></article></div>]]>

<blockquote> <em>Odi et amo: quare id faciam fortasse requiris.</em><br><em>Nescio, sed fieri sentio et excrucior.</em> </blockquote>
<p><strong>This simple but heartfelt</strong> couplet (translation above by James Michie in 1969) is the best-known Latin love epigram â€“ a short poem in elegiac metre â€“ that survives from Ancient Rome. Composed by the poet Catullus around <span>55 BCE,</span> <span>number 85</span> of his book of <span>116 poems,</span> it pithily encapsulates the searing conflict of emotions that he claims to be experiencing in the course of his affair with a younger married woman, who is addressed in other poems as his â€˜girlâ€™ (<em>puella</em>) and by the pseudonym â€˜Lesbiaâ€™. But for such a short poem â€“ just 14 words in Latin â€“ it has raised a whole host of questions, and hundreds of pages have been written about it. What is the point of the poem? How should it be translated from the Latin? How does it relate to the poetâ€™s life and feelings? Its psychology comes across as complex and strikingly modern, as does much of Catullusâ€™s poetry; to some, the questions it raises might seem more suited to a post-FreudÂ­ian examination of mental conflict than to the concerns of an ancient poet. We might recognise that the opposite emotions of love and hate can be simultaneously entertained; but how, after all, does that work?</p>
<p>In its original Latin, <span>Poem 85</span> is a so-called elegiac couplet, in which a longer line (hexameter) is followed by a shorter one (pentameter). The words of the poem have been placed with care. The couplet is composed in a criss-cross pattern, beginning and ending with two verbs of intense emotional connotation: <em>odi</em>, â€˜I hateâ€™; and <em>excrucior</em>, â€˜Iâ€™m rackedâ€™. The first line concludes with the questÂ­ioning <em>requiris</em>, â€˜you askâ€™; the second opens with the answer <em>nescio</em>, â€˜I donâ€™t knowâ€™. The middle of the first line has <em>faciam</em>, â€˜I doâ€™; the middle of the second has its passive counterÂ­part <em>fieri</em>, â€˜is being doneâ€™ (related to <em>fiat</em> â€“ literally, â€˜let it be doneâ€™).</p>
<p>The couplet thus mimics by its shape the image of the poet being pulled apart in opposite directions, an image made explicit by the verb <em>excrucior</em>. That word (the root of our â€˜excruciatingâ€™) will have evoked for Romans the noun <em>crux</em> (plural <em>cruces</em>). Although in the <span>1st millennium CE</span> <em>crux</em> came to be heard almost exclusively to mean â€˜crossâ€™ with reference to the crucifixion of Christ, in CatullÂ­usâ€™s time it was more commonly used to signify the â€˜rackâ€™. This was the standard instrument of torture in the Roman world, to which unfortÂ­unate victims were bound by their hands and legs so that their bodies might literally be pulled apart.</p>
<p>While Catullus remains utterly infatuated with Lesbia, she has proved to be <br>distressÂ­ingly fickle to him</p>
<p>No less cruel and visible as a method of executÂ­ion in the Roman world was crucifixion. Catullus was in his teens when in <span>71 BCE</span> the slave-revolt led by Spartacus was quelled, and he would probably have witnessed at first hand the gruesome sight of 6,000 captured slaves being nailed or strung up to die on wooden crosses along the Appian Way leading from Rome to Capua. WhatÂ­ever the precise image intended by Catullus as a parallel to his own feeling of torment, what is evident is that the combination of hate and love, pulling him in different directions, is making him feel as if he is being â€˜racked to deathâ€™: the <em>ex</em> of <em>excrucÂ­ior</em> connotes a process leading towards expiry and extinction, as well as extenÂ­sion â€“ both in time and across space. Moreover, Catullus claims, thereâ€™s nothing he can <em>do</em> about it: heâ€™s simply the object of this torturous and self-contradictory feeling. His response to someone who might wish to enquire (<em>requiÂ­ris</em>) about what heâ€™s â€˜doingâ€™ (<em>faciam</em>) is that heâ€™s not â€˜doingâ€™ anything, but that he senses (<em>sentio</em>) it â€˜being doneâ€™ (<em>fieri</em>) to him: the passive form of the verb corresÂ­ponds to his own passivÂ­ity in the process heâ€™s describing.</p>
<p>However, just before Catullus presents himself as the helpless victim of opposing emotÂ­ions, the answer he gives to the imagined question is unequivocal: â€˜I donâ€™t knowâ€™. The implication of <em>nescio</em> (the negative of <em>scio</em>, â€˜knowâ€™, whence comes our word â€˜scienceâ€™) has been overlooked by generations of translators from the Latin, who have rendered the word <em>quare</em> as â€˜whyâ€™ or â€˜the reason whyâ€™ rather than â€˜howâ€™ â€“ even though itâ€™s clear that Catullus does know, as do his readÂ­ers, why or for what reason heâ€™s prey to emotional conflict. For instance, one of the poemâ€™s earliest English transÂ­lators, the poet Richard Lovelace (1617-57), renders it as:</p>
<blockquote>I hate and love; wouldâ€™st thou the reason know?<br>I know not, but I burn, and feel it so.</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, the translator in the popular Loeb series, which prints classical texts with facing versions in straightforward English, in 1976 had it as:</p>
<blockquote>I hate and love. Why I do so, perhaps you ask? <br>I know not, but I feel it, and I am in torment.</blockquote>
<p>Such translations using â€˜whyâ€™ followed by â€˜I donâ€™t knowâ€™ ask us to suppÂ­ose that Catullus is claiming an inability to understand the reason for his painful emotional turmoil. Yet the poet has already made it abundantly clear, in several other poems describing his affair with Lesbia, that he knows the reason only too well: while he remains utterly infatuated with her, she has proved distressÂ­ingly fickle to him, willing to be unfaithful not only to her husband but to her adultÂ­erous liaison with the poet too. In <span>Poem 72</span> (my translation), Catullus analyses the effect on him of Lesbiaâ€™s infidelity:</p>
<blockquote>You used to say you had eyes for Catullus alone, <br>Lesbia, and would rather hold me in your arms than Jove. <br>My feelings for you then were not just vulgar lust,<br>but the kind of love a father feels for his children and their kin. <br>Now that I know your ways, my desire for you burns ever fiercer,<br>even though youâ€™re far shabbier in my eyes, and flightier. <br>How can this be, you say: itâ€™s because such hurtful treatment <br>is bound to make one desire oneâ€™s lover more, but like them less.</blockquote>
<p>How is it possible, in terms of logic or emotion, to feel both hate and love towards the same person at the same time?</p>
<p>In the final couplet here, Catullus explains to the reader, in terms very similar to those he uses in <span>Poem 85,</span> the paradox of his feelings. The enquirer doesnâ€™t need to ask the cause of the poetâ€™s pain, here described as <em>iniuria</em> (â€˜hurtful treatmentâ€™) because itâ€™s easy to understand: Catullus is wounded by Lesbiaâ€™s sexual intimacy with other lovers and hotly resents her behaviour; but his desire for her, perhaps intensified by the prospect of losing her to a love-rival, is even stronger.</p>
<p><strong>The reader might still </strong>ask how such divergent feelings as love and dislike can coexist in a lover and be directed towards the same object â€“ indeed, the final line above describes someÂ­thing that feels like such an emotional contradiction, the combinÂ­ation of desire with disliking. That divergence is, in <span>Poem 85,</span> yet more starkly expressed with â€˜I hate and loveâ€™ (rendered more emphatically in translations that repeat the â€˜Iâ€™: â€˜I hate and I loveâ€™). But, again, Catullus would expect the reader to ask not â€˜whyâ€™, but â€˜howâ€™; that is, how is it possible, whether in terms of logic or emotion, for someone to feel both hate and love towards the same person at the same time? Since Catullus knows, as do his readers, <em>why</em> heâ€™s prey to these contradictory feelings, only in answer to the question â€˜howâ€™ can it be reasonable for him to follow up, as he does, with â€˜I donâ€™t knowâ€™. Having declared his ignorance of how the perplexing phenomenon of simultaneous opposing emotions can arise, he then abandons analysis and simply testifies to his own torment.</p>
<p>The correctness of the translation of <em>quare</em> as â€˜howâ€™ is confirmed by lexical data. In Catullusâ€™s time and before (as found, for example, in passages written by Catullusâ€™s older contempÂ­orary, the orator Cicero) <em>quare</em> is used to mean â€˜howâ€™ or â€˜in what wayâ€™. It comes to mean â€˜whyâ€™ in the course of the languageâ€™s histÂ­Â­ory; but given the compelling contextual and linguistic arguments for the understanding of what Catullus is asking in <span>Poem 85,</span> what explanation can there be for the persistÂ­ent mistranslation of <em>quare</em> as â€˜whyâ€™ rather than as â€˜howâ€™ in English? (TransÂ­lations into other languages such as Italian, German and French also tend to fluctuate between rendering <em>quare</em> as â€˜whyâ€™ and â€˜howâ€™).</p>
<p>One answer must be that translators have been influenced by a later Latin couplet thatâ€™s as famous as Catullusâ€™s, and indeed alludes to it. A satirical squib <span>(number 32)</span> composed by the poet Martial in the late <span>1st century CE,</span> more than <span>100 years</span> after Catullusâ€™s death, uses the same couplet form:</p>
<blockquote>I donâ€™t like you, Sabidius, and Iâ€™m unable to say why:<br>All I can say is this: I donâ€™t like you.</blockquote>
<blockquote> <em>Non amo te, Sabidi, nec possum dicere quare: </em><br><em>Hoc tantum possum dicere: non amo te</em>.</blockquote>
<p>Nothing is known of the context of the epigram or of the implied feud between the poet and the otherwise unknown Sabidius. But the poem has won a firm, if anecdotal, place in the annals of Latin studies in England. The story (undoubÂ­tedly apocryphal) is told how, as a student at Christ Church College, Oxford, the writer Thomas Brown (1662-1704) committed a misdeÂ­meanour and was sent for punishment to the college dean, a <span>Dr Fell.</span> The dean required Brown to transÂ­late some Latin verse on the spot, and opened a book of epigrams at random to present him with Martialâ€™s couplet. After a momentâ€™s thought, Brown recited, allegedly to the deanâ€™s delight, his witty and memorable version of the poem:</p>
<blockquote>I do not like thee, Doctor Fell, <br>The reason why I cannot tell; <br>But this I know, and know full well, <br>I do not like thee, Doctor Fell.</blockquote>
<p>In the case of Martialâ€™s epigram, â€˜the reason whyâ€™ is a …</p></div></div></div>

<b>Generational references</b> are a new memory management technique that's easy, deterministic, and <i>very</i> fast.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
This technique is the first ingredient in Vale's final <a href="https://vale.dev/blog/hybrid-generational-memory">hybrid-generational memory</a> design, which is even faster. Our eventual goal is to be as fast as Rust, and perhaps even as fast as C++, while being safer than both. <a href="#note0" data-noteid="0">0</a>
</p>
<p>
This article explains how generational references work, how they compare to reference counting, and what makes it all so fast. <a href="#note1" data-noteid="1">1</a>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h2 id="built-on-single-ownership">
 Built on Single Ownership</h2>
<p>
Recall that in Vale, an object is freed when its <b>owning reference</b> goes out of scope. An object always has exactly one owning reference pointing to it.
</p>
<p>
We can have as many <b>non-owning</b> references as we want. <a href="#note2" data-noteid="2">2</a>
</p>
<p>
In other languages, when a programmer frees an object and then accidentally dereferences a non-owning reference to it, it can cause memory unsafety and vulnerabilities. <a href="#note3" data-noteid="3">3</a>
</p>
<p>
Our goal is to detect this situation and react to it safely. <a href="#note4" data-noteid="4">4</a>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h2 id="generational-malloc-and-the-sacred-integer">
 Generational Malloc and the Sacred Integer</h2>
<p>
Generational references use <b>generational malloc</b>, which is like regular malloc, except at the top of every allocation is a <b>generation number</b>, which tracks how many objects have previously been at this memory location.
</p>
<p>
One could also think of it as describing "I am the <b>n</b>th inhabitant of this memory location".
</p>
<p>
Freeing an object will increment its generation number. Nobody else ever modifies it.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Later on, we use this number to see if a particular object is still alive, explained further below.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Generational malloc would normally be an adjustment to mimalloc or jemalloc, but we can simulate it with our own <span>genMalloc</span> and <span>genFree</span> functions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>genFree</span> increments the generation number, and instead of calling <span>free</span> <a href="#note5" data-noteid="5">5</a><a href="#note6" data-noteid="6">6</a>, remembers the allocation in a free-list. There's a free-list for every size class (16b, 24b, 32b, &lt;=48b, &lt;=64b, &lt;=128b, etc).
</li>
<li>
<span>genMalloc</span> pulls from a free-list if possible. If it's empty, it calls <span>malloc</span> and initializes the generation number to 1.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can find our experimental implementation in <a href="https://github.com/ValeLang/Vale/blob/master/Midas/src/builtins/genHeap.c">genHeap.c</a>.

Vale's references are <b>generational references</b>. A generational reference has two things:

To create a reference to an object, we get its allocation's generation number, and include it in the reference.

<p>
To dereference a generational reference, we do a "liveness check" to see whether the allocation's generation number <b>still matches</b> our reference's target generation. <a href="#note7" data-noteid="7">7</a>
</p>
<p>
This prevents use-after-free problems, and makes Vale completely memory safe.

<p>
It's as if the reference is saying:
</p>
<p><b>"Hello! I'm looking for the 11th inhabitant of this house, are they still around?"</b>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
and the person who opens the door says:
</p>
<p><b>"No, sorry, I'm the 12th inhabitant of this house, the 11th inhabitant is no more."</b> <a href="#note8" data-noteid="8">8</a>
</p>
<p>
or instead:
</p>
<p><b>"Yes! That is me. Which of my fields would you like to access?"</b>

 This is similar to the "generational indices" technique from C++ and Rust, but applied to the entire world instead of just a specific vector.

 This will safely halt the program, unless the user is explicitly checking whether something is alive (such as for a weak reference).

Generational references are only the first steps towards hybrid-generational memory, but we decided to run some early experiments to see how it compares to existing memory models.
</p>
<p>
For this experiment, we benchmarked <a href="#note9" data-noteid="9">9</a> <a href="#note10" data-noteid="10">10</a> three flavors of Vale:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Unsafe</b>, with no memory safety, the equivalent of C++ (minus caveats, see below!)
</li>
<li>
<b>RC</b>, where we use naive reference counting for all our objects.
</li>
<li>
<b>GM</b>, which uses generational references.
</li>
</ul>

 Here, we benchmarked against other flavors of Vale, to isolate the differences between unsafe, reference-counting, and generational references.

Once we implement full hybrid-generational memory, we'll be benchmarking against C++ and Rust, stay tuned!

Generational references have only 10.84% overhead, <b>less than half the cost of reference counting!</b> These are very promising results, and suggest that full hybrid-generational memory could be incredibly fast.

Try it out! In the Vale release, you can find a benchmark folder with scripts to run the benchmarks. You can find the source code for the various approaches <a href="https://github.com/ValeLang/Vale/tree/master/Midas/src/c-compiler/region">here</a> (feel free to swing by the <a href="https://discord.gg/SNB8yGH">discord server</a> and we can point you to the right files).

<b>Note these caveats!</b> To isolate the difference between generational references and the other approaches:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
In all flavors, we only allocate objects on the heap, except for primitives. Future versions will add stack allocations.
</li>
<li>
We used <a href="https://github.com/ValeLang/Vale/blob/master/Midas/src/builtins/genHeap.c">genHeap.c</a> for all versions, though only GM ever touches the generation number, the other versions ignore it. Future versions will integrate generational malloc into jemalloc or mimalloc directly.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once we address these limitations, we can get more precise benchmarks against the other approaches.

 Why is this so fast?</h2>

<p>
Generational references are much easier for the CPU to handle than reference-counted references, because:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Generational references have no aliasing/dealiasing overhead, just on dereference.
</li>
<li>
Generational references cause less cache misses.
</li>
<li>
Liveness checks' branching is easier to predict than RC decrements' branching.
</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section>
<p>
We explain these two differences more below.

 No Aliasing Costs</h3>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Reference counting is costly:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Whenever we "alias" (make a new reference to an object), we have to dereference the object to increment its counter.
</li>
<li>
Whenever we "dealias" (throw away a reference), we have to:
</li>
<ul>
<li>
Dereference the object to decrement its counter,
</li>
<li>
If the counter is zero, deallocate it.
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
For example:
</p>

    <div>
      
      <p><span><span>fn <span>launchShip</span><span>(<span><span><span>ships</span></span> <span>&amp;<span><span>Map</span>&lt;<span>int</span>, <span>&amp;<span>Spaceship</span></span>&gt;</span></span></span>, <span><span><span>id</span></span> <span>int</span></span>, <span><span><span>armada</span></span> <span>&amp;<span><span>List</span>&lt;<span>&amp;<span>Spaceship</span></span>&gt;</span></span></span>)</span> <span>{<br>  <span><span><span><span>ship</span></span></span> = <span><span>ships</span><span>.</span><span>get</span>(<span>id</span>)</span></span>;<br>    <p>  <span><span>armada</span><span>.</span><span>add</span>(<span>ship</span>)</span>;</p><p>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>}</p></span></span></span></p>
    </div>
  
<p>
As you can see, reference counting incurs a cost whenever we alias or dealias. <b>Generational references don't have that cost.</b> The above snippet would have zero overhead if it used generational references.
</p>

</section>

      </div>
  


    </div>
    <div>
      <div>
  
<section>
<p>
Instead, generational references incur a cost whenever we dereference an object:
</p>

    <div>
      
      <p><span><span>fn <span>getShipName</span><span>(<span><span><span>ships</span></span> <span>&amp;<span><span>Map</span>&lt;<span>int</span>, <span>&amp;<span>Spaceship</span></span>&gt;</span></span></span>, <span><span><span>id</span></span> <span>int</span></span>)</span> <span><span>str</span> </span><span>{<br>  <span><span><span><span>ship</span></span></span> = <span><span>ships</span><span>.</span><span>get</span>(<span>id</span>)</span></span>;<p>  <br>  <br>  <span>ret <span><span>ship</span><span>.</span><span>name</span></span>;</span><br>}</p></span></span></span></p>
    </div>
  

</section>
<section>
<p>
This is cheaper because <b>programs dereference less than they alias and dealias:</b> our sample program had 4.7 million counter adjustments, but only 1.3 million liveness checks. <a href="#note11" data-noteid="11">11</a> <a href="#note12" data-noteid="12">12</a>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h3 id="more-cache-friendly">
 More Cache Friendly</h3>
<p>
Reference counting is not very "cache friendly". Adding and subtracting integers is basically free on modern CPUs, but the real bottleneck in modern programs is how <i>far</i> those integers are: if it's been recently accessed, it's in the nearby cache, and only takes a few CPU cycles to fetch. Otherwise the CPU will "cache miss" and have to bring it in all the way from RAM, which could take <b>hundreds</b> of cycles. <a href="#note13" data-noteid="13">13</a>
</p>
<p>
In our reference-counted <span>launchShip</span> example, the <span>ship.__ref_count++</span> could take a few cycles if <span>ship</span> is already in the cache, or hundreds of cycles if it's not.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Generational references are more cache friendly:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
When a generational reference goes away, we don't need to reach into memory (unlike RC, where we have to decrement a counter).
</li>
<li>
We don't need to increment when aliasing (see previous section); we don't need to reach into memory to increment.
</li>
</ul>

</section>

      </div>
  
<div>

      <div>
        <div>
    
<div id="note11" data-noteid="11">
<p><span>11</span></p><section>
<p>
 Half of these are aliasings and half are dealiasings. Aliasing happens whenever we access a member (e.g. <span>person.name</span>) or make a new reference (e.g. <span>&amp;person</span>).
</p>

</section>
</div>
<div id="note12" data-noteid="12">
<p><span>12</span></p><section>
<p>
 Many languages are able to skip a lot of the adjustments, using static analysis. For example, Lobster can remove up to 95%. Our experiment doesn't have those optimizations; it compares naive RC to naive generational references.
