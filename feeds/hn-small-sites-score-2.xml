<article>
<p><span>At the beginning of 2019 StorageOS embarked on a significant development effort to build v2.0 of our product. The cloud native landscape had significantly changed since the inception and subsequent release of StorageOS v1.0, with Kubernetes emerging from the container orchestrator battle royale as the clear winner. We observed two key trends amongst our customers and the industry in general.</span></p>
<p><span>Firstly, customers wanted to run bigger clusters – in the 10’s or even 100’s of nodes. Secondly, customers wanted to run multiple clusters and for the clusters to interact in various patterns. We designed StorageOS 2.0 to address these trends.</span></p>
<p><span>Given the significant development effort to create StorageOS v2.0, we wanted to ensure the testing toolkit and workflow we used was up to the task of verifying our reliability and scalability. At StorageOS, product testing is undertaken by the Product Reliability Engineering (PRE) team, and we tasked ourselves with engineering a new testing framework and suite of tests to do justice to the product the company was building.</span></p>
<p><span>Our previous testing framework (known internally as ‘vol-test’) was based around a set of libraries and scripting tools that included the ability to provision a variety of environments on a variety of platforms for the tests to run in. Vol-test also included functional, end to end, stress and benchmarking tests for the StorageOS API as well as StorageOS running in Kubernetes.</span></p>
<p><span>While feature rich, we often found ourselves wanting a more expressive language and toolset. Additionally, the provisioning and testing functions were closely coupled – which made the system inconvenient to work with at times. We staged our own version of the perennial engineering ‘re-write or improve’ debate and settled on separating the testing and provisioning functions and focusing on a better way to write and execute tests. What we ended up with was three systems:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>T2Infra – </span><i><span>a provisioning framework for creating reproducible environments quickly</span></i></li>
<li><span>T2 – </span><i><span>a testing framework and suite of tests to verify StorageOS behaviour and API outside of Kubernetes</span></i></li>
<li><span>Kubecover – </span><i><span>a testing framework and suite of tests to run within Kubernetes</span></i></li>
</ul>
<p><span>A major consideration was what language to create the new testing frameworks in. The two languages that we considered were Python and Golang; the former due to ease of use and our team’s familiarity with it and the latter because Kubernetes and surrounding projects are often written in Golang. Perhaps more importantly, much of StorageOS is written in Golang too.</span></p>
<p><span>The use of a common language between our Reliability Engineers and our Software Engineering colleagues is a great advantage when testing, as it allows for closer collaboration and tightened development cycles. The static typing and easily accomplished concurrency that Golang offered has been extremely welcomed and has helped to drive development of significantly more complex tests at a significantly reduced cost.</span></p>
<p><b>T2Infra – Fast environment provisioning using Ignite/Firecracker</b></p>
<p><span>T2Infra is a provisioning framework that lets us stand up testing environments quickly. We generally run our tests on </span><a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/"><span>Firecracker</span></a> <span>VMs (for more information about Firecracker check out this </span><a href="https://unixism.net/2019/10/how-aws-firecracker-works-a-deep-dive/"><span>blog </span></a><span>by Shuveb Hussain) by leveraging the </span><a href="https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite"><span>Ignite</span></a> <span>project from our good friends at </span><a href="https://www.weave.works/"><span>Weave</span></a><span>. In essence, Ignite provisions Firecracker virtual machines that run StorageOS containers. That seems like a lot of layers of abstraction but this combination of tooling gives us; highly reproducible, quick to provision, isolated environments for running tests.</span></p>
<p><span>These qualities are important to us as a reproducible environment translates directly into more deterministic tests, while fast provisioning times allow us to spin up a fresh environment for every test. Using a new environment per test means that tests do not “cross-contaminate” one another further increasing the reliability of our tests.</span></p>
<p><b>T2 – Testing outside of Kubernetes</b></p>
<p><span>T2 is a testing framework that was created to test and verify the behaviours of StorageOS while driving StorageOS via its API. The framework consists of libraries to access the StorageOS API, to cause various kinds of ‘chaos’, provide test orchestration functions, and of course, the tests themselves.</span></p>
<p><span>Because we are using lightweight VMs, we have familiar tools available to us for introducing controlled disruption into the test environment. For example we leverage </span><a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/iptables"><span>IPTables</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/ipset"><span>IPSet</span></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/tc"><span>TC</span></a> <span>to cause network partitions, inject latency and restrict bandwidth between nodes. These tools are controlled via the T2 framework during test runtime so changes are entirely dynamic.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For additional insight into the test environment, it is important to collect both logs and traces from inside our VMs. Running additional containers inside the VMs such as the </span><a href="https://www.jaegertracing.io/"><span>Jaeger</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.fluentd.org/"><span>Fluentd</span></a> <span>agents for collecting traces and logs is simple to do with systemd manifests. As each test spins up its own environment it is easy to collect and separate traces and logs from different tests. For more insight into how important tracing is for understanding a distributed system </span><a href="https://dgraph.io/blog/post/solving-jepsen-with-opencensus"><span>Manish Rai Jain from Dgraph</span></a><span> wrote an interesting blog about how he used tracing and Jaeger to squash a bug exposed by </span><a href="https://jepsen.io/"><span>Jepsen</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><b>Kubecover – Adding Kubernetes to the mix</b></p>
<p><span>While T2 is useful for testing StorageOS in a dedicated, predictable environment, the final arbiter of StorageOS as a product is of course how we behave within Kubernetes – since this is how our customers run our product.</span></p>
<p><span>Kubecover is a testing framework written in Golang that uses the </span><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go"><span>Kubernetes </span></a><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go"><span>Golang</span></a> <span>client directly as well as the </span><a href="https://github.com/storageos/go-api/tree/master/v2"><span>StorageOS API</span> <span>Client</span></a> <span>to drive tests of StorageOS within Kubernetes clusters. Our Kubecover framework leverages great work by </span><a href="https://github.com/darkowlzz/"><span>darkowlzz</span></a> <span>to make </span><a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/"><span>Kubernetes in Docker</span></a><span> (Kind) work with Ignite as a backend instead of Docker. The changes allow us to spin up a Kind cluster with each Kind “node” running on a separate Ignite provisioned Firecracker VM. The advantage of using Kind is that we can spin up local and test environments in a matter of seconds.</span></p>
<p><span>Given the many popular Kubernetes distributions that exist we can also use Kubecover binaries in testing pipelines that run against other Kubernetes distributions. For example we routinely run tests against managed Kubernetes services such as AKS and EKS, as well as various versions of upstream Kubernetes running on cloud infrastructure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Why have two separate testing frameworks?</b></p>
<p><span>The reason for having two separate test frameworks is separation of concerns. T2 is for end to end testing of the StorageOS container, driven via the StorageOS API, while Kubecover is for testing StorageOS integration with, and behaviours in Kubernetes, driven via the </span><a href="https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/01/15/container-storage-interface-ga/"><span>CSI</span></a><span> interface. Kubernetes adds layers of abstraction that are not always helpful in the end to end testing of StorageOS, so testing StorageOS behaviour is something we generally handle in T2. Testing of Kubernetes specific behaviours then takes place in Kubecover. In general our approach is to first verify the StorageOS API behaviour before adding testing of behaviours running StorageOS in Kubernetes.</span></p>
<p><span>For a more specific example of how we make these distinctions, consider testing of volume resize. We first tested volume resize in T2 to verify that the StorageOS API is behaving correctly and the feature works as we expect it to. Once the correct behaviour was verified, we wrote tests in Kubecover to ensure that CSI resize requests were also being handled correctly. The resize requests in Kubernetes are generated by editing the size of a Persistent Volume Claim so requests come via the CSI API.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>How do we spec our tests?</b></p>
<p><span>In order to have a consistent and clear description each test gets its own </span><a href="https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/"><span>Gherkin</span></a> <span>spec, so the test is described in a </span><span>`GIVEN, WHEN, THEN`</span><span> syntax. The test spec should give the reader a clear indication of what the test is going to do and provides context for the test code itself. Having a consistent approach to documenting our tests has made it easy for anyone in our team to triage a test failure and understand what the test is doing. This approach is particularly helpful when it comes to more complex test cases.</span></p>
<p><span>Typically we begin spec’ing out tests by following the “happy path”. For example the “happy path” spec for resizing a volume looks like the below:</span></p>
<pre><span>GIVEN an unattached volume of size x</span>

<span>WHEN the volume is resized to size y where y is greater than x</span>

<span>THEN the volume will display its new size</span>

<span>AND the block device size will reflect this size</span>

<span>AND the filesystem will reflect a new larger size</span></pre>
<p><span>The happy path test is important as it proves that the feature works as expected. The next priority is an “unhappy path” test that proves the API is not just accepting and actioning any and all requests, whether valid or not.</span></p>
<pre><span>GIVEN an unattached volume of size x</span>

<span>WHEN the volume is resized to size y where y is less than or equal to x</span>

<span>THEN the resize will fail with an easy to understand error</span></pre>
<p><span>Once a happy and unhappy path has been set we investigate cases where failure is assumed. For example in cases of concurrent requests, it is important that we only action the first, and error the rest, as detailed in the following spec:</span></p>
<pre><span>GIVEN an unattached volume of size x</span>

<span>WHEN two concurrent resize requests are made to size y and size z</span>

<span>THEN only one resize will be actioned</span>

<span>AND the other request will receive an error response</span>

</pre>
<p><span>As the StorageOS control plane guarantees linearisable volume updates, one of the concurrent resize requests will fail because each resize request will be using the same volume object version. The first request to reach the API will cause a version bump so the subsequent request will be failed. However there are also linearisable operations that we verify work as intended, such as having </span><a href="https://docs.storageos.com/docs/concepts/replication/#delta-sync"><span>replicas rejoin</span></a> <span>while a resize is occurring. Once the replicas have rejoined they should also reflect the new size of the volume.</span></p>
<p><b>How we run our tests</b></p>
<p><span>We run all of the tests in T2 against development containers throughout the day. …</span></p></article></div></div></div></div>

            <h2>Important &amp; Helpful Notes</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Never use a custom domain name - these require some of your personal information when being registered. Even with whois privacy protection, certain law enforcement can demand for these credentials.</li>
                <li>Feel free to use a VPN, though Tor is more than enough for your needs.</li>
                <li>Whenever you boot Tails OS, it will load with a fresh install. To keep files on the USB even when shutdown, look into using <a href="https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/persistence/index.en.html">Encrypted Persistent Storage </a>. Please note: <i>this is not recommended</i> for obvious security risks.</li>
                <li>Run your articles through multiple translation converters. Edit minor mistakes afterwards. This avoids engines and tools picking up on your writing style.</li>
                <li>Always backup your articles. The safest bet is to use <a href="https://archive.org/">archive.org</a></li>
                <li>Don't expect to collect revenue with your blog. It is extremely difficult to accept payment without some form of tracking to your personal information. If anything, maybe allow your users to donate to a charity you would like to support.</li>
                <li>WordPress is the suggested blog platform but there are others to choose from:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://write.as/">Write.as</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Try your best to avoid publishing articles on your home or work network. Make a trip to the local coffee shop during busy hours and post it then.</li>
                <li>Randomly select different times to publish articles. Avoid creating a trackable pattern.</li>
                <li>Never work on anything related to your blog unless using the burner laptop and Tails OS. This might seem simple, but one little slip-up is all it takes.</li>

July 10, 2020 | http://steen.free.fr/interslavic/slovianto1.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://steen.free.fr/interslavic/slovianto1.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><b>Slovianto</b> is a highly simplified form of Interslavic that allows non-Slavic people to express themselves at a very basic level when visiting Slavic countries or maintaining contact with Slavs via the Internet. Grammar is limited to a bare minimum, and forms that are not strictly necessary are not used at all. Because it does not contain anything that cannot be found in the Slavic languages, the result wil not look or sound too awkward to Slavic speakers, but rather remind them of the kind of language used by small children.</p><p>Slovianto can also be used as a first step in the process of learning the „real” Interslavic language. It has been constructed in such way that it can gradually be expanded with new bits and pieces that occur in more complex versions. Thus, we distinguish three different levels, each of them adding new elements that bring Slovianto closer to Interslavic:
</p><p>The working title <b>Slovianto</b> is a portmanteau word for „Slavic Esperanto”. This name, albeit somewhat tongue-in-cheek, refers to the simplicity of Slovianto: it has no gender, no cases, no aspect, little conjugation and no irregularity. Yet, that is where the similarity to Esperanto ends, because Slovianto's means of simplification are in fact far more similar to those used by Interlingua.</p><p>Slovianto can be written in the Latin alphabet and the Cyrillic alphabet, but we will concentrate on the Latin alphabet here:

</p><p>In the <a href="http://steen.free.fr/interslavic/en-ms.html">Interslavic dictionary</a> you will find other characters as well, like <b>ò</b>, <b>ų</b>, <b>å</b> or <b>ť</b>. You can simply ignore the diacritics and read them as <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, <b>a</b>, <b>t</b> etc. That goes for <b>ě</b>, too. The only characters that keep their diacritics in Latin orthography are <b>č</b>, <b>š</b> and <b>ž</b>. If you find writing them inconvenient, you can always use <b>cz</b>, <b>sz</b> and <b>zs</b> (or <b>cx</b>, <b>sx</b> and <b>zx</b>) as an alternative.</p><p>Accentuation is fairly free. What matters more is that you speak slowly and clearly. As a general guideline, it would deserve recommendation to put stress on the antepenultimate syllable.</p><div width="90%"><tbody><tr><td>

							<p>PARIS — The French Parliament unanimously agreed on Thursday to introduce a nationwide age verification system for pornography websites, months after President Emmanuel Macron pledged to protect children against such content.</p>
<p>Macron made the protection of children against adult content online a high-profile issue well before the coronavirus crisis hit. In January, tech companies, internet services providers and the adult movies industry <a href="https://www.lefigaro.fr/secteur/high-tech/les-fournisseurs-d-acces-des-acteurs-du-web-et-marc-dorcel-s-engagent-pour-proteger-les-mineurs-du-porno-20200117" target="_blank">signed a voluntary charter</a>, pledging to roll out tools to help ensure minors don’t have access to pornographic content.</p>
<p>Within a broader law on domestic violence, the Senate decided <a href="https://www.publicsenat.fr/article/parlementaire/porno-le-senat-bloque-l-accessibilite-des-sites-aux-mineurs-183097" target="_blank">in June</a> to introduce an amendment requiring pornography websites to implement an age verification mechanism.</p>
<p>In order to enforce the law, the French audiovisual regulator CSA will be granted new powers to audit and sanction companies that do not comply — sanctions could go as far as blocking access to the websites in France with a court order.</p>
<p>The choice of verification mechanisms will be left up to the platforms. But lawmakers have suggested using credit card verification — a system first adopted by the U.K., which mulled similar plans to control access to pornography but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/oct/16/uk-drops-plans-for-online-pornography-age-verification-system" target="_blank">had to drop them</a> in late 2019 because of technical difficulties and privacy concerns. Italy also approved a <a href="https://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/eli/gu/2020/06/29/162/sg/pdf" target="_blank">similar bill in late June</a>, which raised the same concerns over its feasibility and <a href="https://www.key4biz.it/filtro-anti-porno-nicita-agcom-limiti-tecnici-norma-pillon-a-rischio-disapplicazione/312167/" target="_blank">compliance with the EU laws</a>.</p>
<p>As private actors could implement their own solutions, the new law also highlights the challenges of digital identification. In Brussels, there are growing calls to introduce an EU-wide digital ID system that would allow users to bypass Google and Facebook’s identification ecosystem. For politicians, including French Junior Digital Minister Cédric O, systems of identification online are <a href="https://www.zdnet.fr/actualites/identite-numerique-le-cnnum-veut-soutenir-l-effort-deja-engage-par-le-gouvernement-39905257.htm" target="_blank">a matter of digital sovereignty</a>.</p>
<p>The Senate has already voted on the bill. Following an agreement today between senators and lawmakers from the lower house National Assembly, a final vote will be held again in the Senate where the bill is expected to pass.</p>
<p>Senators have also suggested using FranceConnect, a tool developed by the state to help users connect to public services such as tax collection and health insurance.</p>
<p>In the face of skepticism and privacy concerns from campaigners, O has since <a href="https://www.zdnet.fr/actualites/identite-numerique-le-cnnum-veut-soutenir-l-effort-deja-engage-par-le-gouvernement-39905257.htm" target="_blank">denied</a> that the national connection tool would be used.</p>
<p>"We voted on one principle, which is to give the CSA the obligation to monitor the protection of minors, but the CSA is free to find the right way for sites to comply with their injunction," the text’s rapporteur in the Senate Marie Mercier told POLITICO.</p>
<h3><strong>Minitel rose</strong></h3>
<p>Key actors from the French porn industry have long called for new measures to modernize a French law which was drafted at the time of the “Minitel rose,” a very popular pornography service in the 1980s.</p>
<p>“[With this law] we can already fine up to 75,000 euros and three years of prison, but no one applies it,” said Mercier.</p>
<p>The conservative politician worked on the amendment after hearings with French pornography producer Marc Dorcel, ex-adult actress-turned-documentary-director Ovidie and child protection NGOs.</p>
<p>“Most of those who abide by the law feel that it’s unfair that the [sites] keep doing their business without restriction," Mercier added.</p>
<p>For years, one of the most difficult tasks for French regulators has been finding a way to enforce local laws on foreign services.</p>
<p>With this new law, if the site does not comply within 15 days after a first warning from the audiovisual regulator CSA, the regulator will be able to ask the Paris Court of Justice to send an order to telecom operators to block the access to these sites from France.</p>

        <p><i>posted on 29 May 2020</i></p><p>Yes, you read it right! Don’t let the feature requests you receive from your customers drive your product roadmap. Instead, let the real problems they are facing do.</p>

<p>Nearly 4 years ago, when I had just transitioned from engineering to product management here is how I used to respond to one of the most important questions that you get asked as a product manager.</p>

<p><a href="https://akshayd.in/2020/05/29/Don-t-let-feature-requests-from-your-customers-drive-your-product-roadmap!/">Read More</a></p>

<!--more-->

<p><span>Question</span> - Why do you think this feature should be on the roadmap? <br>
<span>Answer</span> - Because customers XYZ and ABC have asked for it
</p>
<p>It sounds naive in the hindsight but I’ve cut myself some slack given it was my first time as a product manager.</p>

<p>Sometimes, we as product managers consider the number of customers that have asked for a particular feature as a parameter to add weight to the decision of adding it to the roadmap. However, it is easy to fall prey to this vanity metric by right away acknowledging the feature request as a gap in your offering that needs to be filled without analysing the feature request thoroughly. Analysing your customers’ feature requests in a proper manner will help you identify the right set of problems your customers are facing. Many times, you will realize that the problem does not have to be solved by the exact feature the customers are suggesting.</p>

<p>While there are numerous ways in which one could dissect the feature request , the <a href="https://hbr.org/2012/02/the-5-whys.html"><b>FIVE WHYS framework</b></a> provides a simple and effective way of getting to the core of the problem.  The 5 Whys framework is an iterative interrogation technique to determine the root cause of the problem by repeatedly asking the question -  “Why” . Here is an example of my recent experience of using this framework to address a customer’s feature request.</p>

<div>
<p><span>Customer</span> : We’d like an API endpoint to fetch the loyalty information of users. </p><p>
<span>Me</span>: Could you please let us know why you would want an API endpoint since you already have this information in the members’ report? </p><p>
<span>Customer</span> :   We’d like to build an automated process of getting the information via an API every night and dump that information at an FTP location ?</p><p>
<span>Me</span> : Alright, sounds good. Could you please tell me why you would want to dump this information at an FTP location ?  What happens after you dump it to FTP location.</p><p> 
<span>Customer</span> : We have crons that would read the information and sync the information with the contacts in Hubspot CRM . </p><p>
<span>Me</span> : Okay. Why do you sync the loyalty information in Hubspot ? </p><p>
<span>Customer</span> :  We want to use the loyalty information to be included in the marketing emails that we send.</p><p>
<span>Me</span> : We already have Hubspot integration underway exactly for this use case. Every time the loyalty information of the user changes, the change will be synced with the Hubspot user profile automatically with the integration. You could then set triggers in Hubspot to send out emails with the loyalty information. 
</p></div>

<p>In the above example, although it seemed like a feature request for a new API endpoint, the ultimate job that the customer was looking to get done with this API was to include the loyalty information in the marketing emails sent via Hubspot. The actual problem was unearthed by repeatedly asking the question “Why”. Evidently, the plethora of information this framework gives you as you go deeper layer by layer not only helps you reach to the core of the problem but also gives you holistic insights about it. You may choose any other framework that helps with problem analysis. The bottomline is to ensure that you thoroughly understand the rationale behind the feature request.</p>

<p>Customers will often ask you the world. More often than not, the feature requests your customers raise if considered verbatim, have the potential to derail your product strategy. Tending to such feature requests without peeling the layers of the onion may help you pacify a couple of customers but will harm your product in the long run. For a winning product strategy , it is very imperative to choose solving those problems that align with your product and company goals.</p>

<p>After all , effective product management is not just about solving problems but about choosing  the right set of problems to solve.</p>

<p>This has been an interesting year! When the pandemic came and left us all housebound, I used it as an excuse to do some remedial work I’d been dreading—moving Pinboard onto modern versions of PHP and MySQL. Things had gotten to the point where I couldn’t even run a bug-for-bug identical copy of the site on a modern laptop, and the servers themselves were overdue for system upgrades. 

</p><p>Much of the core code on the site dated back to 2009-2010 and was written by Past Me, a vindictive, inscrutable nemesis who devoted his life to sabotaging Present Me. 

</p><p><img src="https://idlewords.com/images/past_me.jpg">

</p><p><i>Past Me laying his snares in 2009.</i></p>

<p>Doing this on a live system is like performing kidney transplants on a playing mariachi band. The best case is that no one notices a change in the music; you chloroform the players one at a time and try to keep a steady hand while the band plays on.  The worst case scenario is that the music stops and there is no way to unfix what you broke, just an angry mob. It is very scary.

</p><p>But I got it done! It helped in this process that I was in Japan, since I could do most work at night while my US/European customers slept or wept into their phones or whatever it is people do at night nowadays. 

</p><p>The site is now on a 2020 foundation (specifically, it’s on PHP 7 and a current MySQL), and with everything less brittle I can start making bigger changes. One of those is to make the site look okay on mobile phones, now that I’m finally convinced they aren’t a fad. You can see the beginnings of this reworking on the <a href="https://pinboard.in/about/">about page</a> and in other corners of the site.

</p><p>Another is to finish the new API. The current one was designed to be a drop-in replacement for the old Delicious API and lacks important features, like any way to say “show me stuff that has changed since timestamp X”, or interact with Pinboard features that weren’t present in Delicious.

</p><p>Another analogy I’d use for this kind of upgrade work is clearing a disused garden. In the process you may unearth remarkable stuff—an old wagon wheel, a Roman urn—hiding among the weeds. But it’s mostly interesting to you, and not to the people who are waiting in line at your vegetable stand.

</p><p>In my case, I found the skeletons of dead features (remember placemarks?) as well as spectral ghosts of defunct services like Google Reader, Readability, and of course Delicious itself, which now slumbers peacefully while I try to figure out a way to bring it up without dealing with the waves of automated spam still pointed at the site. But I’ll save that for another post.

</p><p>Now that I have a fresher memory of how the site works, and am not so afraid of touching anything, I look forward to doing some long-delayed feature development.
 
</p><p>Meanwhile, thanks to everyone for using the site for another year! Not everyone gets to be around long enough to have to do major upgrades, and I am grateful to be in that position, thanks to all of you.

<p>Another new blog on the internet – aren’t there already enough of
those? <a href="http://tttthis.com/blog/if-i-could-bring-one-thing-back-to-the-internet-it-would-be-blogs">Some would say
no</a>.
I, for one, am a fan of the open, interoperable, indie web,
even if that seems to stack the cards against you.<sup id="fnref:indie-disadvantage"><a href="#fn:indie-disadvantage">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I’ll keep this introductory post brief. We<sup id="fnref:we"><a href="#fn:we">2</a></sup> want to start a SaaS
product, and while there seem to be awfully many “founder stories”
around of people magically getting 50k downloads, $10k MRR, etc., we
don’t often hear about the long, rocky path to sustainable success.
There’s often scant detail about the initial steps: ideation,
validation, etc. Also, all these whiz-bang success stories suffer
from enormous survivorship bias. Not to mention they leave us normal
folks feeling quite inadequate, when in reality there’s enormous luck
involved, too.<sup id="fnref:luck"><a href="#fn:luck">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Unfortunately, “failure” isn’t sexy. As a result there seem to be few
resources online talking about the things people have tried that
<em>haven’t</em> worked. We want to take a more optimistic view. From each
“failure” we hope to learn things, get better at what we’re trying to
do, so that 10 years from now, looking back, we can point at all the
hustle that goes into trying to Build Something.</p>
<p>We figured we might as well challenge ourselves to get something out
there, right now, instead of waiting until perhaps one day if and/or
when we manage to create something successful. This way, at the very
least we’re keeping ourselves accountable by publicly writing about
what we’re trying, and who knows, we might be able to say something
that someone somewhere finds useful. We’re also very keen for
feedback, so any and all input is more than welcome. Ideas, critique,
links to resources, we want it, our inboxes are open. Have a look at
the <a href="https://exsaasperated.com/contact/">Contact us page</a> if you want to get in touch, or try our
low-budget comments box down below!</p>
<p>We’re just trying to muddle along making our own way here, so we’re
bound to have many a false start, but we are trying something new to
us – <a href="https://exsaasperated.com/mailing-list/">join us for the ride</a>, and we’ll see what happens!</p>

  </div>
</div>


<p>The COVID-19 crisis has put a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/business/economy/coronavirus-inequality.html">spotlight</a> on the dramatic growth of inequality, with the wealthy able to take refuge in holiday homes while many workers living paycheck to paycheck cannot afford to socially isolate. Somewhere in between are middle-class families that have been mostly able to ride out the storm by staying inside but at the same time are becoming increasingly aware of how precarious their security — financial and otherwise — really is.</p>



<p>Over the previous decade, no book has done more than Thomas Piketty’s “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” to bring the question of economic inequality back on the public agenda. At the core of Piketty’s argument is the famous formula “r &gt; g,” which he takes to be the central law of capitalism. Now emblazoned on t-shirts and coffee mugs, the formula expresses the idea that, in the absence of remedial state intervention, the return on capital (r) will grow faster than the economy (g).</p>



<p>Piketty tells the story of the runaway (and accelerating) growth of wealth at the very top, which is not in doubt. As governments eased post-World War II financial regulations over the past few decades, unrestrained capitalism created returns on assets that grew at far higher rates than GDP.</p>



<p>Where Piketty’s story is less convincing is in explaining how this trend continues in spite of growing discontent and widespread awareness of its harmful consequences. Piketty claims that the concentration of private wealth has led to the growth of a plutocracy: the concentration of political influence in the hands of the super-wealthy. But this isn’t an explanation; it just raises other questions, like why do electorates keep voting governments into office that facilitate this concentration of wealth? It is strange to see an otherwise politically middle-of-the-road scholar like Piketty embrace what is essentially a crude Marxist understanding of the capitalist state as a plaything in the hands of the wealthy.</p>



<p>The sustained acceleration of wealth at the top in a democratic society is only comprehensible if we recognize that this trend has been embedded in a wider middle-class politics that has come to center on housing and, in particular, property inflation.</p>

      “As other flagship projects of the neoliberal era floundered, the politics of middle-class aspiration came to increasingly revolve around homeownership.”    </p>

    
    
  </div>
</div>




<p>During the mid-20th century, Anglo-American countries, in particular, managed to promote widespread homeownership through a variety of policies. This <span data-note="John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) was a British economist famous for his theories of government influence on business and the economy; he argued that fiscal regulation is necessary to maintain stable economic growth.">Keynesian</span> model of capitalism brought property ownership into reach for those without access to inherited wealth. Being a wage-earner (someone who, in Marx’s famous phrase, has nothing but his labor-power to sell) was no longer a condition that condemned people to a marginal existence based on getting by from day to day. It was now a social status that could give people a concrete stake in the capitalist social order. Although this state of affairs was characterized by pernicious gender and racial hierarchies, the creation of a broad-based middle class should nonetheless be seen as a unique historic achievement.</p>



<p>The Keynesian model worked on the basis of steady annual wage growth. As the post-war era progressed, this became associated with consumer price inflation that eroded the value of assets. Neoliberalism always had its own, distinctive middle-class politics that centered on the idea of an ownership society. The supply-side doctrine of trickle-down economics was only the crudest expression of an ideology of democratized capital that was integral to the entire project of neoliberal capitalism. Inclusion in the benefits of capitalism was to come not from state protections and the power of unions but from full commitment to the spirit of entrepreneurialism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was among the first to understand the emotional appeal of that prospect when, in the midst of her attacks on unions and the public sector, she offered working-class residents the opportunity to buy the homes they had until then rented from the public sector. This, it was hoped, would serve as a buy-in to the psychology of investment and encourage ordinary people to see themselves as asset-holders rather than workers.</p>

      “In many large cities, it is virtually impossible to break into the property market just on the basis of an average wage.”    </p>

    
    
  </div>
</div>




<p>The ideology of democratized capital found expression in three key areas: pensions, human capital and housing. The risks associated with pension privatization were never lost on people, but the upward march of stock markets for much of the 1990s refocused attention on the seemingly boundless opportunities offered there. But as stock markets fizzled in the early 2000s, dreams of pension-fund capitalism largely faded along with them. Dreams of human capital too reached their zenith in the 1990s, when <span data-note="“Third way” ideas emphasize moderate social, political and economic policies to reconcile left-wing and right-wing political partisanship. Key “third way” politicians include Bill Clinton and Tony Blair.">“third way”</span> thinking in the context of the <span data-note="The idea of a “new economy” arose during the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s to refer to the transition from a manufacturing-based economy to one driven by services and information technology.">“new economy”</span> held out the prospect that highly skilled knowledge workers could monetize their educational assets.</p>



<p>It is really only in the area of housing that the promise of democratized asset ownership found lasting traction. Success in this area derived in large part from the fact that it could build directly on the legacy of democratized homeownership left by the Keynesian era. Liberalizing credit markets appeared to be the most readily available way to push homeownership rates up further. The upward pressure on house prices that this entailed initially led primarily to a democratization of the <span data-note="The “wealth effect” is the change in spending that occurs when people perceive that their wealth has increased.">“wealth effect,”</span> which also became an important source of economic growth.</p>



<p>Over time, it became tempting for governments to respond to each economic slowdown by boosting the housing market, in the process creating an economy that was more and more dependent on stimulus from the wealth effect of asset inflation. As other flagship projects of the neoliberal era floundered, the politics of middle-class aspiration came to increasingly revolve around homeownership.</p>

<p>The home became an asset rather than simply property — an investment that was expected not merely to generate returns but also capital gains. As people with stagnant wages and unstable employment bought houses with large amounts of debt, it became more and more important for those houses to appreciate in value. At least initially, this wealth effect helped to compensate for stagnant wages. The Keynesian household became a <span data-note="Hyman Minsky was an American economist who lived from 1919 to 1996. He is often referred to as a “post-Keynesian” economist, and his work stresses the role of uncertainty, speculation and debt in the economic system.">Minskyan</span> household, increasingly dependent on the speculative returns on its investment. Capitalism itself transitioned to a Minskyan phase, where the continued appreciation of an asset was a precondition for being able to finance it.</p>



<p>But of course, the very logic of credit-driven home purchases pushed prices up to heights where it was increasingly difficult to enter the market. Property inflation benefits the already propertied and excludes aspiring middle-class households from the housing market. In the U.S. as well as in other countries, including the U.K. and Canada, homeownership rates show a particular pattern over the period from 1980 to 2020 — an upward trend followed by a downward trend. Property inflation over time eroded the possibility of buying a home on the basis of a wage alone. In many large cities, it is virtually impossible to break into the property market just on the basis of an average wage.</p>



<p>The crisis of 2007-8 did significant damage to the reputation of housing as a democratic generator of wealth, but things have become significantly worse since then. Defying widespread expectations, housing markets in large urban centers rebounded with a vengeance. This has raised the bar for entry dramatically: The same salary that would have allowed someone to buy into the property market 10 years ago no longer allows that, because in some places, property prices have doubled in the meantime.</p>

    <p>
      “Housing inflation has built a new class structure that revolves around asset ownership instead of employment.”    </p>

    
    
  </div>
</div>




<p>The post-crisis era has also exposed a generational rift. The consequences of property inflation are felt particularly acutely by millennials. Many members of that generation played by all the rules yet, by their mid-20s, still find themselves without any real prospect of a middle-class existence — unless, of course, they have wealthy parents willing to help. Because property gets passed from one generation to the next, it makes little sense to frame the problem in terms of boomers against millennials. The millennial phenomenon is so important because it is in that age cohort that the fault lines produced by four decades of sustained property inflation are becoming highly visible.</p>



<p>This has hardly gone unnoticed, but widespread concerns have yet to translate into significant policy changes. Policymakers and politicians are increasingly concerned about issues of housing affordability, but any policies designed to address the problem are inevitably double-edged: Measures, like lower interest rates, that bring property ownership into reach for some simultaneously push prices up further. In other words, we face a situation of policy lock-in, whereby policymakers can only improve things in the short term by making them worse in the long term.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I see a common pattern with startups and teams I’ve advised or been a part of. I call it the Software Over-specification Death Spiral, or SODS for short.</p>



<p>It looks like this:</p>



<ol><li>Product Manager (or CEO, Engineering Manager, etc) drafts up some sort of specifications or requirements for a new feature or product.</li><li>Product Manager (or CEO, Engineering Manager, etc) drafts up some sort of specifications or requirements for a new feature or product.</li><li>The requirements are handed over to the engineering team to implement.</li><li>The engineering team “implements” it, but gets some things wrong. One bucket of things that are prone to being wrong could be things that were so obvious that the PM thought they weren’t worth making explicit. Another bucket are corner or edge-cases that the PM didn’t think of.</li><li>The PM is surprised at this, and work has to be redone.</li><li>In an effort to prevent this in the future, both the PM and the engineering team agree that requirements need to be more detailed.</li><li>Surprise: despite the increased details in requirements, the engineering team still gets it wrong.</li></ol>



<p>In each iteration of this loop, everyone agrees the requirements just need more details, but every time that happens, things are still wrong. What’s going on?</p>



<h4>Breeding Code&nbsp;Monkeys</h4>



<p>You’re breeding code monkeys, is what’s happening. Software is complex and malleable, and no set of specifications or requirements will ever be complete. There will always be behavior that requires some “filling in the blanks” at implementation time. The person doing the implementation needs to be able to either:</p>



<ul><li>Recognize when they should ask for clarification, or, preferably,</li><li>Be able to fill-in-the-blanks correctly.</li></ul>



<p>Counterintuitively, once you have this problem, the more you try to weed out ambiguity in requirements, the more likely you are cause <em>the opposite</em> effect of what you’ve want. Engineers turn off the part of their brain that they would use to think through product decisions, and become, essentially, “code monkeys” that just do what they’re told.</p>



<h4>A Better&nbsp;Way</h4>



<p>Does that mean you shouldn’t write specifications or requirements, or you should right <em>less? </em>Well, let’s not throw the baby out with the bathwater just yet. Specifications are important, but if you’re missing key pieces, they can make your problem worse.</p>



<p>At a high-level, when you’re building software, there are three questions to answer:</p>



<ol><li>What the software does—requirements and behavior</li><li>Why it does what it does—actual problem it solves for its users</li><li>How it does what it does—the actual implementation</li></ol>



<p>These three are all related. SODS occurs when engineers try to do #1 and #3 without understanding #2. As Simon Sinek would say, “you must start with why”.</p>



<p>It’s on both the PM and the engineering team to understand “the why”. A few suggestions for PMs (and engineers):</p>



<ul><li>Hire or worth with engineers who are inclined to understand the product, because they could be users themselves or because they have some other interest in the product space (or, as an engineer, try to help build <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">products that you would use</a> or that you find interesting).</li><li>Make sure you explain <em>why</em> something is worth building (or, as an engineer, make sure you understand that, and if you don’t, ask).</li><li>Push engineers to be involved in <a href="https://www.quora.com/Should-software-engineers-be-involved-in-product-decisions" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">product decisions</a> (or, as an engineer, try to be involved in various pre-implementation parts of the product lifecycle).</li><li>Undertake other activities that help engineers build product intuition. Engineers can spend time with users, spend time understanding your products analytics, etc.</li><li>If you really want to test whether an engineer is thinking about “the why”, have an engineer write the specifications for a feature of reasonable size, and then have the PM review them. If they can’t even attempt that, that’s usually a bad sign (though the worst sign of all is if they absolutely don’t want to even try).</li></ul>



<p>Don’t fall victim to SODS.</p>

<p><span><span>Reading Time: </span> <span>2</span> <span>minutes</span></span></p><h2>Couples with fertility issues will also see a change in citizenship benefits</h2>



<p>Canadian families are as diverse as Canadians themselves, and everyone deserves the same rights and opportunities, no matter who they love or how they identify.</p>



<p>In recognition of the diversity of <a href="http://citizenship/" target="_blank" aria-label="Canadian  (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Canadian </a>families, the Honourable Marco E.&nbsp;L. Mendicino, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, today announced a change in the interpretation of “parent” under the Citizenship Act. The change allows non-biological Canadian parents who are their child’s legal parent at birth to pass down Canadian citizenship to their children born abroad in the first generation.</p>



<p>“I am very happy to announce this historic and positive declaration made by Quebec’s Superior Court. This change by Immigration Refugees and Citizenship <a href="http://citizenship/" target="_blank" aria-label="Canada  (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Canada </a>means that non-biological legal parents at birth and biological parents are now viewed equally as a child’s parent for the purposes of citizenship by descent. Canadian LGBTQ2+ families and parents experiencing fertility issues have waited too long for this important day. I know this was a difficult and stressful time for the Caron / van der Ven family, and Canada is grateful to them for the courage and strength they have shown in righting this wrong.”</p>



<p><strong>– The Honourable Marco E.&nbsp;L. Mendicino, P.C., M.P., Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship</strong></p>



<figure><img src="https://www.thedailyscrum.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/canadian-citizenship-benefits.jpg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://www.thedailyscrum.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/canadian-citizenship-benefits.jpg"></figure>



<p>This new interpretation helps Canadian parents who have relied on assisted human reproduction to start a family, including members of the LGBTQ2+ community and couples with fertility issues. Until now, a child born abroad was automatically recognized as a citizen at birth only if the child shared a genetic link to the Canadian parent or if the child was born to a Canadian parent in the first generation.</p>



<p>“Getting citizenship for our son was a long, sometimes hurtful and frustrating journey. We are extremely happy and relieved that the court corrected this discriminating policy, not only for our family, but also for many same-sex and non-traditional families around the world who could not get Canadian citizenship for their children. We are very thankful to IRCC for implementing the new changes so quickly, and above all, to our lawyers Olga Redko and Audrey Boctor, without whom we would never have gotten this far. – <strong><em>Laurence Caron and Elsje van der Ven</em></strong></p>



<p>This change is the result of the advocacy of the Caron / van der Ven family, who sought a durable solution through the court system to address situations where some children of parents using assisted human reproduction did not acquire citizenship automatically at birth. The Superior Court of Québec affirmed that Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada’s (IRCC) new interpretation of “parent” recognizes equally biological parents and legal parents at birth, and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects this interpretation under the law.</p>

	<div>
		<div>
			<p>I was such an idiot. I gave up literally $125,000 to do dropshipping.</p>
<p>You see, I quit my $250,000 a year job to go do dropshipping.</p>
<p>I spent 6 months dropshipping, fulltime. That was all I did. The opportunity cost of that was massive.</p>
<p>I also lost $2000 USD after spending $12,000 on Facebook ads and Instagram shoutouts.</p>
<p>And if I had to go back in time to March 2019, I’d yell “Stop!!! Don’t do dropshipping! Do this other thing instead!”</p>
<p>And in fact, as early as May I had read a anti-dropshipping thread that explained why dropshipping was a bad first venture. I should’ve listened. I should’ve paid more attention.</p>
<p>But alas, here we are.</p>
<p>Wait, what is “that other thing” I’d have told myself to do?</p>
<p>Well, I guess you’ll just have to read until the end to find out 🙂</p>
<p>Now don’t let this blog post discourage you, because online business is a worthy goal. But there are other online businesses you should consider that may be cheaper.</p>
<p>Hopefully you can learn something from my $2000 mistake. If this post helps save you some money, then I will consider myself a happy man.</p>



<p>You might be thinking: well, I bet he didn’t spend enough time on it. Or I bet he just didn’t want to spend money (or was too afraid to). Or maybe he didn’t read enough about copywriting / marketing.</p>
<p>Well let me talk a little more about my dropshipping experience so you can know if this post is for you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I had a ton of time</strong>. The 6 months I spent dropshipping was basically full-time. I had no job (didn’t need one). I freelanced myself about $2000 for a rate of about $60/hour, plus some credit card signup bonuses ($300 here and there), to fund the dropshipping venture
<ul>
<li>So no, there’s no “laziness” or “not enough effort” excuse. That was a solid 6 months. This venture should’ve “worked” by then. It didn’t.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>I was well read</strong>. I’d read Charlie Munger’s Psychological Checklist. Influence. All the recommended copywriting books, direct response books (e.g. Scientific Advertising, Ogilvy’s stuff). Really. I’d read a lot man. I didn’t slack on this dropshipping venture.</li>
<li><strong>I had a bunch of money</strong>.&nbsp;I had enough savings from my previous job to last me a lifetime (<em>easily</em>). But I’ve never started a business. I really wanted to start a business. And it wasn’t going to be in-person. If I’m gonna start a business, it better be online.
<ul>
<li>What was my previous job? I was a software engineer in Silicon Valley. Living extremely frugally. I had enough money.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And yes, I was dropshipping from Aliexpress. I used Shopify. I watched all the Youtube videos of James Holt, Gabriel St Germain (appears to be the most legit dropshipper there).</p>
<p>OK? So I had everything going for me (theoretically at least). Why did I end up ditching dropshipping?</p>

<p>There’s one main reason: it’s really expensive.</p>
<p>You can learn the same thing for a lot cheaper. And I mean&nbsp;<em>a lot</em> cheaper. And possibly even better too.</p>
<p>Well there are other reasons too:</p>
<ul>
<li>A) It’s really expensive</li>
<li>A2) Split testing is EXPENSIVE in dropshipping</li>
<li>B) The learning curve for dropshipping is extremely steep, due to many skillsets needed to make it work</li>
<li>C) A lot of headaches come with scaling a winner in dropshipping</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="A)_It%E2%80%99s_really_expensive"></span>A) It’s really expensive.<span></span></h2>
<p>How much budget do you need to start a dropshipping business?</p>
<p>Well, the fake gurus out there will tell you only need $300 to start a dropshipping business. “<em>And you too can make $10,000 a month!</em>” Ah, SMH.</p>
<p>It’s true. To&nbsp;<em>start</em>, you only need maybe $100. Shopify subscription, domain name, a couple Shopify plugins, maybe an Instagram shoutout.</p>
<p>But to do it&nbsp;<em>properly</em>, a real marketing venture, you need wayyyy more than $300. And I mean WAY more. I’m talking $10,000 – $15,000 range.</p>
<blockquote><p>What do you mean Muhima? How can it cost that much?</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah well I’m talking about&nbsp;<em>testing</em> ads, testing products.</p>
<p>To run all those tests, you need a lot of money. To buy data.</p>
<p>And how many tests will it take to find a winner?</p>
<p>The best dropshippers I’ve watched on Youtube and the best marketers I followed on Twitter all have a hit rate of about 1 in 10. Or 10%.</p>
<p>To test a product, you need to run 3 tests, running different emotional angles. 1 headline/image for each one.</p>
<p>What does each test cost? The rule of thumb is to run the ad to 3x gross margin in loss. For example, if you make $30 gross margin on your product ($40 price point, dropshipped from China for $10 each), then you need to run the test to $90.</p>
<p>So each product you’re testing out costs $270, at minimum.</p>
<p>But wait, lets say you had one promising angle returning -20% ROI (which is good). Then you gotta run 2 more variations off that. Lets say you change up the image/video creative. Boom, that’s another $270.</p>
<p>Ok, now zoom out. Remember the best marketers have a hit rate of 10%. Oh shit. 10 times $270 is how many? $2700 already. Oh shit.</p>
<p>But wait, you’re a newbie. You’re not experienced like those guys. And besides, what if you have a run of bad luck? So your likely hit rate is no better than 5%. To give yourself a margin of safety, ideally you want to have a budget twice that, just in case. How much are we at now? 20*$270 * 2 = $10,000+</p>
<p>Yeah man. It’s expensive to do dropshipping right.</p>
<p>Believe me, there are other internet businesses that don’t require as much starting budget to do right.</p>
<h2><span id="A2)_Split_testing_is_EXPENSIVE_in_dropshipping"></span>A2) Split testing is EXPENSIVE in dropshipping<span></span></h2>
<p>And I mean EXPENSIVE.</p>
<p>True split testing requires statistically significant data (lets say at least 90% statistical significance. Really it should be 95%, but some people relax the standard to 90% in the interest of trying to hit green sooner)</p>
<p>Do you know how many conversions you need to reach statistical significance?</p>
<p>3 conversions ain’t gonna cut it bro. 10 isn’t going to do it either.</p>
<p>I’m talking at least 50-100, if you’re trying to split-test a 20% improvement. I’ve had split-tests run up to 200 conversions.</p>
<p>So lets call it between 100-200 conversions.</p>
<p>It really takes A LOT of data to hit statistical significance.</p>
<blockquote><p>Muhima, What does this mean for dropshipping? How much does it cost to split test in dropshipping?</p></blockquote>
<p>Lets say you’re testing a clothing product for $40. What’s 50 conversions? Oh SHIT. $2000?</p>
<p>HOLY SHIT. You need $2000+ just run ONE split test?</p>
<p>Oh man.</p>
<p>Are you starting to see why you need a BIG budget to really learn marketing with dropshipping?</p>
<p>You’re only learning marketing if you’re doing split tests — everything else is just throwing shit at the wall. You don’t&nbsp;<em>really</em> know what works. It’s just guesswork.</p>
<h2><span id="B)_The_learning_curve_for_dropshipping_is_extremely_steep,_due_to_many_skills_required_(i_e_many_moving_parts)"></span>B) The learning curve for dropshipping is extremely steep, due to many skills required (i.e. many moving parts)<span></span></h2>
<p>Compared to this other business model I ended up switching to, there are MANY moving parts in dropshipping.</p>
<p>If you’re new to internet marketing, it’s going to be difficult to troubleshoot. As a professional software engineer, oh man. Add just one moving part, and the complexity of your project may have doubled or tripled.</p>
<p>Yes there are people who’ve succeeded with dropshipping, but it’s not easy for a beginner to pickup.</p>
<p>Here’s a running list of skills you need to succeed in dropshipping:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Writing ads</strong>. You have to know what makes a good image/video. You have to learn how to write click baity titles (since you’re bidding CPM, not CPC). If you want to do a good job, you should learn how to spy on competitor’s ads and how to analyze them.</li>
<li><strong>Writing pre-sales landing page</strong>. Chances are pretty good you’re not writing pre-sales page if you’re a newbie. And no, “product description” does NOT count, SMH guys. I’m talking something like a survey lander, or just a good old sales letter with a headline and some inspirational story “This 95 year old woman feels like a 20 year old doing yoga on this yoga mat!”</li>
<li><strong>Writing the sales funnel</strong>. Are you going to be doing free+shipping or straight up product sale with $20+ margin? How are you going to do upsells? Downsells? Cross sells?</li>
<li><strong>Monetizing backend with emails</strong>. With Facebook CPMs on the rise, I saw a lot of marketers adapt by taking a slight loss on the frontend offer and try to make it up in the backend. LTV man. Well if you’re a newbie – oh man. It’s tough.</li>
<li><strong>Building out a professional, branded-looking website</strong>. Hopefully this is the easier part for you. But there are still many who find the task of building out a Shopify website daunting.</li>
<li><strong>Scaling a winner when you have one</strong>. This is the easier part. But still easy to fuck up if you’re not careful.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are you a newbie? Take a quick pause and look at what you have to figure out.</p>
<p>There’s like at least 5 variables you have to troubleshoot or test.</p>
<p>Really tough learning curve. Very steep.</p>
<h2><span id="C)_A_lot_of_headaches_come_with_doing_big_sale_numbers_on_dropshipping"></span>C) A lot of headaches come with doing big sale numbers on dropshipping<span></span></h2>
<p>Lets say you’ve got a winner and you’re trying to scale it as hard as you can.</p>
<p>Congrats! That’s an accomplishment! (And also sure to be short-lived — grab as much as you can before competition comes in).</p>
<p>But wait, there’s more challenges!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Paypal withholding</strong>. Paypal has a reputation for suddenly closing your account. Just like Stripe, they’re wary of dropshippers.There was a funny joke I read on Reddit about this. Some guy said he had $20,000 in his Paypal and another guy says: “How are your balls so big, I can’t even imagine” LOL.</li>
<li><strong>Stripe will close your account</strong> if they find out you are dropshipping, even if your refund rate is less than 1%. Dropshipping is against their Terms of Service. How will you get another Stripe account? And all the money in the Stripe account goes poof. It’s not yours anymore.</li>
<li><strong>Refunds will come. High refund fees.</strong> You have to pay a $20 chargeback fee&nbsp;<em>in addition</em> to a full refund.</li>
<li><strong>Bad cash flow</strong>. Paypal/Stripe may keep a healthy reserve of your funds, for about 60-90 days. Your FB ads (which is your primary cost) is billed monthly. So this is bad for your cash flow.</li>
<li><strong>Need to hire customer support agency</strong>. Eats into your profit margin. Or else you spend hours each day answering customer support emails.</li>
</ul>
<p>Long story short, it’s tough to make dropshipping a truly passive business. You definitely need to dedicate at least a few hours a day to tending the garden so to speak.</p>

				</header>

				<h2 id="the-common-approach"><a href="#the-common-approach">The Common Approach</a></h2>
				<p>The common approach to JWT authentication seems to be using a short-lived JWT in javascript's memory and a longer-lived JWT in an HTTPOnly cookie for re-issuing the in-memory token after it's expired. The security benefits of this have never made much sense to me since the cookie's token can just be used to retrieve an in-memory token itself. More work with no benefit.</p>

				<p>The longer-lived token for re-issuing the short-lived token generally contains information for invalidating the session. This means session access cannot be <em>guaranteed</em> revoked for however long the short-lived token is potentially active.</p>

				<h2 id="the-best-of-both-worlds-approach"><a href="#the-best-of-both-worlds-approach">The Best of Both Worlds Approach</a></h2>
				<p>This approach allows for fast throughput requests and infrastructure savings by reducing database lookups to "dangerous" actions while allowing session revocation before any dangerous action is performed.</p>

				<p>What's a dangerous action? That's up to you and your app needs to determine. While developing this approach any Create, Update, or Delete action or token re-issue was considered dangerous, while any Read action is safe enough that they're allowed during the short-lived token's window without verification.</p>

				<p>This means any revoked session will have, at most, minutes to view the account, but cannot alter any data associated with it.</p>

                <h2 id="the-basics"><a href="#the-basics">The Basics</a></h2>				<p>This is the basic setup:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Data stored in token:
						<ul>
							<li>Short lived expiration time.</li>
							<li>User ID.</li>
							<li>Session ID.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>JWT stored in HTTPOnly cookie.</li>
					<li>Session ID is a "shared session" stored in user database.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2 id="the-implementation"><a href="#the-implementation">The Implementation:</a></h2>
				<h3 id="jwt-cookie"><a href="#jwt-cookie">JWT Cookie</a></h3>				<p>Storing the JWT in an HTTPOnly cookie allows us to create a persistent, hidden from javascript authentication method. Attaching it as credentials to our requests will mean needing to implement cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection, but we won't dive into that here because of the many possible solutions depending on your needs.</p>

				<h3 id="shared-sessions"><a href="#shared-sessions">Shared Sessions</a></h3>				<p>By creating a unique ID session field on each user we eliminate the need to store a separate session database/table that stores multiple sessions for each user depending on device, browser, etc. The shared session ID is deemed a current valid session until it is changed in the database. This is how we'll revoke sessions.</p>

				<p>This means we'll have to revoke all sessions associated with a single account rather than individual sessions, but this is usually the general approach anyways.</p>

				<h3 id="revoking-sessions"><a href="#revoking-sessions">Revoking Sessions</a></h3>				<p>What reasons can we use to revoke sessions? Password changes, compromised account detection, and more. When we need to invalidate a session, we simply need to generate a new session ID for the user in the database. All currently issued tokens will be invalid for re-issue or unsafe actions.</p>

				<h3 id="user-id"><a href="#user-id">User ID</a></h3>                <p>By storing the user's ID in the token we can implicitly trust for any safe action that the user of a valid, unexpired token is who they say they are, and should have access to the account data associated with the ID.</p>
				
				<p>This will save a database lookup for every safe action performed. A possibly large accumulation over time with a speedup for the user on each safe request as well.</p>

				<h3 id="expiration"><a href="#expiration">Expiration</a></h3>				<p>With a short-lived expiration we can re-verify valid sessions as soon as a token expires, limiting the window revoked sessions have to safe actions as well.</p>

				<p>Rather than having a separate token for re-issuing the short-lived token we can just use the expired token + its session ID to verify it should be re-issued.</p>

				<p>We check the database that the session ID is still valid, compare the issued time against a longer window of time and if both are accepted issue a new short-lived cookie token.</p>

				<p>Most JWT implementations (like node-jsonwebtoken) make this easy by throwing an expiration specific error on validation, and then a method for decoding the token while ignoring the expiration:</p>

				<pre><code>
				verify(token, 'secret').catch((err) =&gt; {
					if (err.name === 'TokenExpiredError') {
						// Check against re-issue time window &amp; validate session ID
						return validateSessionAndReissue(token);
					}
				});
				</code></pre>

				<p>This way our single token can "re-issue" itself when needed.</p>

				<h2 id="considerations"><a href="#considerations">Considerations:</a></h2>
				<h3 id="the-jwt-window"><a href="#the-jwt-window">The JWT Window</a></h3>				<p>If you need instantly revocable sessions for all requests and can't deem any safe vs unsafe then a JWT isn't the solution for you at all. Classic sessions stored in a cookie are smaller in size, will use the same number of DB lookups, and are often easier to implement.</p>

				<h3 id="server-side-handling"><a href="#server-side-handling">Server Side Handling</a></h3>				<p>Your server implementation may need to accommodate the approach in several ways. The user's ID will typically be attached to the request as included credentials from the token rather than included as an argument/parameter or REST endpoint. This can be nice since endpoints, graphQL queries, etc. can be simplified.</p>

				<p>Different actions/resources will need to be marked as safe for implicit trust and some for unsafe requiring explicit validated session trust. This may be a higher order function around different routes or resolvers.</p>

                <h3 id="a-single-session"><a href="#a-single-session">A Single Session</a></h3>				<p>If your security needs to track/differentiate between two sessions under a single account then a shared session likely over complicates the fingerprinting you'd want to attach to actions and classic sessions are probably a better choice.</p>

				<h2 id="in-summary"><a href="#in-summary">In Summary</a></h2>				<p>This approach has the same security implications as most JWT implementations, but offers more safety around certain actions giving the performance and infrastructure benefits of the normal JWT approach for all other actions. And the single JWT being responsible for re-issuing itself reduces complexity greatly.</p>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    
<p>I’ve spent about a year ramping up on reinforcement learning (RL) and related research topics. Compared to my PhD work at Berkeley, my current research is less focused on publishing and more independent, creating unique challenges and rewards. I want to share some tips for effective self-study and independent research, which are roughly ordered from those targeting early research first to more mature research later.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Write down your goals.</strong> Do you want to publish a paper? Contribute to an open source project? Gain experience for a career change? Do you simply enjoy learning? You can list more than one goal, but sort them and <em>pick one as your primary.</em> When I started, my primary goal was to learn about as many approaches to agent based programs as I could find, and a secondary goal was to build an agent that uses mind-wandering (which led me to build a chat bot).</li>
  <li><strong>Mix learning and practicing.</strong> I learn by reading, watching videos, taking online classes, and participating in study groups. I practice by coding. A 1:1 ratio works well for me. I usually spend days or weeks in one mode before switching to the other.</li>
  <li><strong>Regularly read classic papers.</strong> Get to know the history of the field and the key figures. Often what they’ve done is worth trying yourself, or will influence your direction.</li>
  <li><strong>Start or join a reading group.</strong> This helps with motivation and learning. Don’t overdo it: start with one paper or textbook chapter per month, adjust later if necessary. Take notes each time and consider posting them online.</li>
  <li><strong>Write down your research plan.</strong> Don’t overthink it, this is just a starting spot. It doesn’t have to be long. I keep mine in a google doc. I re-read and update it frequently. It starts high-level and aspirational and gets more detailed. Here are some sections my plan contains (yours can be much shorter!):
    <ul>
      <li>One sentence research hypothesis.</li>
      <li>Objectives - one line per each of my 3mo / 6mo / 1yr / 2yr objectives. I review and revise this section every three months.</li>
      <li>Draft abstract + intro of a hypothetical research paper (dissertation?) that I hope to some day write if my research works out.</li>
      <li>Learning plan / courses to take.</li>
      <li>Reading list &amp; related work.</li>
      <li>FAQ. Brainstorm questions that you expect to encounter, both from others and yourself. Since I shifted from lots of structure in my previous role to less structure in my current role, my FAQ includes questions like <em>“why am i doing this?”</em> and <em>“what possible obstacles do I expect?”</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Revisit and evolve your goals.</strong> My high-level goals evolve slowly, but my lower-level ones change a lot. I enjoy looking back and seeing how they’ve changed as I learned new things.</li>
  <li><strong>Conduct self-performance reviews.</strong> Independent work has little intrinsic structure. I force structure on myself: every three months I write down where I can improve the most, and what I’m most proud of. In fact, this blog post is part of my 1yr performance review.</li>
  <li><strong>Keep a research journal.</strong> Try to write daily. I keep my journal at the end of my research plan, and this blog is an experiment in shifting some of my journaling to be public.</li>
  <li><strong>Don’t worry about novelty.</strong> It is valuable to implement well known algorithms yourself. Remember to cite the author if you publish your code or anything derivitive.</li>
  <li><strong>Build small projects.</strong> Apply what you’re learning. Spend hours (not days) making a 1-2 page design doc including a 1 sentence summary of the project, 1-3 paragraphs of overview, and a bullet list of the initial features. Spend weeks (not months) building the first prototype of a project, then iterate. Some friends and I spent a couple months <a href="https://github.com/andyk/improved-funicular">implementing 2048 and a bunch of algos to play it</a>; it was motivating and we learned a lot. I also built a chat bot, a small python library of utility functions for writing RL algorithms, and a few other small projects.</li>
  <li><strong>Write up your progress.</strong> When you’ve finished a project or reached a checkpoint, take a few hours to write up your results and some reflections. It doesn’t have to be polished. My friends and I documented some of our results and lessons learned working on 2048 in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oNbpl-4W6jaOg4DefeQPYh77wpbNfZwzI5t86mra3hs/edit">a shared google doc</a>. Now we have the option to come back later and iterate on it, maybe even work towards publishing it somewhere.</li>
  <li><strong>Teach what you learn.</strong> Prepare a short talk, or even better a short hands-on training tutorial. Give it at a meetup or put it on YouTube. If you’re not ready for that, give it for your friends.</li>
  <li><strong>Allow yourself to explore tangents.</strong> But time box them, and if possible, try to synthesize lessons from the tangent back into your research plan.</li>
  <li><strong>Find folks to collaborate with.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Look where you work. For academics, this is straightforward, e.g., PhD students have their advisors and other students. If you’re not an academic, there might already be reading groups or chat channels at your company you can join. Otherwise, attend meetups, post on mailing lists of open source projects, or go to a conference.</li>
      <li>Once you find a collaborator, some of your solo activites can become group activities. I work closely with a friend Nick Jalbert that I met in grad school. We have weekly video chats and occasionally in-person mini-retreats. Here are examples of ways Nick and I collaborate:
        <ul>
          <li>Every few weeks, we read a paper and then meet to discuss it. Nick inspired me to set up this blog when he started posting <a href="https://nickjalbert.github.io/reading">his reading notes</a> online.</li>
          <li>We built a short hands-on <a href="https://www.meetup.com/LA-Deep-RL/events/268096321/">Intro to RL tutorial</a> for the LA Deep RL meetup group.</li>
          <li>We are self-studying our way through <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/">Gilbert Strang’s online linear algebra course</a>.</li>
          <li>We write code together. Sometimes we both work on our own separate implementation of an algorithm and then compare, sometimes we review each other’s code or design docs, and sometimes we pair program.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Contact people in the field.</strong> Be bold but humble. Don’t start with the most famous researchers; instead contact folks that are local to your area. Read their recent papers or books first. Get an introduction if you can. Raise a technical topic or question that overlaps with their research. Researchers are generally meritocratic, so they will give you time if you have ideas that are interesting to them. Nonetheless, expect to be rejected or ignored.</li>
  <li><strong>Spend time motivating yourself.</strong> I once read that people overestimate how much progress they can make in a month and underestimate how much they can make in a year;&nbsp;this is my experience with self-study and independent research. Major research accomplishments tend to take years of work (Is this kinda counter to the underestimting progress in a year thing?). Along the way, you should expect to ocassionally feel bored, distracted, hopeless, disillusioned, etc. I don’t wait for these moments to arrive to manage them. Instead, I proactively set aside time for activities that inspire me. For me, this includes reading or watching sci-fi, public speaking, and passionate conversations with friends about RL and AI. And when a bad day comes along, I take a break from work, listen to music or go the gym, talk it out with a friend, or try jumping into a different project. All the while, I remain patient for my sense of excitement to return. And it always does.</li>
</ul>

<p>Have fun and good luck with your research and studying.</p>

<p>To counter a second coronavirus wave, President Aleksandar Vucic announced a new lockdown. Protesters reacted with fury at his inconsistency, amid wider anger over his strongman leadership.</p>
<p>Thousands of Serbs demonstrated for a second consecutive night on Wednesday in response to President Aleksandar Vucic’s management of the coronavirus crisis and wider concerns over the state of democracy in Serbia.</p>
<p>The protests were the first major pandemic-related unrest in Europe since the start of the crisis and were met by a violent police response that some analysts said they had not witnessed in Serbia since the rule of Slobodan Milosevic, who governed Serbia during the 1990s.</p>
<p>Serbs first took to the streets on Tuesday, soon after Mr. Vucic announced that Belgrade would be placed under a new three-day lockdown following the second wave of confirmed coronavirus infections.</p>
<p>But the demonstrations quickly morphed into a wider expression of frustration at Mr. Vucic’s increasing control over policymaking and perceived mismanagement of Serbia’s pandemic response. The protests continued on Wednesday, even after Mr. Vucic suspended his decision to enforce a second shutdown.</p>
<p>Protesters said they were less angry about the re-implementation of the lockdown than the governmental missteps that had created the need for renewed restrictions in the first place. These included decisions to proceed with a general election last week and to restart large public sports events.</p>
<p>“We don’t mind staying home for another three days — that wasn’t the problem,” said Dragana Grncarski, 45, a fashion events manager who protested on both days.</p>
<p>“However, they’re playing with our minds and with the truth,” Ms. Grncarski added. “When it suits them to do elections, there is no corona. They organized football matches and tennis matches, and because of that we have a situation where the hospitals are full.”</p>
<p>After initially enforcing one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns in March, Mr. Vucic lifted social restrictions in early May, claiming his government had defeated the coronavirus.</p>
<p>But while other European countries eased their lockdowns gradually, Mr. Vucic opted for a faster process, soon allowing Serbs to gather by the tens of thousands without social distancing at sports matches and to crowd into reopened nightclubs.</p>
<p>“We went from one extreme to another,” said Jelena Vasiljevic, an expert on Balkan protest movements at the University of Belgrade.</p>
<p>Mr. Vucic initially refused to change course on the re-openings, even as the daily number of new cases rose from below 20 to above 300 and investigative news reports suggested that the toll could be even higher.</p>
<p>He pressed ahead with a controversial general election on June 21 that most opposition parties had long planned to boycott, saying they did not want to legitimize a process that they feel is gamed in Mr. Vucic’s favor.</p>
<p>And to Mr. Vucic’s critics, his decision first to ease restrictions ahead of a vote that was certain to increase his power — and then reinstate them soon after — felt like he was playing politics with public health.</p>
<p>“Citizens have been constantly deceived and lied to for political ends,” said Tena Prelec, an expert on politics in Southeast Europe at the University of Oxford.</p>
<p>Analysts said the spontaneous nature of the protests reflected the lack of institutional means to express dissent.</p>
<p>Under Mr. Vucic, the quality of Serbian democracy has fallen from “free” to only “partly free,” according to Freedom House, an independent Washington-based watchdog that makes an annual assessment of each country’s political freedoms.</p>
<p>“The media and state institutions are completely consumed by one party,” said Dr. Vasiljevic.</p>
<p>On Tuesday night, some protesters briefly entered the Parliament building before being forced out by police.</p>
<p>Law enforcement officials were later filmed beating unarmed protesters with batons, in scenes that some analysts said mirrored police behavior during the rule of Mr. Milosevic, who led Serbia through the Balkan Wars and was later tried for war crimes in The Hague.</p>
<p>“The excessive use of force — we haven’t seen that since Milosevic in 1996 or 1997,” Dr. Vasiljevic said.</p>
<p>Mr. Vucic said police were right to respond with force.</p>
<p>“There were indications of foreign involvement, and some criminal faces were there, too,” Mr. Vucic said, speaking on Wednesday afternoon, before the second night of protests.</p>
<p>“The aim was to damage Serbia’s international image,” he added.</p>
<p>The protests could soon fizzle because of their leaderless nature, the lack of a clear goal, and the strength of Mr. Vucic’s grip on Serbia, Dr. Vasiljevic said.</p>
<p>Similar mass demonstrations dissipated last year without forcing concessions from Mr. Vucic.</p>
<p>“This situation is a bit different,” said Dr. Vasiljevic. “But we still need to have some clear political articulations and a clear political narrative.”</p>

<h3 id="what-does-a-web-server-do">What does a web server do?</h3>

<p>It listens on a TCP port for connections. When someone from somewhere on the internet makes a connection to that port, it happily recieves the “request”, processes it, and sends a “response”.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-modern-web-development">What is “modern” web development?</h3>

<p>Modern web development refers to the prevalent web development practices right now. I’m writing this in 2020, and right now web development revolves around the concepts of “frontend” and “backend”. Let’s rewind a bit.</p>

<p>Long ago, web development was about creating pages in HTML which gets transmitted over the wire to browser which then displays it. People could click and navigate to other pages. But that was mostly it. Everything was static and everyone would see the same things.</p>

<p>Then “dynamic” web came into existence. Here, “web servers” would create HTML pages on the fly depending on the user who is requesting it. “Users” could also add/remove content from these servers. There was a lot of “data” moving around and naturally databases became prominent. Also, languages like PHP which allowed dynamically creating HTML became popular.</p>

<p>Then came the smartphones. With smartphones came “native apps” and also smaller screens. This was a double blow to web development. One, websites now have to be visually attractive on large screens and small screens (responsive design). Two, websites would have to compete with the interactivity offered by native applications. Although responsive design has largely been a successful change in web development, competing with native applications is something web applications are still struggling in. This is partly because native code on Android and iOS simply have more capabilities on the platform. Thus the term “native”.</p>

<p>That is what drives the differentiation between frontend and backend in modern web development. Large organizations have native applications for each platform and web version of their applications. This means that the “backend” server can be the lowest common factor - which is “REST APIs”. And the UI on different platforms are their own codebases. For the web, the UI is called frontend. Large organizations also drive innovation and technology. And therefore most of the popular web technologies we have now is devoted to this frontend-backend divide.</p>

<p>On the frontend javascript is the default choice and that is why popular frontend frameworks like React and Vue are all also javascript frameworks.</p>

<p>But backend can be anything. Javascript itself, python, java, rust, kotlin, go, ruby, php, or even <a href="https://css-tricks.com/wtf-is-a-static-api/">just JSON files</a>. The only requirement for a backend technology, as can be seen from that last example, is that it is able to return strings over a web connection. Most applications would also have to interact with databases, other internet services (APIs), and the filesystem, and also encapsulate “business logic”. And that is where things become interesting.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-javas-role-in-modern-web-development">What is Java’s role in modern web development?</h3>

<p>No matter how much stuff happens on the frontend, centralized services will have a backend with components that I described previously. Even if things are dockerized and deployed on the cloud thus giving rise to multiple “backends”, there is something at the “back”.</p>

<p>Java, over the last few years has been evolving rapidly (compared to its own past) to accomodate the needs of modern web development. Because the JVM is battle tested and because the development paradigms that Java enforces are also useful for large teams to work together, Java is a powerful player in the backend space of modern web development.</p>

<h3 id="what-should-i-know-about-java-to-understand-modern-web-development-in-java">What should I know about Java to understand modern web development in Java?</h3>

<h4 id="specifications-vs-implementations">Specifications vs Implementations</h4>

<p>The biggest insight I can share is that in Java world <strong>everything has specifications</strong> and implementations. “Specification”/standards are API interfaces (usually), configuration formats, or expected behaviour that are meant to be interoperable. (This plays well with the concept of <code>Interface</code> in Java’s object-oriented paradigm)</p>

<p>What this means is that you could write software that targets a specification and then it could work with any of the implementations of that specification. This is a concept very much alien to javascript developers.</p>

<p>For a concrete example, let us take the case of REST API development. If you are building a framework that simplifies development of REST APIs in javascript, you can build it however the way you want. Then you write documentation on how the user of your framework should write their functions such that it can be hooked into your framework. For example, <a href="https://expressjs.com/">express</a> developer would want you to write a function like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>/</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>req</span><span>,</span> <span>h</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>h</span><span>.</span><span>send</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>Hello World!</span><span>'</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But, <a href="https://hapi.dev/">hapi</a> will ask you to write the same like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>route</span><span>({</span>
        <span>method</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>GET</span><span>'</span><span>,</span>
        <span>path</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>/</span><span>'</span><span>,</span>
        <span>handler</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>req</span><span>,</span> <span>h</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

            <span>return</span> <span>'</span><span>Hello World!</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So, as a user, you get locked in to the framework early on.</p>

<p>But in Java, this is not necessarily the case. There is “<a href="https://download.oracle.com/javaee-archive/jax-rs-spec.java.net/jsr339-experts/att-3593/spec.pdf">JAX-RS</a>” [pdf link] specification which talks about how the user will write their classes and methods, how these will be annotated, how the configuration will be specified, and so on. The specification also tells you how your framework should behave when interacting with such user code as well.</p>

<p>So, no matter whether you’re using <a href="https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey/">Jersey</a>, <a href="https://resteasy.github.io/docs/">RESTEasy</a>, or any other JAX-RS compliant framework, your method will be the same:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>@Path</span><span>(</span><span>"/"</span><span>)</span>
<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>HelloWorld</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>@GET</span>
	<span>public</span> <span>String</span> <span>helloWorld</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    	<span>return</span> <span>"Hello World!"</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can write this and deploy it with Jersey and it will work. You can then remove Jersey and put something else that implements JAX-RS, it will work. That is what a standard does.</p>

<p>Now, this does not mean that Java is a boring place where everyone writes programs the same way. There are other REST frameworks that do not conform to the JAX-RS specification like <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web.html#mvc">Spring MVC</a>
and they can have their own ways of how to write web resource classes.</p>

<h4 id="did-i-mention-specifications">Did I mention specifications?</h4>

<p>Java has to be understood in its historical context. Java was under Oracle for a long long time. And Oracle used to provide various cloud services that uses Java based technologies. And Oracle used to maintain the specifications in and around Java. And Oracle used to provide proprietary technologies on top of these specifications.</p>

<p>The proliferation of such specifications (which no other programming language seems to have) is good and bad. Bad because it makes a programming language an economic product rather than a language of creative expression. Good because you can move your enterprise from one provider to another, provided they both support the same specifications equally. Enterprises love this promise of not being vendor locked in. It is just an added bonus to them that they can swap developers around constantly because everyone is practically writing the same thing.</p>

<p>So, the story of specifications doesn’t end with specifications. Java also has collections of specifications. There is something called “Standard Edition” (SE), something called “Enterprise Edition” (EE). SE “contains” the basic things that makes it a programming language (like data types, IO, etc.) whereas EE “contains” further things like the JAX-RS specification we mentioned above. Meaning, if you have a cloud provider who implements the Java EE platform, then there are a lot of specifications that they are complying with (almost all the technologies that an enterprise needs).</p>

<p>On the other hand there are also projects like <a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.microprofile">Eclipse MicroProfile</a> which form useful alternatives to things like Java EE. There are also frameworks like <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework">Spring</a>, <a href="https://micronaut.io/">Micronaut</a>, and <a href="https://quarkus.io/">Quarkus</a> which are comprehensive solutions of their own (often with interchangeable parts).</p>

<p>That ends part 1 of this post. Have a coffee now.</p>

<h3 id="tell-me-about-web-development-in-java">Tell me about web development in Java</h3>

<p>I’m sorry it has to be this way. Much of Java is stuck in the past. And without the historical context, you will have great trouble in navigating the Java ecosystem. I’ve spent countless nights doing this. Just show some patience.</p>

<h3 id="history-of-web-development-in-java">History of Web Development in Java</h3>

<p>Java has seen all of it. So we have to start from the very beginning.</p>

<h4 id="servlets">Servlets</h4>

<p>A servlet is very similar to the hello world function in express that we saw earlier.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>ServletHelloWorld</span> <span>extends</span> <span>HttpServlet</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>@Override</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>init</span><span>(</span><span>final</span> <span>ServletConfig</span> <span>config</span><span>)</span> <span>throws</span> <span>ServletException</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>super</span><span>.</span><span>init</span><span>(</span><span>config</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>

    
    <span>@Override</span>
    <span>protected</span> <span>void</span> <span>service</span><span>(</span><span>final</span> <span>HttpServletRequest</span> <span>request</span><span>,</span> <span>final</span> <span>HttpServletResponse</span> <span>response</span><span>)</span> <span>throws</span> <span>ServletException</span><span>,</span> <span>IOException</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>response</span><span>.</span><span>getWriter</span><span>().</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello World!"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
 
    <span>@Override</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>destroy</span><span>()</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That is a hello world servlet.  The request object would have information about path and other info required to form a response.</p>

<p><a href="https://javaee.github.io/servlet-spec/">Java Servlet Specification</a> is the specification that defines how servlets should be.</p>

<h4 id="servlet-containers">Servlet Containers</h4>

<p>These are frameworks which, based on the servlet specification, are designed to run servlets. An example is “Catalina” which is a part of Tomcat.</p>

<h4 id="web-servers">Web servers</h4>

<p><a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat</a> is a group of technologies which could be considered a complete “web server”. Tomcat includes components like “Coyote” which listens to a port for HTTP connections, and Catalina mentioned above which takes that request and forwards it to a servlet and later takes the response from the servlet and passes it back.</p>

        <blockquote><p>Gartner says hyper-automation is one of the top 10 trends of the year – but what the heck is it?</p></blockquote>
<p>Initially, hyper-automation sounds like yet another buzzword. But analysts say hyper-automation is a thing unto itself, and they suggest businesses pay attention to it. Great. But then, what <em>is</em> it?</p>
<p>One reason that hyper-automation is difficult to recognize is that it has many names. Gartner calls it hyper-automation, and considers it <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-10-strategic-technology-trends-for-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the top trends</a> of the year. IDC calls it <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=IDC_P35141" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intelligent Process automation</a> while Forrester dubs the same practices <a href="https://go.forrester.com/blogs/digital-process-automation-an-important-part-of-your-digital-transformation-strategy/%20target=">Digital Process Automation</a>. Still others do not call it by any name at all.</p>
<p>“We created the first of its kind hyper-automation tool for project management. We don’t present it that way because people don’t yet understand and really know about hyper-automation,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregorystoos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">says Grégory Stoos</a>, a French entrepreneur who founded Portuguese startup <a href="https://planless.io/%20target=">planless.io</a>.</p>
<h3>No clear name, but it’s a real thing</h3>
<p>While the name is still a bit in flux, the definition has already gelled.</p>
<p>According to Gartner, hyper-automation “involves a combination of tools, including <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/rpa-robot-process-automation-how-it-relates-to-intelligent-automation/">robotic process automation</a> (RPA), intelligent business management software (iBPMS) and AI, with a goal of increasingly AI-driven decision making.” The firm further clarifies that “hyper-automation often results in the creation of a digital twin of the organization (DTO)” which in turn enables &nbsp;organizations “to visualize how functions, processes and key performance indicators interact to drive value.”</p>
<p>In short, you can think of hyper-automation as automated automation. It always functions at high speeds and often (though not always) at large scale.</p>
<p>“Hyper-automation enables machines to automate the further implementation of additional automation without the input of human assistance. It is often said that machines running on this type of technology can not only learn 10,000 times faster, they can do so without ever missing it on the next iteration,” says Nate Nead, CEO of <a href="https://dev.co/">DEV.co</a>, a custom software development company.</p>
<p>While it is used in several industries, it is not generally widespread.</p>
<p>“Hyper-automation is yet to become mainstream, but adoption is growing. My observation is based on the fact that even in call centers, despite its usefulness, hyper-automation is yet to become a staple,” said Reuben Yonatan, founder and CEO of <a href="https://getvoip.com/">GetVoIP</a>, an advisor service on cloud communications.</p>
<h3>A few current examples</h3>
<p>Today, use cases are typically in early stages, particularly in contexts where you would expect heavy automation. A common goal is accelerating, streamlining, and even redesigning processes.</p>
<p>“A real-world example of hyper-automation in my industry—cloud communication—is the use of RPA and AI in call centers to automate processes such as mouse clicks and application launch to help an agent quickly pull information about a client from multiple systems,” explains Yonatan.</p>
<p>“When a customer calls in, an agent must aggregate information from various systems to get a complete customer profile. With the hyper-automation tools handling the process, the agent doesn’t have to keep switching between several applications, and the process is faster,” Yonatan adds.</p>
<p>Implementations vary significantly, depending in large part on where and why hyper-automation is used. That is likely to remain true for the foreseeable future too.</p>
<p>“Traditional areas where such AI tools will truly skyrocket in the next decade include database search querying, project automation, CRM, ERP systems, fulfillment and tracking of things like leads, people, processes and packages. As machines learn faster and make less mistakes then humans, it is estimated that most jobs will be automated in 20 years or less,” says Nead.</p>
<p>Wyndham Capital Mortgage, which <a href="https://www.aifoundry.com/newsroom/news/wyndham-capital-mortgage-partners-with-ai-foundry-for-lending-ai-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">entered a partnership</a> with AI Foundry in May, is another example of a company using hyper-automation to automate where automation couldn’t go before.</p>
<p>“Wyndham Capital Mortgage’s strategy is to be a leader in the utilization of automation and particularly robotic processing technologies,” said Wyndham Capital Mortgage CEO Jeff Douglas in <a href="https://www.aifoundry.com/newsroom/news/wyndham-capital-mortgage-partners-with-ai-foundry-for-lending-ai-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a statement</a> to the press. “By implementing [AI Foundry’s] Agile Mortgages’ cognitive robots, we are now able to push deeper into loan processing stages where document and decision complexity limited automation gains.”</p>
<p>In short, Wyndham is accelerating its loan origination process and jacking up scale too. Part of that is achieved by using robots to fetch information from a variety of sources, thereby <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/5-reasons-why-qa-needs-humans/">eliminating menial work</a> typically done by operations employees.</p>
<p>“Wyndham Capital Mortgage has been utilizing RPA for some time. Integration of AI Foundry’s solutions moves it to hyper-automation,” explains <a href="https://bryan.uncg.edu/faculty-and-staff/kshetri-nir-b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nir Kshetri</a>, a professor at University of North Carolina-Greensboro and a research fellow at Kobe University.</p>
<p>The move to hyper-automation was necessary because RPA alone is insufficient to fully automate the loan origination process. Wyndham needed a technological fix for RPA’s gaps and shortcomings.</p>
<p>“RPA perform well in automating predefined steps in which rules define where relevant data can be located on each type of pre-defined document – for example, [tax] form 1040 and statements from some predefined banks. However, RPA may not deliver the automation goals if different customers submit documents in different formats with different contents. By utilizing [machine learning] and machine vision financial institutions such as Wyndham Capital Mortgage can extract relevant information from diverse documents,” Kshetri adds.</p>
<p>Even though it hasn’t gone mainstream yet, hyper-automation is in common enough use that consultancies are already organizing guidance for their clientele.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://theartofservice.com/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Art of Service</a>, a management consultancy company based in Australia, frequently releases updated and new assessments of hyper-automation based on hundreds of projects and initiatives according to CEO and R&amp;D Director, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gerardblokdijk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gerard Blokdyk</a>. Gartner, IDC, Forrester and other firms also provide guidance and projections.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of attention for a group of technologies that’s yet to entirely settle on a name. And <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/things-that-are-called-ml-ai-that-really-arent/">at least it’s a real thing</a>. In the meantime, think of hyper-automation as a swiftly laid foundation for businesses keen on future-building rather than future-proofing.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Safely storing digital files for a long time turns out to be an expensive and
difficult problem.</p>
<p>Recent advances in filesystems, though, have made this a doable task.</p>
<h2 id="the-old-rule-3-2-1-backups">The old rule: “3-2-1 backups”<a href="#the-old-rule-3-2-1-backups" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p>The “3-2-1” backup strategy is perhaps the most common strategy for keeping
files safe.</p>
<p>This strategy suggests that you maintain:</p>
<ul>
<li>at last <strong>three</strong> different copies of every file, with</li>
<li>at least <strong>two</strong> different <em>storage formats</em>, and</li>
<li>at least <strong>one</strong> copy offsite.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-different-storage-formats">Why different storage formats?<a href="#why-different-storage-formats" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p>If you store your data on different formats, hopefully the formats will have
different lifespans. When one fails before the other, it gives you time to make
a new copy.</p>
<p>There are several problems with this line of reasoning, though.</p>
<figure>

<p>Optical media: the state of the art (last millennium)</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Storage formats available to consumers are typically only hard drives and
optical storage media (CD-R, DVD-R, or BD-R). The latest optical storage
technology is limited to 25GB per disk. Hard drives are regularly in the 1-12TB
range, which is <strong>40-500x bigger</strong>. Backing up a 6TB $100 hard drive on optical
media would be ridiculous: it would take 240 BD-R disks.</p>
<p>There’s a bigger problem with 3-2-1, though: how do you detect any problems with your files in the first place?</p>
<h2 id="why-3-2-1-isnt-enough-the-impact-of-bit-rot">Why 3-2-1 isn’t enough: the impact of “bit rot”<a href="#why-3-2-1-isnt-enough-the-impact-of-bit-rot" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p>All commonly available storage formats eventually suffer from “bit rot,” or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_degradation">data
degradation</a>.</p>
<p>Your files are comprised of hundreds of thousands or even millions of bits of data.</p>
<p>If a handful of those bits are “flipped” due to storage defects or media
degradation your file can become unreadable.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of an image with only a couple bits flipped:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://photostructure.com/img/2020/06/bitrot.jpg" alt="JPEG bitrot after flipping 0, 1, 2, or 3 bits (source)"> <figcaption>
<p>JPEG bitrot after flipping 0, 1, 2, or 3 bits (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_degradation">source</a>)</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Note that the rightmost file is 99.999% correct, yet isn’t viewable.</p>
<p>Most likely, hard drives and optical disks that are five years old or older will
have some amount of bit rot.</p>
<p>Many of our older family photos on old hard drives had succumbed to some amount
of bit rot. In discovering this unpleasantness, we updated PhotoStructure to
detect and skip over photos and videos that are corrupt, with the hope that
you’ll have several copies of a given photo, and one of them won’t have bit rot.</p>
<p>But this feature just treats the symptom: this doesn’t fix the underlying
problem.</p>
<h2 id="overcoming-bit-rot">Overcoming bit rot<a href="#overcoming-bit-rot" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p>Several advanced filesystems, including
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btrfs">Btrfs</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS">ZFS</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFS">XFS</a> all support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_scrubbing">data
scrubbing</a>, which detects and
repairs bit rot automatically.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, neither Windows nor macOS support these filesystems. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Machine_(macOS)">Time
Machine</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup_and_Restore">Backup and
Restore</a> don’t detect bit rot
either.</p>
<p>So: <em>how do normal people use these fancy new filesystems?</em></p>
<h2 id="nas-to-the-rescue">NAS to the rescue<a href="#nas-to-the-rescue" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage">Network-attached
storage</a> (NAS) devices
hold several large hard drives and quietly do their work safely storing your
files. You can keep using your favorite OS, but you don’t have to worry about
bit rot anymore.</p>
<p>Most NAS also support hosting Docker images. PhotoStructure runs under Docker,
and is designed to run smoothly on a NAS.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/products/series/home">Synology</a> is the most

<li>
<p>If building your own computer is intimidating and you’d like to try FreeNAS,
the <a href="https://www.freenas.org/freenas-mini/">FreeNAS Mini</a> comes pre-assembled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://unraid.net/">unRAID</a>, like FreeNAS, runs on hardware you already

<h2 id="getting-started-with-your-nas">Getting started with your NAS<a href="#getting-started-with-your-nas" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Consider getting a NAS that has 4 or more drives to offer redundancy and
support data integrity checks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buy 50% more storage than you need right now so you have room to grow in the
near future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable weekly data scrubbing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable monthly S.M.A.R.T. self-diagnostic runs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set up your NAS to either apply security patches automatically or notify you
to do so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider installing a virus scanner and malware detection package on your
NAS. Synology has a “security audit” tool as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure your router has recently-updated firmware</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use secure admin and user passwords. Using a password manager like
<a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a> makes this easy to do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configure your NAS to tell you if it has any errors: <strong>you don’t want any
disks dying or backups failing without you knowing it.</strong></p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-at-least-3-copies">How to get “at least 3 copies”<a href="#how-to-get-at-least-3-copies" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p>Satisfy the 2nd or 3rd copy of the “at least 3 copies” rule by copying the
entire contents of your NAS to an external hard drive that normally stays
powered down and offline. Do this quarterly.</p>
<p>Consider storing this drive near your emergency kit so you can grab it as you
leave your house in case of an emergency.</p>
<p>This external drive can also reduce your dataloss if your NAS catastrophically
fails, or if you get hit by malware like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptoLocker">cryptolockers</a>.</p>

<p>Satisfy the “at least 1 offsite” rule by setting up your NAS to back up to a
cloud service automatically. <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/">Backblaze</a> and
<a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/">tarsnap</a> are both well-regarded offsite storage
solutions, and both have solutions that work with your new NAS.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to pay for cloud storage, you can set up another NAS (like at
a friend or family member’s house). Both FreeNAS and Synology support NAS-to-NAS
replication.</p>
<p>Make sure you configure the replication job to run in the middle of the night,
and throttle network bandwidth so you don’t make your friends or family grumpy.</p>

from HTML and CSS, but that same approach can also be used with SVG to
build sophisticated custom UI elements.</p>
<p>In this article, we'll give a brief overview of SVG, when to use it
(and when not to), and how to use it effectively in a React
application. We'll also briefly touch on how to integrate with d3
(which comes in very useful when working with SVG).</p>

<p>We relied heavily on SVG to build the charting updates we launched
recently in pganalyze (check out my <a href="https://pganalyze.com/blog/introducing-new-charts-and-date-picker">blog post about
these</a>
if you missed it), and we would like to share how we work with SVG in
React. At the end of the post, we link to a simple but functional
charting example based on our new charting code. We stripped it down
to make it easier to follow, and we think it's a great introduction to
building SVG components in React.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-svg"><a href="#what-is-svg" aria-label="what is svg permalink"></a>What is SVG?</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">SVG</a> is an
XML-based vector graphics format. It is commonly used for icons and
illustrations, but the similarities to HTML make it a great fit to
extend your UI. Like HTML, SVG consists of a DOM tree of elements
which can be styled with CSS, can be scripted and animated, and can
dispatch events on user interaction. SVG is well-supported in modern
browsers, including Firefox, Safari, Chrome, and Edge. All of these
support embedding SVG directly in HTML, and React supports using SVG
elements to build your components.</p>
<p>A thorough overview of SVG is beyond the scope of this post, but let's
review the salient features in the context of building UI components.
The actual elements available fall in a few different categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>simple lines and shapes, like <code>rect</code>, <code>circle</code>, and <code>line</code></li>
<li>more complex lines and shapes, like <code>polygon</code> and <code>path</code> (check out
<a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/closer-look-svg-path-data/">Joni Trythall's
post</a> on
everything you can do with the path data attribute!)</li>
<li>text, like the simple <code>text</code>, the fancy <code>textPath</code> (essentially
<code>text</code> along an arbitrary <code>path</code>), and the handy <code>title</code> (for simple
tooltips similar to HTML's <code>title</code> attribute)</li>
<li>special elements to combine and manipulate these, like <code>mask</code>,
<code>clipPath</code>, and <code>pattern</code></li>
<li>other odds and ends, like the familiar anchor (<code>a</code>) from
HTML (with the neat feature that it can conform to whatever shape it
is wrapping, and only that part is interactive).</li>
</ul>
<p>Mozilla's MDN has a good
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG">reference</a> to all
the element types available.</p>
<p>The event system is very similar to what you're already used to in
HTML. Some events are different, but many familiar ones like <code>onClick</code>,
<code>onMouseEnter</code>, <code>onFocus</code>, and <code>onKeyUp</code> are there. Registering event
handlers is the same—svg elements expose <code>onEvent</code> attributes and you
can add your callback there. If you're using TypeScript, note that
you'll need to parameterize generic React synthetic event types with
<code>SVGElement</code> or just <code>Element</code> instead of <code>HTMLElement</code>. E.g.:</p>
<div data-language="ts"><pre><code><span>const</span> handleClick <span>=</span> <span>(</span>e<span>:</span> React<span>.</span>MouseEvent<span>&lt;</span>Element<span>&gt;</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span><span>void</span></span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>'clicked'</span><span>,</span> e<span>.</span>currentTarget<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="when-to-use-svg"><a href="#when-to-use-svg" aria-label="when to use svg permalink"></a>When to use SVG</h3>
<p>If you think SVG might be a good fit for some section of your UI,
there's a good chance you're right, but you should consider your
options. There are always trade-offs. If you don't go with SVG, your
other likely options in a React app are going to be sticking with
HTML, or using Canvas. You can <a href="https://pattle.github.io/simpsons-in-css/">do a
lot</a> with some plain divs
and CSS, so HTML may be suitable for more than you think. That said,
if you feel like your use case is pushing HTML to the breaking point
(or at least into a cryptic forest of obscure tags and esoteric
styling), maybe it's not the right fit. Remember <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan">Kernighan's
Law</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in
the first place. So if you're as clever as you can be when you write it,
how will you ever debug it?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum there's Canvas. Its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_mode_(computer_graphics)">immediate
mode</a>
paradigm means it can perform much better with huge datasets, but that
also makes it awkward to work with in React, and harder to script rich
interactivity. SVG (and HTML) have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retained_mode">retained
mode</a> model that's better
suited to building UIs.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, if it's reasonable to stick with HTML, <strong>stick
with HTML</strong>. If not, and you expect to work with a <strong>modest number of
data points</strong> (the threshold will vary based on your UX needs and your
performance expectations), <strong>SVG is a good bet</strong>. It will allow you to
build these components in a manner similar to building HTML
components, and to maintain a consistent look and feel with the rest
of your app. Otherwise, consider Canvas or even WebGL.</p>
<h3 id="svg-in-react"><a href="#svg-in-react" aria-label="svg in react permalink"></a>SVG in React</h3>
<p>The mechanics of using SVG elements in React are straightforward: Just
write a standard component and return an SVG tag instead of an HTML
tag. You only need to ensure you're nesting tags correctly and only
putting SVG elements inside an <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> tag (just as you should ensure
you're not putting block-level elements in a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>). There's no
special class to extend, no extra options to handle.</p>
<p>Here is a trivial SVG component:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>Greeting</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span><span>{</span>name<span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>text</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>hello </span><span>{</span>name<span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>text</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This uses the SVG <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> element instead of the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> you might
expect in an HTML component, but as you can see, it's otherwise
identical to an HTML component. To use this, just wrap it in an
<code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> element:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>Main</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>svg</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>g</span> <span>transform</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>translate(20,20)<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
        </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Greeting</span></span> <span>name</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>Maciek<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>g</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>svg</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>(Don't worry about the <code>&lt;g&gt;</code> element for now; we'll cover that next.)</p>
<h3 id="handling-layout-in-svg"><a href="#handling-layout-in-svg" aria-label="handling layout in svg permalink"></a>Handling Layout in SVG</h3>
<p>A big difference between HTML and SVG is layout: In HTML, the normal
layout flow positions elements on the page automatically according to
a set of <del>simple</del> rules. In SVG, it's up to you to place each
individual element exactly where it's supposed to go. There is <strong>no
built-in positioning</strong> mechanism at all, and the order of the tags
really only determines what gets drawn on top of what (like z-index in
HTML; SVG has no explicit z-index.)</p>
<p>The mechanism for this positioning is a coordinate system that's
standard in computer graphics: The origin is in the upper-left corner,
and positive x and y values move elements to the right and down,
respectively. You can think of it like an HTML document where all
elements are <code>position: absolute</code>, and <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are <code>top</code> and
<code>left</code>. Here's an example:</p>
<p>
  <svg width="800" height="300" viewBox="0 0 800 300"><g transform="translate(120,120)"><rect fill="red" width="30" height="30"></rect></g><g opacity="0.4"><text text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="hanging" x="60" y="120">x=<!-- -->120</text><path d="M 0,120 L120,120" stroke-dasharray="4 4" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"></path><polygon points="120,120 110,115 113,120 110,125" fill="black"></polygon></g><g opacity="0.4"><text text-anchor="start" dominant-baseline="middle" x="120" y="60">&nbsp;y=<!-- -->120</text><path d="M 120,0 L120,120" stroke-dasharray="4 4" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"></path><polygon transform="rotate(90 120,120)" points="120,120 110,115 113,120 110,125" fill="black"></polygon></g><g transform="translate(300,160)"><circle fill="powderblue" r="20"></circle></g><g opacity="0.4"><text text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="hanging" x="150" y="160">x=<!-- -->300</text><path d="M 0,160 L300,160" stroke-dasharray="4 4" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"></path><polygon points="300,160 290,155 293,160 290,165" fill="black"></polygon></g><g opacity="0.4"><text text-anchor="start" dominant-baseline="middle" x="300" y="80">&nbsp;y=<!-- -->160</text><path d="M 300,0 L300,160" stroke-dasharray="4 4" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"></path><polygon transform="rotate(90 300,160)" points="300,160 290,155 293,160 290,165" fill="black"></polygon></g><g transform="translate(520,200)"><text fill="green">some text</text></g><g opacity="0.4"><text text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="hanging" x="260" y="200">x=<!-- -->520</text><path d="M 0,200 L520,200" stroke-dasharray="4 4" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"></path><polygon points="520,200 510,195 513,200 510,205" fill="black"></polygon></g><g opacity="0.4"><text text-anchor="start" dominant-baseline="middle" x="520" y="100">&nbsp;y=<!-- -->200</text><path d="M 520,0 L520,200" stroke-dasharray="4 4" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"></path><polygon transform="rotate(90 520,200)" points="520,200 510,195 513,200 510,205" fill="black"></polygon></g></svg></p>
<p>As you can see, the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> offsets mean slightly different things
for different types of elements. For <code>rect</code>, it's the upper-left
corner. For <code>circle</code> and <code>ellipse</code>, it's the center (in fact, circles
and ellipses use <code>cx</code> and <code>cy</code> attributes instead of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> to
make this clearer). For text, it's a reference point, and the text's
placement relative to that point is configurable via attributes like
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/dominant-baseline">dominant-baseline</a>
and
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/text-anchor">text-anchor</a>
(by default, the text starts at the x position, with the baseline at
the y position.)</p>
<p>At first blush, this seems like it would make any non-trivial SVG
component a nightmare to put together, but we can use some SVG
features and some conventions to help us build complex modular
components that work well together.</p>
<p>Let's assume we're working with a certain explicit <code>width</code> and
<code>height</code> for our component. This can get tricky if you need your
component to be responsive, but we'll hand-wave around it for now; we
discuss that in more detail below.</p>
<p>In general, we've found a good approach for SVG components is to have
parents size and position their children by subdividing the parent's
own width and height. Parents determine each child's desired <code>width</code>
and <code>height</code> and pass those as props. We could also pass <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
to have children position themselves, but SVG provides a handy element
that simplifies this: the group (<code>&lt;g&gt;</code>). As its name suggests, the
element is a way to apply a set of properties to a group of children.
Most relevant for us is the <code>transform</code> attribute, specifically its
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/transform#Translate"><code>translate</code></a>
value. This lets us establish a new origin local to the group, offset
from the parent origin (which may be another <code>&lt;g&gt;</code>!) by the specified
x and y values. This is perfect for positioning children, since you
can easily do so in the parent. The children themselves can pretend
they're positioned at the origin, so they only have to worry about
their width and height, and what to render within that space. In fact,
this pattern is so useful, we have a helper component to do this:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>Translate</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span><span>{</span>x<span>=</span><span>0</span><span>,</span>y<span>=</span><span>0</span><span>,</span>children<span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span>x <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>!</span>y<span>)</span> <span>return</span> children<span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>g</span> <span>transform</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span><span>`</span><span>translate(</span><span><span>${</span>x<span>}</span></span><span>,</span><span><span>${</span>y<span>}</span></span><span>)</span><span>`</span></span><span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>{</span>children<span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>g</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Even though subdividing space like this in SVG component hierarchies
is a good rule of thumb, sometimes it may not be a good fit for some
part of your UI. Since <code>&lt;g&gt;</code> is <strong>not</strong> a bounded container like a
sized <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with <code>overflow: hidden</code>, the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>
pattern is just metadata for children to follow as a guideline. If
that pattern gets in the way, you can break the rules and have
children draw outside these bounds (though the result may be harder to
reason about).</p>
<p>Another useful pattern is to have components specify all the sizing
and positioning metadata in constants at the top of the component:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>Chart</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span><span>{</span> data <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<p>Design is about constantly closing the gap between what users expect from your product and what it actually does. Product teams try to close this chasm every day, whether by user testing, tracking metrics and behavior, or seeking feedback. In attempts to bridge this user experience communication gap, teams often forget the most important thing — the text.</p>



<p>Product copy, or the text found on user interfaces, is the most under-leveraged part of product development today. Here are a few reasons why.</p>



<h5>Editing copy is your highest ROI lever</h5>



<p>Unlike almost anything else in product development, editing copy doesn’t require any engineering or design lift. Working on copy is about <em>maximizing the utility of your existing feature set</em>.</p>



<p>In many cases, the cheapest and most practical solution to a problem is well-written copy. Rather than committing a team’s time to building an entirely new feature, editing the copy goes a long way in user retention and engagement.</p>



<p>Whether it’s a clearer error state that helps users self-correct or an empty state that helps users get started, editing text can directly affect metrics. [1] It’s easy for the conversation around copy to revolve around marketing copy (thinking about text on a landing page or a marketing email and whether or not it converts), but this conversation around the importance of text needs to shift to product as well.</p>



<p>Of course, there’s no substitute for poor design, but bad copy can make even the best designs ineffective.</p>



<h5>Product copy is your most direct line of communication to users</h5>



<p>As John Maeda expressed with his <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://vimeo.com/208035080" target="_blank">2017 Design in Tech report</a>, “Words are really important because the graphics don’t make sense sometimes.”</p>



<p>Product copy makes expected user behavior <em>explicit</em>. It’s your chance to communicate intent. In being what your users actually read, the text anchors the user experience and bridges gaps in expectation. As UX writer Ryan Cordell&nbsp;points out:</p>



<div><p>“Microcopy is how your product communicates. It provides answers, feedback, comfort, guidance, encouragement and more. If we fail to design the words we use, this still communicates something to the user. It says we can’t or don’t want to help. It says we don’t care as much as we should. And that’s catastrophic for the customer experience.” [2]</p></div>



<p>Ultimately in building a product, you’re optimizing for user understanding — to surface the value of the features that your team spent so long to build.</p>



<h5>Text is what guides users when they venture off the happy path</h5>



<p>It’s often easy for designers and PM’s to optimize for the happy path: the user experience that most closely aligns with their own expectations of how the product should be used. However, we all know that expectations often exist in isolation from how people actually use your product — and much of the burden of steering users back on track <em>relies on the text</em>.</p>



<p>Copy serves as your product’s guardrails. Whether it’s an error message, a new user experience, or an empty state, it’s often <em>text</em> that guides users when they don’t know what to expect. In a study conducted by Microsoft Azure’s design team, user test errors<em> decreased by 44%</em> after copy changes alone. [3]</p>



<p>It’s in these moments of mismatched expectations that clarity is most critical. This is especially true as the role of software expands. From health-tech to purchasing houses and cars, the sole responsibility of guiding people through complex and important decisions is now carried by the digital experience.</p>



<p>Often times, however, because these non-ideal users journeys don’t get designed, users are greeted with generic text written ad-hoc by the last person that touches it.</p>



<h5>Copy exists from end to end</h5>



<p>Almost every single step of the product development process works in verticals — designers work in design tools and then pass designs off to developers that work in devtools. The same verticalization of tooling and work applies to almost every other step of building a software product with a team.</p>



<p>The <em>exception</em> to this verticalization of product development is the copy, which exists from the very beginning (specs, drafts) all the way to the very end (in the final product) and is touched by everyone from design to engineering to legal to marketing.</p>



<p>Rather than existing as one-offs, the product text works in a system to build trust for users. Like the narrator in a story, copy sets the context and defines the goals. [4] Thinking about copy early means being intentional about the information you convey to users — and drives design decisions like progressive disclosure and information architecture.</p>



<hr>



<p>Let’s be clear: writing good copy is <em>hard</em>. It might not be glanceably flashy the same way a Dribbble post might be. Text often “looks” the same in a design at first- and second-pass, even after edits. Reworking copy can be painstaking — and requires an in-depth understanding of both the product and the user.</p>



<p>But as we want to build and design products that shape how people interact with the world, we shouldn’t overlook the obvious when communicating: the words.</p>



<hr>



















<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p>



<div><div>
<div><p>[0] In full disclosure, our belief that text should be first-class in building product has led Jolena and I to building <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://dittowords.com/" target="_blank">Ditto</a>. 🤗</p></div>
</div></div>



<p>[1] Even really simple copy changes change produce enormous ROI. <a href="https://www.directyourbookings.com/blog/marketing/convert-better-with-ux-writing-hotel-case-study-by-google/">One example</a> of many is the 17% increase in engagement when Google Travel replaced “Book a Room” with “Check Availability”.</p>



<p>[2] You can find more great excerpts from Ryan’s post on communication theory and microcopy <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/3-communication-theories-that-will-help-you-write-better-microcopy-and-make-better-products-4df25571ca6f">here</a>.</p>



<p>[3] In addition to decreased user test errors, the metrics-driven insights found by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyliehansen">Kylie Hansen</a>‘s team impacted NPS, customer retention, active users, and more. She goes over some of it <a href="https://ellessmedia.com/csi/kylie-hansen/">here</a>.</p>



<p>[4a] A scenario that often requires high trust is a monetary transaction. Increasing transparency by clearly surfacing what to expect is something that <a href="https://uxplanet.org/this-is-ux-writing-at-its-very-best-2806f3f386e0">both Airbnb and Amazon do well</a>.</p>



<p>[4b] Over coffee, <a href="https://medium.com/@jsaito">John Saito</a> once mentioned to us that the product of Dropbox itself had more words than a Harry Potter novel!</p>

					<p><em><span>Project Post</span></em></p>
<p><span>Today, the CNCF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) voted to accept Contour as an incubation-level hosted project.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://projectcontour.io/"><span>Contour</span></a><span> is a high-performance ingress controller for Kubernetes that provides a control plane for </span><a href="https://envoyproxy.io/"><span>Envoy</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>“One of the most important steps for running workloads at scale with Kubernetes is to implement efficient Layer 7 traffic ingress management,” said Matt Klein, software engineer at Lyft and TOC sponsor for Contour. “Contour fills a common operational gap by providing a way for users to access applications within a Kubernetes cluster. As Contour is already integrated with Envoy, it is a natural fit for CNCF, and we look forward to helping the project build its community.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Contour works by deploying Envoy as a reverse proxy and load balancer. Contour supports dynamic configuration updates and multi-team Kubernetes clusters with the ability to limit the Namespaces that may configure virtual hosts and TLS credentials as well as provide advanced load balancing strategies.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“We believe CNCF can play a big role in shaping the future of ingress controllers, a critical part of any cloud native infrastructure,” said Michael Michael, Contour maintainer, and director of product management at VMware. “We are excited to have a vendor neutral home, encouraging more companies and contributors to join our community, contribute, and help us deliver on the vision of Contour.”</span></p>
<p><span>Contour has been adopted by a number of well-known organizations and enterprises in production, including Adobe, Kinvolk, Kintone, PhishLabs, and Replicated. Adobe has</span><a href="https://youtu.be/39FLsSc2P-Y?t=83"><span> adopted Contour</span></a><span> as its ingress controller for “Project Ethos”, a multi-tenant Kubernetes based platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Main Contour Features:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Envoy Inside: Contour is built as the control plane for Envoy, the high performance L7 proxy and load balancer</span></li>
<li><span>Flexible Architecture: Contour can be deployed as either a Kubernetes deployment or daemonset</span></li>
<li><span>Multi-team support: Safely support ingress in multi-team Kubernetes clusters</span></li>
<li><span>TLS Certificate Delegation: Administrators can delegate wildcard certificate access more securely</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Notable Milestones:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>329 Contributors&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>91 Committers</span></li>
<li><span>2.3k GitHub Stars</span></li>
<li><span>375 Forks</span></li>
<li><span>48 Releases</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>“Modern distributed systems rely on networking and connectivity, making ingress controllers for Kubernetes an essential piece of architecture,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. “Contour is a logical complement to Envoy and makes it easier to consume in a cloud native, multi-team environment. As Envoy is an incredibly popular graduated project, we look forward to seeing what Contour will accomplish as part of CNCF.”</span></p>
<p><span>Contour has an active </span><a href="https://github.com/projectcontour/community/blob/master/ROADMAP.md"><span>roadmap</span></a><span> and plans to add support for </span><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/service-apis"><span>Kubernetes Service APIs</span></a><span> and for routing services across Kubernetes clusters. The team also plans to enable support for Envoy features like rate limiting, auth, and access log service.</span></p>
<p><span>In 2017 Contour was created at Heptio, which was then acquired by VMware in 2018. The team released v1.0 in November 2019.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As a CNCF hosted project, joining incubating technologies like OpenTracing, gRPC, CNI, Notary, NATS, Linkerd, Rook, etcd, OPA, CRI-O, TiKV, CloudEvents, Falco, Argo, Dragonfly, and SPIFFE and SPIRE, Contour is part of a neutral foundation aligned with its technical interests, as well as the larger Linux Foundation, which provides governance, marketing support, and community outreach.</span></p>
<p><span>Every CNCF project has an associated maturity level: sandbox, incubating, or graduated. For more information on maturity requirements for each level, please visit the </span><a href="https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/graduation_criteria.adoc"><span>CNCF Graduation Criteria</span></a><span>.</span></p>

And from a business perspective, it can let you determine cost based on customer seats instead of unbounded number of calls to a cloud provider.</p><h2 id="demo-application-smart-lighting">Demo Application: Smart Lighting</h2><p>Here is a web demonstration application that uses <a href="https://picovoice.ai/products/porcupine">Porcupine</a> (wake word detection) and <a href="https://picovoice.ai/products/rhino">Rhino</a> (Speech-to-Intent) engines to control smart lights in a home.</p><p><span><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>Welcome to the smart home!

You can see more web demos <a href="https://picovoice.ai/demos/">here</a>.</p><h2 id="how-to-embed-voice-ai-in-the-browser">How to embed Voice AI in the browser</h2><p>To achieve offline voice AI, we can use speech technology from Picovoice. Picovoice engines run in modern web browsers via WebAssembly. A typical use case involves providing the engines realtime audio input from the microphone, and receiving events back (e.g. hotword detected).</p><p>The core of running any Picovoice engine in the browser is simply three files: a WebAssembly module, its wrapper, and a binding file. The binding provides a factory method for creating an instance of the engine. The engine fires a callback to signal that the WASM has finished loading, accepts frames of audio, and returns the engine results.</p><p>We will expand on this foundation with additional steps to setup streaming audio, request microphone permission, and downsample audio to the required format. We’ve provided demo code to assist with those tasks.</p><h3 id="web-audio-api-and-microphone-access">Web Audio API and Microphone access</h3><p>Picovoice uses the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API">Web Audio API</a> to process streaming audio. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices">MediaDevices API</a> is used to access the microphone. The user must explicitly grant permission to access the microphone before any audio processing can occur. This is mandatory due to browsers’ security model. Additionally, the browser requires an HTTPS connection to allow microphone access (for testing locally, HTTP will suffice).</p><h3 id="web-voice-processor">Web Voice Processor</h3><p>Picovoice engines accept industry standard 16KHz audio for speech processing. When accessing microphone audio, we need to downsample it to this format. We also need to ask for permission from the user to access their microphone, and connect the input to the downsampler. To handle these tasks we have provided the <a href="https://github.com/Picovoice/web-voice-processor">Web Voice Processor</a> package. It is also available on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@picovoice/web-voice-processor">npm</a>.</p><h3 id="web-workers">Web Workers</h3><p>Picovoice recommends using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API">Web Workers</a> to run the engines in the background. Workers separate the speech processing from the main JavaScript thread.</p><p><img src="https://picovoice.ai/static/callbacks-c8a5873581c231ecd10793ca212b2f8d.svg" alt="Callbacks and Workers"></p><p>The demo code includes Porcupine and Rhino web worker scripts. They communicate with managers in the main thread using <code>postMessage()</code>. In addition, the Web Voice Processor performs downsampling via its own dedicated worker.</p><h3 id="open-source-demo-applications">Open Source Demo Applications</h3><p>We have provided demo code for the Porcupine and Rhino engines (including running both together) that will run in a recent web browser without transpilation required.</p><p>The Porcupine demo allows you to control a smart lamp with always-listening commands.</p><p>The Smart Lighting demo uses Rhino to handle smart home lighting with natural language commands like “dim the living room lights”. There’s also an always listening version of this demo that uses Porcupine as a trigger to wake the smart home lighting and then use the natural language commands.</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/Picovoice/porcupine/tree/master/demo/javascript">Porcupine Smart Lamp</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/Picovoice/rhino/tree/master/demo/javascript/standalone">Rhino Smart Home Lighting</a> (standalone push-to-talk)</li><li><a href="https://github.com/Picovoice/rhino/tree/master/demo/javascript/always-listening">Rhino Smart Home Lighting</a> (always-listening using Porcupine)</li></ul><p><span><p>The code provided is for demonsration purposes and we do not recommend or support linking to the source code directly.

How do I use this with e.g. Webpack?</h3><p>The JavaScript code provided is fairly conservative and does not use ES6 and newer language features, notably modules (that said, a modern browser is required to work with all of the aforementioned Audio, Worker, and WASM APIs). You may wish to e.g. convert one of the <a href="https://github.com/Picovoice/rhino/blob/master/demo/javascript/shared/ppn_rhn_manager.js">Manager IIFEs</a> to a class and provide a module export which would allow you to elegantly integrate it with a typical Webpack/Babel setup.</p><p>Alternatively, you can simply add the scripts as-is to the HTML document head using something like <a href="https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet">React Helmet</a>, and provide them in a static/public folder with your web application.</p><h3 id="which-picovoice-engines-run-in-the-browser">Which Picovoice Engines run in the browser?</h3><p>All of them.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Engine</th><th>Purpose</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://picovoice.ai/products/porcupine/">Porcupine</a></td><td>Wake word detection</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://picovoice.ai/products/rhino/">Rhino</a></td><td>Speech-to-intent (NLU)</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://picovoice.ai/products/cheetah/">Cheetah</a></td><td>Speech-to-text (realtime; live feedback)</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://picovoice.ai/products/cheetah/">Leopard</a></td><td>Speech-to-text (file-based; accuracy boost)</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://picovoice.ai/products/octopus/">Octopus</a></td><td>Speech-to-index (voice search)</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="how-do-i-create-custom-wake-words-or-speech-to-intent-contexts-for-the-web">How do I create custom wake words or speech-to-intent contexts for the web?</h3><p>You can use the <a href="https://picovoice.ai/console/">Picovoice Console</a> to create wake words and design and train speech-to-intent contexts.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Desmos-Art-Guide.jpg" alt="Math Vault — The Definitive Desmos Art Guide to Computational Sketching" width="800" height="480" title="Desmos Art Guide" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20480'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Desmos-Art-Guide.jpg"></p><p>If you’re of the type who enjoys playing around with graphing calculator, then you might be interested in the so-called <strong>Desmos Art</strong>. These are basically&nbsp;<em>pictures</em> and <em>animations</em>&nbsp;created in <a href="https://www.desmos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Desmos</a>&nbsp;primarily through the clever use of <em>equations</em> and <em>inequalities</em> — among other features such as <em>tables</em>, <em>animating sliders</em> and <em>regression&nbsp;models</em>.&nbsp;Indeed, if you go to <a href="https://www.desmos.com/art" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this official staff pick page</a>, you&nbsp;should&nbsp;see that a whole bunch of creative artworks were already being created — anything from&nbsp;<em>cartoon characters</em>,&nbsp;<em>landscape</em>&nbsp;to <em>logos</em> and <em>portraits</em>.</p><p>But here’s&nbsp;a&nbsp;problem: when you reach a Desmos artwork page, you&nbsp;get to see the end-result with all the <em>equations</em> and <em>inequalities</em>, without necessarily having any clue about how the sketching process comes about from the beginning to the end:</p><ul><li>Why does this weird-looking equation pop out from <em>nowhere</em>?</li><li>How did the author know that $3.982$ is the <em>leading coefficient</em> to use?</li><li>And how did those numbers get so precise up to <em>four</em>&nbsp;decimals digits?</li></ul><p>To remedy this situation, we came up with a laborious and&nbsp;interesting solution: we decided to go out there and create a new Desmos sketch from scratch, and work backward to comment a bit on&nbsp;the <em>steps</em>, <em>procedures</em> and <em>reasoning</em> involved&nbsp;in the sketching process —&nbsp;as we go through the different&nbsp;stages and portions&nbsp;of the drawing.</p><p>And with that, let’s proceed straight into our Desmos Art guide in <strong>computational sketching</strong>, which — as you might have guessed — is going to be both fun and informative — even if you have no intention whatsoever of using any graphing calculator in the near future. <span id="more-7609"></span></p><h2 id="s1"><span id="Step_1_Initial_Setup_%E2%80%94_Source_Picture"></span><a href="#toc">Step 1: Initial Setup — Source&nbsp;Picture</a><span></span></h2><p>Unless you are some kind of sketching guru — which we certainly are not — it’s generally better to&nbsp;base the&nbsp;sketching on some underlying model: some picture that you actually want to draw; some picture that&nbsp;you can rely upon in case the&nbsp;sketching derails&nbsp;by a huge&nbsp;margin.</p><p>And in case it’s&nbsp;not clear enough, you should only choose a picture that you really, <em>really</em> enjoy sketching&nbsp;— something that you can derive a&nbsp;whole lot of&nbsp;satisfaction from. This is because unlike ordinary <em>pencil-and-eraser sketching</em>, sketching in Desmos has to be done by&nbsp;filling the command lines with <strong>equations</strong>, <strong>tables</strong> and <strong>inequalities</strong>, so that&nbsp;if you can’t fuel enough passion into a drawing, then the time and effort invested into reproducing it&nbsp;is&nbsp;probably not going to worth it.</p><p>Also, when choosing a picture, take good care to select one that is <em>not</em> too difficult to draw. Otherwise, you might have to regret your decision much later when you’re already, say, 21 hours into the process. Of course, you&nbsp;don’t want to make the picture too easy either, as it might not be much of a gratifying experience if you&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;that&nbsp;way.</p><p>In our case, using the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/gold/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit Gold</a>&nbsp;membership recently awarded to us, we went out there and created&nbsp;our first very own&nbsp;signature <em>Reddit alien avatar</em>:</p><div id="attachment_8064"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8064" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Vault-Redditbot.png" alt="Math Vault Snoovtar — Redditlady and Redditdog" width="520" height="520" title="Math Vault Redditbot" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20520%20520'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Vault-Redditbot.png"></p><p id="caption-attachment-8064">Guess who’s in the house? The <strong>Math Vault Snoovtar</strong>! (<em>alien avatar</em> in Redditese)</p></div><p>For the lack of better terms, let’s just call these lovely creatures <em>Math Vault Redditlady</em> and <em>Redditdog</em>, respectively. Now,&nbsp;does this logo make a good choice as a <em>source image</em>? We certainly think it does:</p><ul><li><strong>Passion Level</strong>: Since we only create avatars that we like, channeling energy into recreating the creatures invented in part by ourselves is definitely not an issue.</li><li><strong>Complexity</strong>: Both the Redditlady and the Redditdog have very&nbsp;<em>well-defined </em>borders and colors,&nbsp;making it a formidable&nbsp;challenge that’s not&nbsp;too intimidating.</li></ul><p>And with both criteria passed, we proceed to happily import&nbsp;our avatar image into Desmos. By default, Desmos likes to set the <strong>origin</strong> $(0,0)$ as the <em>center</em> of the image, and that is a good choice for most purposes. However, depending on the size of the&nbsp;source image, sometimes it makes sense to consider rescaling it so that <em>at the default zoom level</em>, the image occupies around 70% of the <strong>graphing grid</strong>&nbsp;either in height or in width. If the image is too small, then it’s hard to appreciate any&nbsp;fine detail, and if it’s too big, then one&nbsp;might&nbsp;have a hard time focusing on the big picture — literally.</p><p>In our case, since the&nbsp;avatar is&nbsp;just about the right size to start with, we decided to keep the <strong>dimension</strong> of the image to the default $10 \times 10$ setting at the end. We also didn’t alter&nbsp;the image’s&nbsp;<strong>aspect ratio</strong>&nbsp;either, which in many cases aren’t really&nbsp;necessary anyway.</p><p>But just to drive the message home a bit, setting up a&nbsp;source image correctly from the get-go is more important than it seems, since the last thing we&nbsp;want to be doing is to, say,&nbsp;<em>rescale</em> the image to an appropriate size after being&nbsp;already halfway through the sketching process.</p><h2 id="s2"><span id="Step_2_Divide_and_Conquer"></span><a href="#toc">Step 2: Divide and Conquer</a><span></span></h2><p>How do you deal with a huge task that seems impossible to complete? You partition the task into smaller subtasks. That is, tasks that are so small that you actually enjoy doing them!</p><p>In particular, when it comes to sketching in Desmos, you want&nbsp;to section the picture into different <strong>portions</strong>, each of which can be&nbsp;finished in a reasonable amount of time, so&nbsp;that when it comes to the time of&nbsp;sketching, you focus on one&nbsp;single portion and one&nbsp;single&nbsp;portion only.</p><p>In our case, since we know that sketching the entire Redditlady and its companion pet can be quite a challenge, instead of resorting to despair, we divide the entire avatar into 6 portions — from the top to the bottom:</p><div><div><ul><li>Hand &amp; Rubik’s Cube</li><li>Skirt</li><li>Redditdog</li></ul></div></div><div><figure><img src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Desmos-Folders.jpg" alt="Sketching in Desmos: Using Folder to Organize Command Lines" width="470" height="574" title="Desmos Folders" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20470%20574'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Desmos-Folders.jpg"><figcaption>Math Vault Redditbots&nbsp;cut into 6 pieces. Neat!</figcaption></figure></div><p> By inspection, while we see that most of these portions are&nbsp;relatively simple&nbsp;to implement, we still anticipate some challenges ahead of us when it comes to the&nbsp;Armor portion. In an attempt to make the Armor less intimidating, we proceed to&nbsp;subdivide it&nbsp;further into 7&nbsp;<strong>subportions</strong>:</p><div><div><ul><li>Left Shoulder</li><li>Right Shoulder</li><li>Collar</li><li>Arm</li></ul></div><div><ul><li>Chest</li><li>“Lungs”</li><li>“Outer Lungs”</li></ul></div></div><p>With the gist of our&nbsp;organisational structure now settled, we then proceed to create a&nbsp;<strong>Desmos folder</strong>&nbsp;for each of the general portions, all of the while making a mental note that every command line pertaining to a specific&nbsp;portion should&nbsp;be <em>dragged</em> into its&nbsp;associated folder — if it’s not already in there.</p><p>And while Desmos doesn’t really support <em>folder nesting</em> at this point, there’s nothing preventing us from using&nbsp;<strong>comment lines</strong> to provide labels for the subportions. True, while this level of organization could&nbsp;be an <em>overkill</em> for a simple picture, as the complexity&nbsp;of the&nbsp;picture increases, structuring the command lines this way can make&nbsp;<em>line identification</em> and <em>future reference </em>substantially easier.</p><div><figure><img src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Armor-Subportions.gif" alt="Sketching in Desmos: Using Comment To Label Subportions of the Image" width="414" height="387" title="Armor Subportions" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20414%20387'%3E%3C/svg%3E"><figcaption> A list of command lines under the Armor folder.

We call this <strong>portion crunching</strong>, and&nbsp;is done in part to ensure that the work completed&nbsp;with minimal resistance&nbsp;and mental blocks.

However, since these curve&nbsp;segments&nbsp;tend&nbsp;interact with each other, it would be hard for us to draw these segments <em>sequentially</em>&nbsp;— as would be done in ordinary pencil-and-eraser sketching.&nbsp;<span>Instead, we prefer to resort to the strategy&nbsp;as outlined below:</span></p><blockquote><ol><li>Model a curve segment using an appropriate class of <strong>equations</strong>, and leave its&nbsp;graph&nbsp;with the&nbsp;full domain <em>intact</em>.</li><li>Do the modeling for <em>each</em>&nbsp;of the curve segments in the close figure.</li><li>Cut off the excessive parts of&nbsp;each curve — by imposing <strong>restrictions</strong> on the&nbsp;associated equation.</li></ol></blockquote><p>In particular, we&nbsp;want the curve trimming to&nbsp;happen at the very end, because&nbsp;once the curve modeling are done for each curve segment in&nbsp;a close figure, Desmos will map out all&nbsp;the <strong>intersection points</strong>&nbsp;along with&nbsp;their coordinates — the latter of which provide key information as to where&nbsp;to cut off the&nbsp;curves, and might not be available had&nbsp;we&nbsp;decided to trim the curves off from the get-go.</p><p>In actuality though, we’ll&nbsp;probably spend more time modeling the curve segments rather than trimming&nbsp;them&nbsp;— as there are&nbsp;simply too many&nbsp;curves&nbsp;in too many&nbsp;different shapes and forms.

<p>If you are bootstrapping like us and you can’t burn money on CPC campaigns, you need to find out clever ways to acquire new customers.</p>



<p>For us, it’s even worst because we are in a very crowded market and the live chat keyword has an incredible high bid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have tried several times to purchase live chat keywords on google and other PPC programs like <a href="https://www.capterra.com/p/173977/Customerly/reviews/">Capterra</a>.</p>



<p>We never had a satisfying result from them.</p>



<p>They are very expensive in a range of 20$ per click on google and starting at 2$ per click on Capterra.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The truth is we have never had a campaign with a proper return of the investment.</p>



<p>We decided then to focus on channels that always worked for us:</p>



<ul><li>Referrals</li><li>Partnerships</li><li>Integrations</li></ul>



<p>We have grown from 0 to 6000 signups for free thanks to the “powered by” label you can find in our live chat of the basic plan accounts.</p>



<h2>The WordPress Live Chat plugin Integration</h2>



<p>When we decided to help our WordPress customers with an easier integration of the live chat within their WordPress website we never thought it was such an incredible opportunity of growth.</p>



<p>The Live Chat WordPress plugin was quite easy to develop, it’s just a wrapper of the JavaScript code with some tweaks to fetch user’s data automatically for our customers.</p>



<p>People were searching for a quick live chat to use on their websites and we have a solution for them.</p>



<p>The plugin itself took 10 hours of coding. It was very basic and was doing its job quite well in terms of functionalities.</p>



<p>When you installed the first version of the live chat plugin of Customerly you could do an onboarding that redirects you to the Customerly dashboard to complete the customization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you had complete the submission on Customerly you needed to grab the project id and paste it in a small input textbox, save and then the live chat was appearing on your website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Magic right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nope.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It took a while to understand how to optimize the onboarding experience, but before talking about this, let me start on how we have optimized the SEO within the WordPress’ plugin directory.</p>



<p>Follow me from here because I’m going to share with you the exact optimization strategies that I’ve learned by bringing our live chat WordPress plugin from the 33 positions for the<strong>&nbsp;live chat</strong>&nbsp;keyword to the 4 positions. Ranking above HubSpot.</p>

<h2>Choose the right Keywords</h2>



<p>For us it is quite easy, the keyword to focus on are three:</p>



<ul><li>Live Chat</li><li>Free Live Chat</li><li>Live Chat Free</li></ul>



<p>Think about in terms of anything related to your product that can be interesting for someone searching on the directory.</p>



<p>For example, we do offer a <a href="https://www.customerly.io/en/email-marketing-newsletter-template-builder?utm_campaign=wpoptim&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=Customerly">newsletter</a> and <a href="https://www.customerly.io/en/visual-marketing-sales-funnel-automation?utm_campaign=wpoptim&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=Customerly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">funnel</a> service at a smaller cost than MailChimp and it can be integrated easily with MailMunch and Elementor forms.</p>



<p>We decided to use these keywords in the FAQ to let people find the plugin since they are related to what we do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I strongly suggest you focus on one single keyword for the title and the presentation though.</p>



<p>People need a <a href="https://www.customerly.io/en/live-chat-software-for-customer-support?utm_campaign=WPplugin&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=Customerly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Live Chat for their website</a>, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Where do you go to search for a WordPress plugin?</p>



<p>Google or WordPress directory.</p>



<p>The WordPress directory itself has enormous traffic you can turn into your customer acquisition flow for free.</p>



<p>We cannot know exactly the amount of searches for each keyword on the WordPress plugin directory but we have two ways to understand to which one has more traffic:</p>



<ul><li>The google keyword planner is a good start to understand volumes.</li><li>Check the first 3 plugins that are listed for a specific keyword and analyze their daily downloads.</li></ul>



<p>You can check ANY WordPress plugin performance by adding /advanced/ at the end of the URL like this: https://wordpress.org/plugins/customerly/advanced/</p>



<p>Sum their daily downloads and you will get a sense of the traffic you can get from that keyword.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>The Plugin Readme</strong></h2>



<p>When we released the first version I didn’t know the readme was the most important part of the game and was the last thing I’ve focused on.</p>



<p>In fact, that single file alone is the reason why today we have got 13k B2B signups for free.</p>



<p><em>That one plus a few other tricks.</em></p>



<p>I thought it was just a description of the plugin without any importance for ranking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I’ve written a small description on how to install the plugin and link the chat to the website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Very nerdy and not attractive at all.</p>



<p>I started wondering if there was a way to rank on the top 10 and this is my journey to it.</p>



<p>There are very few articles online on how to optimize your WordPress plugin to rank on the directory and no SaaS to keep track of your SEO improvements while optimizing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, with my curiosity, I started to AB testing almost everything I could.</p>



<p>And it worked.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>The WordPress Directory Competitor Analysis&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>First of all, I started by analyzing the competitors for the live chat keyword.</p>



<p>I’ve found out a weird behaviour of the ranking algorithm: a bunch of live chat plugins with very few active installs were ranking higher than others with hundreds of thousands of installs.</p>



<p>As you can see from the screenshot above when we ranked above HubSpot we had just 500+ active installs versus 80,000+ active installs of HubSpot.</p>



<p>That’s when I started thinking, we can rank in the top 10 too even if we have just released with very few active installs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But how?</p>



<p>So I started with optimizing the readme in 3 ways:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Adding Keywords in the Title</li><li>Adding Keywords in the small description&nbsp;</li><li>A lot of keywords in the long descriptions</li></ul>



<p>Below you can see how many times we added the keyword live chat in the Readme when we have updated it.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Plugin_directory_optimization_for_Live_Chat.jpg?fit=1024%2C789&amp;ssl=1" alt="WordPress Live Chat plugin Readme" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Plugin_directory_optimization_for_Live_Chat.jpg?w=1542&amp;ssl=1 1542w, https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Plugin_directory_optimization_for_Live_Chat.jpg?resize=300%2C231&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Plugin_directory_optimization_for_Live_Chat.jpg?resize=1024%2C789&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Plugin_directory_optimization_for_Live_Chat.jpg?resize=768%2C592&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Plugin_directory_optimization_for_Live_Chat.jpg?resize=1536%2C1183&amp;ssl=1 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></figure>



<p>I noticed 2 minutes after the submission of the new readme version we ranked 20 positions higher.</p>



<p>The difference between Google and WordPress ranking is that WordPress is immediately updated.</p>



<p>So you can immediately know if you have done something wrong or good.</p>



<p>I started A/B testing and it worked quite well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We were on the first page (top 20 results) and I knew I could do something else to optimize.</p>



<p>We decided to extend the optimization to the FAQ.</p>



<p>So I started adding keywords to the question and within the answer.</p>



<p>It worked great as well! A few minutes later we were ranking in the top 9 positions for the live chat keyword.</p>



<p>Bam!</p>



<p>The day after we saw a spike of installs but the signups were still very few.</p>



<h2><strong>The importance of active install growth&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>At the time, to install the live chat you needed to follow a link to the Customerly dashboard from your WordPress dashboard to signup.</p>



<p>This process was tricky and a lot of WordPress users were abandoning the signup because they felt it was not a WordPress integrated experience.</p>



<p>Since the signup process was long and boring people were installing the plugin and after few days uninstalling it because of that.</p>



<p>This behaviour brought down the active install growth percentage and we started losing a few positions.</p>



<p>This is what we have done to fix this. 👇🏻</p>



<p>The signup process and linking between your WordPress website and the Customerly live chat ID was a 10-step long painful process.</p>



<p>We lowered down this signups process to 2 steps:</p>



<ul><li>Add a password</li><li>Click a button</li></ul>



<p>And you are now ready to go.</p>



<p>We focused on removing all possible frictions.</p>



<p>That was it.</p>



<p>That brought 10 times the installs we had before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So the signups.</p>



<p>“Make it easy” and do not over complicate the process is always the key.</p>

<p>I wasn’t still happy with the rank, I wanted to be in the top 5 positions.</p>



<p>But how?</p>



<h2>WordPress Support Forum</h2>



<p>I discovered that forum’s support requests are public and ranked. I started wondering if they could affect the ranking.</p>



<p>If you think about it, the more support requests related to the keyword you are optimizing you have, the more people might find the right plugin in what you have.</p>



<p>So I thought to send people there to ask for support about the live chat.</p>



<p>After 5 support tickets with the keywords in the question and the answer made the trick.</p>



<p>You can access to the support with this url: <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/customerly/">https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/customerly/</a></p>



<p>We were above HubSpot and just below LiveChat. Boom 💥&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Are Ratings really important?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>I started wondering if ratings might affect the ranking as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I was analyzing the positions on the charts, I’ve created a small piece of software to check everyday movements of the plugins, their reviews, average review and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Live_Chat_downloads.jpg?fit=1024%2C497&amp;ssl=1" alt="WP Live Chat downloads SaaS " srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Live_Chat_downloads.jpg?w=1256&amp;ssl=1 1256w, https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Live_Chat_downloads.jpg?resize=300%2C146&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Live_Chat_downloads.jpg?resize=1024%2C497&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Live_Chat_downloads.jpg?resize=768%2C373&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></figure>



<p>It seemed to be not as important as the support tickets.</p>



<p>But I wanted to give them a try.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The strategy here was simple and lean-to implement. I’ve added two ways to ask for reviews:</p>



<ul><li>Customerly Funnels with a Bonus Email (5 minutes)</li><li>Review Links in the plugin (30 minutes of develop time)</li></ul>



<p>The Funnel</p>



<figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Customerly_Live_Chat_Plugin_Funnel_for_Reviews-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C626&amp;ssl=1" alt="Funnel for Live Chat WP Reviews" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Customerly_Live_Chat_Plugin_Funnel_for_Reviews-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;ssl=1 2560w, https://i2.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Customerly_Live_Chat_Plugin_Funnel_for_Reviews-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C183&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Customerly_Live_Chat_Plugin_Funnel_for_Reviews-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C626&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Customerly_Live_Chat_Plugin_Funnel_for_Reviews-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C469&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Customerly_Live_Chat_Plugin_Funnel_for_Reviews-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C938&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Customerly_Live_Chat_Plugin_Funnel_for_Reviews-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1251&amp;ssl=1 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></figure>



<p>I’ve created a behavioural funnel with <a href="https://www.customerly.io/en/visual-marketing-sales-funnel-automation?utm_campaign=wpoptim&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=Customerly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Customerly Funnels</a> to deliver an email to all our WordPress amazing users after few days from the install of their Customerly Live Chat on their website.</p>



<div id=""><div><div><div><h3>Get the most out of your SaaS by using Behavioural Funnels</h3><p>Trigger messages or emails based on your customers’ behaviour on your SaaS</p></div></div></div></div>



<p>The email goes straight to the point: if you leave an honest review of the live chat, we will give you the Pro plan for free for 3 months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the actual email body:</p>



<div><div>
<p>” Hey {{name}},<br>thank you so much for installing our WordPress plugin 🙏</p>



<p>We have a bonus for you!</p>



<p>🔥 3 months of PRO plan when you drop us a sincere&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/customerly/reviews/#new-post">WordPress review.</a></p>



<p>👉 To get the 3 months for free all you need to do is:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/customerly/reviews/#new-post">Write a sincere review here</a></li><li>Reply to this email with your username you have used.</li></ul>



<p>Once we receive your email back we will personally send you a coupon code with your 3 months bonus.</p>



<p>Done deal?”</p>








</div></div>



<p>[I’ve crafted and shared with everyone a ready-to-use <a href="https://www.customerly.io/en/visual-marketing-sales-funnel-automation?utm_campaign=wpoptim&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=Customerly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">funnel template</a> to ask for reviews]</p>



<p>The funnel email hack worked. We have got immediately 10+ reviews and it was still working in terms of reviews left when we decided to turn it off.</p>

          <p>Some weeks ago I asked a few of the Codelitt team members a simple question:</p><blockquote>“What is UX?”</blockquote><p>I was happy that no one shied away from answering, and the difference in their responses was incredible:</p><p><strong>Engineers</strong> focused their answers in very pragmatic areas that all revolved around <em>friction</em> and how to reduce it. The experience “behind the curtain” that helps make interactions smooth was what they thought of. Things like loading times or making sure that buttons were clickable came to their minds.</p><p><strong>Designers</strong> saw the importance of researching both the users and business who would be investing in the product. They cared about making sure that the brand’s values were enhancing the experience. They wanted the users &amp; customers to know exactly what to expect when interacting with their products.</p><p><strong>Project Managers</strong> focused on understanding and empathizing with the users so that the end product is intuitive and useful to the user.</p><figure><img src="https://res-2.cloudinary.com/hepw4b4yn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/codelitt-user-experience.jpg"></figure><p>Simply put, UX means “User Experience”: it’s the experience that a user has while interacting with a product. UX <em>Design</em> is, by definition, the process by which we determine what that experience will be.</p><p>UX Design always happens. Whether it’s intentional or not, somebody makes the decisions about how the human and the product will interact. <em>Good</em> UX Design happens when we make these decisions in a way that understands and fulfills the needs of both our users and our business.</p><p>UX encompasses so many disciplines that it’s unfair to think of it as a sphere within visual design. Quite the contrary! The building of an interface is a <em>subset</em> of that product’s experience design.</p><figure><img src="https://res-3.cloudinary.com/hepw4b4yn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/codelitt-ux.jpg"></figure><p><strong>UX happens whenever a human interacts with a product</strong>. Any product. Take a pencil, for example. There’s the way that the wood, plastic or metal feels on your hand, the way it falls on your fingers, the feel of the graphite against the paper. Does it have a rubber end or a button you have to press to get the graphite out? In every case, it’s all been thoroughly thought out and designed, each component a part of the experience of writing with a pencil.</p><p>From the business objective, to the product’s stakeholders, designers, engineers and project managers, the experience encompasses every person working on it. It is the culmination of a multitude of disciplines working together. Every decision we make when building a product shapes that experience. UX is at the heart of everything we do.</p>

July 9, 2020 | https://www.feval.ca/posts/screenr/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.feval.ca/posts/screenr/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    
    



<p>I tried <a href="https://www.hey.com/">Hey</a>, the new e-mail service built by Basecamp. It is great, simple, smart. They’ve put a lot of thoughts behind re-inventing email. There are some pretty interesting features but fundamentally what is different is the opinionated workflow on which it operates.</p>

<p>The only mail that lends into the “Imbox” (how they name the important inbox) is from senders the user allowed. The first time they receive an email from someone, it ends in a staging zone, and then the user need to screen senders and decide if they want to receive emails from them, and where they want these email to lend: 1. in the imbox, 2. in a set of “feeds” (email that is casually read), 3. in the “paper trail” (receipts, …).</p>

<p>I liked the overall experience of Hey, and was about to subscribe. However there are two things that are a no-go for me. It doesn’t support custom domains for email addresses (yet)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, and there is no “archive” feature<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. So I decided against that.</p>

<p>But I really liked the workflow, and I figured it shouldn’t be that big of a deal to re-create something similar in a plain-old mailbox.</p>



<p>Here’s what I need:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Senders need to be screened for their spam to be allowed in my inbox. I figured this can probably be done by redirecting mail from senders I never screened into a sub-folder and reviewing that occasionally.</li>
  <li>Screening senders need to be dead easy. That’s the beauty of Hey: screening is done by clicking on a thumbs-up or thumbs-down button. That’s why it works, no non-sense of creating or editing rules.</li>
  <li>Support the same kind of classifying structure. I already had a <em>newsletter</em> folder with a few manually created rules, and a <em>reference</em> folder in which I would occasionally put a mail that I wanted to retrieve easily - this is just automating that.</li>
  <li>Works from my computer or my phone, using existing apps. There is no point in starting a multi-month project and implement a working email UI, this needs to fit within my limited evenings and kids naps.</li>
  <li>Low maintenance, for the same reason.</li>
</ol>



<p>So I built <a href="https://github.com/cfe84/screenr">Screenr</a>.</p>

<p>Screenr plugs to an email server<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>, monitors email in folders, and classifies email into a set of folders.</p>

<p>Incoming emails from unknown senders (i.e. with an email address that has not been seen yet) are moved to a “For screening” folder. Emails from screened senders are moved based on configuration: either leave in the inbox, or move it to a particular folder.</p>

<pre><code>graph TD
	A[Inbound mail] --&gt; B(Inbox)
	B --&gt; C["Sender screened?"]
	C --&gt;|No| D("Move to 'For Screening'")
	C --&gt;|Yes| E(Move to configured folder)
</code></pre>

<p>To configure the tool, I just need to screen emails in the “For screening” folder occasionally, and move them based on where I want these to land: move emails from senders I still want in my inbox to a <em>Screened</em> folder (which then gets moved back into the inbox once Screenr registered the decision). Move emails I want to reject to a <em>Rejected</em> folder. Move emails I barely care about, such as newsletters, promotions, etc. into a <em>newsletter</em> folder. Move receipts, booking confirmations, order tracking info, tax documents, etc. into a <em>Reference</em> folder. If I move a single email between two monitored folder, then Screenr will move all of the mail from that sender into the new folder.</p>

<pre><code>graph TD
	A[For screening] --&gt; C[Decide what to do with this sender]
	C --&gt;|Allow in inbox| D("Move to 'Screened'")
	C --&gt;|Ok but classify elsewhere| E(Move to the folder you want)
	C --&gt;|Don't want mail from them| F(Move to 'Rejected')
</code></pre>

<p>Screenr supports two configurations (at the folder level) to classify email: either move the email directly to the target folder, or through an intermediary “classification” folder (like the “Screened” folder for email for inbox). The reason for that is that you might want to occasionally classify email without creating a rule: e.g. if my spouse forwards me a booking confirmation it’s nice to file it into the <em>Reference</em> folder without automatically classifying everything she sends me as reference<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Bonus points: now I can change my default behavior for new email based on where I’m at. I archive email in my inbox - the reduced amount of email there makes inbox 0 much easier to attain - and delete email in the “newsletter” folder. Less thinking, inmore better.</p>



<p>There are 4 folders I’m watching:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.feval.ca/img/2020/screenr/folders.jpg" alt="The folders I'm monitoring"></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Inbox</em> is the email that I (probably) care about. Once I read it, I archive it.</li>
  <li><em>Newsletter</em> is the stuff that I’m occasionally browsing, but it’s mostly composed of automatically sent emails and newsletters and there’s likely no required action. Once I read it, I (most likely) delete it.</li>
  <li><em>Papertrail</em> receives all my order confirmation, plane tickets, vouchers, etc. It usually just stays there. I used to call it <em>Reference</em> but I like Hey’s name better. Some of the mail I manually move there, mostly when my parents send me a scan of a bank record, or my wife sends me some reservation, because I don’t want to classify them there.</li>
  <li><em>For screening</em> is all the mail that I’m receiving from senders I haven’t reviewed yet.</li>
</ul>

<p>When something arrives in <em>For screening</em>, first I get excited because that’s proof that Screenr still does its job. Then I decide what to do with it by moving it in one of the folders:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.feval.ca/img/2020/screenr/screening.jpg" alt="The folders I use for screening"></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Screened</em> is for emails I want in my inbox, like people I know, notifications I care about, etc. Screener registers my decision then move it (and potentially other emails by that sender) back into the inbox</li>
  <li><em>File in papertrail</em> is the same as screened, but for my <em>papertrail</em> folder.</li>
  <li><em>Rejected</em> is for what’s not exactly a spam, but I don’t actually want. Examples are emails from my car dealership, which is mostly spam, but which also sends me service confirmation once in a while, which I then go fishing in that folder and redirect to reference. Or companies who want me to wish them happy birthday:</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://www.feval.ca/img/2020/screenr/spam.jpg" alt="Example of some spammy email"></p>



<p>I wanted reasonable portability, my email provider recently released a bare-bones nodejs hosting and I figured I could give it a shot, so I settled for typescript. That host was hardly controllable, so I ended giving up and re-hosting onto the Kubernetes cluster from which you retrieved this static HTML page in a vastly over-complicated setup instead (more on this in <a href="https://www.feval.ca/posts/k8s-static/">this blog post</a>).</p>

<p>The application itself is decomposed into 4 layers following the onion architecture:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>domain</code>, contains the actual classification logic</li>
  <li><code>contracts</code>, contains interfaces and data exchange structures for the dependencies that the domain will need an implementation for, such as <code>IMailbox</code> which allows retrieving emails or moving them around, <code>Mails</code> which are those mails, or <code>IScreeningStorage</code> which provides interfaces to store screening behavior or retrieve it based on sender.</li>
  <li><code>infrastructure</code>, which are the particular implementations for those dependencies: an <code>IMAPMailbox</code> implementing <code>IMailbox</code> which provides said features for an IMAP server.</li>
  <li><code>application</code> which binds all the stuff together: loads configuration, instantiate infrastructure, inject in domain, then kick off the process.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the storage of screening results, I settled on a file-based system which stores everything in memory and serializes it back to a file in storage when new rules are detected.</p>

<p>Building the IMAP connector was the most painful. The client libraries in the node ecosystem are not super well maintained and documented<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>, I tried two, and diagnosing some issues I was having<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7">6</a></sup> was a straight pain that almost made me abandon. In retrospect I would probably pick .Net Core instead, given that the IMAP libraries are much more solid. If I want to make evolutions on that, I don’t exclude a rewrite ; the languages are sufficiently close that this wouldn’t be a big thing to do.</p>

<p>As mentioned, the hosting is done on a k8s cluster. A Helm chart specifies a single deployment with no service, and mounting a file share inside the container to store and retrieve the settings. Here is the extent of the infrastructure:</p>

<pre><code>graph TD
	  A[Pod] --&gt; C[File share]
</code></pre>



<p>To run Screenr, you need a computer that can run node ; ideally a server that you don’t turn off.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Source is on <a href="https://github.com/cfe84/screenr">GitHub</a> and the Readme explains how to configure it. Clone the repo locally, then run <code>npm install</code> and <code>npm run build</code>. To start it, go with <code>npm run start</code>.</li>
  <li>Compiled version is on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/screenr">npm</a>.</li>
  <li>Docker image is on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/cfe84/screenr">DockerHub</a> (or <code>docker pull cfe84/screenr</code>). Kubernetes Helm Chart are available in the git repo.</li>
</ul>



<p>There are some optimizations that could be done. For starters, this could use IMAP notifications to actually listen for new mail, rather than reconnecting and checking every 20s. I went for the straight forward thing right now, not sure if it’ll be a problem. Also this could be extended to support more rules, but it might require some more UI work which I don’t want to do, so that’s it for now.</p>

  <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Estimating how much you are spending (or wasting) on a particular Kubernetes workload is hard. The good news is that there are some reasonable strategies for estimating how much a given workload costs.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In this post, we’ll discuss five major problems that affect cost estimation, and touch upon the strategies we use to overcome these problems in the <a href="https://www.fairwinds.com/insights">Fairwinds Insights</a> cost dashboard. We’ll present a more in-depth review of right sizing in a forthcoming blog.</p>
<h2><strong>Problem #1: Bin Packing</strong></h2>
<p>Say we have a Node, which costs us $20/month. Say it has 5GB of memory and 5 CPUs we can put to use. (Note: this isn’t a very realistic node, but it makes the diagrams and math come out nice 🙂)</p>
<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hubfs/Blog-Problems%20with%20Kubernetes%20Cost%20Estimation%20Strategies.png" alt="Image of squares 2x5 of CPU and Memory"></p>
<p>And here’s a workload, which needs 2 GB of memory, and 2 CPUs in order to run:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hubfs/Blog-Problems%20with%20Kubernetes%20Cost%20Estimation%20Strategies-1.png" alt="Image of squares 2x2 of CPU and Memory"></p>

<p>We can fit up to two Pods worth of this workload in a single node:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hubfs/Blog-Problems%20with%20Kubernetes%20Cost%20Estimation%20Strategies-3.png" alt="Image of squares 2x5 of CPU and Memory with 2 squares not used"></p>

<p>But if we want to add a third Pod for the workload, there’s not enough space left. So we’ll need to add (and pay for) a new node:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hubfs/Blog-Problems%20with%20Kubernetes%20Cost%20Estimation%20Strategies-2.png" alt="Image of squares two 2x5 of CPU and Memory. In the first 2 squares are empty. In the second 6 squares are empty."></p>

<p>Note that there’s a little bit of wasted space on our first node - we’ve got 1GB of memory and 1CPU just sitting there. And our second node is very underutilized - less than half its resources are getting put to use.</p>
<p><strong>This is the first and primary problem of cost estimation</strong>: Kubernetes can’t split up one pod across multiple nodes. So if a whole number of pods don’t fit inside a single node, you’re going to have a certain amount of capacity that’s going to waste.</p>
<p><strong>Solution: </strong>One solution here is to “right-size” the nodes. If we used a node with 4GB of memory and 4CPUs, our workload would fit perfectly, and there’d be no capacity going to waste:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hubfs/Blog-Problems%20with%20Kubernetes%20Cost%20Estimation%20Strategies-Jul-09-2020-02-08-40-46-PM.png" alt="CPU and Memory 2x4 squares completely filled"></p>

<h2><strong>Problem #2: Resource Asymmetry</strong></h2>
<p>Let’s consider a different kind of workload: one that’s very CPU-intensive. It needs 3 CPUs to run, but only 1GB of memory.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hubfs/Blog-Problems%20with%20Kubernetes%20Cost%20Estimation%20Strategies-Jul-09-2020-02-08-46-96-PM.png" alt="Image of squares. Column 1 is x3 squares, column 2 is 1 square"></p>

<p>Now we can only fit 1 Pod worth of this workload into a single Node (using our 4CPU/4GB example):</p>
<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hubfs/Blog-Problems%20with%20Kubernetes%20Cost%20Estimation%20Strategies-4.png" alt="2 columns of 4 by 2 rows. CPU has three squares filled, 1 memory square filled"></p>

<p>There’s a ton of unused capacity going to waste here - not only 1 CPU, but also 3 GB of memory. We’re only using half the Node, but if we want to spin up a second Pod, we’ll need a second Node, with the same amount of waste!</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Again, we’ll want to right-size our nodes - cloud providers offer CPU-intensive and Memory-intensive nodes to handle exactly this problem.</p>
<h2><strong>Problem #3: Cost Attribution</strong></h2>
<p>Let’s say our smaller Node (4 CPUs and 4 GB) costs $16/mo. Using those numbers, we can come up with a rough estimate for how much each CPU and each GB of memory costs us. Say, of that $16, $8 goes to CPU, and $8 goes to memory. We can then infer that we’re paying $2 per CPU, and $2 per GB of memory.</p>
<p>So how much does our original workload cost us per pod?</p>

<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hubfs/Blog-Problems%20with%20Kubernetes%20Cost%20Estimation%20Strategies-Jul-09-2020-02-08-40-52-PM.png" alt="2x2 square with 4 boxes"></p>

<p>Based on our math above, we’d say <code>$2/CPU * 2CPUs + $2/GB * 2GBs = $8.</code> Which makes sense - we can fit exactly two of these workloads on a $16 node. For reasons we’ll cover below, we call this <strong>the optimistic method</strong> of cost estimation.</p>
<p>But what about our second workload, the CPU-intensive one?</p>

<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hubfs/Blog-Problems%20with%20Kubernetes%20Cost%20Estimation%20Strategies-Jul-09-2020-02-08-46-96-PM.png" alt="Image of squares. Column 1 is x3 squares, column 2 is 1 square"></p>

<p>Let’s do the same math: <code>$2/CPU * 3CPUs + $2/GB * 1GB = $8.</code> So the <strong>optimistic method</strong> says this workload costs us $8. But as we saw above, we can only fit one of them per Node. So in reality, it’s costing us $16/mo, and the optimistic method doesn’t seem so accurate.</p>
<p>Is there another method of cost estimation that might give us a more reasonable answer? There is!</p>
<p>Instead of adding the CPU cost and the memory cost together, we can take the <em>maximum</em> of the two. This helps us account for memory-intensive or CPU-intensive workloads, that might cause extra capacity to go to waste. (Note that we’ll also need to multiply the result by 2, so we count the missing resource as well.)</p>
<p>So the math becomes <code>MAX($2/CPU * 3CPUs, $2/GB * 1GB) * 2 = $12.</code> This is a good deal closer to the $16 target. The remainder is attributable to the fully unused node capacity (i.e. the 1 CPU that is still going to waste, despite the fact that the Node carries a CPU-intensive workload).</p>
<p>We call this <strong>the conservative method</strong> of estimation. It prepares for a worst-case scenario in terms of Kubernetes’ ability to bin-pack workloads onto your Nodes.</p>
<p>For many workloads, the conservative method and the optimistic method will give similar estimates, but they diverge for CPU- or memory-intensive workloads. The basic difference is that the optimistic method assumes optimal bin-packing, while the conservative method assumes there will be some waste. Say, for instance, that we were also running a memory-intensive workload, one that needs only 1 CPU, but 3 GB of memory:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hubfs/Blog-Problems%20with%20Kubernetes%20Cost%20Estimation%20Strategies-Jul-09-2020-02-08-46-90-PM.png" alt="1 square in column 1, 3 squares in column 2"></p>

<p>Kubernetes is smart enough to pack this together with our CPU-intensive workload, saving us the unused capacity:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hubfs/Blog-Problems%20with%20Kubernetes%20Cost%20Estimation%20Strategies-Jul-09-2020-02-08-40-35-PM.png" alt="CPU intensive workloads combined so 2x4 squares are all used"></p>

<p>The <strong>conservative method</strong> would say that each of these workloads costs $12, for a total cost of $24. But Kubernetes has found a way to pack them into a $16 Node! We’ve overshot. That’s why it’s called <strong>conservative</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>optimistic method</strong> accounts for the clever bin packing, and would say that each of these workloads costs $8, for a total cost of $16, which is a perfect estimate, given that they fit exactly onto one $16 node.</p>
<p><strong>Solution: </strong>So which one should you use? The answer is that it depends. If you’ve spent time optimizing your instance types, or if your nodes are much larger than your average workload, there’s a good chance that Kubernetes can find a way to pack workloads together in a cost-efficient way, and you can safely choose the <strong>optimistic</strong> method. Otherwise, we recommend the <strong>conservative</strong> method.</p>
<h2><strong>Problem #4: Resource Ranges</strong></h2>
<p>Another issue at hand is the fact that a Kubernetes workload doesn’t just use a fixed amount of CPU and memory. Resource usage can vary from second to second, and Pods may get killed or moved between nodes in response to these fluctuations.</p>
<p>To help with this issue, Kubernetes configuration gives engineers two fields for managing resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>requests</code> set the minimum resource usage of the workload. When a workload gets scheduled on a Node, you can be sure that <em>at least this much</em> is available</li>
<li><code>limits</code> set the maximum resource usage of the workload. When a Pod for the workload tries to use more than this amount, the Pod <em>will get killed</em> and a new one will start.</li>
</ul>
<p>The actual resource usage of a given workload will be somewhere between these two numbers, and will fluctuate heavily from second to second (just look at the Activity Monitor on your macbook to see how much this can vary!).</p>
<p><strong>Solution: </strong>One way of estimating bottom-line workload cost is to look at that fluctuating number, and take an average over time. Another way of estimating workload cost is to look at <code>requests</code> and <code>limits</code> in order to provide a range of possibilities, or to take an average of the two.</p>
<p>Since Fairwinds Insights is primarily concerned with <a href="https://www.fairwinds.com/insights">configuration validation</a><strong>,</strong> we opt for the second strategy - we want to tell you, <em>given your current configuration</em>, how much you can expect this workload to cost.</p>
<h2><strong>Problem #5: Noisy Neighbors</strong></h2>
<p>Kubernetes can only do its best with the information it's given. This is why it’s so important to specify <code>requests</code> and <code>limits</code> for every single one of your workloads.</p>
<p>For example, if one of your workloads duly requests 1GB of memory, but another workload on the same node hasn’t set <code>requests</code> or <code>limits,</code> the second workload could easily begin to gobble up all the resources available on that Node. This could prevent our original workload from getting all the memory it needs, hurting its performance.</p>
<p>Because it can be tricky to dial these settings in, some teams never set requests or limits at all, while others set them too high during initial testing and then never course correct. To appropriately estimate cost, we need to set the right limits and requests. Fairwinds Insights uses <a href="https://github.com/FairwindsOps/goldilocks/">Goldilocks</a>, a free open source tool, to analyze actual resource usage and recommend settings for <code>requests</code> and <code>limits</code> that are “just right”.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Understanding the financial costs of each of your organization’s applications impact is important, but when they’re all running together in Kubernetes, it can be quite difficult. Fortunately, there are some reasonable ways to solve each of the problems with Kubernetes cost estimation.</p>
<p>By using a combination of right-sizing (more to come on that), adopting the right methods (e.g. conservative vs. optimistic), and employing configuration validation tools like Fairwinds Insights and Goldilocks, you can ensure your Kubernetes deployments run efficiently.</p>

<h2><strong>Highlights from my conversation with Rebecca Sadwick</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Go-to-market strategy basically revolves around getting “people who can benefit from the product to know about it and want to buy it.”</li><li>Long-term momentum should be one of the first and most important considerations of a startup.</li><li>Positioning should be the core of your marketing strategy.</li><li>When creating a product, always remember that when something needs explanation, you’ve already lost.</li><li>Let the market dictate how they like to buy.</li><li>Partnerships are not a substitute for other direct strategies.</li><li>Quantitative data can drive worse decisions than a lack of data altogether.</li></ul>

<p>The Roman roads diagram project is a series of maps driven by an unconventional idea: what if we represented Ancient Rome’s famed road network in the style of a modern transit map?</p>
<p>So far I’ve made five diagrams (below). Click for more information.</p>
<p>You can see how my style has evolved since I made the first map back in 2017. My ultimate goal is to make a book out of these. I’ll probably have to redesign a few of them.

Don't believe me? Why not quickly <a href="https://supabase.io/docs/postgres/postgres-intro">spin up a database</a> and see it for yourself with this query:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>SELECT</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>FROM</span><span> pg_database</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>In this post, we'll explore these template databases and see how we can make full use of their potential. We'll even look into creating a template database of our own.</p><h2>template1</h2><p>By default, running:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>DATABASE</span><span> new_db_name</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>simply copies everything from the database <code>template1</code>. We can modify this template database in any way: add a table, insert some data, create new extensions, or install procedural languages. Any of these actions would be propagated to subsequently created databases.</p><p>This, however, is <strong>not</strong> advisable. Removing any one of these modifications would need you to manually uninstall or drop these changes from <code>template1</code>. You do have the option to drop and recreate the entire <code>template1</code> database altogether. This unfortunately comes at the risk of committing a mistake along the way, effectively breaking <code>CREATE DATABASE</code>. It would be better to leave <code>template1</code> alone and create a template database of your own.</p><h2>Custom Template Databases</h2><p>To set an existing database as a template database:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>ALTER</span><span> </span><span>DATABASE</span><span> template_db_name </span><span>WITH</span><span> is_template </span><span>TRUE</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Doing this allows any user or role with the <code>CREATEDB</code> privilege to utilize it as a template. If not, only superusers or owners of the database would be allowed to do so.</p><p>To create a new database with this template:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>DATABASE</span><span> new_db_name TEMPLATE template_db_name</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><h3>Advantages</h3><ul><li>With this, you can now have customized templates without the need to worry about polluting <code>template1</code>.</li><li>You can safely drop the entire custom template database without the risk of breaking <code>CREATE DATABASE</code>.</li><li>If you wish, you can create multiple template databases for various use cases.</li></ul><h3>Limitations</h3><ul><li>To properly create a database from a custom template database, there should be no other connections present. <code>CREATE DATABASE</code> immediately fails if any connections exist at the start of the query.</li><li>As such, if you are looking to replicate a database while maintaining your connections (eg. a production database), it would be more ideal to use the Postgres utility <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/app-pgdump.html">pg_dump</a>.</li></ul><h2>template0</h2><p><code>template0</code> contains the same data as <code>template1</code>. We could think of this template database as a fallback if anything irreversible happens to <code>template1</code>. As such, this template database should never be modified in any way as soon as the database cluster has been initialized. To create a database with <code>template0</code> as the template database:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>DATABASE</span><span> new_db_name TEMPLATE template0</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><h3>Applications</h3><ul><li>If anything goes wrong with <code>template1</code>, It can be dropped and recreated with <code>template0</code> as the template database.</li><li>We can also create a clean database that does not contain any modifications present in <code>template1</code>. This would be useful when restoring from pg_dump. Any conflicts brought about by modifications not present in the dump are eliminated.</li><li><code>template0</code> can be used to specify new encodings. As pointed out in this <a href="https://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/exploring-the-default-postgres-template-databases#:~:text=we%20can't%20edit%20the%20locale%20or%20encoding%20of%20a%20database%20copied%20from%20template1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a>, creating a new database with <code>template1</code> and new encodings would result in an error.</li></ul><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span></span><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>DATABASE</span><span> new_db_name TEMPLATE template0 ENCODING </span><span>'SQL_ASCII'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>DATABASE</span><span> new_db_name ENCODING </span><span>'SQL_ASCII'</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>To quickly sum things up, we found out that new databases are, by default, created from a template database called <code>template1</code>. <code>template1</code> can be modified in any way we please and the changes would be present in any database created afterward. We can also create custom template databases and base new databases from them instead. If things go awry, <code>template0</code> is always there to help.</p></section><section><a href="http://eepurl.com/gPWkwn">SUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER</a></section></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><p id="7416">When I first started building Percy over five years ago, I honestly had no idea where it would go. What I was sure about, though, was that it was a problem I was genuinely interested in solving, and I just wanted to build it.</p><p id="f0da">Fast forward to today, and we have both a product and a team that I am super proud of, passionate users and customers who love Percy, and most importantly, we have successfully made the previously-obscure phrase “visual testing” commonplace in the tech industry and across developer communities. Achieving this was no small feat, and I’m thrilled that Percy has played a pivotal role in making that happen.</p><h2 id="7f25">What’s next</h2><p id="b175">I am excited about all the opportunities that this acquisition will unlock. BrowserStack has spent over nine years building a platform that enables millions of developers and QA engineers worldwide to test across thousands of browsers and devices at scale. Similarly, Percy has spent the last five years focusing on a new category of testing — one that sits at the intersection of design, development, and deployment, with a significant overlap with browser automation and developer workflows.</p><p id="a79a">Though our paths have been adjacent until now, our capabilities fit perfectly together to create a comprehensive testing experience for users.</p><p id="fe68">Percy has invested heavily in the intricacies of visual testing and embedded deeply and easily in the workflows of thousands of developers. Being part of the BrowserStack platform will open many doors for expanding visual testing to a much wider range of testing environments.</p><p id="87c8">On the personal front, I will continue to lead Percy as Director of Product for Visual Testing. I’m very excited about this role and the changes it brings.</p><p id="eff3">It seems like every founder’s acquisition post ends up with this statement at some point, so I’ll get it out of the way — it’s <em>hard </em>to build and run a startup! Though my focus was always the product and team, as co-founder a lot of my time and energy were also spent managing day-to-day business activities. With this acquisition I am happy to be able to get back to my roots in product and engineering.</p><h2 id="f495">Thank you</h2><p id="0d41">I get to be the public face of this change, but we would never have gotten this far or created this powerful new product without the tireless work of the entire Percy team. I want to thank you for all the hard work, passion, and the empathy that you bring to work each day. A special thanks for riding the many rollercoasters of change during the shared tough times that the world is going through right now. I’m thankful to be able to work with each one of you.</p><p id="ba6b">And finally, a big thanks to all our users and customers for your continued support and belief in us. You give us the energy behind everything we do and we will be looking forward to your feedback on how to continue to make Percy better and better.</p><p id="9a2e">You can read more about the acquisition on the <a href="https://www.browserstack.com/blog/browserstack-has-acquired-percy?utm_source=announcement_blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=percy_acquisition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BrowserStack blog</a>.</p></div></div></section></div>]]>

<h3><strong>Rule 4.1 of the developer constitution</strong></h3>



<p>It’s the law. Software engineers have to hate meetings. If you’re caught enjoying yourself in a meeting you can get your dev card pulled. So be careful out there. And stay classy, San Diego.</p>







<div><figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ron-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ron-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ron-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ron-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ron.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>







<h2><strong>We’re bad at articulating the negative effects of meetings</strong></h2>



<p>I knew right away as a junior developer out of college I was in too many meetings. Even though I had nothing to compare it to. As I took on more visible projects, the number of meetings went up. I felt the pain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three years into my career, I got <a href="https://linearb.io/blog/promoted-from-dev-to-team-lead-8-things-they-didnt-tell-me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promoted from dev to team lead</a> and bam… not only was I in more meetings than ever but my team was also constantly complaining to me they were in too many meetings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I remember being in product strategy meetings for hours. HOURS.&nbsp;</p>







<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dan_2-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dan_2-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dan_2-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dan_2-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dan_2.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>







<figure><blockquote><p>Join our mission to end useless status meetings.</p><p><a href="https://linearb.io/status-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Click here for early access</a> to the dev team dashboard of the future.</p><p>Real-time progress on your features and bugs powered by Git data.</p></blockquote></figure>



<div><p>After I got comfortable with our product leaders and executive team, I would spin my chair around in circles as a (passive aggressive) way of letting them know I was ready to go.</p><p>Looking back on it, I wasn’t addressing the bigger issue. Another long meeting was right around the corner. And I wasn’t doing anything to help other developers in our org avoid meetings that were too long or had no value.&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>In general, I was good at <a href="https://linearb.io/blog/being-vp-of-software-development-is-harder-than-being-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">translating between engineers and executives</a>. But for some reason, when it came to meetings, I failed to find the words.&nbsp;</p>







<h2><strong>“Too many meetings” is not a complaint, it’s a cry for help</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://linearb.io/blog/stand-up-2-0-ten-community-insights-from-100-responses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I’ve been asking developers why they don’t like meetings</a> and what specifically they don’t like about them. The more I parse what I’m hearing and compare it to my own experience, the more I think “too many meetings” is a symptom of a bigger issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most developers don’t arbitrarily dislike all meetings. When we say we don’t like meetings what we really mean is:</p>



<ul><li>“I dislike inefficiency”</li><li>“I dislike poorly planned meetings”</li><li>“I dislike poorly executed meetings”</li><li>“I dislike not living up to my promises”</li><li>“I dislike missing our team iteration deadline”</li><li>“I dislike not getting enough time to do my job”</li></ul>







<p>Developers are the most important asset innovative companies have. Instead of dismissing this feedback as “engineers just don’t like meetings”, we need to listen to them.&nbsp;</p>







<h3><strong>Maker’s Schedule versus Manager’s Schedule</strong></h3>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paul4-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paul4-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paul4-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paul4-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paul4.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>







<p>When it comes to meetings, there is an inherent tension between developers and bosses. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paul Graham</a> (pictured above), known for his work on LISP and for co-founding Y Combinator, explains the disconnect in his 2009 essay <strong><em>Maker’s Schedule, Manager’s Schedule</em></strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a summary:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Bosses (Managers) get stuff done through meetings – changing tasks every 60 minutes.<br></li><li>Developers (Makers) and other creators need 3-4 hour blocks of time to get work done.<br></li><li>Each way of working is perfectly fine by itself but problems arise when the two collide.<br></li><li>For a Maker, a single meeting at the wrong time can disrupt their entire day of work.<br></li><li>Powerful people on a Manager Schedule force Makers to “resonate at their frequency.”&nbsp;</li></ul>







<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paul3-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paul3-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paul3-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paul3-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paul3.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>







<p>We’ve all been there. Your VP needs an update on feature XYZ. They “have a call with customer ABC tomorrow” or they’re “presenting to the exec team this afternoon” so they summon you and the team. You share your status update. Or, worse, someone else talks and you just sit there. (Why did I need to be here??) Your boss asks a few questions. You leave.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it’s not just your VP. Your team lead, your product owner, your project manager, your UX designer… they all want your time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it’s just not just meetings. The support person, the salesperson… they all have a “quick question” and it’s always “kind of urgent”. At least now they can’t walk by your desk when you don’t answer on Slack after 57 seconds. But you want to be helpful so it’s still a distraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your boss goes on to their next meeting. The sales rep goes to their next call. For you, it’s not that easy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You have to start your process all over. “Getting in the zone” takes time. And if you have another meeting in an hour you might not want to start something big or important. So you get up to date in Slack. Maybe pick up a friend’s PR and add some comments. Next thing you know the day is over and you didn’t get enough quality time into your big, important task.&nbsp;</p>







<h3><strong>Two failed attempts&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>When I was Director of Engineering (and later VP), I considered myself a “cool” leader. Not one of those out of touch suits. Not some MBA that talked about innovation but didn’t actually know how to code. (Python dice rolling simulator doesn’t count, Conner!) I was an executive but I still understood what it was like to be a developer. After all, I had just been a developer. I got promoted from dev to team lead to Director in a two-year span. I was not out of touch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet I was the cause of many meetings and interruptions. What was my alternative? I needed updates so I could <a href="https://linearb.io/blog/vp-engineering-vp-product-how-to-keep-a-united-front/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">communicate with our VP of Product</a> and our CEO. Jira was never up to date. Slack worked sometimes but not always in the timeframe I needed.</p>







<p><strong>PRO TIP FOR MANAGERS:</strong> Beware of how you feel when you leave a meeting with your team. The meeting was for you and you got work done so you’re probably feeling great. Your team probably did not get work done and might not be feeling as great. Don’t allow your feelings to cause your mind to overvalue the meeting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eventually, I heard enough complaints and tried to do something about it.&nbsp;</p>







<h4><strong>Failed idea #1: No meeting Wednesday</strong></h4>



<p>We looked for a day each week where devs could work uninterrupted. After much negotiation, we picked Wednesday. We would meet up for the daily then no more meetings all day. None. No exceptions. I convinced the CEO and the whole company. Everyone agreed! It lasted about three weeks. By week four the “urgent priority” meeting requests started rolling in again. And by week five my own team had lost their resolve and we were right back to meetings on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>







<h4><strong>Failed idea #2: Brazilian BBQ meat coaster&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>At <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/brazilian-barbecue-history-335804" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brazilian BBQ </a>restaurants “Gauchos” bring skewers of meat to your table. If you want some, they cut a few pieces on to your plate. If you don’t want any of that particular meat, no worries. A few minutes later another pair of chaps will be by with a new kind of meat. (It’s amazing.)</p>



<p>How does the gaucho know if you want more meat? Your table has a little cube or coaster on it. Green side up means more meat! Red side up means I have the meat sweats and I’m taking a break. See where I’m going with this?</p>



<p>I gave everyone on our team a little coaster. Green side up meant I’m available to chat. Red side up meant please don’t interrupt. I sent an email to the whole company.&nbsp;</p>







<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zone-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zone-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zone-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zone-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zone.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>What’s worse: meat sweats or meeting sweats?</figcaption></figure>







<p>It lasted a brief time. But eventually, the shoulder tap interruptions resumed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why did these attempts fail? I didn’t explain the problem well enough. The “rules” we implemented seemed arbitrary to everyone else. We had a great relationship with our ecosystem so they bought in initially because they wanted to be helpful. But, in order for change to take hold, people need to understand the “why”. And the “why” in this case has to be more than just devs don’t like meetings and interruptions.&nbsp;</p>







<h2><strong>5 steps for reducing meetings and increasing focus time blocks&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Dev team leads, scrum masters, product leaders, and business leaders can use these ideas to maximize the most valuable “resource” in your company – your developers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Developers can use it too. If you’re like me – complaining about meetings but not explaining your “why” very well – this framework will help you articulate yourself better.</p>







<h3><strong>Step 1: Take a meeting inventory and establish a baseline</strong></h3>



<p>Are we really in too many meetings? As we start educating our company about “why” meetings and interruptions are bad for developers, let’s also make sure our premise is correct.</p>



<p>To start, let’s look at the recurring meetings we’re in:</p>







<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chart-New-alignment-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chart-New-alignment-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chart-New-alignment-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chart-New-alignment-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chart-New-alignment.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>







<p>Most reasonable developers are not proposing to get rid of these so this becomes your baseline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Add up the total number of hours and divide by the total number of hours in your typical iteration. At LinearB, these baseline meetings take up 10% of our typical two-week iteration. Not bad, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now look at your random meetings: update with your product owner for feature XYZ, check-in with the support department, technical design, UX design, emergency production issue, etc. These take up a lot more time if we aren’t careful. So, examine their value closely.&nbsp;</p>







<h3><strong>Step 2: Assess the value of your meetings</strong></h3>



<p>Are all of our recurring and random meetings providing value to attendees? It depends on who you ask. They’re definitely valuable for the person scheduling them like the Director, team lead or product owner. But are they valuable for developers?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The daily stand-up is our most important, most frequent meeting. And yet many developers don’t think they get value from it.</p>

<p>At <a href="https://linearb.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LinearB</a>, we refactored our meetings and created two core tenets:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Everyone in the room must get value – especially developers.&nbsp;</li><li>No status update meetings are allowed.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>For engineering leaders, if you listen to your team, you’ll quickly learn which meetings are not delivering value. But just canceling those meetings may be complicated. Other stakeholders may find them valuable. So, instead of canceling, ask yourself “how can I refactor this meeting to make it more useful to my team?”&nbsp;</p>







<p>Here’s an example:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Marketing teams should scale alongside new business revenue. As the company generates new business, the marketing budget gets bigger and the team scales accordingly.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Companies often think about go-to-market (GTM) spend in terms of payback periods - if we put a dollar into the business today, how long will it take to get that dollar back in terms of revenue. For example, if we spent $15m on GTM in 2019 and generated $15m new business ARR in 2019 that would be a 12 month payback period. A 12 month payback is considered great for most SaaS businesses.&nbsp;<br></p><p>When you combine the idea of payback periods along with industry benchmarks for marketing spend you start to get a picture of what marketing budgets look like as you scale. According to <a href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5ea5d85d88b3bd3fa7481aab/5f0721b9c8fbf34510ac1da7_image%20(73).png" target="_blank">Keybanc</a>, SaaS companies spend between 15% and 50% of their go-to-market budget on marketing. </p><p>When you map out this percentage spend against payback periods, you start to get a sense of what your marketing budget at different revenue targets should look like.&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-5ab1cbc8e47a-32481ab0"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5ea5d85d88b3bd7015481ab4/5f06ab4c328260ba3799a145_marketngteam2.001.jpeg" alt=""></p></figure><div><p>The mix is largely determined by the sales motion. Generally, Self-serve SMB businesses require more marketing spend whereas enterprise sales heavy businesses require less marketing.&nbsp;</p></div><p>From here you can start to get a sense of what you can afford and how big your marketing team could be at each point in scale. Generally, marketing teams (full-time-employees) account for 35-40% of your marketing budget.&nbsp;<br></p><div><p>Another helpful datapoint comes from <a href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5ea5d85d88b3bd3fa7481aab/5f065bbf2b3d6331272bc36f_Insight_s_SaaS_Marketing_Spend_Benchmarks_Report.pdf" target="_blank">Insight Partners</a>, where they provide benchmarks for new logo bookings per marketing employee (FTE).&nbsp;</p></div><figure id="w-node-41bc96697126-32481ab0"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5ea5d85d88b3bd7015481ab4/5efbd440b708739085e5a3a8_qRW2yCCH9-9IoVtU_Y-tknGhkcROR8xbPL1pOipXzzoNWAsGs6gNpv4ESyzI4tmnSpsPOs-QmT6yTV9i_m7UjJ66d4d7wHRzTCwu6GzT_e-U3IC3iT33pJVrd_J5fNgBMMGu5ApO.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>As companies target bigger customers, individual marketers are able to support more revenue scaling from $498k/FTE to $1,238k/FTE. Bigger ACV companies typically have smaller marketing teams as the go-to-market strategy is more outbound sales led, rather than through digital growth marketing tactics.&nbsp;</p><p>By taking these benchmarks and extrapolating them against new business targets, you start to get a clear picture of what your marketing team should look like over time.&nbsp;<br>‍</p><figure id="w-node-b9a4ea7d9877-32481ab0"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5ea5d85d88b3bd7015481ab4/5f06ab6f3dc1fef5342db03a_marketngteam2.002.jpeg" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍<br></p><p>So for example, if I want to generate $9m in new business this year, and most of my customers pay me $50k each, then i’ll want to have a marketing team of around 11 people, but if i mainly focus on SMB customer then i’ll likely need a team of 18 people.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Of course, benchmarks and extrapolations only tell part of the story. Some companies index higher on programs vs. people. The exact mix depends on what you’ve found to work for your business in the past and what you want to experiment with in the future. Additionally,&nbsp; your capital position will naturally change your level of investment.</p><p>From personal experience, I found the above benchmarks to be a bit inflated to how we’ve built the team at Lattice.&nbsp; Historically, we’ve tended to operate a lean team of generalists, hire more contractors and indexed towards more program spend. But as we’ve added more specialization on the team, the numbers start to even out towards the above benchmarks.&nbsp;<br>‍</p><p>Regardless, understanding the relationship between new business targets, size of customer contracts, and go-to-market motion will help you to determine the size of your marketing team as the business grows.&nbsp;<br></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As part of recent design changes, GitHub has introduced READMEs for profiles. By <a href="https://dev.to/web/design-github-profile-using-readme-md-8al">creating a repo</a> with your name and adding <code>README.md</code> file with markdown to it, you can now add a rich description of yourself.</p><p>Here is an example of how it looks like:</p><p><img alt="Python reference count graph" src="https://rushter.com/static/uploads/img/github_profile.jpg" width="650"></p><p>This feature may not be available to your profile yet. GitHub uses selectively rolling.</p><p>Unlike the old plain-text bio field, the new feature supports external links and images. This is where it gets interesting.</p><h2>Tracking profile views</h2><p>Since Github's markdown can display images from external sources, you can now track and display views of your profile.</p><p>To do so, you need to host an image on your server and display it via Markdown syntax:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>image</span> <span>title</span><span>](</span><span>https</span><span>:</span><span>//rushter.com/counter.svg)</span>
</pre></div><p>On the server-side, each image request can be treated as a view of your profile. The rest of the story is simple — you need to store a counter in the database and return an SVG image with the number of views as a response. Of course, there will be some extra requests from bots, but having such statistics is better than nothing.</p><p>To prevent IP and User Agent leaking, GitHub caches all images via special proxy. To avoid being cached on Github servers after the first image request, your image must specify cache headers or return non-200 response (e.g., an HTTP 404 page).</p><p>Here is the HTTP header that disables caching:</p><div><pre><span></span>Cache-Control: max-age=0, no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate
</pre></div><p>This is not something new for repositories since they had this ability for a long time, and GitHub allows this kind of use of images for <a href="https://github.com/dwyl/repo-badges#github-repo-hit-counter-">interactive badges</a>. Unlike profiles, repositories have access to traffic statistics too.</p><p>Here is how it can <a href="https://github.com/rushter">look like</a> when you have access to the new feature:</p><p><img alt="Python reference count graph" src="https://rushter.com/static/uploads/img/github_counter.png" width="700"></p><p><br> There are libraries and services that can do <a href="https://github.com/brentvollebregt/hit-counter">this for you</a>. You can also use <a href="https://pipedream.com/@tod/github-profile-view-counter-p_G6CNmN/readme">Pipedream</a> if you want to have more control over the counter logic.</p><h3>Security aspects</h3><p>For a lot of people, allowing external images on their websites sounds like not a big deal. I've been using this technique to track profiles views on various platforms for more than 10 years. I've seen how recruiters constantly refresh my profiles when they need to make a decision :).</p><p>Unlike GitHub, most of them don't even bother proxying the image to hide IP, referrer, and browser agent. If you want to allow external images on your site, you <strong>must</strong> proxy them and hide everything about a person who requested it.</p><p>A person with bad intentions can trick a victim into opening your profile that looks completely legit and detect his IP and a browser. You can also set a cookie to track user visits on other websites, but browsers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21064698/google-third-party-cookies-chrome-two-years-privacy-safari-firefox">will soon stop</a> doing it.</p><p>A single-pixel image can provide you a lot of information. This is how the whole AD industry works when it tracks your visits on various websites.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>According to my tests, profile views do not count as repo views, and I hope, in the future, we will be able to see traffic stats in the repository that hosts the README file.</p></div></div>]]>

                <div>
                    <p>All of a sudden, we’re all working from our living rooms and using remote tools and video calls to stay as connected as we can. The once-steady migration to working from home has suddenly leapt to 100% adoption. But in our collective loss of shared physical space, did we also lose all the things that come with it? Things that lead to freer, more organic conversation and <em>feeling</em> more together?</p><p>When we share a physical space, there's hundreds of tiny inter-personal interactions – opportunities for conversations to start – combined with a shared physical context. These give rise to something I call social serendipity: the chance for unstructured and unplanned conversations to take place. This is where people actually get to know each other, and where new ideas are born.</p><p>When designing the offices at Pixar, Steve Jobs asked that the only restrooms be placed in an atrium at the very centre of the office. Why? To quite intentionally force coworkers from across the organisation to bump into each other and mix together, striking up new conversations.</p><p>For social serendipity to really happen, you need a 'safe' environment for people to share thoughts with as little friction and consequence for a 'bad idea' as possible. When physically hanging out with friends, or sitting with coworkers that you have a good relationship with, this just happens naturally, but in a world where we all are physically distanced, something subtle is lost.</p><p><strong><br>There are two main things missing in today’s social apps which are there in a physical workplace: </strong></p><ol><li>A low-friction 'open channel' for conversation to flow (in an office, this is something like passively being near to others)</li><li>Conversation hooks – exposure to things to talk about (in an office, this can be observing something that someone is doing)<br></li></ol><h2 id="open-channels">Open channels</h2><p><br>When you use Slack, email, or WhatsApp, you are effectively posting a letter to somebody. It may be fast to deliver and small in size, but it’s still a letter. This type of communication is a little like playing ping pong in the dark: you know virtually nothing about the other player’s position or current state (with perhaps the only dim lightbulbs in the room being status notifications like ‘read’,'active’, or 'typing’). </p><figure><img src="https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/2020/07/ping-pong-in-the-dark.png" alt="" srcset="https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/ping-pong-in-the-dark.png 600w, https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/ping-pong-in-the-dark.png 1000w, https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/2020/07/ping-pong-in-the-dark.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The ping pong in the dark of messaging</figcaption></figure><div><p>What about voice or video calls? Well, they are little more like fishing: you throw out a line and if there’s a bite, the line is connected. But this can also be quite disruptive… much like how you catch a fish and pull it out from its environment (the river), the recipient of a phone call is pulled out from whatever they were doing. </p><p>Regardless, both of these different types of communication are very intentional, and by that I mean that you need a reason to reach out and start. This 'needing a reason' forms a viscous barrier to free flowing communication. </p><p>In both cases, once a ‘session’ (what I’m calling a natural, active conversation between people) is created, people can talk fairly freely within it. </p></div><p><br>In <em>synchronous</em> communication (so a voice or video call), the session is formal – it has an official connect and disconnect, and everyone knows the status. Within that, people can speak freely – kind of similarly to an in-person conversation… within the bounds of the intent of the session of course, as it’s so disruptive to whatever else that everyone wants to do.</p><div><p>In <em>asynchronous</em> communication (back-and-forth messaging), the session is informal, noncommittal, and doesn’t have a clear beginning or end. There is also a kind of <em>semi-synchronous</em> version that can happen when multiple parties are replying rapidly, but it still doesn’t need any reason to come to an end because it’s non-committal. </p><p><strong>If we were to put these into spatial terms: </strong></p></div><p><br>A video or voice call is like entering a temporary room – you can see who else is there, and everyone else knows you are there. However, that room also demands that you can’t be elsewhere. Because of this, they are only created if they are needed for some purpose. </p><p>With messaging, it’s like each person is inside of their own private room, receiving and sending paper letters at their convenience, each with little knowledge of when the other person will receive it, or their context when they receive it. This also means a lot of messaging is done passively by the user during other activities – there is no demand for exclusivity and so speed is something of an unknown… if you want to get something done fast, messaging is probably not the way. </p><figure><img src="https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/2020/07/rooms-of-social-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/rooms-of-social-1.png 600w, https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/rooms-of-social-1.png 1000w, https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/rooms-of-social-1.png 1600w, https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/2020/07/rooms-of-social-1.png 1631w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The passive nature of messaging means less demand on each party (they’re in their own space after all), but it's also less personal and involves some social friction between each batch of messages, a friction which increases directly if more time passes between batches. As that friction increases, the reason for reaching out needs to be greater and so it ends up pushing out silly, casual or free conversation for stronger reason-based messages.</p><figure><img src="https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/2020/07/social-over-time.png" alt="" srcset="https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/social-over-time.png 600w, https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/social-over-time.png 1000w, https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/2020/07/social-over-time.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>As time passes between messages</figcaption></figure><p>However, neither of these reflect the casual nature of a conversation in an office, a coworking space, or even just hanging out. In those, people are present in a space together and are ‘open’ to conversation i.e. there is a continuous ‘session' going on, even if people don’t have to actively be engaged in it. (Note: Arguably, a more awkward version of this also happens on a conference call whilst waiting for others to join, but is short-lived and more incidental.)</p><p>This open space is fertile ground for social serendipity and natural conversation, but in remote communication, there’s still something missing: a 'conversational hook'</p><h2 id="conversational-hooks"> <br>Conversational hooks</h2><p>A conversational hook is something for another to grab onto and talk about – but when the only way of interacting with another is through very intentional methods, there’s little to no <em>discovery</em> of new hooks… unless actively volunteered by someone, or perhaps something stumbles into frame (e.g. someone’s dog making a surprise appearance during a video call). </p><figure><img src="https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/2020/07/sddefault-1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/sddefault-1.jpg 600w, https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/2020/07/sddefault-1.jpg 640w"></figure><div><p><strong>What types of conversation hook are there? </strong></p><p><strong>Depth hooks </strong><br>The more you talk to someone, the more you know about them, and the more conversational hooks you have – simply put, you just know them better and so there’s more to talk about. </p><p><strong>Open channel hooks </strong><br>In a sufficiently low friction, high trust setting, people share voluntarily – they feel comfortable enough to offer these 'hooks' up. The best example of this is just hanging out together.</p><p><strong>Observed context hooks</strong> <br>If two people in a physical space bump into each other when they go to make coffee, that’s something to talk about. The same with the clothes, the weather (sorry, I’m a British cliche), the music they're playing. Our shared context powers conversation. When we aren’t able to see each other and share physical space, we have less shared context.</p></div><p>For consumers, Instagram Stories offers a neat solution by letting users offer up conversational hooks through low-stakes context sharing. Why 'low stakes'? Because stories are ephemeral, there is less pressure for the glossy presentation of a more permanent post so people can be more honest and less worried about their image. After all, the content won't last more than a day – a version of the 'open channel' we looked at earlier. This offers up a conversation starter that friends can latch onto, often spilling into a full chat.</p><p><strong>The role of proximity</strong></p><p>Real world conversation isn’t without a spatial dimension: we use proximity to control who is involved, and who is involved directly determines the type of conversation.</p><p>Conversations vary at different scales because every time we speak, we're adapting our thoughts for the audience. Whenever we speak, we’re thinking of these things:</p><ul><li>Who is the audience?</li><li>What will they think of this?</li><li>Have they understood what I’m saying?</li></ul><p>As the group gets bigger there are more people to please, and so more people to consider how they’ll receive what you’re saying. Scale directly affects how intimate a conversation is. As the number of people listening increases, a topic gets more and more diluted or the conversation becomes more and more generic.</p><p>Effectively, as the audience grows, the soapbox that a speaker at any moment is socially standing on, gets taller and the spotlight gets brighter.</p><p>This is the reason that we often take someone to one side to be able to have a more intimate conversation. Now, this is a solved problem in many social apps because they force users to rigidly define a boundary: WhatsApp groups, Slack channels etc. all have a fixed list of members OR they're totally open (like Twitter), and there's no concept of controlling the audience. </p><p>However, in a social app that offers an open space, setting rigid boundaries on a conversation isn't the natural solution – doing that would be much more equivalent to gathering people in a particular room, and so is more intent-driven. This is fine for a meeting, but the required intent also demands undivided attention during the gathering.</p><p><strong>The role of ephemerality</strong></p><p>In a normal conversation setting, things aren't quite so permanent – whatever is said is heard by the audience but not recorded forever on a server.</p><p>Just imagine two conversations in a real office: one that happens normally with someone you're sitting with, and one where there's also a camera there, recording everything. Simply making that one change to the scene, adding a sense of permanence, completely changes the dynamic. A place can be transformed from a cafe to a stage: more formal, intentional... and less natural.</p><p>Of course, there's benefits to this in the right situation (a paper trail can be useful), but to recreate the organic conversations and truly open environment that allows for social serendipity, communication needs to be able to be 'throw-away' and frivolous. </p><p>This is something that Snapchat nailed for consumer social – by making things impermanent, they are free to be more natural and real. </p>…</div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>Every company in the world has to ask questions to its customers.</p>



<p>Combined to data, it’s the best way to really know how they feel, what made them customers, what you should improve in your products, how loyal they are, etc. Those questions (and their answers) became a way to track the performance of companies and to benchmark them to their competitors. Some companies even started to calculate a part of their CEO remuneration based on customers satisfaction. <a href="https://screeb.app/net-promoter-score-nps/net-promoter-score-understanding-and-measuring-your-nps-with-screeb/">Net Promoter Score</a>, <a href="https://screeb.app/customer-effort-score-ces/customer-effort-score-understanding-and-measuring-your-ces-with-screeb/">Customer Effort Score</a>, Customer Satisfaction, <a href="https://screeb.app/product-feedback/how-to-collect-product-feedback-from-your-users-with-screeb/">Product Feedback</a>, Product Market Fit, Market Study… you have tons of occasions to ask questions during your customers’ journey, and tons of good reasons to do it.</p>



<p>Obviously, if it’s that important for companies, other providers already try to solve that issue. The survey industry is a $45B market, when you include all the players operating along the complete funnel (market research firms, software providers like SurveyMonkey or <a href="https://screeb.app/screeb-vs-typeform/">Typeform</a>…). Some Customer Experience suites and some CRM also provides survey features, and that segment is an even bigger market, with a $54B cap.</p>



<p>But existing solutions have major flaws:</p>



<p>1️⃣ They crush your users’ experience, by interrupting them in your app or on your website, or by adding yet another email in their inbox.<br>93% of Internet users say that they feel more online interruptions than 2 or 3 years ago, and 82% of them already left a website or an app because of them.</p>



<p>So instead of helping you better understand your customers, surveys make them leave.</p>



<p>2️⃣ Because of that bad experience, only a small fraction of your customers answer. In average, online survey have a 12% conversion rate. It means that 88% of the people you ask questions to refuse to answer.<br>With that few answers, how can you be sure that the decisions you’ll make from the insights you’ll collect are the right ones?</p>



<p>Increasing the response rate must be a priority to improve your retention.</p>



<p>3️⃣ And if it’s such an effort to answer, those 12% of people answering are, most of the time, really happy or really angry customers. It means that you mostly collect extreme answers and that you miss the more-neutral-but-still-highly-important answers of your customers.<br>That bias is as bad as the low response rate one, because it means that the decisions you’ll take will be based on a non-representative panel of users.</p>



<p><strong>A bad UX, a low response rate and a bias in the answers : the survey experience is broken.</strong></p>

<h2>Social &amp; Messaging DNA</h2>



<p>At Screeb, we come from the social media and messaging industry. Michael, our CEO, worked at Facebook for 7 years. Simon, our Head of Products &amp; Marketing, cofounded Bringr – a leading social media management solution in France – that has been acquired by iAdvize, the European leader of conversational marketing. He worked here for 5 years, including 2 with Michael and Samuel, our CTO.</p>



<p>Social and Messaging is <strong>in our DNA</strong>.</p>



<p>It means that when we started to work on that topic, we brought a fresh eye and we decided to start from scratch, not looking at what the survey industry was doing, but taking our inspiration from Instagram, Messenger or Zenly.,</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://screeb.app/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/illustrations-2.png" alt="" width="526" height="373"></figure></div>



<p>The result? <strong>The beta we are announcing today!</strong> 🎉</p>



<p>We’ve developed a conversational survey designed to increase your retention rate. We worked a lot on how to integrate it as smoothly as possible in your visitors and users journey while increasing your response rate. Our experience and hundreds of hours of conversations with brands from all over the world were crucial to build Screeb. Still, we also wanted to invent a new format and so we decided not to adopt a traditional chatbot/chatbox format to prefer a “layer” one, more nicely integrated on our users’ interface.</p>



<p>So our beta starts today! That’s a invitation-only beta, meaning that you can register right now to be a part of it but we’ll progressively deliver invitations, to closely onboard our first users. We’ve opened a waiting list, and the more you’ll share Screeb to your friends and colleagues, the sooner you’ll get your invitation to our beta.</p>



<p>So, are you ready to increase your retention rate?<br>Are your ready to collect insights in the most efficient way ever?<br>Are you ready for Screeb?</p>



<p>We can’t wait to see how you’ll use it!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>On March 30, 2020, the <a href="https://www.acm.org/articles/bulletins/2020/march/dl-access-during-covid-19">ACM announced</a> that its digital library would be open access for three months. During that time, every conference paper, journal article and book chapter published by the ACM was free to the general public. They didn’t even require a login. The reason to open the digital library was a good one: most people who use it get access through where they work, either in industry or academia. Because of the global pandemic, most people who use it are now working at home, outside of the network which allows them access.</p>
<p>I hoped it would remain open. I shared URLs to papers on the Digital Library on forums, in emails and even in source repos knowing everyone could access the papers at the moment, and hoping that would continue. I even let myself think it was likely that those making the decisions at the ACM would see that this free access had become a public good. I was wrong. On schedule, the ACM Digital Library closed again on June 30, 2020.</p>
<p>It should have remained open. First, because the global pandemic is not over, and few people who read computer science research papers are back at work. Most people who work in the software industry are still at home, and there is still uncertainty about what will happen in American colleges and universities in the next school year.</p>
<p>But more importantly, the ACM Digital Library should have remained open because the most comprehensive repository of computer science research should be freely available to all.</p>

<p>The Association for Computing Machinery, or ACM, is a non-profit professional organization for the field of computing. Its stated mission is to support “<a href="https://www.acm.org/about-acm/about-the-acm-organization">educators, researchers and professionals</a>” who work in all forms of computing. In practice, I believe the members are primarily computer science educators and researchers and the efforts of the ACM reflect that.</p>
<p>One of the most important functions of the ACM are its conferences and journals. Researchers in academia and industry publish their work through peer-reviewed conference proceedings and journals. For any given field in computer science, there is usually an ACM conference or journal which is one of the top venues to publish in for that field.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://dl.acm.org/">Digital Library</a> is the online repository for all of this research. It has papers published this month all the way back to the beginning of the field of computing in the early 1950s. It is, as far as I know, the most comprehensive single source of computer science research in the world.</p>

<p>The ACM is not a for-profit publisher. They are, as said above, a non-profit professional organization. This fact distinguishes them from for-profit publishers like Elsevier. There is a long-standing effort by many in the scientific community to <a href="http://thecostofknowledge.com/">boycott Elsevier</a> and move to open access publications. This boycott has resulted in many organizations ending contracts including <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/the-nutshell/sweden-cancels-agreement-with-elsevier-over-open-access-64405">Dutch</a>, <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-analysis/major-german-universities-cancel-elsevier-contracts-31208">German</a> and <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/the-nutshell/sweden-cancels-agreement-with-elsevier-over-open-access-64405">Swedish</a> universities, the <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-terminates-subscriptions-worlds-largest-scientific-publisher-push-open-access-publicly">University of California</a> system and <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/guided-by-open-access-principles-mit-ends-elsevier-negotiations-0611">MIT</a>.</p>
<p>For Elsevier, this fight for open access is existential. They exist to make a profit on scientific publishing. If Elsevier can’t charge for access to the papers it has published, it has no business model and it will cease to exist. The ACM exists to serve the field of computing and society itself. The purpose of the ACM is laid out clearly in <a href="https://www.acm.org/about-acm/acm-constitution#article2">Article 2 of its constitution</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Association is an international scientific and educational organization dedicated to advancing the art, science, engineering, and application of information technology, serving both professional and public interests by fostering the open interchange of information and by promoting the highest professional and ethical standards.</p></blockquote>
<p>Opening the ACM Digital Library supports every part of that sentence.</p>
<p>My impression is that practitioners are underrepresented in the ACM. These are the professional software developers, product managers and system administrators who do the majority of the professional computing work in our industry. The ACM has on the order of <a href="https://www.acm.org/about-acm/acm-history">100,000 members</a>, which is surely a small fraction of the total computing professionals in the world.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2014/8/177024-acm-and-the-professional-programmer/fulltext">then-president Vint Cerf asked</a> why so many professionals are not members, the closed Digital Library <a href="https://www.itworld.com/article/2697033/why-many-programmers-don-t-bother-joining-the-acm.html">was one of the top answers</a>. Professional organizations exist to serve the profession and the professionals in it—even non-members. The Digital Library should not be a membership perk. It should be the public resource that inspires professionals to become members.</p>

<p>The moment you write something, you own its copyright. In order for the ACM to publish a paper, we have to <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright-and-license-forms">transfer copyright</a>. Per that agreement, authors retain the right to publish the paper on their home page (<a href="https://www.scott-a-s.com/publications">which I do</a>). The institutions the authors work at and the agencies that funded the work are also allowed to publish the paper.</p>
<p>Savvy readers without access to the Digital Library know this fact. Most recent papers can be found by simply Googling its title. Occasionally, finding a free copy of a recent paper requires tracking it down directly from authors’ homepages or institutional publication lists.</p>
<p>If most recent papers are available elsewhere, why all the fuss? There are four reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not&nbsp;<em>all</em> recent papers are posted by their authors or institutions. Authors don’t always update their home pages and institutions don’t always post papers. Some authors don’t even have a home page.</li>
<li>Older papers, from before authors routinely had a home page, are not freely available anywhere.</li>
<li>The Digital Library URL for a paper should be the canonical online home for that paper. If the author does not have a home page or the institution they work for ceases to exist, that URL will always be valid. But people are less likely to share that URL if not everyone can access it. Rather, they will point to the versions scattered throughout the internet.</li>
<li>The Digital Library itself is valuable: it is a well-designed network of papers, authors, conferences and journals. If you find an interesting paper, you can then easily look at the other papers published in the same conference. Or other papers published by the same author.</li>
</ol>

<p>Rationally, three months of open access is better than zero, so the current situation is better than before. Yet, instead of giving the ACM credit for those three months, I’m asking for more. I acknowledge that is unfair. I also acknowledge that the ACM has <a href="https://libraries.acm.org/subscriptions-access/acmopen">stated that their eventual goal</a> is general open access. They have several efforts towards this goal: ACM conferences can choose to <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/permanent-access">grant open access</a> to their latest proceedings; authors can <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/openaccess#hybrid">pay a fixed fee</a> for their paper to be open; and they established entire journals where all articles <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/openaccess#gold">must pay the fixed fee</a> to be open.</p>
<p>This is progress, and we must grant credit for incremental improvements. But I fear the ACM is still being too conservative: these efforts are ad-hoc, do not apply to historical papers and do not seem to make open access the primary goal.</p>
<p>I freely admit that I do not know what a sustainable model would look like. But I do know it is possible. While they are smaller in scope, there are major computer science conferences and journals that are completely open access, such as <a href="https://www.usenix.org/">USENIX</a> and <a href="https://vldb.org/">VLDB</a>.</p>
<p>I am a member of the ACM, and I intend to be a member for the rest of my life. I criticize it not because it is bad, but because I believe it is good. I just want it to be better.</p>

        <p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/theautomatic.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/python-for-else-statement.jpg?w=640" alt="python for else statement" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>



<p>One of the first things you usually learn when starting a new language is the if-else construct of that language.  <a href="http://theautomatic.net/category/python/">Python</a>, like some other languages, offers an extended variation of this called the “for/else” statement.  Let’s check out a couple examples to see how it works!</p>
<h2><strong>The for/else statement</strong></h2>
<p>The main use case for the for/else statement is when you need to loop through a list with the potential to break out of the loop.  If a break occurs in the loop, the code within the <strong>else</strong> clause will <em>not</em> be executed.  However, if a break does <em>not</em> occur, then the code within the <strong>else</strong> clause <em>will</em> be executed.</p>
<p>For example, in the code below we initialize test = False.  Then we loop through each element in the list, <em>nums</em>.  If an element in <em>nums</em> equals 20, we break out of the loop.  Since no element equals 20,  we never break out of the loop, and therefore, the <strong>else</strong> clause is executed, which changes the value of test to equal True.</p>
<pre title="">

nums = [10, 4, 6, 8, 2]
test = False
for num in nums:
    if num == 20:
        break
else:
    test = True


</pre>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/theautomatic.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/python-search-list.png?w=640" alt="python search list for else statement" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>In general, rather than just flagging a variable as True / False, you might want to perform some additional actions based off whether the break occurred.</p>
<pre title="">
nums = [10, 4, 6, 8, 2]
test = False
for num in nums:
    if num == 20:
        # do something here if 20 is found...
        break
else:
    test = True
    # do additional code here in case 20 is never found...

</pre>
<h2><strong>while/else statements</strong></h2>
<p>In addition to for/else statements, <a href="http://theautomatic.net/category/python/">Python</a> also supports while/else statements.  We can modify our code above to use a while/else statement like this:</p>
<pre title="">
nums = [10, 4, 6, 8, 2]
test = False
i = 0
while i in range(len(nums)):
    if nums[i] == 20:
        break
    i += 1
else:
    test = True

</pre>

<![CDATA[The Magical Methods in C#]]>

<p>There’s a certain set of special method signatures in C# which have particular support on the language level.
Methods with those signatures allow for using a special syntax which has several benefits. For example, we can use them to simplify our code or create <code>DSL</code> to express a solution to our domain-specific problem in a much cleaner way. I came across those methods in different places, so I decided to create a blog post to summarize all my discoveries on this subject.</p>

<h2 id="collection-initialization-syntax">Collection initialization syntax<a href="#collection-initialization-syntax" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h2>

<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/object-and-collection-initializers#collection-initializers">Collection initializer</a> is a quite old feature, as it exists in the language since version 3 (released in late 2007). Just as a reminder, <code>Collection initializer</code> allows for pre-populating a list by providing elements inside the block statement:</p>

<pre><code>var list = new List&lt;int&gt; { 1, 2, 3};
</code></pre>

<p>This translates simply to the following list of statements:</p>

<pre><code>var list = new List&lt;int&gt;();
list.Add(1);
list.Add(2);
list.Add(3);
</code></pre>

<p><code>Collection initializer</code> is not characteristic only for arrays and collection types from <code>BCL</code> but can be used with any type meeting the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Implements <code>IEnumerable</code> interface</li>
<li>Declares method with <code>void Add(T item)</code> signature</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>public class CustomList&lt;T&gt;: IEnumerable
{
    public IEnumerator GetEnumerator() =&gt; throw new NotImplementedException();
    public void Add(T item) =&gt; throw new NotImplementedException();
}
</code></pre>

<p>We can add support for <code>Collection initializer</code> to existing types by defining the <code>Add</code> method as an extension method:</p>

<pre><code>public static class ExistingTypeExtensions
{
    public static void Add&lt;T&gt;(ExistingType @this, T item) =&gt; throw new NotImplementedException();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This syntax can be also used to insert elements into the collection field without accessible setter in initialization block:</p>

<pre><code>class CustomType
{
    public List&lt;string&gt; CollectionField { get; private set; }  = new List&lt;string&gt;();
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var obj = new CustomType
        {
            CollectionField = 
            {
                "item1",
                "item2"
            }
        };
    }
}

</code></pre>

<p><code>Add</code> method can have more than one parameter:</p>

<pre><code>public class CustomList&lt;T&gt;: IEnumerable
{
    public IEnumerator GetEnumerator() =&gt; throw new NotImplementedException();
    public void Add(T item, string extraParam1, int extraParam1) =&gt; throw new NotImplementedException();
}
</code></pre>

<p>To use this overload inside the initialization block we need to wrap all parameters in extra pair of curly braces:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = new CustomType
{
    CollectionField = 
    {
        {"item1", "extraParamVal1", 2 },
        {"item2", "extraParamVal2", 3 }
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p><code>Collection initializer</code> is quite often used to initialize collection with a well known number of items, but we can utilize it to set up collection with a dynamic number of elements. In both cases the syntax is identical:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = new CustomType
{
    CollectionField = 
    {
       existingItems
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>This is possible for types which meet the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Implements <code>IEnumerable</code> interface</li>
<li>Declares method with <code>void Add(IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; items)</code> signature</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>public class CustomList&lt;T&gt;: IEnumerable
{
    public IEnumerator GetEnumerator() =&gt; throw new NotImplementedException();
    public void Add(IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; items) =&gt; throw new NotImplementedException();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, array type and collections from <code>BCL</code> don’t implement <code>void Add(IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; items)</code> method, but we could easily change that by defining an extension method for the existing collection types:</p>

<pre><code>public static class ListExtensions
{
    public static void Add&lt;T&gt;(this List&lt;T&gt; @this, IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; items) =&gt; @this.AddRange(items);
}

</code></pre>

<p>Thanks to this extension method it’s now possible to write code which looks as follows:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = new CustomType
{
    CollectionField = 
    {
        existingItems.Where(x =&gt; /*Filter items*/) .Select(x =&gt; /*Map items*/) 
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>or even compose the resulting collection from the mix of individual elements and results of multiple <code>enumerables</code>:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = new CustomType
{
    CollectionField = 
    {
        individualElement1,
        individualElement2,
        list1.Where(x =&gt; /*Filter items*/) .Select(x =&gt; /*Map items*/),
        list2.Where(x =&gt; /*Filter items*/) .Select(x =&gt; /*Map items*/),
    }
};

<p>Without this syntax, it would be very hard to achieve a similar result inside the initialization block.</p>

<p>I’ve discovered this language feature by accident while working with mappings for types with collection fields generated from <code>protobuf</code> contracts. For those of you who are not familiar with <code>protobuf</code>, if you are using <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp-generated">grpctools</a> to generate dotnet types from <code>proto</code> files, all collection fields are generated as follows:</p>

<pre><code>[DebuggerNonUserCode]
public RepeatableField&lt;ItemType&gt; SomeCollectionField
{
    get
    {
        return this.someCollectionField_;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, collection fields in generated code don’t have a setter, but a blessing in disguise, <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/collections/repeated-field-t-">RepeatableField<t></t></a> implements <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/collections/repeated-field-t-#class_google_1_1_protobuf_1_1_collections_1_1_repeated_field_3_01_t_01_4_1a6d0e9efbac818182068afae48b8d4599">void Add(IEnumerable<t> items)</t></a> so we can still initialize them inside the initialization block:</p>

<pre><code>/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Adds all of the specified values into this collection. This method is present to
/// allow repeated fields to be constructed from queries within collection initializers.
/// Within non-collection-initializer code, consider using the equivalent &lt;see cref="AddRange"/&gt;
/// method instead for clarity.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name="values"&gt;The values to add to this collection.&lt;/param&gt;
public void Add(IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; values)
{
    AddRange(values);
}

<h2 id="dictionary-initialization-syntax">Dictionary initialization syntax<a href="#dictionary-initialization-syntax" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h2>

<p>One of the cool features introduced in C# 6 was <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-6#initialize-associative-collections-using-indexers">Index initializers</a> which simplified syntax for dictionary initialization. Thanks to that we can write dictionary init code in a much more readable way:</p>

<pre><code>var errorCodes = new Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt;
{
    [404] = "Page not Found",
    [302] = "Page moved, but left a forwarding address.",
    [500] = "The web server can't come out to play today."
};
</code></pre>

<p>This code is translated to:</p>

<pre><code>var errorCodes = new Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt;();
errorCodes[404] = "Page not Found";    
errorCodes[302] = "Page moved, but left a forwarding address.";    
errorCodes[500] = "The web server can't come out to play today.";    
</code></pre>

<p>It’s not much but it definitely results with a better experience for writing and reading the code.</p>

<p>The best thing about <code>Index initializer</code> is that it is not limited only to <code>Dictionary&lt;&gt;</code> class, it can be used with any type which defines an <code>indexer</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class HttpHeaders
{
    public string this[string key]
    {
        get =&gt; throw new NotImplementedException();
        set =&gt; throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var headers = new HttpHeaders
        {
            ["access-control-allow-origin"] = "*",
            ["cache-control"] = "max-age=315360000, public, immutable"
        };
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="deconstructors">Deconstructors<a href="#deconstructors" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h2>

<p>In C# 7.0, together with tuples, a deconstructor mechanism has been introduced. Deconstructors allow for “decomposing” a tuple into a set of individual variables as follows:</p>

<pre><code>var point = (5, 7);
// decomposing tuple into separated variables
var (x, y) = point;
</code></pre>

<p>which is equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>ValueTuple&lt;int, int&gt; point = new ValueTuple&lt;int, int&gt;(1, 4);
int x = point.Item1;
int y = point.Item2;
</code></pre>

<p>This syntax allows also for switching values of two variables without the need for an explicit declaration of the third variable:</p>

<pre><code>int x = 5, y = 7;
//switch
(x, y) = (y,x);
</code></pre>

<p>… or for a more succinct way of member initialization:</p>

<pre><code>class Point
{
    public int X { get; }
    public int Y { get; }

    public Point(int x, int y)  =&gt; (X, Y) = (x, y);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Deconstructors can be used not only with tuples but with custom types too. To allow for deconstructing custom type, it needs to implement a method that obeys the following rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>It’s named <code>Deconstruct</code></li>
<li>Returns void</li>
<li>Every parameter has to be defined with <code>out</code> modifier</li>
</ul>

<p>For our type <code>Point</code> we can define deconstructor in the following way:</p>

<pre><code>class Point
{
    public int X {get;}
    public int Y {get;}

    public Point(int x, int y) =&gt; (X, Y) = (x, y);
    
    public void Deconstruct(out int x, out int y) =&gt; (x, y) = (X, Y);
}
</code></pre>

<p>and sample usage can look as follows:</p>

<pre><code>var point = new Point(2,4);
var (x, y)= point;        
</code></pre>

<p>which under the hood is translated to:</p>

<pre><code>int x;
int y;
new Point(2, 4).Deconstruct(out x, out y);
</code></pre>

<p>Deconstructors can be added to types declared outside the source code by defining them as an extension method:</p>

<pre><code>public static class PointExtensions
{
     public static void Deconstruct(this Point @this, out int x, out int y) =&gt; (x, y) = (@this.X, @this.Y);
}
</code></pre>

<p>One of the most useful examples of deconstructors is the one for <code>KeyValuePair&lt;TKey,TValue&gt;</code>, which allows for easy access to key and value while iterating over a dictionary:</p>

<pre><code>foreach(var (key, value) in new Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt; { [1] = "val1", [2] = "val2" })
{
    //TODO: Do something
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>KeyValuePair&lt;TKey,TValue&gt;.Deconstruct(TKey, TValue)</code> is available only from <code>netstandard2.1</code>. For previous <code>netstandard</code> versions we need to add it manually using the approach with the extension method.</p>

<h2 id="custom-awaitable-types">Custom awaitable types<a href="#custom-awaitable-types" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h2>

<p>C# 5 (released together with Visual Studio 2012) introduced an <code>async/await</code> mechanism which was a real game-changer in the area of asynchronous programming. Before that, handling invocation of asynchronous methods resulted very often in quite a messy code, especially when there was more than one asynchronous invocation:</p>

<pre><code>void DoSomething()
{
    DoSomethingAsync().ContinueWith((task1) =&gt; {
        if (task1.IsCompletedSuccessfully)
        {
            DoSomethingElse1Async(task1.Result).ContinueWith((task2) =&gt; {
                if (task2.IsCompletedSuccessfully)
                {
                    DoSomethingElse2Async(task2.Result).ContinueWith((task3) =&gt; {
                        //TODO: Do something
                    });
                }
            });

</blockquote>

<p>Deps is a private, hosted, Maven repository. While building it I had a critical decision to make - Where to host it? I evaluated many different hosting services but decided on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). I’ve been using it in pre-production and then production for over a year and a half now. I haven’t seen too many experience reports on Google Cloud, so I wanted to share how I’ve found it, what went well, and what still needs improving. I’ve split my thoughts below into good, meh, bad, ugly, and opportunities for improvement. I have compared and contrasted with Amazon Web Services (AWS), the other hosting provider that I have the most experience with, and GCP’s biggest competitor.</p>

<p>A note up front, these are solely my experiences, and it’s quite possible that I’ve misunderstood or misrepresented things here. If I’ve made any mistakes, let me know so I can correct them. I only talk about services that I have experience using. There are a bunch of really good looking services like Google Kubernetes Engine, Google App Engine, and BigQuery, but I haven’t used them enough (or at all) to be able to give a review on them.</p>

<h2 id="permissions">Permissions</h2>

<p>Google Cloud’s permission model is one of its strongest features. AWS IAM permissions are fairly complicated; in practice people often set permissions to <code>s3:*</code> or equivalent to make things work. For this reason (and others) there has become a ‘best-practice’ of running multiple AWS accounts for dev, staging, and prod, and <a href="https://segment.com/blog/secure-access-to-100-aws-accounts/">maybe more environments</a>. AWS seems to be okay with this situation and is leaning into it, offering <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/06/introducing-aws-landing-zone/">AWS Landing Zone</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/">Organisations</a> to help orchestrate multiple accounts. This works, but it seems like it adds a lot of complexity.</p>

<p>In contrast, GCP offers a much simpler starting point: Projects. Every resource you create (I think?) lives in a Project, and Projects live inside your (single) Organisation. By default, resources within a Project are accessible to other resources in that Project (as long as their API is enabled) and are inaccessible to anything outside of the project. For example, if you create a Cloud SQL database and a Cloud Storage bucket, by default a VM inside the project can access both resources, but a VM outside of the project couldn’t. This goes a long way towards setting up safe permission structures. If you need to, you can setup inter-project resource access, but it’s not something you’re likely to need too much. In my experience, I needed it for accessing disk images and DNS records, but everything else for Deps’ production service lives isolated in the production project.</p>

<p>Google’s Organisation management offers <a href="https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-folders">hierarchical folders</a> with cascading permissions. I haven’t needed to use them, but it seems like this would scale well to very large organisations. I wonder if this is modelled on the way Google’s internal permission system works?</p>

<h2 id="product-philosophy">Product Philosophy</h2>

<p>GCP has quite a different product philosophy to AWS. When new GCP features and resources are released into general availability, they are usually very high quality. This is in contrast to AWS where it can sometimes feel like you are the first person to use a feature. A quote I have seen which rings true to me is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17025561">“Google’s Beta is like AWS’s GA”</a>.</p>

<p>GCP also has done well with integrating their different services together. GCP provides a smaller set of core primitives that are global and work well for lots of use cases. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/">Pub/Sub</a> is probably the best example I have for this. In AWS you have SQS, SNS, Amazon MQ, Kinesis Data Streams, Kinesis Data Firehose, DynamoDB Streams, and maybe another queueing service by the time you read this post. <strong>2019 Update</strong>: Amazon has now released another streaming service: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/msk/">Amazon Managed Streaming Kafka</a>. GCP has Pub/Sub. Pub/Sub seems flexible enough to replace most (all?) of AWS’ various queues. (Disclaimer, I haven’t used Pub/Sub yet, just looked at its documentation).</p>

<p>Google opts for strong consistency by default. Google Cloud Storage, has <a href="https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2018/02/how-Google-Cloud-Storage-offers-strongly-consistent-object-listing-thanks-to-Spanner.html">consistent</a> lists and gets, Cloud Key Management Service has strong (global) consistent key enablement, and Cloud Spanner is their globe-spanning consistent database. Many AWS services are eventually consistent, which pushes complexity onto the developer.</p>

<p>Even though Google has a smaller set of primitives than AWS, they are often simpler. Rather than having dozens of compute instance types, they offer just four: micro, standard, highmem, and highcpu. In actual fact, these are all just pre-configurations in the design space, and you can size and configure your instances to be just about any combination of memory and CPU.</p>

<p>Another small thing, but one that I appreciated is that GCP’s resource names are often aesthetically prettier. Either you get to name resources yourself (I’m looking at you <code>jfkjfkfjlkjfjfkak.cloudfront.net</code>), or the generated names are short, e.g. <code>&lt;instance-prefix&gt;-cjgh</code>.</p>

<h2 id="global-and-regional-by-default">Global and Regional by default</h2>

<p>One of the nicest things about GCP is that most resources are either global or regional. This includes things like the control panel (you can see all of your project’s VMs on a single screen), disk images, storage buckets (multi-region within a continent), network configuration, global load balancing, Pub/Sub, VPC networks, and probably more I’m forgetting. This contrasts with AWS, where most resources, including the control panel, are either zonal or regional.</p>

<h2 id="compute-engine">Compute Engine</h2>

<p>Google Compute Engine has been very solid for me. I’m only using it for a handful of VMs but I haven’t noticed any issues with it. The instance group managers work well and auto-scaling does what it’s meant to do. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/health-checks">Health checks</a> can be used to destroy unhealthy instances and create new ones without manual intervention (this has pros and cons, as you may lose debugging information). <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups/updating-managed-instance-groups">Rolling updates</a> work well for doing deployments. The Rolling Update manager waits for new instances to be healthy before shutting down old instances. This has helped catch a few issues before they hit production. If your instance is unhealthy, GCP provides <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/live-migration">live instance migration</a>. It’s nice, it seems to happen once/twice a week, and I’ve never noticed any issues with it. On AWS, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/maintenance-help/">maintenance events</a> will require a reboot.</p>

<p>Google’s pricing model is much simpler. As mentioned above, you can preconfigure your machines to just about any combination of memory and CPU that makes sense for your application. You can also pick your Intel CPU instance family if you need certain CPU features, or just want the slight performance boost available.</p>

<p>For standard VMs, Google offers <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/sustained-use-discounts">Sustained Use Discounts</a>. If you run a standard VM for more than 25% of a month, Compute Engine automatically discounts your bill. If you run an instance for a full month this ends up to be a 30% discount. This is a nice benefit if you don’t want to pre-purchase capacity, but still have a stable workload. They even do something neat with ‘inferred instances’ where they bin-pack partial instance usage. This means you don’t lose your discount if you replace instances through the month, and ends up giving you the maximum possible discount. I can’t do it justice here, check out the docs, it’s really cool.</p>

<p>Google’s answer to AWS spot pricing is <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/preemptible">Preemptible Instances</a>. Instead of bidding on instances and working out the maximum price you’re willing to pay, they offer a single, fixed 80% discount. One thing that is trickier with Preemptible Instances is that you only get a 30-second warning before your instance is preempted. On AWS you get two minutes. The tradeoff is that both pre-emptible and standard instance startup times are faster because Google can evict Preemptible Instances more quickly. On AWS, after submitting a spot request you may have to wait a short time before your spot request is fulfilled.</p>

<p>Lastly, Google has an answer to Amazon’s Reserved Instances, and again they are much simpler. To use <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/signing-up-committed-use-discounts">Committed Use Discounts</a>, you purchase vCPUs and memory capacity separately. Your purchase is tied to a region but is otherwise convertible to just about any instance configuration (see the docs for a few small limitations). Committed Use Discounts are automatically applied to the instances you are running in your workload, and then Sustained Use Discounts are applied to any resource usage on top of that.</p>

<h2 id="terraform">Terraform</h2>

<p>Picking Terraform has been a really big win for Deps. It enables us to quickly and safely spin up a complete staging or development environment to test a risky infrastructure change. It also ensures that changes to production are tracked, commented, and coherent as a whole. Terraform takes a little bit of learning, but the <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/index.html">Google Cloud Provider docs</a> are really good, and the team working on the provider is constantly updating it with new features and resources in GCP. If you want to be on the bleeding edge of every GCP feature then Terraform may not be a good fit for you, as they don’t generally support beta resources. However you could manage those beta resources via the console/CLI/<a href="https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/">Deployment Manager</a> until Terraform support is added, then <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/index.html">import</a> them into your Terraform config.</p>

<p>The one place I think Terraform has room to improve is in running multiple environments from a single configuration, e.g. dev, staging, prod. <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/workspaces.html">Workspaces</a> are good, but there is limited support for switching variables based on your workspace.</p>

	The decision to shut down eight nuclear reactors in the year following the Fukushima disaster contributed to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/418078/electricity-prices-for-households-in-germany/">higher electricity prices</a> in Germany. It also led to the partial replacement of nuclear generation by electricity generated from coal, lignite and gas, and thus to an increase in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and local pollution, the health effects of which have not been considered.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Diffuse and concentrated risks</b>
</p>
<p>
	The dispersal of risks and accidents is a factor that facilitates their social acceptance. Thus, although much less deadly than road accidents (which cause more than <a href="https://www.preventionroutiere.asso.fr/2019/12/22/statistiques-daccidents/">3,000 deaths</a> a year in France), plane and train accidents cause more emotion. Even if we add to this the 20,000 or so injured people hospitalized each year as a result of road accidents, the car is perceived as not very dangerous, and public opinion erupts when the authorities seek to impose speed limits. In the evaluation of public policies, this difference in perception is generally not considered. At best, economists calculate the balance of aggregate benefits and costs without taking into account how these benefits and costs are felt by the public. Politicians, on the contrary, if only for electoral reasons, are more sensitive to the concentration or dispersion in time and space of the effects of their decisions.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Phasing out nuclear power</b>
</p>
<p>
	Germany's nuclear power plant policy is an example of this sprinkling effect. In 2011, after the meltdown of the Fukushima Daiichi reactors, the German government, which had just relaunched the industry, decided to gradually close all its nuclear power plants. The last ones will have to stop in 2022. No cost-benefit assessment was carried out to support this decision, but the federal authorities considered that it would be well accepted by the population, which has often shown its hostility to this technology because of the risks of accidents and the problem of waste reprocessing. Even today, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00148-015-0558-8">81% of Germans are still in favor</a> of this radical change of policy. For <a href="https://www.greenpeace.fr/la-sortie-du-nucleaire-en-allemagne-a-t-elle-ete-compensee-par-une-hausse-de-la-production-de-charbon/">environmental organizations</a>, the move away from nuclear power is a win-win situation, as plant closures are compensated for by the production of electricity from renewable sources, which is operated at close to zero cost and without emitting greenhouse gas or particulates. It is undeniable that green electricity production has <a href="https://www.energy-charts.de/ren_share.htm?year=all&amp;source=ren-share&amp;period=annual">sharply increased</a> over the decade. But in an industry where the product is not storable on a large scale, it is necessary to ensure that production is available at the times when consumers want to use it. Because wind and sun are intermittent, unless considerable capital is invested in energy storage facilities, green energy cannot be an identical replacement for dispatchable plants that operate at baseload levels and, if necessary, increase their output to meet peak demands. The problem arises in particular at the end of the day when demand increases while the photovoltaic panels are not producing. At times when green energy is not available, conventional German thermal power plants, or imports, have had to be used to replace closed nuclear power plants. The shutdown of the reactors has therefore been accompanied by an increase in production from green energy at times when it is available and, at times when it is not, by an increase in production from power stations burning coal, lignite and gas, as well as by an increase in imports, especially from Denmark, France and the Czech Republic.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Generalized cost</b>
</p>
<p>
	In total, output from thermal power stations has fallen, but to a lesser extent than if the nuclear power stations had not been shut down. A <a href="https://haas.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/WP304.pdf">study</a> conducted at Berkeley measures the difference between the observed trajectory and that of the alternative scenario in which the nuclear reactors would not have been shut down early (the counterfactual). It assesses the costs associated with the more intensive use of conventional thermal power plants and the increased imports resulting from the nuclear phase-out. The authors analyze the shutdown of 10 reactors (out of the 17 initially operating) between 2011 and 2017. The originality of the study is that it is not limited to production costs and aggregate carbon emissions. It also integrates the spatial dispersion of effects in terms of local air pollution. By combining data on hourly and plant by plant operating volumes and costs between 2010 and 2017 with information on electricity demand and prices, local weather conditions and primary energy prices, the authors calculate what the hourly output per plant would have been if the government had not ordered the closure of the ten reactors. They deduce the additional costs incurred in terms of primary energy consumption and environmental damage. They end up with some estimates of the effect of the closure decision on the average production of thermal power plants (+15%), on imports (+37%) and on wholesale prices (+4%). As the four major industrial groups owning nuclear power plants also owned coal-fired power plants, they were little penalized by this energy substitution. However, the higher prices were indeed a cost for German consumers, estimated by the authors at $1.6 billion per year. But this is not the main cost. The impact on health and the climate must also be considered.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	<b>Local pollution and excess mortality</b>
</p>
<p>
	The combustion of fossil fuels causes emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> and pollutants with local health effects (SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub> and fine particles). According to the study cited, the replacement of nuclear power plant production resulted in an additional 12% for each of these emissions. The additional carbon dioxide emissions amount to 36 million tons per year, which, based on a social cost of carbon of $50/tCO<sub>2</sub>, represents an additional cost of $1.8 billion per year.
</p>
<p>
	But the most important effect comes from additional local pollution: it would have caused an excess mortality of 1,100 individuals per year. This number is calculated from a geographical analysis of the populations living around the thermal power plants, the variation in local production induced by the government decision and estimates of the harmfulness of local pollution (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24332274">ESCAPE project</a>). It only considers residents in Germany, without integrating the effects in neighboring countries. Taking a value of $7.9 million as the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318790641_Income_Elasticities_and_Global_Values_of_a_Statistical_Life/fulltext/597f45b6aca272d568188301/Income-Elasticities-and-Global-Values-of-a-Statistical-Life.pdf">price of a German's life</a>, the authors of the study estimate that the additional cost of the closure decision due to local pollution amounts to $8.7 billion per year.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Benefits of closure</b>
</p>
<p>
	The costs are therefore substantial. What about the benefits? By closing the country's nuclear power plants, the German government wants to eliminate the risk of accidents and solve the problem of waste treatment and storage. The evaluation of the induced gain depends on the accident probabilities retained and on the way in which the <a href="https://www.liberation.fr/checknews/2019/04/20/est-il-vrai-que-l-accident-nucleaire-de-fukushima-n-a-cause-aucun-mort_1720075">populations</a> in the vicinity of the damaged plants are taken care of (evacuation, re-housing, care, etc.). Current estimates are around <a href="https://www.mech.kuleuven.be/en/tme/research/energy_environment/Pdf/wpen2013-14.pdf">$3 per MWh</a>. As the exit policy has resulted in a reduction of 53 TWh/year in nuclear generation, the estimated gain is less than $200 million per year, far from the annual cost of $12 billion resulting from the addition of the additional cost of production ($1.6M), the additional CO2 emissions ($1.8M) and the additional mortality linked to local emissions ($8.7M).
</p>
<p>
	*
</p>
<p>
	*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *
</p>

<p>
	Assessing the economic and environmental impact of a nuclear power plant is not easy. It requires approximate assumptions that are open to criticism. But even if one can think that the costs are overestimated and the gains underestimated by the study cited above, the gap between the two is so great that it is difficult to see how the decision to close could be justified on a purely techno-economic level. However, in hindsight, even in possession of these data, it is likely that the anxiety-producing potential of the images of the earthquake/tsunami/reactors-meltdown sequence looping through the 24-hour news channels would have led the German government to take the same decision. The scattering of illnesses and deaths caused by local pollution considerably reduces their weight in the face of an event such as Fukushima, where we find the ingredients of the classic tragedy: unity of place, unity of time and unity of action. It is a psychological fact that explains why political rationality often frees itself from economic and environmental analysis.

        <span>Step 3:</span> Get scrappy.
      </p>
      <p>
        It happened.
      </p>
      <p>
        The email every app developer dreads:
      </p>
      <p><img src="https://directmemo.io/images/blog/1/rejection-e2a3c6a88dbf773961f19d543c955055.png?vsn=d" alt=""></p><p>
        I had done everything right:
      </p>
      <p>
        -- I tackled a problem I had from my 5 years of working remotely: <span>the difficulty of privately sharing team-wide tasks, announcements, and reminders.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        -- I found my first customer on Twitter before writing a line of code.
      </p>
      <p>
        -- I even shipped quickly and iterated.
      </p>
      <p><img src="https://directmemo.io/images/blog/1/tweet-1c7e0b96d0e0d70d03aa4b661afb9531.png?vsn=d" alt=""></p><p>
        I checked all the boxes they teach you in Startup School!
      </p>
      <p>
        I tried to reason with them, or get some direction on how to get approval:

        No dice.
      </p>
      <p>Time to get scrappy.</p>
      <p>In a moment of brash inspiration, I tweeted at Stewart Butterfield (Slack's CEO) basically pleading my case</p>
      <p>No response.</p>
      <p>Sidenote: I deleted that tweet, but Stewart - if you’re reading this, give me a 5-minute chat any time, any place!</p>
      <p>My next move was to scour Twitter for phrases related to “Slack team tasks”, “Slack mass-messaging”, etc. and reach out directly to as many people as possible.</p>
      <p><img src="https://directmemo.io/images/blog/1/tweet2-9e15582f560fc65c73ec2c8461ff9e5a.png?vsn=d" alt=""></p><p>I ended up finding a 2-year-old tweet by Ryan Hoover (Founder of Product Hunt) about a browser plugin that served a similar purpose, but not very well.</p>
      <p>To get his attention, I posted the app to Product Hunt, and asked him for feedback as a reply to his original tweet:</p>
      <p><img src="https://directmemo.io/images/blog/1/hoover-fa7a1492ebc3de3e203a5b3f80d7cac7.png?vsn=d" alt=""></p><p>No response, again :/</p>
      <p>Next I created <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/direct-memo" target="_blank">an Indie Hackers profile</a> with a post linking to the Product Hunt page, which led to a good number of upvotes.</p>
      <p>Sidenote: I’ve found the IndieHacker community to be one of the most supportive and welcoming on the internet - a testament to the leadership team and Rosie Sherry, the community manager. If you’re interested in community building, <a href="https://rosieland.substack.com/" target="_blank">her newsletter</a> is a must-read.</p>
      <p>Upvotes trickled in, until something awesome and unexpected happened. Ryan upvoted my post!</p>
      <p><img src="https://directmemo.io/images/blog/1/upvote-5751a7e7165c8c5e0cb3245eda22e5bb.png?vsn=d" alt=""></p><p>Obviously, app signups surged.</p>
      <p>Users signed up from large corporations, small businesses, universities, and everything in between.</p>
      <p>Industries ranged from watch-makers to fantasy sports commissioners, to CEOs.</p>
      <p>The thrill was intoxicating, and it hasn’t died down. A month later I still jump out of bed to check on new signups every morning!</p>
      <p>Moral of the story: When things don't go as planned, get scrappy and put yourself in a position to get lucky.</p>
      <p>Next I’ll be experimenting with other ways to grow, like social media ads. Are there any courses or websites you recommend for learning how to do them well?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>C++17 introduced <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/new/operator_new">an alignment argument</a> to <code>::operator new()</code>. It's important to note that if you allocate something using aligned new, you <strong>absolutely must</strong> deallocate it <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/delete">using aligned delete</a>, or the behavior is undefined. LLVM 10.x takes advantage of this alignment parameter, if the compiler supports it. That means if you are compiling on Windows with MSVC set to C++14, <code>__cpp_aligned_new</code> is not defined and the extra argument isn't passed. Otherwise, if it's compiled with MSVC set to C++17, <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/User:D41D8CD98F/feature_testing_macros"><code>__cpp_aligned_new</code> is defined</a> and the extra argument is passed.</p><p>There's just one teeny tiny little problem - <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/6d2f73f821ed5ea584869924b150ac2e6e65c12e/llvm/include/llvm/Support/Compiler.h#L568">the check was in a header file</a>.</p><p>Now, if this header file were completely internal and LLVM itself only ever called <code>::operator new()</code> from inside it's libraries, this wouldn't be a problem. As you might have guessed, this was not the case. LLVM was calling <code>allocate_buffer()</code> from inside header files. The corresponding <code>deallocate_buffer</code> call <em>was</em> inside the same header file, but sadly, it was called from a destructor, and <em>that</em> destructor had been called from inside one of LLVM's libraries, which meant it didn't know about aligned allocations… <strong>Oops!</strong></p><p>This means, if your program uses C++17, but LLVM was compiled with C++14, your program will happily pass LLVM <strong>aligned memory</strong>, which LLVM will then pass into <strong>the wrong delete operator</strong>, because it's calling the unaligned delete function from C++14 instead of the aligned delete function from C++17. This results in strange and bizarre heap corruption errors because of the mismatched <code>::operator new</code> and <code>::operator delete</code>. Arguably, the real bug here is LLVM calling any allocation function from a header file in the first place, as this is just begging for ABI problems.</p><p>Of course, one might ask why a C++17 application would be linking against LLVM compiled with C++14. Well, you see, the <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-10.0.0">prebuilt LLVM binaries</a> were compiled against C++14… <strong>OOPS!</strong> Suddenly if you wanted to avoid compiling LLVM yourself, you couldn't use C++17 anymore!</p><p>Luckily <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/7aaff8fd2da2812a2b3cbc8a41af29774b10a7d6"><strong>this has now been fixed</strong></a> after a bunch of people complained about the extremely unintuitive errors resulting from this mismatch. Unfortunately, as of this writing, <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/">LLVM still hasn't provided a new release</a>, which means you will still encounter this problem using the latest precompiled binaries of LLVM. Personally, I recompile LLVM using C++17 for my own projects, just to be safe, since LLVM does not gaurantee ABI compatibility in these situations.</p><p>Still, this is a particularly nasty case of an unintentional ABI break between C++ versions, which is easy to miss because most people assume C++ versions are backwards compatible. Be careful, and stop allocating memory in header files that might be deallocated inside your library!</p></div></div>]]>

Things that are hard to come up with but easy to copy are ‘Math hard'.</p><p>Many mathematics problems take a long time to figure out how to solve. But, once you have a method, often the answer can be verified quickly and the method can be learned easily. Pythagoras needed to be smart to invent his theorem, but now children learn it in school. Other Math Hard things include recipes, designs, and new ideas.</p><p>Unless Pythagoras could have kept his method a secret, which is difficult to do, his theorem wouldn’t have helped him build a defensible company. Even school kids can copy it.</p><p>This is like startup ideas for a new kind of user experience or interface – they’re hard to figure out, hard to keep secret (especially if your users experience the secret), and easy to copy.</p><p>But what if you could keep the secret? After all, ‘trade secrets’ can be kept for a while if you’re careful.</p><p>The problem is, the more success you have with your secret, the more effort other people will put in to discover it. You might be really smart, and have worked really hard, but there are lots of smart people who will work hard to be successful. It’s unrealistic to think that you’ll ever have a totally unique insight, let alone one other people couldn’t come up with if they really wanted to.</p><p>If this kind of insight were the defensibility criterion necessary for starting a successful company, by definition almost no-one would ever start one. No matter the ingenuity of your invention, you’re going to end up competing on some other dimension.</p><p>Math Hardness, the hardness of working stuff out, at best buys you time. How much time? Sadly, some amount of time that’s inversely proportional to how much success you’re having. The more valuable your secret turns out to be, the less time you have left.</p><p>The other kind of hardness is the intrinsic hardness of doing certain things. Some things are difficult to do, even if everyone knows how to do them. This is Bodybuilding Hard.</p><p>Achieving a bodybuilder’s physique isn’t complicated, no matter what the endless range of supplements suggests. You need to: exercise frequently with heavy weights; and consistently eat a protein rich diet. Neither is a secret or complicated to understand. Most people, in shape or not, know this stuff. The problem is that doing these things is intrinsically hard. It requires strenuous activity that’s much less fun than seeing friends over beers and burgers.</p><p>Most valuable achievements are Bodybuilding Hard. Learning a new skill, becoming wealthy, being a good partner – all require effort. Practically everyone knows more or less how to achieve these things, but few actually do. That’s why there is a supplement shortcut for every industry: pointy guitars; self help books; and magazines with fancy bedroom techniques.</p><p>Bodybuilding Hard startups are everywhere. On demand services, marketplaces, ecommerce – they’re the backbone of Rocket Internet’s portfolio. They don’t have Pythagorean secrets. These businesses are a pain to run, requiring the coordination of thousands of people and complex operations.</p><p>Without a secret, beating everyone else is hard. But bodybuilding isn’t economically self-sustaining&nbsp;if&nbsp;you’re&nbsp;just&nbsp;good: you need to be the best. Despite small differences, the winner still takes it all.</p><p>Hence, bodybuilding is riddled with steroids and techniques to eek out tiny advantages. Bodybuilding startups are no different — only their steroids are cash, experience, and thousands of traumatised former bankers and consultants.</p><p>The more success you have through doing something Bodybuilding Hard, the more people are going to be incentivised to try to do the same thing. If it’s a startup worth starting, eventually the payoff must outweigh the hardness. And once it’s clear it does, your competition will bring steroids.</p><p>Bodybuilding Hardness, like Math Hardness, buys you time. How much time? Once again, some amount of time inversely proportional to how much success you’re having. The better it’s going, the less time you have left.</p><p>Both types of hardness are good ways to get started. Doing something hard buys you a window of opportunity to succeed. But, once you’re big, something else has to keep you there.</p><p>Defensibility doesn’t imply hardness in the long run, even if hardness is useful in the beginning. For the best companies, things get easier after the hard part.</p><p>Their long term advantage doesn’t require new insights or ongoing effort: it’s too hard to compete like this once the stakes are high enough. Their advantage is unique resource accumulation – like Google’s datasets or Apple’s brand, or scale-enabled product differentiation – like Uber’s liquidity or Amazon’s delivery infrastructure. You need to snowball.</p><p>Doing something hard can put you ahead of your competition, but it isn’t the hardness that will keep you there.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1553598693305_327084"><div><p>Thanks to the EF team for reading drafts of this.

Delivering a successful product is not something you do once and forget about but is rather a continuous recurring process. With every line of code that changes, software must remain in a functional state, which implies the need for rigorous testing.</p>
<p>Over time, as the software industry evolved, testing practices have matured as well. Gradually moving towards automation, testing approaches have also influenced software design itself, spawning mantras like test-driven development, emphasizing patterns such as dependency inversion, and popularizing high-level architectures that are built around it.</p>
<p>Nowadays, automated testing is embedded so deeply within our perception of software development, it’s hard to imagine one without the other. And since that ultimately enables us to produce software quickly without sacrificing quality, it’s hard to argue that it’s not a good thing.</p>
<p>However, despite there being many different approaches, modern “best practices” primarily push developers specifically towards <em>unit testing</em>. Tests, whose scope lies higher on <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html#TheTestPyramid">Mike Cohn’s pyramid</a> are either written as part of a wider suite (often by completely different people) or even disregarded entirely.</p>
<p>The benefit of this approach is often supported by the argument that unit tests provide the most value during development because they’re able to catch errors quickly and help enforce design patterns that facilitate modularity. This idea has become so widely accepted that the term “unit testing” is now somewhat conflated with automated testing in general, losing part of its meaning and contributing to confusion.</p>
<p>When I was a less experienced developer, I believed in following these “best practices” to the letter, as I thought that would make my code better. I didn’t particularly enjoy writing unit tests because of all the ceremony involved with abstractions and mocking, but it was the recommended approach after all, so who am I to know better.</p>
<p>It was only later, as I’ve experimented more and built more projects, that I started to realize that there are much better ways to approach testing and that <strong>focusing on unit tests is</strong>, in most cases, <strong>a complete waste of time</strong>.</p>
<p>Aggressively popularized “best practices” often have a tendency of manifesting cargo cults around them, enticing developers to apply design patterns or use specific approaches without giving them a much needed second thought. In the context of automated testing, I find this prevalent when it comes to our industry’s unhealthy obsession with unit testing.</p>
<p>In this article I will share my observations about this testing technique and go over why I believe it to be inefficient. I’ll also explain which approaches I’m currently using instead to test my code, both in open source projects and day-to-day work.</p>
<p><em>Note: this article contains code examples which are written in C#, but the language itself is not (too) important to the points I’m making.</em></p>
<p><em>Note 2: I’ve come to realize that programming terms are completely useless at conveying meanings because everyone seems to understand them differently. In this article I will be relying on the “standard” definitions, where unit testing targets smallest separable parts of code, end-to-end testing targets software’s outermost entry points, while integration testing is for everything in-between.</em></p>
<p><em>Note 3: if you don’t feel like reading the entirety of the article, you can skip to the end for the summary.</em></p>
<h2>Fallacies of unit testing</h2>
<p>Unit tests, as evident by the name, revolve around the concept of a “unit”, which denotes a very small isolated part of a larger system. There is no formal definition of what a unit is or how small it should be, but it’s mostly accepted that it corresponds to an individual function of a module (or method of an object).</p>
<p>Normally, when the code isn’t written with unit tests in mind, it may be impossible to test some functions in complete isolation because they can have external dependencies. In order to <em>work around</em> this issue, we can apply the dependency inversion principle and replace concrete dependencies with abstractions. These abstractions can then be substituted with real or fake implementations, depending on whether the code is executing normally or as part of a test.</p>
<p>Besides that, unit tests are expected to be pure. For example, if a function contains code that writes data to the file system, that part needs to be abstracted away as well, otherwise the test that verifies such behavior will be considered an integration test instead, since its coverage extends to the unit’s integration with the file system.</p>
<p>Considering the factors mentioned above, we can reason that <strong>unit tests are only useful to verify pure business logic inside of a given function</strong>. Their scope does not extend to testing side-effects or other integrations because that belongs to the domain of integration testing.</p>
<p>To illustrate how these nuances affect design, let’s take a look at an example of a simple system that we want to test. Imagine we’re working on an application that calculates local sunrise and sunset times, which it does through the help of the following two classes:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>LocationProvider</span> <span>:</span> <span>IDisposable</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>HttpClient</span> _httpClient <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>HttpClient</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    
    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>string</span> locationQuery<span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>

    
    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Dispose</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> _httpClient<span>.</span><span>Dispose</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>SolarCalculator</span> <span>:</span> <span>IDiposable</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>LocationProvider</span> _locationProvider <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>LocationProvider</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    
    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>SolarTimes<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetSolarTimesAsync</span><span>(</span><span>DateTimeOffset</span> date<span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Dispose</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> _locationProvider<span>.</span><span>Dispose</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Although the design above is perfectly valid in terms of OOP, neither of these classes are actually unit-testable. Because <code>LocationProvider</code> depends on its own instance of <code>HttpClient</code> and <code>SolarCalculator</code> in turn depends on <code>LocationProvider</code>, it’s impossible to isolate the business logic that may be contained within methods of these classes.</p>
<p>Let’s iterate on that code and replace concrete implementations with abstractions:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>interface</span> <span>ILocationProvider</span>
<span>{</span>
    Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>string</span> locationQuery<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>LocationProvider</span> <span>:</span> <span>ILocationProvider</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>HttpClient</span> _httpClient<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>LocationProvider</span><span>(</span><span>HttpClient</span> httpClient<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        _httpClient <span>=</span> httpClient<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>string</span> locationQuery<span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>interface</span> <span>ISolarCalculator</span>
<span>{</span>
    Task<span>&lt;</span>SolarTimes<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetSolarTimesAsync</span><span>(</span><span>DateTimeOffset</span> date<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>SolarCalculator</span> <span>:</span> <span>ISolarCalculator</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>ILocationProvider</span> _locationProvider<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>SolarCalculator</span><span>(</span><span>ILocationProvider</span> locationProvider<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        _locationProvider <span>=</span> locationProvider<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>SolarTimes<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetSolarTimesAsync</span><span>(</span><span>DateTimeOffset</span> date<span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>By doing so we were able to decouple <code>LocationProvider</code> from <code>SolarCalculator</code>, but in exchange our code nearly doubled in size. Also note that we had to drop <code>IDisposable</code> from both classes because they <strong>no longer own their dependencies</strong> and thus have no business taking responsibility for their lifecycle.</p>
<p>While these changes may seem as an improvement to some, it’s important to point out that the interfaces we’ve defined serve <strong>no practical purpose other than making unit testing possible</strong>. There’s no need for actual polymorphism in our design, so, as far as our code is concerned, these abstractions are <em>autotelic</em> (i.e. abstractions for the sake of abstractions).</p>
<p>Let’s try to reap the benefits of all that work and write a unit test for <code>SolarCalculator.GetSolarTimesAsync</code>:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>SolarCalculatorTests</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>[</span><span>Fact</span><span>]</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> <span>Task</span> <span>GetSolarTimesAsync_ForKyiv_ReturnsCorrectSolarTimes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        
        <span>var</span> location <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Location</span><span>(</span><span>50.45</span><span>,</span> <span>30.52</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
        <span>var</span> date <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>DateTimeOffset</span><span>(</span><span>2019</span><span>,</span> <span>11</span><span>,</span> <span>04</span><span>,</span> <span>00</span><span>,</span> <span>00</span><span>,</span> <span>00</span><span>,</span> TimeSpan<span>.</span><span>FromHours</span><span>(</span><span>+</span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

        <span>var</span> expectedSolarTimes <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>SolarTimes</span><span>(</span>
            <span>new</span> <span>TimeSpan</span><span>(</span><span>06</span><span>,</span> <span>55</span><span>,</span> <span>00</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
            <span>new</span> <span>TimeSpan</span><span>(</span><span>16</span><span>,</span> <span>29</span><span>,</span> <span>00</span><span>)</span>
        <span>)</span><span>;</span>

        <span>var</span> locationProvider <span>=</span> Mock<span>.</span><span><span>Of</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ILocationProvider</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>(</span>lp <span>=&gt;</span>
            lp<span>.</span><span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> Task<span>.</span><span>FromResult</span><span>(</span>location<span>)</span>
        <span>)</span><span>;</span>

        <span>var</span> solarCalculator <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>SolarCalculator</span><span>(</span>locationProvider<span>)</span><span>;</span>

        
        <span>var</span> solarTimes <span>=</span> <span>await</span> solarCalculator<span>.</span><span>GetSolarTimesAsync</span><span>(</span>date<span>)</span><span>;</span>

        
        solarTimes<span>.</span><span>Should</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>BeEquivalentTo</span><span>(</span>expectedSolarTimes<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here we have a basic test that verifies that <code>SolarCalculator</code> works correctly for a known location. Since unit tests and their units are tightly coupled, we’re following the recommended naming convention, where the test class is named after the class under test, and the name of the test method follows the <code>Method_Precondition_Result</code> pattern.</p>
<p>In order to simulate the desired precondition in the arrange phase, we have to inject corresponding behavior into the unit’s dependency, <code>ILocationProvider</code>. In this case we do that by substituting the return value of <code>GetLocationAsync()</code> with a location for which the correct solar times are already known ahead of time.</p>
<p>Note that although <code>ILocationProvider</code> exposes two different methods, from the contract perspective <strong>we have no way of knowing which one actually gets called</strong>. This means that by choosing to mock a specific one of these methods, we are making an <strong>assumption about the underlying implementation</strong> of the method we’re testing (which was deliberately hidden in the previous snippets).</p>
<p>All in all, the test does correctly verify that the business logic inside <code>GetSolarTimesAsync</code> works as expected. However, let’s expand on some of the observations we’ve made in the process.</p>

   <p><!--<img align="left" src="../pics/motherboard-and-hands-320.jpg" alt="Motherboard and Hands" style="max-width:100%;height:auto; padding:15px;">-->I think Covid-19 has re-emphasized the value of self-reliance
      to many of us.  During this pandemic, we have been through
      periods when we couldn't simply pick up a phone and call someone 
      to come to our home to make repairs.  We may also have been 
      unable to go to a local shop to get help.  Since so much of our 
      personal business must now be conducted on line, finding inexpensive 
      computers and making basic repairs to our own computers 
      are becoming important life skills.  Without them, we may be unable 
      to stay connected to the world, to attend school, to work, or even to 
      buy food without risking exposure to a potentially deadly disease.</p>

   <p>Fortunately, repairing a computer or buying a cheap used one is not as 
      difficult as many people seem to believe.  All that is needed is the 
      will to learn to do these things in a hands-on way.  Individuals must 
      be willing to take the risks associated with trying to repair 
      their own computers or buying used computers on line.  For most people, 
      I think this is the stumbling block that they never overcome.  
      What separates the people who can do these things from those who 
      cannot is not intelligence.  It is nothing more than need and 
      interest sufficient to get them past the stumbling block.  
      If you are willing to learn, you will win the battle for 
      computer self-reliance.  I will not tell you that you will not be 
      frustrated at times.  I will only say that, if you keep trying, you 
      will learn these skills.</p>

   <p>In this article, I will outline the knowledge and skills that are 
      necessary to solve most basic computer repair problems.  But first, I 
      will explain one simple step that you can take right now to have a 
      working computer in your home at all times.</p>

   <p>Have a working backup computer in your home to use in the event of 
      the death or loss of your primary 
      computer.  A backup computer need not be expensive.  In fact, you can 
      buy a useful, used computer on Ebay for around $50.  The role of this 
      computer is only to get you on line to do research or to buy parts or 
      other necessities until you can get your primary computer working 
      again, or until you can buy another computer.  A rather 
      <a href="https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/surf-internet.html">old computer</a> is capable of meeting 
      these needs.  Some of you may want to use a cellphone for this, and 
      that will work if your cellphone service includes a data plan.  However, 
      for reasons that will become clear later, a fully-functioning computer 
      would be better.  I have written several articles on 
      cheapskatesguide.org that explain how to buy a cheap computer on 
      line.  For suggestions about multiple approaches to getting a cheap 
      laptop, read <a href="https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/how-to-get-a-cheap-laptop.html">this 
      article</a>.  For recommendations regarding the best used laptops to 
      buy for less than $100 in the year 2020, read 
      <a href="https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/best-laptops-in-2020.html">this</a>.  To obtain a more 
      in-depth understanding of the art of buying a computer that meets your
      needs, go to the <a href="https://cheapskatesguide.org/helper/core-page.html">Core 
      Articles</a> page and read the articles there in chronological order.</p>

   <p>Now, let me talk about what you need to know to make basic computer 
      repairs.  If you take good care of your computer, the only computer 
      repair that you are likely to need that is not basic is the 
      replacement of your motherboard.  So, if your computer is completely 
      dead or stops booting at the BIOS screen (both symptoms of a bad 
      motherboard), it is most likely time to buy another computer.  If any 
      life at all remains in your computer--if you hear beep codes (beeping 
      sounds when you turn on your computer), see a repeating 
      pattern of flashing 
      lights, or see an error message on the monitor--you may be looking at 
      a computer that you can repair with basic skills.  Below, are the 
      skills that everyone can learn and then use to make basic computer 
      repairs.  Everyone should be able to:</p>
   <br>

   <div>
   <center><h2>Basic Computer Repair Skills Everyone should have</h2></center>
   <ul>
      <li>Diagnose basic computer problems</li>
      <li>Identify compatible parts for a computer</li>
      <li>Research repair methods on line</li>
      <li>Make basic changes to a computer's BIOS settings</li>
      <li>Create a bootable Linux USB drive</li>
      <li>Re-install software</li>
      <li>Replace a hard drive or solid state drive</li>
   </ul>
   </div>
   <p>When you think about it, that is a rather short list.  I think that a
      simple lack 
      of desire is the only thing that prevents most people from obtaining 
      these skills.  In this article, I will not teach you these skills.  I 
      will tell you what you need to know and a little about how to find 
      that knowledge.  I will tell you how to develop the skills.  And, in 
      some cases, I will outline basic repair procedures and tell you how 
      to fill in the details yourself.</p>
   <h2>Diagnosing Basic Computer Problems</h2>
   <p>Most symptoms of computer problems are pretty obvious.  Your keyboard 
      stops working.  A USB connector stops working.  Your computer's monitor 
      doesn't light up.  A message appears on your monitor saying that no 
      operating system was found.  Your computer's sound stops working.  
      The question is not whether a problem exists but whether it is 
      a software problem or a hardware problem.</p><p>The easiest way to rule out a hardware problem is to boot your 
      computer from a reliable, bootable Linux USB flash drive.  If the 
      problem does not go away, then you most likely have a hardware 
      problem.  One obvious exception is that the problem will go away if 
      your hard drive is bad.  I recommend creating a bootable Linux Mint 
      USB flash drive, making sure it works with every piece of hardware on 
      your computer, and setting it aside for when you need it.  Another
      benefit of having a Linux USB flash drive is that if your hard
      drive dies, you will still be able to use your computer to get online.</p>

   <p>If the problem is caused by software, an online search will give you 
      possible sources and procedures to follow to narrow down the problem 
      to one source.  If an error message appears, use an online search 
      engine to search for that exact error message with quotes around it.  
      If you have no error message, you may have more difficulty finding 
      information about the exact source of your problem.  This process can 
      sometimes take several hours, but you are likely to eventually find 
      hints that will lead you to solutions for most computer software 
      problems, especially if the software is common.</p><h2>Identifying Compatible Parts for Your Computer</h2>
   <p>On a modern laptop computer, the battery and hard drive are the only 
      parts that are likely to fail that you can replace with basic 
      skills.  In over 30 years of owning computers, I have never had a 
      single stick of RAM fail.  I have had RAM sticks that have become 
      unseated from their connectors and needed to be pushed back into 
      place.  Beep codes or flashing lights can give you a hint that RAM 
      has become unseated.  Search on line for "computer beep codes" to find 
      the specific beep codes for your computer.</p> 

   <p>You generally only need to know three things to locate a 
      hard drive or Solid State Drive (SSD) that is compatible with your 
      computer: the hard drive's width, its thickness, and the type of 
      connector to which it connects.  You need to buy a replacement hard 
      drive that will physically fit into the space in your computer, and  
      the connector of the hard drive must connect to the connector on your 
      computer's motherboard.  These days, all spinning hard drives are 
      either 2.5 or 3.5 inches wide with SATA connectors.  Most 
      regular-sized desktop computers have 3.5 inch hard drives, but a 
      laptop will never have a 3.5 inch hard drive.  Laptops have either 2.5 
      inch spinning hard drives or some kind of SSD.  If your computer has 
      an SSD, you will have to open up your computer and look at the SSD's
      connector.  Unfortunately, these days, there are a small number of 
      solid state drive connector types that have the same physical 
      connections but are different electrically.  In my opinion, this was 
      a very poor design decision.  Luckily, these SSD's are the only 
      example in the computer industry of which I am aware of this being 
      allowed to occur.  Find a picture of your SSD's connector online and see 
      what type of connector the online source says it is.  Wikipedia is 
      a good place to look for this type of information.  Once you have 
      identified the type of connector on your SSD, see what Wikipedia says 
      about its electrical arrangement.  Do not try to use an SSD with a 
      different type of electrical arrangement, because this is likely to 
      damage the replacement SSD and your computer.</p>
   <h2>Researching Computer Repair Methods on Line</h2>
   <p>When your computer develops a problem, you can almost always find a 
      procedure on line for solving it.  First, you need to know <i>what</i> to 
      do to repair a generic computer with the specific problem you are 
      seeing.  You can read on line about <i>what</i> to do to repair the 
      problem on a generic Windows, Mac, or Linux computer.  Then, if the 
      problem is a hardware problem, you need to know <i>how</i> to 
      physically accomplish the repair of your specific model of computer.  
      A Youtube video can be beneficial for this.  An example of 
      what I mean by "<i>how</i> to physically repair" is the following.  When 
      you open the back of your laptop, what screws do you have to unscrew 
      to release the hard drive?  Do you pull the hard drive straight out 
      perpendicularly from the back of the laptop?  Or, do you slide it 
      parallel to the back of the laptop …</p></div></div>

                    <div>
                 <p>Technical Tuesdays: Markdig, error-free programming, and coding for fun.</p>
<p>Code for this can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/DanielBMarkham/LeanPubX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/DanielBMarkham/LeanPubX</a></p>
<p>Couple of things to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>There's nothing here to test, ie, if I wanted to add tests they would all be acceptance tests, not system tests. That's good. That's what we want.</li>
<li>The application itself is acting like a function that the OS calls. That's also what we want. It enables supercompilers (see Info-Ops 2)</li>
</ul>            </div>
                    </div>

</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>Each feed is <a href="https://validator.w3.org/feed/check.cgi?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhnrss.org%2Fnewest">valid RSS</a> served over <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=hnrss.org">HTTPS</a>.</p>
<h3 id="firehose-feeds">Firehose Feeds</h3>
<p>The “firehose” feeds contain all new posts and comments as they appear on Hacker News:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest
https://hnrss.org/newcomments
</pre>
<p>For just the posts that have appeared on the front page:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/frontpage
</pre>
<p>If the firehose feeds are a bit too noisy for you, <a href="#activity-parameters">read below</a> on filtering them with the <code>points</code> and/or <code>comments</code> parameters.</p>
<h3 id="search-feeds">Search Feeds</h3>
<p>You can get a feed of new posts and/or comments containing keywords by using the <code>q=KEYWORD</code> parameter. For example:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?q=Django
https://hnrss.org/newcomments?q=WordPress
</pre>
<p>If you want a single search feed but multiple keywords, separate the keywords with " OR ":</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?q=git+OR+linux
</pre>
<h3 id="reply-feeds">Reply Feeds <sup>new</sup></h3>
<p>Keep an eye on replies to your comments:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/replies?id=jerf
</pre>
<p>Use a comment ID to follow replies to a particular comment:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/replies?id=17752464
</pre>
<h3 id="self-post-feeds">Self Post Feeds</h3>
<p>Ask HN, Show HN, and polls are available:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/ask
https://hnrss.org/show
https://hnrss.org/polls
</pre>
<h3 id="job-feeds">Job Feeds</h3>
<p>Job opportunities from YC funded startups:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/jobs
</pre>
<p>Top level comments in threads created by the whoishiring bot:</p>
<pre># Comments from "Who is hiring?" threads
https://hnrss.org/whoishiring/jobs

# Comments from "Who wants to be hired?" threads
https://hnrss.org/whoishiring/hired

# Comments from "Freelancer? Seeking freelancer?" threads
https://hnrss.org/whoishiring/freelance

# All of the above
https://hnrss.org/whoishiring
</pre>
<p><span>new</span> If you’re interested in something in particular, you can apply a <code>q=KEYWORD</code> parameter to only return relevant comments. For example, filter the top-level “Who is hiring?” comments to only those containing “React Native”:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/whoishiring/jobs?q=React+Native
</pre>
<h3 id="user-feeds">User Feeds</h3>
<p>If you don’t want to miss a post or comment by a given user, you can subscribe to that user’s feed:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/submitted?id=USERNAME # posts
https://hnrss.org/threads?id=USERNAME   # comments
https://hnrss.org/user?id=USERNAME      # everything
</pre>
<h3 id="thread-feeds">Thread Feeds</h3>
<p>A feed of new comments on a particular post can be found at:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/item?id=THREAD_ID
</pre>
<p>With <code>THREAD_ID</code> the numerical ID found in the URL when viewing the comments page.</p>
<h3 id="feed-options">Feed Options</h3>
<p>You can modify any feed’s output using URL parameters. Multiple parameters can be applied at the same time by joining them with an ampersand.</p>
<h4 id="activity-parameters">Activity Parameters</h4>
<p>You can apply a <code>points=N</code> or <code>comments=N</code> parameter to any feed to filter the results so only entries with more than N points or comments are shown:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?points=100
https://hnrss.org/ask?comments=25
</pre>
<p>You can also combine both parameters:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/show?points=100&amp;comments=25
</pre>
<p>Unfortunately, <code>/newcomments</code> <a href="https://github.com/algolia/hn-search/issues/55#issuecomment-73599729">does not work</a> with a <code>points=N</code> parameter.</p>
<h4 id="search-parameter">Search Parameter</h4>
<p>By default, searches on posts only look at titles. If you want to search against the submitted URLs themselves, use the <code>search_attrs</code> parameter.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<pre># Search for posts with "WordPress" in the title only
https://hnrss.org/newest?q=WordPress

# Search for posts with 'WordPress' in the URL only
https://hnrss.org/newest?q=WordPress&amp;search_attrs=url

# Search for posts with 'WordPress' in the title or URL
https://hnrss.org/newest?q=WordPress&amp;search_attrs=title,url

# Don't restrict search attributes at all. This searches for posts
# containing 'WordPress' in all attributes indexed by Algolia. This was
# the behavior of searches prior to June 3, 2015
https://hnrss.org/newest?q=WordPress&amp;search_attrs=default
</pre>
<h4 id="link-parameter">Link Parameter</h4>
<p>By default, the RSS <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element points to the submitted article’s URL. The <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element can be changed to point to the Hacker News comment page by appending <code>link=comments</code> to the end of the URL. For example:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?link=comments</pre>
<h4 id="description-parameter">Description Parameter</h4>
<p>You can disable the <code>&lt;description&gt;</code> element entirely by passing the <code>description=0</code> parameter:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?description=0</pre>
<h4 id="count-parameter">Count Parameter</h4>
<p>By default, feeds return 20 RSS items. This can be increased via the <code>count=N</code> parameter:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?count=50</pre>
<p>There is a hardcoded limit of 100 entries, so keep that in mind.</p>
<h4 id="feed-formats">Feed Formats <sup>new</sup></h4>
<p>By default, feeds come back as RSS. But if you add “.atom” or “.jsonfeed” to any endpoint you’ll receive the contents in <a href="https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/atom.html">Atom</a> or <a href="https://jsonfeed.org/">JSON Feed</a>, respectively.</p>
<pre># The front page as Atom
https://hnrss.org/frontpage.atom

# "Ask HN" with 10 or more comments as JSON Feed
https://hnrss.org/ask.jsonfeed?comments=10
</pre>
<p>Note: These formats are a lot less battle-tested than the RSS format. If you see any wonkiness or they don’t play nicely with your feed reader, please <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss/issues/new">open an issue</a> with as much information as possible. Thanks!</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
<h2 id="credits">Credits</h2>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.algolia.com/">Algolia</a> for providing their <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/api">REST API</a>. Without it, hnrss.org simply would not exist.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/jaredandrews">Jared Andrews</a> for the <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss/pull/23">PR</a> that created the /whoishiring/ endpoints.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/grantjenks">Grant Jenks</a> for the idea of adding the Article URL and Points to the description.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/cagrimmett">Chuck Grimmett</a> for being a sounding board when it comes to adding new features to hnrss.org as well as suggesting the /jobs endpoint.</p>
<p>And many, many thanks to all those who have donated in support of the project over the years. You all mean the world to me.</p>
<h2 id="colophon">Colophon</h2>
<p>hnrss.org is served by nginx on DigitalOcean. HTTPS is provided by Let’s Encrypt. DNS is provided by Namecheap.</p>
<p>As of September 2018, the feeds are generated using the <a href="https://gin-gonic.github.io/gin/">Gin</a> web framework. From May 2014 to August 2018, the feeds were generated using the <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> web framework.</p>
<h2 id="repositories">Repositories</h2>
<p>A brief primer on the various repositories that make up hnrss.org:</p>
<p>When hnrss.org was created in May 2014, code and documentation lived inside the <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss">edavis/hnrss</a> repository.</p>
<p>In April 2017, the documentation was revamped, migrated into Hugo, and was given its own repository at <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss-docs">edavis/hnrss-docs</a>. The built assets were copied into the <code>docs/</code> folder on <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss">edavis/hnrss</a> and published at <a href="https://edavis.github.io/hnrss/">https://edavis.github.io/hnrss/</a>.</p>
<p>In August/September 2018, hnrss.org underwent a rewrite from Flask to Gin. This new code lives at <a href="https://github.com/edavis/go-hnrss">edavis/go-hnrss</a>.</p>
<p>So, as of September 2018, that’s the state of play. The documentation source lives at <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss-docs">edavis/hnrss-docs</a>. The Gin source that powers hnrss.org lives at <a href="https://github.com/edavis/go-hnrss">edavis/go-hnrss</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss">edavis/hnrss</a> contains the Flask code that powered the site from May 2014 to August 2018 as well as the <code>docs/</code> folder that contains the built HTML copied from <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss-docs">edavis/hnrss-docs</a>.</p>
<p>At some point I’d like to simplify all of this and run everything out of one repository, but it’ll do for now.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>AWS SDK maintains and publishes SDK for over 110+ services with simultaneous and multiple updates on all SDKs each day. They have achieved what interestingly all big companies strive for, launching new APIs seamlessly and effortlessly. During AWS’s flagship entertainment packed conference <strong>“Re</strong><strong>:Invent</strong><strong>,</strong> the SDKs are updated with new APIs that were just announced in less than 2 hours for the world to use.</p><p>To interact with any of AWS services you need to use a AWS SDK in either python, JAVA or any other language your software is in.</p><p>I have been an engineer in the PHP SDK for AWS which is open-sourced on Github and anyone can look at the code published by the AWS teams. AWS manages over 8 SDKs including SDK for <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java">JAVA</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby">ruby</a>, <a href="https://github.com/boto/boto3">python</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js">javascript</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php">PHP</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go">go</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp">C++</a> and few other languages.</p><p>Generally, it requires a significant number of engineers to manage just one SDK. To make sure all APIs and features are available across all SDKs is a big feat. In this post, we are going to talk about how to scale the SDK and how AWS is able to achieve perfect synchronicity across all SDKs without sloshing the SDKs team with manually updating each SDK.</p><h2>How does the AWS SDK works?</h2><p>All of the SDKs have two parts one is the core and another one has all the service-specific code. The core of the SDK handles various features such as “Signing each request using AWS’s Sigv4 protocol”, security features, SSL handling, multi-threading, asynchronous requests, waiters, paginators, and a ton more features.</p><p>The other part of each SDK is based on “model” files specific to each service. All model files are exactly similar across each SDK.</p><p>The difference is very evident in AWS’s python SDK which is divided into two different repositories “boto” and “botocore”.</p><p>All the model files are built on <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenApi</a> protocol to some extent and are compatible with <a href="https://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> API Protocols.</p><p>Here is a JSON definition for DynamoDB in AWS PHP SDK with name “<a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/blob/master/src/data/dynamodb/2012-08-10/api-2.json">api-2.json</a>” and &nbsp;the exact same file also exists in Boto SDK as well with name “<a href="https://github.com/boto/botocore/blob/develop/botocore/data/dynamodb/2012-08-10/service-2.json">service-2.json</a>“</p><p>At AWS each service will release these JSON model files which specify all information related to each API &amp; service. Each SDK handles these files a bit differently as compared to other SDKs. PHP SDK loads these JSON files dynamically in each client to allow various APIs while JAVA SDK will pre-build each of these methods into concrete classes.</p><p>Each AWS team maintains and releases these service-specific model file, which are then consumed by each SDK team in the way they would like.</p><h2>Show Me The Code!</h2><p>I am sure these look like magic to you like it looked to me when I first saw it. So let’s dig into the code. We will look at PHP SDK example as that is team I was part of for over a year and know in and out of the SDK.</p><p>We will look at the AWS Lambda’s invoke method.</p><pre><code>"Invoke":{
      "name":"Invoke",
      "http":{
        "method":"POST",
        "requestUri":"/2015-03-31/functions/{FunctionName}/invocations"
      },
      "input":{"shape":"InvocationRequest"},
      "output":{"shape":"InvocationResponse"},
      "errors":[
        {"shape":"ServiceException"},
        {"shape":"ResourceNotFoundException"},
        {"shape":"InvalidRequestContentException"},
        {"shape":"RequestTooLargeException"},
        {"shape":"UnsupportedMediaTypeException"},
        {"shape":"TooManyRequestsException"},
        {"shape":"InvalidParameterValueException"},
        {"shape":"EC2UnexpectedException"},
        {"shape":"SubnetIPAddressLimitReachedException"},
        {"shape":"ENILimitReachedException"},
        {"shape":"EC2ThrottledException"},
        {"shape":"EC2AccessDeniedException"},
        {"shape":"InvalidSubnetIDException"},
        {"shape":"InvalidSecurityGroupIDException"},
        {"shape":"InvalidZipFileException"},
        {"shape":"KMSDisabledException"},
        {"shape":"KMSInvalidStateException"},
        {"shape":"KMSAccessDeniedException"},
        {"shape":"KMSNotFoundException"},
        {"shape":"InvalidRuntimeException"}
      ]
    }</code></pre><p>The above API is expecting an “InvocationRequest” object and returns a “InvocationResponse” object.</p><p>This is how the “InvocationRequest” is defined.</p><pre><code>"InvocationRequest":{
      "type":"structure",
      "required":["FunctionName"],
      "members":{
        "FunctionName":{
          "shape":"NamespacedFunctionName",
          "location":"uri",
          "locationName":"FunctionName"
        },
        "InvocationType":{
          "shape":"InvocationType",
          "location":"header",
          "locationName":"X-Amz-Invocation-Type"
        },
        "LogType":{
          "shape":"LogType",
          "location":"header",
          "locationName":"X-Amz-Log-Type"
        },
        "ClientContext":{
          "shape":"String",
          "location":"header",
          "locationName":"X-Amz-Client-Context"
        },
        "Payload":{"shape":"Blob"},
        "Qualifier":{
          "shape":"Qualifier",
          "location":"querystring",
          "locationName":"Qualifier"
        }
      },
      "payload":"Payload"
    }</code></pre><p>This is the response object.</p><pre><code> "InvocationResponse":{
      "type":"structure",
      "members":{
        "StatusCode":{
          "shape":"Integer",
          "location":"statusCode"
        },
        "FunctionError":{
          "shape":"String",
          "location":"header",
          "locationName":"X-Amz-Function-Error"
        },
        "LogResult":{
          "shape":"String",
          "location":"header",
          "locationName":"X-Amz-Log-Result"
        },
        "Payload":{"shape":"Blob"},
        "ExecutedVersion":{
          "shape":"Version",
          "location":"header",
          "locationName":"X-Amz-Executed-Version"
        }
      },
      "payload":"Payload"
    },</code></pre><p>The PHP SDK auto-generates code for each of these request and response object and here how the code would look:</p><pre><code>$result = $client-&gt;invoke(array(
    // FunctionName is required
    'FunctionName' =&gt; 'string',
    'InvocationType' =&gt; 'string',
    'LogType' =&gt; 'string',
    'ClientContext' =&gt; 'string',
    'Payload' =&gt; 'mixed type: string|resource|\Guzzle\Http\EntityBodyInterface',
    'Qualifier' =&gt; 'string',
));</code></pre><p>Even the docs are automatically generated from the model files.</p><p>So the various SDK team will not need to write any code “manually” at all for any of these service updates. The service teams,( in this case, AWS Lambda) just needs to make sure that the model file they are creating is error free. The SDK will be able to auto-generate any updates to existing clients as well as auto-generating code for new APIs and services.</p><p>The best part of the SDK team is that is is completely open-sources and is directly integrated into various AWS services.</p><p>API Gateway allows you to deploy Swagger (also knows as OpenAPI Standards) models and then use the APIs to directly generate SDKs with all the features that are already inbuilt into the AWS SDKs.</p><p>I hope this will prove helpful in designing your SDKs for your services. In any SDK the focus should be on creating a model file that is compliant with “OpenApi” standards. By having a standard model for APIs, it will get super easy and fast to launch various SDKs in various languages with very little development time.</p><div><div><div><p><a href="https://dailyjag.com/profile/admin/" rel="author"> <img alt="" src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/33563973b6f338002e574f30a3f94788?s=80&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/33563973b6f338002e574f30a3f94788?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" height="80" width="80"> </a></p><div> <p><span>  </span> <span> <span>Member since</span> <time datetime="2019-02-25 10:02"> August 16, 2011 </time> </span></p></div></div><p><span>I am an android developer, hacker, web developer, professional blogger and a complete tech freak.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>February 2015</h3><p>I was working for a startup based in Jerusalem called Curiyo. Back then I had a nice routine: I wake up around 6 am, go to the gym with my buddy, come back to my room to take a shower, eat a bowl of salad and then leave for work. I get to work around 9 am, leave around 5 to meet friends, hang out, or do whatever activity I was planning for that evening.</p><p>In September of the same year, I went on my first trip abroad. I went with my best friend from high school on a 2-week trip to Italy. And as they say, I caught the travel bug. After that trip, all I could think about was planning the next ones and when I could fly again. And since then, I started traveling literally every month.</p><p>One day, I found a blog post about digital nomads and remote work. "This is it, this is what I want!", I said to myself, and the race began to figure out how I could make that happen. A couple of months later, I landed my first remote job with Toptal and signed up for a 3-month trip around southeast Asia (SEA). And in September 2016 -a year after my first trip- I was in Thailand working remotely, enjoying the beach, drinking fresh coconut water, and calling myself a digital nomad.</p><p>"Work hard, play harder": that is the digital nomad slogan. Each day’s schedule looked different from the day before, depending on what I felt like doing or what the group I’m with is planning. In other words, it’s impossible to have a fixed routine, you have to be flexible and dynamic. Otherwise, you will either have to choose between FOMO or doing a shitty job at your work so you don’t miss whatever fun others are having.</p><h3>February 2017</h3><p>After my 3-month trip to SEA, it was time to go back to Jerusalem to see my family and plan the next move. I wasn’t excited to go back, I grew up in Jerusalem and till that point, it’s where I spent all my life. It was so hard and boring after what I’ve experienced, I just came back after spending 3 months in heaven.</p><p>Suddenly there were no more beaches, no more parties, or random strangers to hang out with. There was a lot of free time thatI had no idea what to do with. All I was doing every day was leaving my parents’ house, go to the university campus where I spent five years getting my computer engineering degree, and work till it’s so hard to keep my eyes open.</p><p>I filled all the free time I had with work. I created an outsource web development company with a friend and worked 14h a day 7 days a week, I became a workaholic. I was hoping that by creating a successful business I will have the means to escape my city and move elsewhere to go back to the heavenly life I had for a short period.</p><p>After 3 months of long days and restless nights mishmash, I realized that wasn’t what I wanted. Of course, I still wanted to build my own business, but I didn’t like the path I was taking. And one day I found myself writing this:</p><p>I woke up late, as usual, tried to open my exhausted eyelids. I had skipped the usual question “What’s the plan for today?” and left my bed. It has been almost 3 months since the last time I answered that question, after the first week of going back to Jerusalem it was the same day repeating itself over and over again. Wake up, go to the university campus, meet the same people, and work for 12-14 hours.</p><p>Everything was the same that day except one thing, one thought. When suddenly I found myself shouting out loud to myself “Oh shit, I’m not happy, FUCK!” after a voice inside my head asked: “Are you happy?”. The answer was obviously no. I just realized I was on auto-pilot and forgot to ask myself such a trivial question. “If you are not happy, what is the point?” I kept asking myself for the rest of the day.</p><p>Work was just my way to escape reality and fill my free time. All that made me wonder: do I have to bury myself in work and live miserably now so that my future self can be happy?&nbsp;</p><p>Probably many of you will say “yes”, or maybe you will hesitate a bit before saying “no”. But that doesn’t change the fact that it is actually what we all do somehow. All of us work hard today hoping that tomorrow, next week, next month, or a year from now we will be happy, satisfied, and fulfilled.</p><p>This led me to another question that has changed everything: <strong>what is the point of chasing big dreams and goals if I'm not enjoying the way to get there?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I didn’t have a clear answer to this question so, in a way or another, my answer was <strong>procrastination</strong>. On one side, I wanted to build a business and create great things. On the other side, I didn’t want to work (hard) on anything as long as I don’t know how to be happy while doing it!</p><h3>June 2017</h3><p>After several months and hustling paperwork, I moved to Germany, and my digital nomad life was on again. Since then, I’ve spent the last 3+ years, traveling around the world, exploring, having fun, and creating memories. I was living the dream that many people dream of. A was living a life with no routine whatsoever, wake up whenever I want, work whenever I want, and tomorrow is always an unplanned adventure.</p><p>You can say everything was perfect, but still, the old dream was bugging me, I want to build and create a successful business, my own business. I never liked the idea of working for someone and trading my time for money. And between fun and procrastination, I was trying to build stuff and bootstrap ideas, but things were always falling between the cracks. With a lifestyle like that, it’s really hard to say no to the sunny beach outside and go work 10 hours on a side project. So as a result, procrastination became my new lifestyle.</p><h3>March 2020</h3><p>I left Mexico for a 2-week trip to San Francisco, I had a lot of traveling planned for this year. Things would have stayed on the same path as before for at least another couple of years if it wasn’t for COVID-19.<br></p><p>Two weeks into the pandemic, I found myself without work and without anything else to do. No travel, no friends around, nothing. This time, I didn’t only have a lot of free time, but all my time became free time. History got a chance to repeat itself, and I had a decision to make. Do I want to re-live 2017 all over again? Do I want to keep myself busy with side projects and endless work?&nbsp;<br></p><p>The feeling from 3 years ago was still fresh in my memory that I didn’t want to fall into that trap again. That was an opportunity I had to take advantage of. I was living alone with no distraction of any kind, It was a chance to rediscover myself and what I really want.</p><p>My goal was to bootstrap a business while having a work life balance. I didn’t want to spend 14 hours on my laptop and feel like it was sucking the life out of me. I believed it was possible to bootstrap without falling into the workaholism swamp.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5f06d0eb03257a01af20a5e4_iZLNJNTTrlnhbqu6GYvnavIObyReSuyqU1-_DJxGfOeSpFmF8hzwy3AryXXXt0pxgt7dn0EkcqU2AAEDMG8i5AS7HAfEUP0GlsyIOdpqtN07TOSJopLFwNzxQ3HwUjMJw5YSN36s.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Earlier this year I was somewhere on the bottom left side. To shift toward the right I had to deal with my procrastination problem. Since nothing I’ve tried before worked for me, I decided to learn everything I can about the subject and challenge myself to write a book about it, this book! I’m trying to prove to myself (and others) that it’s possible to live in the middle, a place where you can be productive and happy.</p><p><strong>“A bird in the hand is worth t̶w̶o̶ ten in the bush”</strong></p><p>My best friend, who is running an online business with ~$300k ARR, is on the opposite side of the curve. He is the most dedicated hard working person I know, but he’s not happy. When I asked him about it, he said he doesn’t believe it’s possible to have that balance. For him, you can’t be productive (grow fast enough) and happy at the same time. His goal is to have a big stable business by age 40 so he can relax and enjoy life then.</p><p>I don’t want that, I don't want to build a business if my happiness is the price. I don't want to live on 30% happiness for the promise that my future self will be 100% in five or ten years. It's not only that 100% happiness is not realistic, but I also believe my future self will still be stuck on the same hamster wheel convincing himself that he needs another 5 years to get to the imaginary perfect happiness.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5f06d0edf9a94c0bc0e6cd9f_Ngrb7PW6OqzpCoN3VZ8zAT8vHN_BKz_ZRkF_1Ze-89S6gTlwS6qyz89AWZIy-r5M6aleCzSf5xq-qp0OG1qkgdq14HcQdSlY1F6TkBny8CtjNETh2sdP4f0dgcuKCAnqFIVf3wiu.gif" alt=""></p></figure><p>Workaholism will blind you, you no longer see the big picture, you have no time to think and re-think, and you work for the sake of the work itself. And without a proper system and regular stops where you pause to double-check where you are heading, the wheel will just spin faster and faster until it eventually spits you out and throws you against the wall.</p><p>I know, sometimes you have something you are so excited about and it doesn’t feel like work. But pure excitement doesn’t last forever. Eventually, you will have to work on other boring and less exciting parts of your project. And once that initial excitement fades away, you either quit or close your eyes and hit the gas pedal to become a workaholic zombie.</p><p>However, life is not easy and you can’t always accomplish things while relaxing and taking it easy. Sometimes you have no other option but to push so hard, for days, weeks, or even months. The problem starts when you have no idea when you are going to lift your foot off the gas pedal to look around and see where you are going and check if you should make a turn and change directions.</p><p>So let’s glue all pieces together. A Procrastinator has this <strong>Instant Gratification Monkey (1)</strong> who wants immediate rewards, to have fun, and enjoy the moment without giving a shit about the future. A workaholic has a <strong>Panic Monster (2)</strong> who wants to work so hard and sacrifice everything today so you can be happy tomorrow.</p><p>The answer to the question: “How do you chase big dreams and without depriving yourself happiness?” is the same answer to the question: “Where could your instant gratification monkey meet your panic monster?” You need both.The monkey is as important as the monster, we’ll see that in the chapter “The Productive Procrastinator”. While in other chapters, we try to find that meeting point, as the sole purpose of this book is not to help you just be a productive person but a <strong>happy</strong> productive person.</p><p>1,2:&nbsp;originally presented in Tim Urban's <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html">blog post</a></p><p>‍<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5ef900053c15adf3558a9fb8_1*Bx1xIfh3q-_hY0LzmbLePg.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>📕 This chapter is …</p></div></div>

                <div>
                    <p>Once you start working with international clients you'll run into many issues you will never experience when contracting for clients in the same country.</p><p>Language barriers, time zone differences or different cultures which could lead to different styles of communicating or different expectations to name just a few. </p><p>But the biggest one might be accepting payments. Cross-border payments are usually costly (both in fees and unfavorable exchange rates), take a long time to be processed and are sometimes even just hard to make as it's not a very common use case for most business owners. There's also different laws, taxes and payment methods.</p><p>The pandemic has made remote work a lot more common and many freelancers now have to deal with this new set of problems.</p><p>I have been working remotely since 2016 and worked for clients all over the world, used dozens of payment methods and dealt with both major and smaller currencies and want to share what I've learned over this period in terms of accepting payments.</p><p>Before we start, it's important to know there's no single best option as each situation is different. Payment frequency, invoice size, where each party is incorporated and many other variables might play a role in which payment method is best for your situation.</p><p>That being said, in every situation we want the same things. Make it easy for the client to pay you, make it easy for yourself to receive the money and do both of these in a timely and inexpensive way.</p><h2 id="international-bank-transfers">International Bank Transfers</h2><p>By far the most common payment method for domestic payments is to use a wire transfer. This works well for domestic payments but is very expensive and slow for cross-border payments.</p><p>Most banks charge a flat fee for processing international transfers but will also convert the money from the client's currency to yours at an exchange rate that is more expensive for you than the actual current exchange rate. My post about <a href="https://blog.jurn.io/international-payments-freelancers/">international transfers</a> explains the hidden costs of these payments more in-depth.</p><p>So before you ask your clients to transfer the money to your account, check with your bank what fees and exchange rates they use for the transfer. Some banks also give you the option to open a foreign currency account, if you regularly take payments in the same currency this could save you a lot in currency exchange fees.</p><h3 id="transferwise">TransferWise</h3><p>One of the best alternatives I found is to use <a href="https://transferwise.com/invite/u/joernv2">TransferWise</a>. TransferWise allows you to hold and accept multiple currencies and have local bank details in many different countries. You can then transfer the money you received at the mid-market exchange rate into your own currency and pay it out to your own bank account with low fixed fees.</p><p>Your client can thus transfer the payment to a local bank account like they would normally do for domestic payments. You can exchange this at a much better rate than banks would offer you and withdraw it to your own bank account for a low and transparent fixed fee.</p><p>This method offers the advantages of bank transfers without the downsides and has in my experience been both the cheapest and best way to accept payments for most situations.</p><p>If you are your client are in a country that is not supported by TransferWise you can also use <a href="https://www.payoneer.com/">Payoneer</a> which works in a very similar way and supports more countries around the world, albeit with higher fees than TW offers.</p><h2 id="credit-cards">Credit Cards</h2><p>Another very common payment method and one that is incredibly easy to pay with for your clients, credit cards.</p><p>Using online payment processors like Stripe, you can easily create an invoice along with a payment link where you client can pay using their credit card. The fees are pretty high, 3.4%+$0.50 per successful card charge and an additional 2% fee is applied if currency conversion is required so you have to be willing to accept high fees for speed and convenience.</p><p>Accepting credit cards is usually only worth it if you sent lots of small invoices and want a convenient way for you clients to pay these. </p><h2 id="paypal">PayPal</h2><p>PayPal was one of the pioneers in the payments industry but I'd strongly recommend using another option whenever possible. </p><p>Accepting payments via PayPal is easy. You can quickly generate a payment link for the client to sent with your invoice and you can easily create a PayPal account, no matter what country you are located in.</p><p>Unfortunately, their fees are very high (both the fixed fees and the currency conversion cost) and they are known for arbitrarily holding funds without good reason. Which they are allowed to do under their own ToC for up to 6 months(!).</p><p>If some of the better payment methods aren't available to you, PayPal might be the best option you have available but for most people it's probably better to steer clear of them. Even banks usually offer a better exchange rate than PayPal does.</p><h2 id="checks">Checks</h2><p>Most people outside of the US probably have never used a check to receive or make a payment so this could be quite a shock when your US client offers you to pay you using one.</p><p>My advice is to avoid these at all costs and talk to your client about setting up an alternative payment method. </p><p>Most non-US banks do not even have the option to cash these out and if they do it's very expensive. Checks, especially international ones, take a long time to arrive after they are mailed to you, they might get lost in the mail or sent to the wrong address, you (likely) need to mail these to your bank once you receive the check to cash it out and you still have to pay the unfavorable exchange rate.</p><p>In my personal experience, it will take around 4-6 weeks in total before the money from the client arrives in your account and you'll pay a very high fee for it.</p><p>Luckily these are becoming less common and I've head the good fortune of not having to deal with one of these for 2 years already.</p><h2 id="escrow">Escrow</h2><p>Escrow transfers are usually only worth it for selling big-ticket items where you need to transfer digital assets such as a domain. The fees are very high but it removes a lot of the risk when you work with a client that you haven't built up any trust with. </p><p>You should view Escrow as taking out an insurance, you accept a higher fee for less risk.</p><h2 id="cryptocurrency">Cryptocurrency</h2><p>Last time I wrote an article about cross-border payments <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22854120">some people commented</a> that crypto was the obvious solution here as there is no currency conversion and the transfer fees are very low. </p><p>I'd figure it's best to address this head-on this time; Although I love the concept of cryptocurrency, it's just not practical to use it for most freelancers. </p><p>Unless you work for a very high-tech startup, it's extremely unlikely someone in the company knows how to use one of these cryptocurrencies or will get permission to buy crypto and transfer it.</p><p>They are also extremely volatile, even though the transfer fees or currency exchange fees of conventional payment methods will cost you more, I have also never lost 10% of my company's liquid assets in a few minutes.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>As remote freelancers we are spoiled for choice nowadays and we have many different options to use depending on what situation we find ourselves in.</p><p>I have used every single option I discussed in the article and they all have their own pros and cons. There is no "one size fits all" solution here and you'll need to do some research to see what works best for the type of business that you run.</p><p>I've found that for my situation I most often end up using TransferWise to accept payment, convert the currency and deposit it to the bank account where my company is incorporated. </p><p>Whether this works best for you is something you will need to research for yourself based on your company and location.</p>

<p>Hello! 👋 My name is Jen and I’m the founder, engineer, designer and customer support at <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/">Lunch Money</a>, a personal finance and budgeting web app.</p>

<p>In short, I am a company of one. I answer the customer support emails and I code and deploy new features. I also manage the <a href="https://developers.lunchmoney.app/" target="_blank">API docs</a> and <a href="https://support.lunchmoney.app/" target="_blank">knowledge base</a>, poke around the logs when there are issues, write the <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/sample_newsletter" target="_blank">bi-monthly newsletters</a> and I designed the logo!</p>

<p>As the company scales, so too must all aspects of my work which I break down into 4 parts: customer support, engineering, product and marketing.</p>

<p><strong>Finding opportunities for process optimization is honestly one of the more fun parts of running a business</strong>. I greatly attribute these to how I’ve been able to stay both solo &amp; sane up until now, currently with 600+ users and $45,000 ARR. In this post, I’m excited to share some of my most successful strategies along with anecdotes from my experience working on Lunch Money.</p>



<p>In the last 14 days, here’s what I got done across all departments:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Product:</strong> Launched an internal beta testers program and two sets of new features to test</li>
<li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Wrapped up a 2-week long refactor of some core components on the client-side</li>
<li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Launched a major feature: advanced transaction filters</li>
<li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Closed 13 tickets related to feature improvements and bug fixes</li>
<li><strong>Marketing:</strong> Sent out a newsletter outlining the latest new features</li>
<li><strong>Marketing:</strong> This blog post</li>
<li><strong>Marketing:</strong> Added new pages to the marketing site (<a href="https://lunchmoney.app/features/rules">Rules</a> and <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/features/collaboration">Collaboration</a>) and updated the icons in <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/features">Features</a></li>
<li><strong>Support:</strong> Received 239 inbound support tickets and sent out 358 emails</li>
</ul>

<p>What makes all this work bearable for me is the fact that there is so much variety (which, of course, is the spice of life!). I love being able to switch between tasks to keep the job interesting and my mind refreshed while still being productive overall.</p>

<p><em>Case in point: I just finished a major refactor and pushed out 2 major features to beta, so writing this blog post right now feels like a vacation for my brain.</em></p>

<p>To state the obvious, I enjoy being hyper-efficient (without burning myself out, of course). Even though I am a single person, I can still automate, optimize and parallelize processes.</p>



<h2 id="implement-safeguards">Implement safeguards</h2>

<p><i>Ah, the blissful beginnings of Lunch Money when I’d push code directly to production several times a day.</i></p>

<p>At 500+ users now, those days are long gone and I’ve since needed to adopt the more boring but responsible approach of implementing safeguards to prevent shipping faulty code.</p>

<p>For one, <b>I’ve been thoroughly reviewing my own code before every change</b>. Every major feature, improvement and bug fix lives in a feature branch that I still, by habit from the corporate days, prepend with <code>jen/</code>. After verifying everything works great locally, I make sure to take a break first, whether that’s working on a completely unrelated task, going for a meal or going to bed. The point of this is to ensure that I’m code reviewing with a clear head.</p>

<p>While adhering to these standards of code reviewing myself may add extra time to my overall process, it potentially saves hours of bug-fixing, answering related support tickets and self-loathing (I’m half-kidding here) down the line if I accidentally ship bad code.</p>

<center><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New phase of Lunch Money– no more pushing major features straight to production 🤯😂 <a href="https://t.co/RYsz7BnU3L">https://t.co/RYsz7BnU3L</a></p>— Jen (@lunchbag) <a href="https://twitter.com/lunchbag/status/1256987437600927744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 3, 2020</a></blockquote> </center>

<p><b>I also recently implemented an internal beta-testing program open to Lunch Money subscribers.</b> With more users accessing my app on a regular basis, the stakes are higher to ship a version that’s as bug-free as possible.</p>

<p>As an engineering team of one, it’s nearly impossible to always get it right the first time, despite having tests (what if I missed an edge case?) or testing locally extensively (how I think my users will use a feature is not always so).</p>

<p>The beta-testing program has provided some additional benefits. It’s nice to have a cohort of users with whom I can have a more candid conversation about Lunch Money and it’s also a great way to show users that their feedback is valued!</p>

<h2 id="automate-later-than-you-need-to">Automate later than you need to</h2>

<p>While automating tasks can save a lot of time in the long-term, it doesn’t always make sense to automate right off the bat.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/is_it_worth_the_time.png"><span>Obligatory XKCD comic (<a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/" target="_blank">link</a>)</span></p>

<p>Automating too late is not a bad thing. I’ll have done the manual work enough times to understand how to eventually automate the task and what edge cases to look out for. I equate it to doing a job yourself before hiring someone– it’s always better to grok the requirements first to some degree so you can understand how to best utilize who you’ve brought on (and appreciate them more!).</p>

<p>I manually triggered the emails for bi-monthly account summaries for months because I wasn’t confident the sending cadence was reasonable. After observing open rates and collecting user feedback, these are now automated to go out on the 5th &amp; 25th of every month.</p>

<p>Something that I’m glad I didn’t spend the time to automate at all was the referral program. If an existing user refers a new user and the new user subscribes to a plan, then both users will receive credit for 1 month.</p>

<p>In the end, the referral program only brought on 11 extra users. It was not a pain at all to manually process rewards for those who did. If I had spent time conjuring up all the edge cases and automating this process, it would not have been worth the time investment.</p>

<h2 id="keep-low-hanging-fruits-in-the-back-pocket">Keep low-hanging fruits in the back pocket</h2>

<p>In my task management system, I use a tag (🍏) to denote which tasks are low-hanging fruits. For the uninitiated, low-hanging fruits are quick tasks that are easy to knock out, such as one-liners or 5-minute fixes.</p>

<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/YP1Jb0JNc7kqFDbdjm/giphy.gif"></p>

<p>I find that keeping these around and tackling them on days when you feel generally unmotivated can really help raise spirits. Still being able to get something completed and shipped is a great way to get out of a slump.</p>



<h2 id="timing-marketing-pushes">Timing marketing pushes</h2>

<p>At Lunch Money, a big part of the business is using the services of Plaid for bank syncing. Plaid charges on a monthly basis which means that if a user signs up on April 30, connects a bank account immediately and doesn’t end up subscribing at the end of their 14-day trial, they will charge me for this user in both April &amp; May’s invoices.</p>

<p>This realization coupled with my intense aversion to paying more than I need to has shaped a lot of practices at Lunch Money.</p>

<p>For one, the data retention policy used to be 30 days which means if your trial ends and you didn’t put in your billing information, your data will be deleted in 30 days. This certainly guarantees that I’ll be overpaying for churned users and is the reason why the data retention policy has since been revised to 5 days.</p>

<p>In total, a user who does not end up subscribing can spend up to 26 days in the Lunch Money system. This comprises of a 14-day trial, the potential for a 1 week trial extension and a 5 day grace period. Assuming enough users connect their bank accounts, the best way to minimize my costs for churned users is to ensure their lifetimes are within one calendar month.</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/calendar-1.png"></p>

<p>As a result, I always schedule marketing pushes such as blog posts and product launches in the first few days of the month. When I came to this realization, my next Plaid bill went down for the first time.</p>

<h2 id="merging-marketing-and-engineering-for-a-combo-win">Merging marketing and engineering for a combo win</h2>

<p>Taking this a step further, the perk of having a spike in new users is that their trial periods more-or-less overlap. Usually when a new user signs up, they will poke around the product and maybe send in a bug report, a feature request or another piece of feedback. If I reply and address their feedback by putting in a fix or shipping their requested feature within days, more often than not, they end up converting into a happy customer.</p>

<p>I’ve therefore identified the following cycle to maximize potential conversions from spikes in user signups:</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/gantt-2.png"></p>

<p>After a marketing push, let’s say a product launch, I will see an immediate increase in signups lasting about 3 days and then slowly trailing off.</p>

<p>Over the next few days, I’ll start hearing from these new users via support tickets. I prioritize responding to them and I get to work. Showing these users that I’m committed to improving Lunch Money based on their feedback is a great and honest sales tactic.</p>

<p>About 3 days before the initial wave of user trials ends, I wrap up my engineering sprint and send out a newsletter detailing the latest features and improvements. This re-enforces to new users that the product is under continuous development.</p>

<p>Finally, I have a drip campaign that automatically notifies users a few days before their trial expires and on the actual date of expiry. This period of time is when I typically see most users convert 🤞.</p>



<p>I used to think that if I were to hire someone, it would first be a customer support agent but I’ve since been moving away from that idea. Users are constantly surprised (in a good way!) when they realize the founder is responding to their bug reports or feature requests directly.</p>

<p><strong>Consistently providing great customer support is a long-term investment for Lunch Money</strong> as it is undoubtedly a great way to turn customers into champions. As I receive and respond to support tickets, I’m also able to identify and overhaul the common sources of trouble for users.</p>

<p>I’ve always believed that customer support would be the most important and the hardest part of the business to scale, especially if I have the goal of staying a company of one.</p>

<p>Corroborating data from <a href="https://emailmeter.com/">EmailMeter</a> and my database, it seems my changes are making a difference. Despite a growing user base, inbound support emails remain fairly steady!</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/screen-shot-2020-05-21-at-4-20-15-pm.png"><span>Handling support on my own should be sustainable at least for the foreseeable future!</span></p>

<h2 id="how-do-support-tickets-work-at-lunch-money">How do support tickets work at Lunch Money?</h2>

<p>A feedback button is located at the bottom right corner of every page. Clicking on it opens up a text area wherein users can submit feature requests, questions, bug …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p><em>This post is the second in a four-part blog series by Peter Zaitsev, Percona Chief Executive Officer.</em></p>
<p>In this series, we are talking about Linux performance measurement, how to measure it right. Linux performance is a very broad topic, so we’ll focus on the four primary resources which are typically going to drive your system performance – obviously CPU, memory, disk storage, and network.</p>
<p>Other parts in this series include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ma.ttias.be/how-to-measure-linux-performance-avoiding-most-typical-mistakes-cpu/">Measuring Linux Performance: CPU</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ma.ttias.be/how-to-measure-linux-performance-avoiding-most-typical-mistakes-disk-storage/">Measuring Linux Performance: Disk</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ma.ttias.be/how-to-measure-linux-performance-avoiding-most-typical-mistakes-memory/">Measuring Linux Performance: Memory</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ma.ttias.be/how-to-measure-linux-performance-avoiding-most-typical-mistakes-network/">Measuring Linux Performance: Network</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of the disk, there are actually two things you have to take care of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disk space</strong> – simple, right? You don’t want to run out of disk space.</li>
<li>And disk as <strong>I/O performance</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="disk-space">Disk Space</h2>
<p>Starting from the simple tool – disk space.</p>
<p>I see a lot of people who do not understand the difference between size, the file length, and the disk usage. So, in this case, I created a test file of 16 gigabytes, but if you look at <code>du</code>, it only takes 4 kilobytes, because that is a sparse file, which is one giant 16-gigabyte hole.</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://ma.ttias.be/content/measuring-linux-performance/part-2/image1.jpg" alt="Example of disk size/filesize" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>Of course, you’re not likely to see this kind of a difference in the real world but you can, because there are a number of systems using sparse files for different things.</p>
<p>For example, in MySQL, due to some of the table compression that is used there may be a big difference between disk space used vs. file length that may be substantially different.</p>
<h2 id="io-performance">I/O performance</h2>
<p>Now when you speak about the disk I/O performance standpoint, you need to consider a number of things here.</p>
<p>Obviously, there is <strong>IOPS</strong> - how much it can do in the bandwidth. They are not quite replaceable, both can be the bottleneck, especially when it comes to the network-attached storage or slower buses. For example, it can be noticed that all SATA SSDs exactly deliver 500 megabytes a second because the SSDs are so fast, but SATA buses are so slow in this case, so that is the limit out there.</p>
<p>You also need to understand <strong>the different types of loads the disk reads, writes, or fsyncs</strong> , because we do have different latency and load implication.</p>
<p>In addition, your load concurrency is often referred to as a <strong>Queue Depth</strong> when it comes to the disk because concurrency is how many requests the system can process in parallel when big throughput is achieved that it is actually typical.</p>
<p>So, from typical mistakes: <em>“My Iostat Disk Utilization number has reached 100%"</em>. I have seen so many times this kind of being so much scared about this 100% when <em>“there is no way to go! Oh my gosh!"</em></p>
<p>The reality is that your <code>iostat</code> utilization number <strong>means the percent of the time when at least one I/O request was outstanding</strong>. It may make sense again for a single spinning drive in the last decade or last millennia, but it doesn’t really make sense for common storage we use those days.</p>
<p>It does not make sense for SSDs, it doesn’t make sense for RAIDs, it doesn’t make sense for NAS, it doesn’t make sense for cloud storage because they are very good at processing multiple requests at a time.</p>
<p>Performance, the latency at least, would not be impacted.</p>
<p>The points that should be highlighted here:</p>
<h3 id="1-separating-read-and-write-latency">1. Separating read and write latency</h3>
<p>Depending on your system, the difference between read and write latency may be very significant. Some systems actually have varied read latency, some have better write latency. In this case, what I do is compare their current latency to their kind of average latency, which you’ve seen on this system over the last period of time, so I can understand relatively easily that it’s abnormal.</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://ma.ttias.be/content/measuring-linux-performance/part-2/image2.png" alt="Disk I/O latency" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p><em>Comparing Current Latency to Historic Latency can help to see when the latency is abnormal</em></p>
<h3 id="2-the-disk-load-that-also-can-be-the-average-disk-use">2. The disk load, that also can be the average disk use</h3>
<p>It means how many requests are going on at the same time. Because if you’re really saturating your disks, queuing happens, and when this thing typically becomes quite high you should know what exactly your storage is expected to be able to optimally handle.</p>
<p>The problem is of course if you think about cloud storage, you don’t really know what the optimal concurrency is. They don’t tell you and that’s going to be implementation-dependent, which can change at any point any time.</p>
<p>

<h3 id="3-biolatency-block-device-latency">3. Biolatency: Block Device Latency</h3>
<p>The next thing is a biolatency, which again you can get from eBPF. You do not need to look at just the average latency, you can look at the distribution which can be done on an I/O device.</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://ma.ttias.be/content/measuring-linux-performance/part-2/image4.png" alt="Block device latency distribution" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>eBPF also has some tools where you can look at that on a file system level that is more interesting because that is where you can also see your cache efficiency as well as you can look at some more of the outliers.</p>
<p>So, this is the tool for ext4 and also one for XFS and some other common file systems.</p>

<![CDATA[A Few Catchy Philosophy Quotes That Are Often Misinterpreted]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<h2>1. "Man is a naturally political animal." - Aristotle (<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0058%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D1253a">Politics, Book 1</a>)</h2>

<h3>What people think it means</h3>

<p>1. People are drawn to "political associations to satisfy their social needs." (<a href="https://oll.libertyfund.org/quotes/164">source</a>), or...</p>
<p>2. People enjoy engaging in the ugly parts of politics, or...</p>
<p>3. People are meant to live in cities. (closest to the actual meaning)</p>

<h3>What it actually means</h3>

<p>To Aristotle, the words "natural" and "political" held special meanings that are not equivalent to what we mean today. The result is that this quote is closer in meaning to:</p>

<blockquote>"Human beings have an internal principle that necessarily leads us to collaboration rather than to independence, and as a result we are meant to live in cities."</blockquote>

<p>When we say "natural" today, we typically mean something that is not man-made. To Aristotle, "natural" refers to things that have a "nature":</p>

<blockquote>"within itself a principle of motion and stability in place, in growth and decay, or in alteration" (Aristotle 192b13)</blockquote>

<p>So when Aristotle says that something is "naturally" the case, through a modern lens he's saying something closer to it being the result of the laws of nature.</p>

<p>Second, by "a political animal," it's tempting to conclude that Aristotle simply means "suited for life in a polis" (city) or "conducive to starting a polis." But he goes on to say that "a human being is <span>more of a</span> political animal than is any bee or any gregarious animal [i.e., an animal that lives in a group]" (1253a8, emphasis mine). So Aristotle thinks that some gregarious animals are political animals, but not to the extent that human beings are. It seems unlikely that Aristotle would suggest that bees or gregarious animals are "suited for lives in a polis" to any degree. More likely, by "political," Aristotle means "working toward a common goal" or "collaborative."</p>

<p>Secular, modern readers would likely disagree with Aristotle's next passage. He argues that nature has "given us" the ability to speak and make moral judgments, and nature "does nothing pointlessly," so we are <span>meant</span> to collaborate on our moral judgments. With our modern understanding of evolution, nature doesn't "give us" features, and nature does sometimes do things "pointlessly." However, this is what Aristotle meant when he said we are "naturally political animals." So even if you agree with the actual meaning of the quote, you probably don't agree with Aristotle's reasoning.</p>

<h2>2. "If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"</h2>

<h3>What people think it means</h3>

<p>When I hear this quote today, I find that people often use it to mean that even if no one observes a fact, it is still true. So it's used as a rhetorical question, with the answer being "of course it makes a sound!"</p>

<h3>What it actually means</h3>

<p>This quote is not directly from any philosophical text, but the question is derived from "A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge" by the Anglican bishop George Berkeley (namesake of UC Berkeley!). Here's the closest section, where Berkeley explains a counterargument and his response:</p>

<blockquote>"But say you, surely there is nothing easier than to imagine Trees, for instance, in a Park... and no Body by to perceive them. I answer, you may so, there is no difficulty in it: But what is all this, I beseech you, more than framing in your Mind certain Ideas which you call Books and Trees, and the same time omitting to frame the Idea of any one that may perceive them? But do not you your self perceive or think of them all the while?" (<a href="https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~dwilkins/Berkeley/HumanKnowledge/1734/HumKno.pdf">source</a>, pg. 18)</blockquote>

<p>I know that's confusing. Let's break it down. For context, Berkeley's famous phrase "esse est percipi" ("to be is to be perceived") is a summary of his philosophical position that objects as we know them cannot exist without the existence of minds to perceive them. (The gist is that everything we know about the object is known through our minds, so when you remove those characteristics, there's nothing left.)</p>

<p>In the first sentence, Berkeley is paraphrasing an objector who claims they are able to imagine trees that no one is perceiving. But Berkeley points out that the objector is simply thinking of the idea of trees ("certain Ideas which you call Books and Trees"), which only exist because the objector is thinking about them.</p>

<p>Since Berkeley believed in a Christian God, it's not clear whether he thought real objects could possibly exist without any perceiver at all, since God might always be watching. But to a secular reader of Berkeley's arguments, the consequence is that <span>the tree does not make a sound</span>, since sound is a perception, and the existence of a perception depends on the existence of a mind to perceive it.</p>

<h2>3. "God is Dead." (The Gay Science) - Nietzsche</h2>

<h3>What people think it means</h3>

<p>This quote might be interpreted as a proclamation of atheism.</p>

<h3>What it actually means</h3>

<p>Nietzsche presented this phrase to a group of atheists, claiming that it was new information for them. So it can't be a statement about atheism.</p>

<p>In this section of "The Gay Science", Nietzsche discusses how many of the underpinnings of Western society, particularly our moral philosophy, implicitly rely on the concept of God. With the rise of philosophical secularism that came with the Enlightenment, we can no longer rely on God to give life meaning and value, and everything that was built on the Christian faith is destined to "collapse" (GS 343). This is what it means for God to be "dead."</p>

			<p><span>I discovered the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/no/book/show/38714658-the-order-of-time">The Order of Time by Carlo Rovelli</a> a few years ago and it reignited my interest in Quantum Physics. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/24/carlo-rovelli-the-order-of-time-review">This is the original review that reeled me in. </a>The title caught my attention initially because the focus was on the concept of time. Time is a mysterious topic. It changes in unexpected circumstances, it’s perceived in different ways and scientists still ponder what it actually is. It turns out that time and quantum physics go hand in hand. The book is in three sections; the understanding of time in modern physics, what happens without time and finally the latest theories on time including Rovelli’s own research into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity#:~:text=Quantum%20gravity%20(QG)%20is%20a,effects%20of%20gravity%20are%20strong.">Quantum Gravity</a> which present some of the most recent theories in the field. </span></p>
<p><span>One of the intriguing things was the link between time and heat. As things heat up, thermal agitation increases, which leads to entropy and disorder. This can distinguish the past and the future. There are many surprising assertions about time (at least for me) that I won’t spoil for you.</span></p>
<p><span>The tone of this book is poetic. It’s always in awe of the amazing world we live in. The best part is that it simplifies very difficult concepts into something most people could understand, allowing for greater access. This can only be a good thing for technology research overall. </span></p>
<p><span>As much information as there is about the concept of time and the theories that exist, there are still many open questions. It leaves you feeling small, knowing there is so much we don’t know about our world. And finally, unlike most other science books, there’s only one equation mentioned (good news for some).</span></p>
<p><span>I’ll leave you with <a href="https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/wellbeing/carlo-rovelli-coronavirus-italy-life-death-psychology-419679">something recent by Carlo Rovelli talking about the pandemic reminding us we are only human and encouraging collaboration and science to overcome it.</a></span></p>

<p>Thread dump files tend to span for several hundreds of lines (sometimes a few thousands of lines). It is hard to conceive and assimilate all the information in the thread dump due to its verbosity. Flame Graph generated by <span><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fastthread.io/" target="_blank">fastThread</a></span> tool condenses all the information into one single compact flame graph format. It facilitates you to identify hot code paths quickly. In this article, let us learn how to use flame graphs generated by fastThread tool for effective debugging/troubleshooting purposes.</p>



<pre>If you would like to learn how to generate flame graph from java thread dumps, you can refer <a href="https://blog.fastthread.io/2020/06/23/flame-graph-from-java-thread-dump/">to this article</a></pre>



<h2>fastThread Flame graph features</h2>

</div></figure>



<p>Here are key features of the flame graph generated by fastThread application:</p>



<h3>1. Information on Mouse Hover:&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Stack traces are represented as a column of boxes, where each box represents a function (a stack frame). On mouse-over of boxes, a tooltip will be displayed. It will show the class name, method name, and line of the code that has been executed. More importantly, it will show the number of threads that are executing this line of code.</p>



<p><em><strong>Example:</strong></em><strong><em>&nbsp; </em></strong></p>



<pre><code>com.buggycompany.framework.concurrent.buyggycompanyCallable.call(buggycompanyCallable.java:82), thread count: 2467)</code></pre>

<p><strong><em>Fig: Hovering mouse generates tool tip indicating line of code that is executed</em></strong></p>



<h3>2. Flame Graph Color</h3>



<p>The background color for each box is not significant and is picked at random to be a warm hue. This randomness helps the eye to differentiate boxes, especially for adjacent thin “towers”.</p>



<h3>3. Box width</h3>



<p>The width of each box depends on the thread count. If the width of the box is sufficient, it displays the full function name. If not, either a truncated function name with an ellipsis is shown, or nothing.</p>



<h3>4. Click to zoom</h3>



<p>When a box is clicked, the flame graph zooms horizontally. This reveals more detail and often function names for the child functions.&nbsp;</p>

<![CDATA[Moving from TypeScript to Rust / WebAssembly]]>
            </title>

<br/>
July 8, 2020 | https://nicolodavis.com/blog/typescript-to-rust/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://nicolodavis.com/blog/typescript-to-rust/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently decided to switch the engine of
<a href="https://boardgamelab.app/">Boardgame Lab</a> from TypeScript
to Rust. The application itself is an SPA written in Svelte.
I only switched the logic that updates the game state to Rust.
Here is a summary of my experience with the transition:</p><h2>Isomorphic Architecture</h2><p>One of the advantages of using JavaScript or TypeScript is
that you can run the same code on both client and server.
For <a href="https://boardgamelab.app/">Boardgame Lab</a>, this means
that the game state can be updated independently on both sides.
This results in a lag-free experience on the client
while still using the server as the authoritative source of
data.</p><p>With <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> taking off, you can get the same advantage
writing Rust. Instead of pushing client-side code to the server, we push server-side code to the client by compiling Rust
to WebAssembly.</p><p>This <a href="https://github.com/wasm-tool/rollup-plugin-rust">Rollup</a>
plugin allows you to import a <em>Cargo.toml</em> file into your
TypeScript codebase, allowing a seamless integration between
Rust and TypeScript code. The dev experience is almost as smooth
as writing TypeScript itself (for example, the browser refreshes
automatically when you change a line of Rust code).</p><p><a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen">wasm-bindgen</a>
facilitates serialization of Rust structs into JSON objects
and vice-versa.</p><h2>Limitations of TypeScript</h2><p>Coding in TypeScript has been a largely pleasant experience,
but switching to Rust immediately brought to light some of the
limitations of TypeScript.</p><h4>Strict Typing</h4><p>TypeScript is more of a type-hinter than a type-checker.
It primarily ensures that you’re not accessing fields that
you aren’t declaring via the type system (which is quite expressive). It also enables nicer autocomplete for your IDE.</p><p>However, it does not actually ensure that the data you are
manipulating corresponds to the type that you have declared
to represent it. For example, the data might contain <strong>additional fields</strong> or
even <strong>incorrect</strong> values for declared types.</p><h4>Data Validation</h4><p>You have to write data validation code to ensure that you’re
operating on correct data in TypeScript. You get this for
free in Rust, which will throw an error if you parse data
that doesn’t line up with the struct that is to hold it in
memory.</p><h4>Error Handling</h4><p>Rust’s <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-02-match.html">pattern matching</a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html">error handling</a> make it easy to
handle every code path that could result in an error, leading
to very robust code.</p><p>This leads to a great degree of confidence that if it compiles,
it’s probably not going to throw an error at runtime.</p><h2>Performance</h2><h4>WebAssembly is faster than JavaScript</h4><p>The initial rewrite without any performance optimizations
is already faster than the previous TypeScript codebase.
This doesn’t matter too much yet, but
<a href="https://boardgamelab.app/">Boardgame Lab</a> will eventually
ship with bots, so the performance will matter once
game trees need to be searched.</p><h4>The Rust server is leaner</h4><p>The multiplayer server receives updates from clients via
WebSockets and then:</p><ul><li>Updates its copy of the game state.</li><li>Broadcasts the client update to other clients.</li></ul><p>The previous server used <a href="https://github.com/websockets/ws">ws</a>, a popular library for NodeJS. The new version uses <a href="https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp">Warp</a> (Rust), which uses less memory
under the same load.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Overall, I’m pretty happy with the switch. I haven’t really
encountered much resistance from the borrow checker despite
being fairly new to Rust (I come from a C++ background, so
maybe that helps).</p></div></div>]]>

<p><img height="501" width="890" src="https://www.bllnr.com/images/cache/fc9b27d1ce9c1a803fe76b3cfc1a34f3_w890.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>An artist's rendering of a Seasteading community (c) Ocean Builders</p>

<p>In a palm-fringed, sunny bay in Panama, a revolution is taking place. This is the location of the first SeaPod manufacturing facility, where around 30 single family SeaPods are being pieced together from 3D-printed molds and lifted onto their foundations just over a kilometre from the shoreline.</p>
<p>The plan is that these will be self-sufficient homes that power themselves, produce their own hydroponic food and electricity, handle their own wastewater treatment, and even be fitted with an underwater coral nursery to support marine life. Air and water drones will courier trash, recycling, packages, food delivery and emergency medical support like defibrillators and medicine.</p>
<p>This is not science-fiction. If all goes ahead, by late Fall this year, Linton Bay Marina in Panama will house the first residential seasteading community in the world. </p>
<p>Seasteading, the concept of creating permanent dwellings at sea outside the territory claimed by any government, is not new, but some examples more credible than others. For instance, in the 1960's the founder of The Church of Scientology based much of the group's executive leadership on seasteads, before moving them back to land in the 1970's. In his 1992 book <em>The Millennial Project; Colonizing the Galaxy in Eight Easy Steps,</em> <a title="Marshall Savage" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Savage">Marshall Savage</a> discussed building tethered <a title="Artificial island" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_island">artificial islands.</a>  </p>
<p> <img height="501" width="890" src="https://www.bllnr.com/images/cache/86199cf33beb4e1e21cb4a752200ef37_w890.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Artisanopolis concept for the Seasteading Institute (c) Gabriel Scheare, Luke Lourdes Crowley and Patrick White</p>
<p>But recently the concept has gained traction with a more serious school of thought. In April 2019, the concept of floating cities as a way to cope with rising oceans was included in a presentation by the United Nations program UN-Habitat. In addition, a Dutch pro-choice non-profit named <a href="https://www.womenonwaves.org/en/">Women on Waves</a> uses seasteading as a way to circumnavigate abortion laws, using a commissioned ship that contains a specially constructed mobile clinic, the A-Portable. When WoW visits a country, women make appointments for an abortion or other reproductive health service, and are taken on board the ship. The ship then sails out approximately 12 miles to international waters where Dutch laws are in effect on board ships registered in the Netherlands.<sup id="cite_ref-5"></sup></p>
<p>This particular seastead in Panama is the brainchild of <a href="https://ocean.builders/about/">Ocean Builders</a>, a company co-founded by Silicon Valley bitcoin entrepreneur Chad Elwartowski, former Navy aeronautical engineer Rüdiger Koch and software developer Grant Romundt. This is not the first attempt at creating a long-term residential community. It came close, last year, when Elwartowski and his partner Supranee Thepdet moved into the first floating, octagonal seastead 12 miles off the coast of Phuket, Thailand.</p>
<p>They lived there for around two months, but after a video of them drinking champagne and inviting others to "join their ocean community" was published online, the Royal Thai Navy sent out a crew to remove their seastead as "a threat to Thai sovereignty". Elwartowski and his partner had already fled after a tip-off from a friend. </p>
<p>Two years prior, a floating island building company called <a href="https://www.blue-frontiers.com/en/">Blue Frontiers,</a> had signed a memorandum of understanding with French Polynesia to create the first semi-autonomous "seazone" for a prototype in 2017, not least on the grounds of fast-rising sea-levels as a potential life-line to hedge against global warming. But the project was later shelved indefinitely after local protests. </p>
<p><img height="593" width="890" src="https://www.bllnr.com/images/cache/decd3a2ab1d05af8f8461db5097bbe83_w890.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The seastead that was home to Chad Elwartowski and his partner Supranee Thepdet</p>
<p>This time, in Panama, they have the full support of the government, says Ocean Builders CEO Grant Romundt, over a Zoom call. "We will be working closely with Panama to identify any legal matters related to our floating homes. We wish to pursue a flagging system so that owners of the homes can hold a title and claim ownership of their new home fully backed by the legal system of Panama."</p>
<p>An advertisement on the Ocean Builders website is recruiting people to join the growing community, “entrepreneurs, aquapreneurs, technology enthusiasts, electronics hackers, marine biologists and other people that are passionate about developing new products and services that a city on the ocean would need.” </p>
<p>The 3D printer they are using to create the molds for the homes is huge, 20 feet by 16 feet, to build details down to the millimeter. The current pod design is engineered for 5 meter waves as the pods float about 2.5 meters above the waves, similar to an oil rig. The design for the SeaPods came from Dutch architect Koen Olthuis of Water Studio, an established designer of floating homes. </p>
<p>"We really don't feel waves like a normal boat would which is floating in the turbulent surface of the water, and when we go further out to sea we can scale our designs to withstand larger waves," says Romundt. Ocean Builders is working towards 3D printing the entire floating home which may take years of research and development. In the meantime, SeaPods are molded from 3D printed molds in a combination of plastic and foam and then covered with fiberglass. The Pods have an outer shell made of a white gel coat. On the interior, owners can choose between gel coat or a Corian artificial stone surface from Dupont.</p>
<p>During the first phase of sales, according to Romundt, the primary focus will be on tourism and businesses, through 'SeaBnBs', time shares and rentals. "We want as many people to experience our new homes as possible," he adds. </p>

<p><strong>Legalities</strong></p>
<p>Every land-based country has their own rules on how long they consider a person needs to be in their country to be deemed a resident of their country, either for legal, tax, health insurance or other purposes. But seasteading countries would be free of that obligation, said Romundt. "There is no requirement for how long someone would need to live on a seastead to be deemed a resident of that community." </p>
<p>To be considered as a country, a seasteading community would likely fly a maritime flag of a country similar to how boats are flagged under a country. This would give them some legal protections as they would theoretically be seen as a part of the country they are flagged under, explained Romundt. To be completely outside of a governments' jurisdiction a seasteading community would need to be 200 miles from land.</p>
<p>According to the non-profit think tank, the Seasteading Institute, many seasteading proponents are fed up with their country's outdated laws and welcome the idea to rewrite the rulebook for the 21st Century. </p>
<p>"The challenge with old governments is that obsolete laws don’t go away as fast as new laws are created. For instance, <a href="https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2016/Bills/A9999/5169_I1.HTM" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">a law that all horses on the highway must wear sleigh bells was not repealed in New Jersey until 2017</a>," said President of the Seasteading Institute, Joe Quirk.</p>
<p>"We need legal systems to evolve as rapidly as the cultures and technologies they govern, and Seasteading is a technology to accelerate the process by which smart laws are developed and dumb laws are deleted. Special Economic Zones are areas within existing countries that are given unique regulatory systems to increase prosperity. Think of them as legal islands created on land. <a href="https://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/wir2019_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">There are more than 4000 around the world, including more than 250 in the US</a>," he added. </p>
<p>Tom W. Bell, a professor of law at Chapman University, wrote a book proposing a new kind of Special Economic Zone known as a SeaZone, which will take the lessons learned from land-based zones and apply them in a floating zone. He said in the book, "Governments across the globe have begun evolving from lumbering bureaucracies into smaller, more agile special jurisdictions - common-interest developments, special economic zones, and proprietary cites. Private providers increasingly deliver services that political authorities formerly monopolized, inspiring greater competition and efficiency, to the satisfaction of citizens-qua-consumers. These trends suggest that new networks of special jurisdictions will soon surpass nation states in the same way that networked computers replaced mainframes."</p>
<p>While this is all good in an ideal, libertarian world, argues Emma Lindsay, a New York-based partner at international law firm Withers, escaping the nation state is difficult, even on the high seas, and in fact the laws of several countries could apply.  </p>
<p>She adds: "<span lang="EN-US">Individuals are subject to the laws of their state(s) of nationality no matter where they are. While not all of a state’s laws apply outside its territory, many do. The laws of the flag state of the seastead also apply.  All seagoing vessels are registered or licensed in a flag state which is deemed the nationality of the vessel. Panama is the world’s largest flag state by far.  Seasteaders also could be subject to the laws of any state that is harmed by their activities at sea, such as by pollution of surrounding waters. The current negotiation of a new UN treaty on conservation and sustainable use of the high seas has increased attention globally on this issue."</span></p>
<p>Withers is advising High Seas Alliance in its advocacy with states and other stakeholders negotiating the new treaty in New York.</p>

<p> <strong>Life In A Tax Haven</strong></p>
<p>The homes in Panama will be located in an anchorage close to a marina in calm, protected waters, as part of a trial run for a community further away in future. This allows for getting accustomed to living on the water while still being able to travel on land having easy access to groceries, supplies and the airport. Each home will be fitted with solar panels, a water filtration system and hydroponic farming to aim for as much self-sufficiency as possible.</p>
<p>One reason for trialling the concept in Panama is that it is a pure tax haven, meaning that it imposes no income, corporate, …</p></div></div>

It doesn’t have a sharp blade, an open flame, or jagged shrapnel. And it’s not dangerous because a bright orange sign proclaimed it so; but precisely the opposite. <em>Invisible</em> goes under the radar and over our heads, engaging no defenses and no fight-or-flight moment.</p><p id="viewer-3emtj">Because <em>invisible</em> doesn’t invoke urgency, less visible matters naturally seem distant, even nonexistent. What’ll get first dibs on my attention — the Amazon rainforest burning for months on end, or the candle burning in my living room? Probably the candle; not because it’s more <em>important</em> than the rainforest, but because it’s more readily <em>visible</em>.</p><p id="viewer-8hggc"><span>Visibility almost never exists on a level playing field. Why is SkyMall staring you in the face on a long flight? And why is Starbucks conveniently placed on the morning-commute-heavy side of the road? Particularly in commercial spaces, what you </span><em>see </em><span>is rarely coincidence. At any given moment, more than a few brands bid fiercely for your eyes — whether via the “</span><a href="https://www.cstoreproductsonline.com/general-merchandise/hitting-consumer-strike-zone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strike zone</a><span>” of convenience store shelves, the head of your search results, or slices of your Instagram timeline. So visibility becomes a point of leverage for those with capital —</span><strong>a differentiator between </strong><em><strong>winners </strong></em><strong>and </strong><em><strong>losers</strong></em><span>.</span></p><div id="viewer-vfg6"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.home.vujade.world/post/out-of-sight-out-of-mind" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_907433be8cb24d2a96f9f8be149bdaaf~mv2.jpeg/v1/fit/w_400,h_353,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_907433be8cb24d2a96f9f8be149bdaaf~mv2.jpeg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpeg"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 01-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 010-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 01-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 01-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 01.283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 010 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-ads28"><a href="http://www.joehollier.com/fiveonthat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></p><p id="viewer-e7ps3">Let’s rewind back to the candle and the rainforest. Who’s the winner there? For starters, it’s the company that sold me the candle. And as winners, they’re inclined to preserve the conditions that let them win. So the immense supply chain that turned crude oil, glass, and paper into a delightful candle (probably clearcutting a rainforest along the way) is deliberately made opaque to regulators and consumers like me. In other words, the <em>box</em> is kept <em>black</em>. With diminished visibility, the loser — the rainforest — is subject to further disadvantage. Thus, <strong>the black box preserves the existing divide between winners and losers.</strong></p><p id="viewer-fq9n4">But if you look a little closer, the winner-loser divide isn’t so black and white. Obviously I, as the owner of the candle, benefit from its black-boxedness. I can fill my living room with citrus blossom fragrances, blissfully ignorant of the polluted air it sends into the lungs of people and animals closer to the candle’s production. And though I may claim to support ecological policy reform, thereby aligning with the loser, my consumption choices say otherwise.</p><div id="viewer-602v0"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.home.vujade.world/post/out-of-sight-out-of-mind" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_83100eafdb1a4ead944746138bb13165~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_600,h_316,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_83100eafdb1a4ead944746138bb13165~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 01-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 010-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 01-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 01-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 01.283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 010 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-9pmb0"><a href="http://www.joehollier.com/fiveonthat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></p><h2 id="viewer-amq0v">Defense mechanisms</h2><p id="viewer-blqmb">Cognitive dissonance is inescapable in a world of black boxes. While they’re often vital to societal functioning — like the black box of democracy, as discussed in <a href="https://vujadeworld.substack.com/p/tangled" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part two</a> — they’re not necessarily moral. Underneath their murky surfaces, we know, are plenty of things we don’t want to see. But since our very lifestyles have molded around them, exposing their inner workings would threaten the way we live. To ward off anxiety and guilt, we construct defense mechanisms (on individual <em>and</em> societal scales).</p><p id="viewer-4nhpg">Take, for example, the moment you dispose of a piece of trash. From the moment it hits the bottom of the bin, a massive system comes to life — of garbage trucks, dumpsters, street cleaners, sanitation centers, and landfills — to whisk it out of your life as quickly as it came in. Or, it just lands on the side of the road…</p><p id="viewer-7h8d">In any case, our products <em>come from</em> and <em>return to</em> a sort of <strong>mental nowhereland</strong>; a cavity for unspoken thoughts to fester: “<em>this doesn’t exist after I’m done with it</em>,” or taken further, “<em>the Earth is abundant</em>.” Of course, these aren’t explicit views in our minds; they occupy the <em>negative space</em> — like shadows, or lies.</p><div id="viewer-a3v8v"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.home.vujade.world/post/out-of-sight-out-of-mind" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_ac3ced2b99534923a938a3d3c2c9b5e5~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1418,h_1418,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_ac3ced2b99534923a938a3d3c2c9b5e5~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 01-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 010-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 01-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 01-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 01.283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 010 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-b0mtt"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BhA8Dhejk9l/?igshid=18a1vwb87761x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></p><p id="viewer-eued3">And this is just for lifeless products.

But as demonstrated by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison%E2%80%93industrial_complex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prison-industrial complex</a>, we’re quite adept at dealing with people in the same callous, logistics-driven manner we deal with objects.</p><p id="viewer-2rm48">Cop cars fill the place of garbage trucks. Landfills become prisons. We thrust our pesky challenges as far as possible from the cozy suburbs, and guard them with barbed wire and strict visitation rules. Behind bars, we lock away the questions we don’t want to ask, as well as the societal shortcomings that made those bars necessary.</p><p id="viewer-aa1kn">And like the candle/rainforest scenario, these black boxes produce winners and losers. Those in charge would like you to think that <em>you</em> — Mr. or Mrs. Upstanding Citizen — are the only winner. You can drive by inmates picking up trash on the side of the road, permitted to think: “<em>those people belong there</em>.” But as they pick up the scraps put there by people like you, the more complicated truth remains deep in a black box.

They are institutional voids, which perpetuate the same invisibilities that produced them. In the process, they carve out a negative space of shadows, lies, and unasked questions. And as this negative space crystallizes, <em>power</em> is encoded into <em>narrative</em>. <strong>Stories, after all, are the strongest defense mechanisms we have</strong>.</p><h2 id="viewer-bd1j1">The glass slipper</h2><p id="viewer-dnank">If <em>defense mechanisms</em> work best when they’re <em>invisible</em>, and <em>invisible is dangerous</em>, then what does that say about <em>stories</em>? That they’re <em>dangerous</em>? Well, sort of. <strong>Stories are most dangerous when they’re</strong> <em><strong>invisible</strong></em>.</p><p id="viewer-dfbfb">In their refined, packaged-up formats, stories are relatively benign. The danger in Disney fairy tales, for instance, stems from the societal narratives surrounding them — which they subtly reinforce. <em>Cinderella</em>, the movie, isn’t the problem; it’s the broader story of femininity, and the impossible challenge of fitting into the “glass slipper” of male expectations.</p><p id="viewer-63p5o">The symbols and mythology of a story, while potential tools for relaying the real issues at hand, also run the risk of obscuring those same issues. As a result, a story itself can be a sort of glass slipper. Beautiful, yet rigid; prompting conformity under the guise of transparency.</p><div id="viewer-b3cqt"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.home.vujade.world/post/out-of-sight-out-of-mind" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_2f350a6be9ea43bea2bed514c28e560a~mv2.gif/v1/fit/w_500,h_273,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_2f350a6be9ea43bea2bed514c28e560a~mv2.gif"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 01-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 010-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 01-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 01-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 01.283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 010 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-39jn9">Because they’re so easy to perpetuate, stories are the most manipulative of all black boxes. And the protective shell of narrative too often lets injustice off the hook. <strong>If the&nbsp;<em>content</em>&nbsp;of a story doesn’t adequately address its</strong> <strong><em>context</em>, a black box has been formed.</strong> These narrative black boxes, like the prison and the landfill, only reaffirm the conditions that produced them in the first place.</p><p id="viewer-9n9s0">Mark Zuckerberg famously <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Facebook_Effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>: “A squirrel dying in front of your house may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa.” Albeit tone-deaf rhetorically (such as his default to <em>dying</em> and <em>Africa</em>), this is, in fact, a <em>story</em>. And it’s not actually about squirrels, nor people in Africa.</p><p id="viewer-9csne">On the surface-level, it seems reminiscent of the candle/rainforest analogy — illustrating how we naturally prioritize what’s <em>visible</em> over what’s <em>important</em>. But Zuckerberg’s subtext is covertly self-reflexive. Visibility, according to the story, sits outside his locus of control. By focusing on a narrowly-defined “relevance” to our “interests,” he implies that all Facebook does is reflect our own natural tendencies. In a sly erasure of context, the squirrel analogy obscures Facebook’s troll-under-the-bridge role: how levied allotment of visibility is their entire profit model.</p><p id="viewer-dg8pl">If history is written by the victors, then <strong>stories are told by the winners</strong>. So behind every story, and thus behind every black box, there’s a winner. And the BIG winners — like Facebook, Google, and Amazon — not only tell stories, but they run the bidding wars for visibility itself. Space, whether on a shelf or a timeline, is fought for exclusively by those on the <em>outside</em> of the black box.</p><div id="viewer-9pui"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.home.vujade.world/post/out-of-sight-out-of-mind" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_ddef68de436249d8b3a7f9f9b4ab7580~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1382,h_1382,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_ddef68de436249d8b3a7f9f9b4ab7580~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 01-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 010-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 01-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 01-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 01.283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 010 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><h6 id="viewer-9h5iv"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5n1R8XJr83/?igshid=uzunevirh3bo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></h6><p id="viewer-i4hr">But now, the black boxes that have cocooned us for so long are beginning to crack.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Online abuse of trust is one of the topics I’ve studied deeply, including significant work toward an unfinished <a href="https://levien.com/thesis/thesis.pdf">PhD</a>, and over two years working on a spam and abuse team at Google. These days my main work is on 2D graphics, but seeing patterns of misinformation about Covid-19 is bringing back interest and motivation to think about these topics.</p>

<p>As Covid-19 has been unfolding, I’ve spent significant time and energy trying to understand it, as I tend to do with threats in general. In so doing, I’ve developed some insight on how to tune media consumption patterns towards more truthful content and less misinformation.</p>

<h2 id="america-is-broken">America is broken</h2>

<p>The astonishingly poor national response to Covid-19 is heartbreaking. Given our incredible richness of resources, it is surprising that many of the failure modes resemble those from low-income countries: superstition, cult of personality, suppression of science, and straight up corruption. A common thread is misinformation and disinformation.</p>

<p>Our response to Covid-19 has been very much like driving a car with poorly-maintained brakes. We’ve done the equivalent of neglecting regular maintenance, ignoring the brake light on the dashboard, and choosing to not to pay attention to the squishy feeling of the brake pedal. It’s as if there’s a devil on our shoulder saying, “oh no, don’t get the brakes fixed, it might cost hundreds of dollars.”</p>

<p>I think it’s worth trying to understand <em>why</em> we’re in that position, but it’s beyond the scope of this blog post. Mass behavior of humans is pretty predictable, but individual choices can probably make some difference. I have no answers for those who <em>want</em> to listen to that devil (a big challenge in and of itself), but for those would prefer to listen to the angel instead, I have some tips.</p>

<h2 id="it-is-a-partisan-issue">It is a partisan issue</h2>

<p>I often see the plea “it is not a partisan issue” attached to factual arguments. I think this represents an aspiration: it <em>should</em> not be partisan. In 2020 America, the reality is that there is a powerful anti-science, anti-truth faction, and that faction makes up a large part of the composition of one of the political parties. It’s not 100% alignment, and I want to give credit where credit is due: for example, the moderate Republican governor of Massachusetts has embraced science and investment in public health, and the results in that state are one of the best in the country.</p>

<p>But in general, any factual argument that has bearing on a political question such as “should we invest in public health” or “should we restructure the economy away from carbon consumption” is now inherently partisan.</p>

<p>Much of the partisan content in media is around issues that are not very consequential, either pure entertainment, or (at least traditionally) between candidates or parties that have comparable ability to govern. I was hopeful that the life or death nature of Covid-19 would motivate the people who decide what appears in media to higher standards. But apparently, it’s just the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scorpion_and_the_Frog">nature of the scorpion</a>, they either can’t help themselves or just don’t care. Almost certainly, the media organization with the most blood on its hands is Fox News, which actively promotes an anti-health, pro-infection agenda. I don’t understand how they sleep at night.</p>

<p>Truth threatens a lot of existing power structures. If everybody woke up tomorrow and decided they were tired of being lied to, there would be seismic shifts of power. It’s worth thinking about who might be most affected by such a thing, and the kinds of things they do to keep it from happening.</p>

<h2 id="high-end-science-journalism">High-end science journalism</h2>

<p>I’m going to cover a range of information sources in this post, but there is a tl;dr: read up on actual science journalism by people who know what they’re talking about. Coverage by Science, Nature, and STAT News has been uniformly excellent. Good journalism is always teamwork, but I’ll also raise up the voices of particularly insightful individuals: <a href="https://twitter.com/sciencecohen">Jon Cohen</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kakape">Kai Kupferschmidt</a> of Science, <a href="https://twitter.com/amymaxmen">Amy Maxmen</a> of Nature, <a href="https://twitter.com/HelenBranswell">Helen Branswell</a> of STAT News. These are science journalists who have invested years in honing their craft.</p>

<p>I’ve also been impressed by coverage in The Atlantic. Their science content is quite good (thanks to top-notch contributors such as <a href="https://twitter.com/edyong209">Ed Yong</a>), but they also put the science in the context of American culture and politics. It is for this reason, I believe, that our President has <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2020/05/27/the-atlantic-saw-subscriptions-surge-after-trump-tweet/">singled them out</a> for criticism.</p>

<p>It’s interesting that these sources tend to be publications that have been around for a while (STAT News is a brand of the Boston Globe media group). It’s not exactly rocket science how to do this, you just need to find experienced, capable writers and pay them to do journalism, with editorial and institutional support. But in today’s hyper-capitalist society, sustaining such efforts is a struggle. If you can, try to support publications that do good work by subscribing, or donating in the case of non-profits.</p>

<p>For someone with a limited budget of time and attention, good science journalism is absolutely the best bang for the buck. The other recommendations in this post are for people who want to spend a little more effort to gain, hopefully, a little more insight.</p>

<h2 id="twitter">Twitter</h2>

<p>By far the most interesting experience I’ve had has been Twitter. What makes Twitter unique is its extremely wide dynamic range of information quality: both the worst of the worst and the best of the best are well represented. (An example of an information source of low dynamic range is an encyclopedia: almost every article is pretty good, garbage and brilliance both being rare)</p>

<p>A well-curated Twitter feed is one of the best information sources available today, and following random people on Twitter is one of the worst.</p>

<p>Even though it has no formal structure such as subreddits, Twitter functions as a set of overlapping communities, often described as “X Twitter” or “Y Twitter” (incidentally, a good explanation of how communities work on Twitter can be had in Jeff Jarvis’ <a href="https://buzzmachine.com/2020/05/11/a-conversation-with-nathan-allebach-steak-umms-voice/">interview of the voice behind Steak-umm</a>). There are many experts who generously share their knowledge and thoughts with us, and I’ve found that with a modest investment of time, it’s possible to follow along.</p>

<p>In one of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCud8VIawWp17jKl2Lp0VvlQ">Jeff Jarvis interviews</a>, they jokingly referred to “idiot Twitter,” and, though it was a joke, the concept has stuck with me. Twitter, like all social media properties, works by engaging very large numbers of people with content that appeals emotionally. The expert communities are far too small a fraction of Twitter’s traffic to be profitable for them, but they support them as a way to maintain the prestige of the platform. The replies of any popular post are filled with all manner of conspiracy theory, miracle cure, denial, blame, and, I think at least sometimes, active disinformation by those who would do us harm (it’s hard to tell the difference and the outcome is the same). I think of all that as “idiot Twitter” and just do my best to avoid it. I also see it everywhere, of course, not just Twitter, and the quantity of it is a good measure of the value in a social media platform.</p>

<p>Twitter has a delicate balance to maintain, as there are many aspects of the site design that push you toward “idiot Twitter” even when you’re trying to curate your experience to avoid it. One example that consistently frustrates me is the trending panel, as that seems to be about half composed of idiot Twitter. It’s addictive, even so, because it tempts you with the thrill of discovering things early. I’ve also found that it’s easier to avoid junk on the desktop site than the mobile app. I’m worried the experience will degrade; Quora stands as a cautionary tale of what can happen to a relatively respectable site when they pursue clicks at the cost of all else.</p>

<p>Whether it would be viable to develop a social network designed for quality of discussion is another topic beyond this blog. I’m not especially hopeful on this front, as it’s hard to see how it would be profitable. In any case, there’s not much value in wishing for the possibly impossible, as somebody seeking quality information can find it even today.</p>

<h3 id="list-curation">List curation</h3>

<p>One of the interesting features of Twitter is that people will curate and share lists of people they feel are worth following. My <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1239639611694911489">covid-19 list</a> is one such, and a lot of thought went into it: I’ve intentionally included people with a wide range of expertise (including, for example, <a href="https://twitter.com/j_g_allen">Joseph Allen</a> for his insight into healthy buildings and <a href="https://twitter.com/uche_blackstock">Dr. Uché Blackstock</a> for expertise on health equity). I’ve also deliberately excluded people from this list who express strong political views or often use an emotional tone. Because of the latter criterion, it’s missing people I personally feel are worth listening to, especially <a href="https://twitter.com/gregggonsalves">Gregg Gonsalves</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/JeremyKonyndyk">Jeremy Konyndyk</a>. As always, your mileage may vary. The goal of this particular list is not to be comprehensive, it’s to select a set of voices that have excellent signal to noise ratio; for a much more comprehensive list, see <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1237834151694303234">this one curated by Jeff Jarvis</a>.</p>

<p>One phenomenon I’ve noticed is that people at the top of these lists tend to recommend each other. I wouldn’t be surprised if some automated evaluation (perhaps based on eigenvalues) could yield a good curated list. That said, in my past research, I’ve found that any automatic metric with an incentive will be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">gamed</a>, and invariably will lift up self-promoters over quiet, thoughtful voices.</p>

<p>Speaking of self-promoters, two names do not belong on lists of top experts, but are often found there: Eric Feigl-Ding &amp; Laurie Garrett. Both are good communicators, but are also sloppy enough with their science to get called out regularly. Inclusion of these names is a sign that a list of experts is not especially carefully curated.</p>

<p>Another important warning sign is lack of inclusion of women and people of color; mainstream media is often guilty of this. Health equity is an especially important part of the …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p><em><center>Neil Postman (March 27, 1998)</center></em></p><hr>
      <p>Good morning your Eminences and Excellencies, ladies, and gentlemen. 
      </p><p>The theme of this conference, "The New Technologies and the Human 
      Person: Communicating the Faith in the New Millennium," suggests, of 
      course, that you are concerned about what might happen to faith in the new 
      millennium, as well you should be. In addition to our computers, which are 
      close to having a nervous breakdown in anticipation of the year 2000, 
      there is a great deal of frantic talk about the 21st century and how it 
      will pose for us unique problems of which we know very little but for 
      which, nonetheless, we are supposed to carefully prepare. Everyone seems 
      to worry about this--business people, politicians, educators, as well as 
      theologians. 
      </p><p>At the risk of sounding patronizing, may I try to put everyone's mind 
      at ease? I doubt that the 21st century will pose for us problems that are 
      more stunning, disorienting or complex than those we faced in this 
      century, or the 19th, 18th, 17th, or for that matter, many of the 
      centuries before that. But for those who are excessively nervous about the 
      new millennium, I can provide, right at the start, some good advice about 
      how to confront it. The advice comes from people whom we can trust, and 
      whose thoughtfulness, it's safe to say, exceeds that of President Clinton, 
      Newt Gingrich, or even Bill Gates. Here is what Henry David Thoreau told 
      us: "All our inventions are but improved means to an unimproved end." Here 
      is what Goethe told us: "One should, each day, try to hear a little song, 
      read a good poem, see a fine picture, and, if possible, speak a few 
      reasonable words." Socrates told us: "The unexamined life is not worth 
      living." Rabbi Hillel told us: "What is hateful to thee, do not do to 
      another." And here is the prophet Micah: "What does the Lord require of 
      thee but to do justly, to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy God." And 
      I could say, if we had the time, (although you know it well enough) what 
      Jesus, Isaiah, Mohammad, Spinoza, and Shakespeare told us. It is all the 
      same: There is no escaping from ourselves. The human dilemma is as it has 
      always been, and it is a delusion to believe that the technological 
      changes of our era have rendered irrelevant the wisdom of the ages and the 
      sages. 
      </p><p>Nonetheless, having said this, I know perfectly well that because we do 
      live in a technological age, we have some special problems that Jesus, 
      Hillel, Socrates, and Micah did not and could not speak of. I do not have 
      the wisdom to say what we ought to do about such problems, and so my 
      contribution must confine itself to some things we need to know in order 
      to address the problems. I call my talk <i>Five Things We Need to Know 
      About Technological Change</i>. I base these ideas on my thirty years of 
      studying the history of technological change but I do not think these are 
      academic or esoteric ideas. They are to the sort of things everyone who is 
      concerned with cultural stability and balance should know and I offer them 
      to you in the hope that you will find them useful in thinking about the 
      effects of technology on religious faith. 
      </p><p><b>First Idea</b> 
      </p><p>The first idea is that all technological change is a trade-off. I like 
      to call it a Faustian bargain. Technology giveth and technology taketh 
      away. This means that for every advantage a new technology offers, there 
      is always a corresponding disadvantage. The disadvantage may exceed in 
      importance the advantage, or the advantage may well be worth the cost. 
      Now, this may seem to be a rather obvious idea, but you would be surprised 
      at how many people believe that new technologies are unmixed blessings. 
      You need only think of the enthusiasms with which most people approach 
      their understanding of computers. Ask anyone who knows something about 
      computers to talk about them, and you will find that they will, 
      unabashedly and relentlessly, extol the wonders of computers. You will 
      also find that in most cases they will completely neglect to mention any 
      of the liabilities of computers. This is a dangerous imbalance, since the 
      greater the wonders of a technology, the greater will be its negative 
      consequences. 
      </p><p>Think of the automobile, which for all of its obvious advantages, has 
      poisoned our air, choked our cities, and degraded the beauty of our 
      natural landscape. Or you might reflect on the paradox of medical 
      technology which brings wondrous cures but is, at the same time, a 
      demonstrable cause of certain diseases and disabilities, and has played a 
      significant role in reducing the diagnostic skills of physicians. It is 
      also well to recall that for all of the intellectual and social benefits 
      provided by the printing press, its costs were equally monumental. The 
      printing press gave the Western world prose, but it made poetry into an 
      exotic and elitist form of communication. It gave us inductive science, 
      but it reduced religious sensibility to a form of fanciful superstition. 
      Printing gave us the modern conception of nationhood, but in so doing 
      turned patriotism into a sordid if not lethal emotion. We might even say 
      that the printing of the Bible in vernacular languages introduced the 
      impression that God was an Englishman or a German or a Frenchman--that is 
      to say, printing reduced God to the dimensions of a local potentate. 
      </p><p>Perhaps the best way I can express this idea is to say that the 
      question, "What will a new technology do?" is no more important than the 
      question, "What will a new technology undo?" Indeed, the latter question 
      is more important, precisely because it is asked so infrequently. One 
      might say, then, that a sophisticated perspective on technological change 
      includes one's being skeptical of Utopian and Messianic visions drawn by 
      those who have no sense of history or of the precarious balances on which 
      culture depends. In fact, if it were up to me, I would forbid anyone from 
      talking about the new information technologies unless the person can 
      demonstrate that he or she knows something about the social and psychic 
      effects of the alphabet, the mechanical clock, the printing press, and 
      telegraphy. In other words, knows something about the costs of great 
      technologies. 
      </p><p>Idea Number One, then, is that culture always pays a price for 
      technology. 
      </p><p><b>Second Idea</b> 
      </p><p>This leads to the second idea, which is that the advantages and 
      disadvantages of new technologies are never distributed evenly among the 
      population. This means that every new technology benefits some and harms 
      others. There are even some who are not affected at all. Consider again 
      the case of the printing press in the 16th century, of which Martin Luther 
      said it was "God's highest and extremest act of grace, whereby the 
      business of the gospel is driven forward." By placing the word of God on 
      every Christian's kitchen table, the mass-produced book undermined the 
      authority of the church hierarchy, and hastened the breakup of the Holy 
      Roman See. The Protestants of that time cheered this development. The 
      Catholics were enraged and distraught. Since I am a Jew, had I lived at 
      that time, I probably wouldn't have given a damn one way or another, since 
      it would make no difference whether a pogrom was inspired by Martin Luther 
      or Pope Leo X. Some gain, some lose, a few remain as they were. 
      </p><p>Let us take as another example, television, although here I should add 
      at once that in the case of television there are very few indeed who are 
      not affected in one way or another. In America, where television has taken 
      hold more deeply than anywhere else, there are many people who find it a 
      blessing, not least those who have achieved high-paying, gratifying 
      careers in television as executives, technicians, directors, newscasters 
      and entertainers. On the other hand, and in the long run, television may 
      bring an end to the careers of school teachers since school was an 
      invention of the printing press and must stand or fall on the issue of how 
      much importance the printed word will have in the future. There is no 
      chance, of course, that television will go away but school teachers who 
      are enthusiastic about its presence always call to my mind an image of 
      some turn-of-the-century blacksmith who not only is singing the praises of 
      the automobile but who also believes that his business will be enhanced by 
      it. We know now that his business was not enhanced by it; it was rendered 
      obsolete by it, as perhaps an intelligent blacksmith would have known. 
      </p><p>The questions, then, that are never far from the mind of a person who 
      is knowledgeable about technological change are these: Who specifically 
      benefits from the development of a new technology? Which groups, what type 
      of person, what kind of industry will be favored? And, of course, which 
      groups of people will thereby be harmed? 
      </p><p>These questions should certainly be on our minds when we think about 
      computer technology. There is no doubt that the computer has been and will 
      continue to be advantageous to large-scale organizations like the military 
      or airline companies or banks or tax collecting institutions. And it is 
      equally clear that the computer is now indispensable to high-level </p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-td-block-uid="tdi_28_53a">

<div>
<p>It’s often said that you can tell a lot about a person by observing their living space. In a similar vein, I believe we can glean a lot about society by observing our own minds – where we store the individual thoughts, beliefs and values that form society’s collective structures. Unsurprisingly our headspace is often a product of our mind’s state, sitting somewhere along a spectrum of fulfilment to boredom at any one time. In this article I want to focus more on the latter, more specifically, how boredom as a pervasive state of mind has shaped our consumption habits. What we feed our minds for entertainment and why.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before I get into that though we have to clarify the relationship between boredom and consumption, or rather dispel a popular myth. Boredom isn’t resolved by quick, easy stimulation of the mind, instead boredom feeds off of it to grow even larger. You can think of it as drinking alcohol to quench thirst, in the immediate term you will feel hydrated only to realise it will leave you even more parched than before. Now that we’ve acknowledged this, bear in mind that today’s pace of life and technology has ensured that we do exactly that. Boredom is met with quick stimulus leaving an even larger craving in its wake, only to be met by quicker and easier stimulation, and so goes the cycle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today’s entertainment economy has adjusted to this fundamental transformation in our consumption habits – I call it a transformation because it has happened slowly but surely over several decades. And while the link isn’t obvious yet, it’s a large part of the reason you’ve been walking out of cinemas thinking “is it just me or were movies better a few years ago”. While I can’t surely say movies were better a few years ago, why, in an increasingly creative, technologically advanced society would viewers be left feeling this way post a movie experience?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The explanation for this lies in, you guessed it, boredom. Also to an extent, discovery and recommender systems but we won’t get into that now. To solve for boredom at scale, we have to appeal to the lowest threshold for stimulation. This objective to appeal to the lowest common denominator for stimulation quickly becomes a defining factor of our consumption habits. When Youtube launched in 2006 later to be acquired by Google, it signalled the start of a shift in consumable entertainment. User-generated entertainment was never before a comparable form of media for the masses. People didn’t watch vlogs and live streams while they ate dinner, they watched old school Tv shows and movies. But Youtube was successful because it was one of the first to address the quantity of entertainment required to “quench” boredom at scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Youtube and subsequent platforms like TikTok are naturally able to provide the lowest common denominator across the board – “there is something for everyone” – with the sheer quantity and diversity of user generated content (UGC) on these platforms. Hollywood movies though, don’t work on the function of quantity. Rather they work on high-quality production and creative output. Hollywood had to address the challenge of vying for eyeball time in an increasingly saturated ‘boredom market’. To do this, Hollywood had to begin considering what platforms like Youtube were doing, providing a quick dopamine hit whilst servicing the lowest common denominators that would attract the most people. Hollywood’s take on this has manifested into today’s mainstream film industry. This takes the form of ‘PG’ movies appealing to younger, broader audiences, through to the one-liners in marvel movies that seem to hit just right.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One other clear example of this is the influx of reboots over the last few years. Here, nostalgia is the common denominator these movies are targeting instead of focusing on the creation of new content. <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens </em>is probably a good example of this, basically a play by play of <em>A New Hope</em> – the first movie in the Star Wars franchise to release in the 1970s.</p>



<h3>How Quibi failed to read the room</h3>



<p>Quibi, Hollywood’s poster child for short-form video content, has been created for a mobile-only audience. It claims it competes with “free” forms of video like Youtube and TikTok that target viewers with time and attention constraints. This offering rests upon the assumption that viewers on current UGC platforms would prefer higher quality production.</p>



<p>If I Imagine the pitch-room for Quibi seed round investment – the pitch would have gone something like this. “We’re time poor/attention-deficit and addicted to the drip-drip release of dopamine that our smart-phones deliver unto us. As our consumption patterns arc away from the past – we are ever in search of easier to consume, easier to enjoy doses that slot into the (apparently) smaller spaces of discretionary time in our lives or minds – Youtube/TikTok have shown how hungry the people are for these short bursts of escape – but user-generated content can’t fill that gap at the scale and quality we can”</p>



<p>What QuiBi failed to understand is that the transformation in our consumption pattern wasn’t about short-form content with high-quality production but about fulfilling the need for stimulus created by boredom. In actual fact, our consumption patterns had fragmented into two formats. The first is “Hollywood” style productions, high-quality story driven content that requires greater cognitive participation (immersion). The second is lower quality production or user-generated content that we equate with easy, effortless consumption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anecdotally, you can abandon a YouTube video halfway and not feel dissatisfied for having wasted five minutes on it – a perk of non-immersive content. Comparatively, it would be difficult to abandon the type of high production content found on Quibi – where you’ve already committed to participating cognitively and are anticipating immersion – without feeling a little cheated of time and effort.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Immersion requires the cognitive expense of dedicating a set amount of time and a certain mindset to consume that content. This cognitive expense is at odds with the youtube or TikTok model, where spontaneous discovery and consumption also equate to spontaneous abandonment of that content without dissatisfaction. If Quibi wanted to replicate the spontaneous discovery and consumption, their focus should have been on scaling quantity that allows for spontaneity rather than spending 100,000 USD per minute of video. Imagine if there were 80,000 or 800,000 pieces of content rather than 8,000?&nbsp;</p>



<p>So then the absurdity of the following statement is apparent:</p>



<p>“We’re competing against free,” Jeffrey Katzenberg says referring to the likes of youtube and social media platforms like TikTok. “We have to offer something that is meaningfully, measurably, quantifiably, creatively different. They don’t know how to do what we do, with all due respect,…”</p>



<h3>Hollywood: Where tried and tested formulas often outweigh the cost of creative risks</h3>



<p>The lowest common denominator is easier to identify on YouTube where stimulus is dictated and served by ‘market’ forces, basically the consumption demands of users. On the other hand, Hollywood relies more heavily on a commercial push strategy informed by the smaller sample set of feedback available in audience scores. The cost of identifying the nature of demand is significantly larger in the latter compared to the throwaway cost of a YouTube production. Producers can easily move from one youtube video to the next without losing an arm and a leg.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The high cost of production in Hollywood doesn’t afford the same luxury, the same applies for Quibi’s production value. This then exacerbates a reliance on more obviously popular tropes, reboots are an easy out given that the particular world, plot or characters are already loved by audiences. This pushes production towards tried and tested formulas which are replicated year on year, where funny one-liners from marvel movies are a hallmark of Hollywood production now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Where optionality was limited in the 90s, early 2000s or any time before to the TV and Cinema, taking punts on new formats, stories or original productions seemed a less risky endeavour. In today’s world, there is far too much optionality and much slimmer margin for error.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>I know, I know, at this point you want "Just Ship It" to be an actual person so you could punch it in the face. As an Indie Maker, that sentence can be super frustrating because it's tired, it's cliche, and your response is always "HEY! You don't understand... it's not that easy".  </p>&nbsp;<p>I agree, it's not easy, but it's always the right thing to do. </p>&nbsp;<p>Here's why.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I started building an app on 01.01.2018. It was New Year's Eve and we just had the crappiest night ever. Yes, imagine a night <em>so bad</em> that at midnight you decide "you know what, fuck it, I'm gonna work on WEB DEVELOPMENT".<br>That bad.  </p>&nbsp;<p>The MVP was ready in a few days. I'm not that good of a coder, it's just a simple app. The 0.0.1 alpha version was more than ready. I could've released it, share it with a couple of people, and call it a day. I could've done that with every single version that I made, at any point from 2018 until now. I just wanted to add one more thing. One more feature. Just this one more thing and people will like it. One more screen and everything is gonna make sense. I swear, just this one last thing and it's ready.  </p>&nbsp;<p>BAM, last moment decision from the world's biggest dumbass:
"People wouldn't use this if it doesn't have a proper native mobile app for it. Time to learn React Native and spend a few months on that 🤦️"   </p>&nbsp;<p>God, if time machines were real, past-Kitze would be shoved in a toilet so hard right now. </p>&nbsp;<p>After 2 years of development, juggling between the fucking horror that's the web platform, React Native, Expo, GraphQL, bitching about how there's no ideal tech stack, the good old jQuery and Filezilla days, switching to other projects, releasing <a href="https://sizzy.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other apps</a>, losing passion, finding passion, coming back to the app, etc. etc. etc...  </p>&nbsp;<p>I just dropped it.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I was still using it but I stopped developing it and just dropped the idea of releasing the app, ever.</p>&nbsp;<p>After a while, I was using it, but I realized that I'm missing a lot of features, so I'd either have to go back to developing it, or I'd have to find an alternative.   </p>&nbsp;<p>And boy did I find one.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I was scrolling their landing page and I was happy and furious at the same time. Someone solved the problem that I was solving. It was like someone literally read my mind and started coding. WHAT.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I have previously sent a video of my app to a couple of people (closest I came to shipping it) so I started getting suspicious if someone actually shared the video of my app with these people because they were solving literally the same problem, and they most of the features that I had.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I started getting this overwhelming happy, sad, and panicky feeling. I literally cannot explain how I felt while scrolling their page.</p>&nbsp;<p>One moment I am scrolling their list of features giggling like a little kid with a 48$ bill in a candy store (yea I know 48$ bills don't make sense, but JavaScript doesn't make sense and you're still using it), one moment I want to find these people and THROW THEM IN A PIT OF LIONS.   </p>&nbsp;<p>FUCK.    </p>&nbsp;<p>It's not their fault. I was just slow. I didn't ship on time. I'm gonna go ahead and tattoo "JUST SHIP IT" on my forehead. Nah I wouldn't be able to see it there. On my arm maybe. Nvm, let me go back to scrolling their landing page.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Fuck. They have solved everything that I wanted to solve, and WAY more. Hey, maybe I should be happy? I don't have to code anymore. Yay!? No more web platform? BLISS. Oh crap... the world is never gonna see my app though. But at least I don't have to see React Native anymore. NICE! Wait... BUT I WASTED SO MUCH TIME ON IT. FUCK.  A bunch of mixed feelings.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Here comes the saddest part, so grab a pack of tissues.   </p>&nbsp;<p>After a little bit of hesitation, I made an account. I watched the videos in their help center. Every time I caught myself smiling about a clever way they implemented something I slapped myself. NO. Bad Kitze. You shouldn't like this. THEY'RE COMPETITORS. <em>sigh</em> Sure buddy, whatever you tell yourself. Competitors to a shitty codebase sitting on your hard drive.  </p>&nbsp;<p>For 2 frickin' years, I thought it's too early to release my app because it's clunky, buggy, it's missing features, blah, blah, blah. No one would ever use it, right? I was so wrong.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I started using their app.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Even though they were working on it for the past few years it's still slow, buggy, and super unpolished, it doesn't matter, because they shipped.   </p>&nbsp;<p>Their mobile app is terrible and it needs 10 seconds to sync. It doesn't matter, they shipped. And I'm looking forward to every single update they release.</p>&nbsp;<p>Their backlog of things to do is huge, but it doesn't matter, they ship every single week, and the app is growing along with the community.  </p>&nbsp;<p>"But Kitze, even though tHeY sHiPpEd no one would pay for something unpolished and broken, right?"  </p>&nbsp;<p>Oh, Indie Hackers. So clever, yet so naive.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Today my 30-day trial has expired. A tear rolled down my cheek for every single digit of my credit card that I entered in their app. I am officially not only a subscriber, but also a fan. Every time I'll get a payment notification it's gonna feel like stepping on a lego ... glued to a knife. My bank might as well change the notification from "You have paid 5$ to ThatCompany" to "You never shipped, loser".   </p>&nbsp;<p>My app is officially dead.  </p>&nbsp;<p>99% of you are in the same boat right now, but hopefully just a few weeks into your project. Don't be a dumbass like me. Take a breath, roll your eyes at the cliche saying, but please...  </p>&nbsp;<p>Just Ship It.  </p>&nbsp;<p>P.S I would totally release and show you my app but ... it's not ready yet.  </p>&nbsp;<hr><p>Thanks for reading this! I wrote another article about <a href="https://kitze.io/posts/github-stars-wont-pay-your-rent" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my successful shipping story</a>, so I'd appreciate if you give it a read!</p>&nbsp;</div></div></div></div>]]>

This pop-up was appearing on all pages, even on pages with no audio or video. To find out, I did a bunch of source code analysis and found out.</p><p>Reddit’s source code uses bundling and minification, but I was able to infer that in <code>./src/reddit/index.tsx</code>, a script was conditionally loaded into the page. If the <code>show_white_ops</code> A/B test flag was set, then it loaded another script: <a href="https://s.udkcrj.com/ag/386183/clear.js">https://s.udkcrj.com/ag/386183/clear.js</a>. That script loads <a href="https://s.udkcrj.com/2/4.71.0/main.js">https://s.udkcrj.com/2/4.71.0/main.js</a> (although it appears to test for a browser bug involving running JSON.parse with null bytes, and sometimes loads <a href="https://s.udkcrj.com/2/4.71.0/JSON-main.js">https://s.udkcrj.com/2/4.71.0/JSON-main.js</a> instead, but I haven’t analyzed this file (it looks fairly similar though), and also does nothing if due to <em>another</em> browser bug, <code>!("a" == "a"[0])</code> evaluates to true).</p><p>The purpose of all of this appears to be both fingerprinting and preventing ad fraud. I’ve determined that <code>udkcrj.com</code> belongs to <a href="https://www.whiteops.com/">White Ops</a>. I have infered this from the name of Reddit’s feature flag, and mentions of White Ops which is a “global leader in bot mitigation, bot prevention, and fraud protection”. They appear to do this by collecting <strong>tons</strong> of data about the browser, and analyzing it. I must say, their system is quite impressive.</p><p>Back to the DRM issue, it appears that the script is checking what DRM solutions are available, but not actually using them.

      <p>A few years ago I wrote <a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20170810"><em>The World in Which IPv6 was a Good
Design</em></a>. I’m still
pretty proud of that article, but I thought I should update it a bit.</p>
<p>No, I’m not switching sides. IPv6 is just as far away from universal
adoption, or being a “good design” for our world, as it was three
years ago. But since then I co-founded a company that turned out to be
accidentally based on the principles I outlined in that article. Or
rather, from turning those principles upside-down.</p>
<p>In that article, I explored the overall history of networking and the
considerations that led to IPv6. I’m not going to cover that ground
again. Instead, I want to talk about attitude.</p>
<h3 id="internets-interoperability-and-postels-law">Internets, Interoperability, and Postel’s Law</h3>
<p>Did you ever wonder why “Internet” is capitalized?</p>
<p>When I first joined the Internet in the 1990s, I found some
now-long-lost introductory tutorial. It talked about the difference
between an internet (lowercase i) and the Internet (capital I). An
internet is “any network that connects smaller networks together.” The
Internet is… well… it turns out that you don’t need more than one
internet. If you have two internets, it is nearly unavoidable that
someone will soon figure out how to connect them together. All you need
is one person to build that one link, and your two internets become one.
By induction then, the Internet is the end result when you make it easy
enough for a single motivated individual to join one internet to
another, however badly.</p>
<p>Internets are fundamentally sloppy. No matter how many committees you
might form, ultimately connections are made by individuals plugging
things together. Those things might follow the specs, or not. They might
follow those specs well, or badly. They might violate the specs because
everybody else is also violating the specs and that’s the only way to
make anything work. The connections themselves might be fast or slow, or
flakey, or only functional for a few minutes each day, or subject to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMPRNet">amateur radio regulations</a>, or
worse. The endpoints might be high-powered servers, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/industries/little-known-story-first-iot-device/">vending machines</a>,
toasters, or satellites, running any imaginable operating system. Only
one thing’s for sure: they all have bugs.</p>
<p>Which brings us to Postel’s Law, which I always bring up when I write
about networks. When I do, invariably there’s a slew of responses
trying to debate whether Postel’s Law is “right,” or “a good idea,”
as if it were just an idea and not a force of nature.</p>
<p>Postel’s Law says simply this: be conservative in what you send, and
liberal in what you accept. Try your best to correctly handle the bugs
produced by the other end. The most successful network node is one that
plans for every “impossible” corruption there might be in the input
and does something sensible when it happens. (Sometimes, yes,
“something sensible” is to throw an error.)</p>
<p>[Side note: Postel’s Law doesn’t apply in every situation. You
probably don’t want your compiler to auto-fix your syntax errors,
unless your compiler is javascript or HTML, which, kidding aside,
actually were designed to do this sort of auto-correction for Postel’s
Law reasons. But the law does apply in virtually every complex situation
where you need to communicate effectively, including human
conversations. The way I like to say it is, “It takes two to
miscommunicate.” A great listener, <em>or</em> a skilled speaker, can resolve
a lot of conflicts.]</p>
<p>Postel’s Law is the principle the Internet is based on. Not because Jon
Postel was such a great salesperson and talked everyone into it, but
because that is the only winning evolutionary strategy when internets
are competing. Nature doesn’t care what you think about Postel’s Law,
because the only Internet that happens will be the one that follows
Postel’s Law. Every other internet will, without exception, eventually
be joined to The Internet by some goofball who does it wrong, but just
well enough that it adds value, so that eventually nobody will be
willing to break the connection. And then to maintain that connection
will require further application of Postel’s Law.</p>
<h3 id="ipv6-a-different-attitude">IPv6: a different attitude</h3>
<p>If you’ve followed my writing, you might have seen me refer to IPv6 as
“a second internet that not everyone is connected to.” There’s a lot
wrapped up in that claim. Let’s back up a bit.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20170810"><em>The World in Which IPv6 was a Good Design</em></a>,
I talked about the lofty design goals leading to IPv6: eliminate bus networks,
get rid of MAC addresses, no more switches and hubs, no NATs, and so on.
What I didn’t realize at the time, which I now think is essential, is that
these goals were a <em>fundamental attitude shift</em> compared to what went
into IPv4 (and the earlier protocols that led to v4).</p>
<p>IPv4 evolved as a pragmatic way to build <em>an internet</em> out of a bunch of
networks and machines that existed already. Postel’s Law says you’d
best deal with reality as it is, not as you wish it were, and so they
did. When something didn’t connect, someone hacked on it until it
worked. Sloppy. Fits and starts, twine and duct tape. But most
importantly, nobody really thought this whole mess would work as well as
it turned out to work, or last as long as it turned out to last. Nobody
knew, at the time, that whenever you start building internets, they
always lead inexorably to The Internet.</p>
<p>These (mostly) same people, when they started to realize the monster
they had created, got worried. They realized that 32-bit addresses,
which they had originally thought would easily last for the lifetime of
their little internet, were not even enough for one address per person
in the world. They found out, not really to anyone’s surprise, that
Postel’s Law, unyielding as it may be, is absolutely a maintenance
nightmare. They thought they’d better hurry up and fix it all, before
this very popular Internet they had created, which had become a
valuable, global, essential service, suddenly came crashing down and it
would all be their fault.</p>
<p>[Spoiler: it never did come crashing down. Well, not permanently. There
were and are still short-lived flare-ups every now and then, but a few
dedicated souls hack it back together, and so it goes.]</p>
<p>IPv6 was created in a new environment of fear, scalability concerns, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect">Second System
Effect</a>.
As we covered last time, its goal was to replace The Internet with a New
Internet — one that wouldn’t make all the same mistakes. It would have
fewer hacks. And we’d upgrade to it incrementally over a few years,
just as we did when upgrading to newer versions of IP and TCP back in
the old days.</p>
<p>We can hardly blame people for believing this would work. Even the term
“Second System Effect” was only about 20 years old at the time, and
not universally known. Every previous Internet upgrade had gone fine.
Nobody had built such a big internet before, with so much Postel’s Law,
with such a variety of users, vendors, and systems, so nobody knew it
would be different.</p>
<p>Well, here we are 25 years later, and not much has changed. If we were
feeling snarky, we could perhaps describe IPv6 as “the String Theory of
networking”: a decades-long boondoggle that attracts True Believers,
gets you flamed intensely if you question the doctrine, and which is
notable mainly for how much progress it has held back.</p>
<p>Luckily we are not feeling snarky.</p>
<h3 id="two-internets">Two Internets?</h3>
<p>There are, of course, still no exceptions to the rule that if you build
any internet, it will inevitably (and usually quickly) become connected
to The Internet.</p>
<p>I wasn’t sitting there when it happened, but it’s likely the very
first IPv6 node ran on a machine that was also connected to IPv4, if
only so someone could telnet to it for debugging. Today, even “pure
IPv6” nodes are almost certainly connected to a network that, if
configured correctly, can find a way to any IPv4 node, and vice versa.
It might not be pretty, it might involve a lot of proxies, NATs,
bridges, and firewalls. But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Gently">it’s all
connected</a>.</p>
<p>In that sense, there is still just one Internet. It’s the big one.
Since day 1, The Internet has never spoken just one protocol; it has
always been a hairy mess of routers, bridges, and gateways, running many
protocols at many layers. IPv6 is one of them.</p>
<p>What makes IPv6 special is that its proponents are not content for it to
be <em>an internet</em> that connects to The Internet. No! It’s the chosen
one. Its destiny is to be The Internet. As a result, we don’t <em>only</em>
have bridges and gateways to join the IPv6 internets and the IPv4
internet (although we do).</p>
<p>Instead, IPv6 wants to eventually run directly on every node. End users
have been, uh, <em>rather unwilling</em> to give up IPv4, so for now, every
node has that too. As a result, machines are often joined directly to
what I call “two competing internets” — the IPv4 one and the IPv6
one.</p>
<p>Okay, at this point our terminology has become very confusing. Sorry.
But all this leads to the question I know you want me to answer: Which
internet is better!?</p>
<h3 id="combinatorics">Combinatorics</h3>
<p>I’ll get to that, but first we need to revisit what I bravely called
<a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20170704">Avery’s Laws of Wifi Reliability</a>, which are
not laws, were surely invented by someone else (since they’re mostly a
paraphrasing of a trivial subset of CAP theorem), and as it turns out,
apply to more than just wifi. Oops. I guess the name is wrong in almost
every possible way. Still, they’re pretty good guidelines.</p>
<p>Let’s refresh:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rule #1: if you have two wifi router brands that work with 90% of client
devices, and your device has a problem with one of them, replacing the wifi
router brand will fix the problem 90% of the time. Thus, an ISP offering both
wifi routers has a [1 - (10% x 10%)] = 99% chance of eventual success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rule #2: if you’re running two wifi routers at once (say, a primary router and
an extender), and both of them work “correctly” for about 90% of the time each
day, the chance that your network has no problems all day is 81%.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In Rule #1, which I call “a OR b”, success compounds and failure
rates drop.</p>
<p>In Rule #2, which I call “a AND b”, failure compounds and success
drops.</p>
<p>But wait, didn’t we add redundancy in both cases?</p>
<p>Depending …</p></div></div>

<p>I see Tailwind being used by a lot of people. I totally get why it’s so popular. It looks great, the design choices are sensible, and you have copy-pastable code that reliably renders in the same way.</p>



<p>It nets you results quickly which feels nice and rewarding. I think Tailwind is a perfect framework for two kinds of situations:</p>



<ol><li> people who don’t want to learn CSS</li><li>people who want a standardized look and want to copy paste from an external library (i.e. Tailwind UI)</li></ol>



<p>I mostly wanted to shut up about Tailwind, and I hoped that people would realize it should be avoided after a while. But that doesn’t seem to be happening. So I think I have to fight the fight and talk about why you should not use Tailwind.</p>



<p>I have had a lot of thoughts about Tailwind, and most of these thoughts come from a place of being the code maintainer of a large scale web application codebase. So mind you, when I am talking about regret in the title, I am talking about a <strong>big web app context</strong> where your code is <strong>going to be maintained for years to come</strong>.</p>



<p>I am not talking about your Sunday side project. I am talking about real, big work® projects here. I am talking about maintaining something that has a lot of complexity that many people will work on for years to come.</p>



<p>You might be tasked with choosing a CSS architecture for that. And you might have heard about this framework called Tailwind. It’s popular right now and it seems to be the 2020 choice.</p>



<p>You look at the website and you see this nice framework that promises you that things are going to be cool in Tailwind land. And you might be thinking: cool, let’s try that.</p>



<p>I urge you to reconsider your options. I would advise you <strong>to not use it.</strong></p>



<p>I really don’t know why Tailwind got so popular over the last year. I think it’s because it does a <strong>lot</strong> of things right. Surely if the authors can make $1.8M in preorders for Tailwind UI, something must be up. But at a fundamental level, I think its ideas are wrong and lead to problems, and I am going to explain why.</p>



<p>The main problem is that the kind of code you are creating with Tailwind, especially on large scale applications, is the kind of code that you’re going to have to swap out in a few years. Why? Because it’s unmaintainable at best. I will explain below.</p>



<h3>An API on top of an API</h3>



<p>Tailwind is a framework that heavily relies on utility classes. Utility classes are classes that typically do one single thing e.g. <code>.flex</code> makes a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> have <code>display: flex</code>. Utility classes create an API on top of what is already a declarative API (CSS itself).</p>



<p>This can lead to problems when</p>



<ol><li>the original API (CSS itself) might change in the process, so now you have a mapping problem</li><li>the mapping itself is not that great, and has bugs on its own</li></ol>



<p>To dive into situation 1, let’s think about how maybe CSS grid will have an evolution in its syntax. Now you don’t just have to update your code, but also the in-between framework (Tailwind).</p>



<p>To dive into an example of situation 2: I was on a project a while ago where somebody mapped Flexbox to utility classes <em>wrongly </em>(i.e. the mapping contained obvious mistakes) and that code had made into production, was versioned, and we couldn’t change it. I thought that was very painful.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Tailwind’s coding style creates its own problems, which you then have to solve</h3>



<p>There’s also a deeper problem: because you are essentially recreating the CSS API with utility classes, you end up with a huge file. The current Tailwind utilities.css file is 1.8 megabyte and contains 80 000 lines of code.</p>



<p>Tailwind proponents will tell you that you can remove unused CSS with Tailwind’s tooling. And this is exactly the problem that I want to talk about: now you have to solve a problem that’s inherent to the framework, adding complexity to your project.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://routify.dev/">Routify</a> and Svelte Discord channels I routinely see people struggling to get the toolchain around Tailwind working. So many people struggling with a toolchain that is totally unnecessary is a real problem. Removing code that shouldn’t be there in the first place should not be necessary.</p>



<h3>Sidenote: I’m not against utility classes</h3>



<p>Surely it feels nice to be able to quickly write flexbox things in a declarative way, and it has it’s uses. I’ve happily wrote declarative flexbox code in the past to quickly set up layouts. I am not against utility classes at all. It’s quite handy to set up layouts quickly with utility classes. I can also totally relate to the idea of designing in the browser with a set of utility classes.</p>



<p>When I do web app layouts we typically have a lot of different panes and panels going on in your app with varied logic about how they should resize. In a prototyping or an early app phase it’s super handy to not have to write a specific (BEM) component for everything and just build things out with utility classes.</p>



<p>But you have to be careful with utility classes. Because what you’re essentially doing is building a complication on top of CSS itself.</p>



<p>When you use a utility classes, for example declaring a flex utility on a div, you are doing it in HTML instead of declaring it in CSS this can quickly lead to unmaintainable code.</p>



<p>I use utility classes in one-off situations. Tailwind style code uses utility classes for <strong>everything</strong>. Tailwind lovers will now come back to me with arguments about <code>@apply</code> but this is just throwing more complexity on something that is already complex.</p>



<h3><strong>Adding complexity to complexity</strong></h3>



<p>Tailwind’s HTML code is fine for very simple projects (which will now have the drag of a whole toolchain to purge unused selectors but OK).</p>



<p>But let’s just imagine you have a bit of a bigger project, with a basic app layout that is working, with a few panels and a few buttons.</p>



<p>You now have to update the code for the next requirement – a bit of responsiveness. The UI has to change according to a breakpoint. So you add some Tailwind breakpoint classes to the thing you are making.</p>



<p>You realize your specific situation requires a very specific breakpoint. So you change your Tailwind config to add this breakpoint. You kind of realize it would be easier to just write the breakpoint directly in CSS, but you want to do things the Tailwind way.</p>



<p>If you would do things the regular CSS way, your media queries list basically lives in two worlds: the tailwind config and a local CSS file. And now you’ve lost your breakpoint structure. So you have to adhere to the Tailwind style.</p>



<p>And then let’s say you have a new situation: dark mode has to be supported. So suddenly your colors all have to change according to the dark mode logic. So now you add a bunch of classes to whatever you are creating again… you look at your button code and you see that the color of the button is directly in the HTML (<code>gray-100</code>). And the opposed color is actually called <code>gray-900</code> in your design system. So now you add a class to the button for the dark situations. And you now realize that there are 7 variants of your button in your codebase and they all have different class combinations.</p>



<p>Now, with the previous responsive example, and this dark thing piled on top of it, you have a sorry mess.</p>



<p>And then you realize that some aspects of what you’re doing would be way easier to handle directly in (S)CSS, using contextual media queries and proper use of the cascade.</p>



<p>Maybe your web app is never going to see the complexity I am talking about. Maybe your apps are not responsive or they don’t support dark mode. But most of my work supports some form of skinnability, is as responsive as possible and needs to be maintained over several yerars.</p>



<p>Putting values on the same class level in HTML is basically destroying the cascade for you. So don’t do it.</p>



<h3><strong>Complexity overload and no proper way to manage it</strong></h3>



<p>The problem with Tailwind is that you end up with an overload of classes in your HTML and no way to manage these.</p>



<p>Tailwind’s creator says it’s not a problem because your code can essentially lives in deep presentational components and it can be abstracted away. But this kind of coding strategy leads to its own problems (e.g. prop drilling)</p>



<p>I’m especially wary of this situation where you have one button that has 6 HTML classes, and then another button that has 5 HTML classes, and another one that has 7 HTML classes. And they’re all different combinations. Now you have to do some serious digging through the codebase to try and bring everything in line, and you’re going to be comparing which of the three buttons have class overlap. Nobody is waiting for that task. And frankly, it’s probably just nog going to happen.</p>



<p>It’s code rot that’s going to happen as soon as you have a few people working on a project with moderate complexity.</p>



<h3>I fear for a Tailwind future</h3>



<p>I already see Tailwind popping up all the time in Javascript articles that have nothing to do with CSS. The authors use it because it’s a quick way to style their tutorial. In the process they’re halving the shelf life of whatever they’re writing, and dirtying up their examples with a boatload of HTML classes.</p>



<p>I fear for the general codebases of web apps when too many people decide that Tailwind is the way to go. Now, on the other hand, this means I’ll have an infinite stream of work to refactor bad codebases to better ones. So I guess I’m not complaining.</p>



<p>Just do yourself a favor and stop using Tailwind.</p>

<p>Historically, US Presidents have entered the White House at a <a href="https://t.co/v8DD3uCI85?amp=1">median age of 55</a>. </p>



<p>Trump was the oldest ever to become president. If he is re-elected and serves a full second term, he would become the oldest sitting president of all-time (surpassing Reagan in his second term). If Biden is elected, he would become the oldest sitting president of all-time too, on his first day. </p>



<p>We are going the wrong way.</p>



<p>Bernie and Bloomberg were even older than Biden. Warren would have been older than Trump upon election. Of the 7 candidates who won at least 1 delegate in the Democratic Primary, 4 were in their 70s, 1 was in her 60s, and 2 were in their 30s. Isn’t it odd that none of them were in their 40s or 50s? It seems that the ages of our presidential candidate’s are becoming as polarized as their politics. There is no one in the middle! I want a middle candidate for president in terms of both age and politics.</p>



<p>In terms of approximating an appropriate age, 40s and 50s seem like a reasonable range. Cognitive function is certainly not all that makes a good president but it would seem to be a significant factor. According to a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614567339?casa_token=L29u1CmuY6gAAAAA%3AHwbJVxHMdjeQxoe1A1UcjnE-sTEy1YhbSyhlQic62On1RpUMpAd0JKWh7H2IvB3tj5dmN8nw2g4x&amp;journalCode=pssa">study </a>in Psychological Science, it does not look like anything good happens after 55. Of course, there is something to be said for growing wiser with age and other good arguments of that nature which are totally valid. I should clarify that when I say that nothing good happens after 55, I am stricly speaking in scientific terms of cognitive function for the average person. No offense to my elders (and sorry for calling you elders).</p>

<p>There are other studies that suggest the best age for decision-making and leadership tends to be during a person’s 50s. Of course, there are many exceptions. This is not an exact science applicable to every person by any means. Still, it seems like reasonable enough support to justify a solid range in which being too young or too old should almost never be an issue.</p>



<p>Politics completely aside, the age range of recent candidates like Yang (45), O’Rourke (47), Cruz (49), Rubio (49), Booker (51), and Harris (55) seems to be an appropriate one. They are all between 45 and 55 which presents an even narrower ranger than what I previously defined as 40s and 50s. Again, I am not saying that this is a range that our president needs to be within by any means, but it seem like a good age range to be within nonetheless. I may have issues with any or all of these candidates listed above but in no case are any of my top concerns in any way related to their ages. Same goes for Kanye (43).</p>



<p>It is helpful also to think about the best leaders our world has to offer outside of politics. I think it is safe to assume that the most successful companies tend to have some of the most successful CEOs.</p>



<p>Here are the ages of the CEOs of the 7 largest companies in the world:</p>



<ul><li>Microsoft’s Satya Nadella (52) </li><li>Apple’s Tim Cook (59) </li><li>Amazon’s Jeff Bezos (56) </li><li>Alphabet’s Sundar Pichai (47) </li><li>Alibaba’s Daniel Zhang  (48) </li><li>Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg (36) </li><li>Tencent’s Ma Huateng (48) </li></ul>



<p>The median age of those world-leading CEOs is 48 and the average is 50. Let us add Elon Musk into the mix for good measure. The man who is revolutionizing the auto industry and sending Americans to space is 48. Coincidentally, I would argue the president should be leading bothing of those efforts.</p>



<p>The point I am making is that we should not be debating the mental fitness of our candidates based on age. That does not mean that I would never vote for someone in their 70s. I just wish I had an electable option not to. Candidates in their early 30s and late 60s generally seem a bit young and old to me for the role of president, respectively, but I would certainly vote for the right candidate at 35 or 65, and even someone in their 80s if that individual candidate seemed great to me. I do not want to be written off as an ageist for having written this and if that is not a term yet I am sure that it will be soon. Just because I would generally want my football team’s quarterback to be in his 20s or early 30s doesn’t mean I would not prefer Tom Brady in his 40’s to most of the other quarterbacks in the league. It seems to me that 40s and 50s are good years of age to be had by the person in the most powerful position in the world, The President of the United States of America. </p>

            <p>PARIS -- 
	Potentially fatal COVID-19 complications in the brain including delirium, nerve damage and stroke may be more common than initially thought, a team of British-based doctors warned Wednesday.</p>
<p>
	Severe COVID-19 infections are known to put patients at risk of neurological complications, but <a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/doi/10.1093/brain/awaa240/5868408" target="_blank">research led by University College London</a> suggests serious problems can occur even in individuals with mild cases of the virus.</p>
<p>
	The team looked at the neurological symptoms of 43 patients hospitalised with either confirmed or suspected COVID-19.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong><a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/newsletters/the-covid19-brief-newsletter-signup" target="_blank">Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>
	They found 10 cases of temporary brain dysfunction, 12 cases of brain inflammation, eight strokes and eight cases of nerve damage.</p>
<p>
	Most of those patients with inflammation were diagnosed with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) -- a rare condition typically seen in children after viral infections.</p>
<p>
	"We identified a higher than expected number of people with neurological conditions such as&nbsp;brain inflammation, which did not always correlate with the severity of respiratory symptoms," said Michael Zandi, of UCL's Queen Square Institute of Neurology and University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.</p>
<p>
	The research, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/doi/10.1093/brain/awaa240/5868408" target="_blank">published in the journal Brain</a>, showed that none of patients diagnosed with neurological problems had COVID-19 in their cerebrospinal fluid, suggesting that the virus did not directly attack their brains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Perhaps crucially, the team found that ADEM diagnoses "not related to the severity of the respiratory COVID-19 disease".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	"Given that the disease has only been around for a matter of months, we might not yet know what long-term damage COVID-19 can cause," said Ross Paterson from UCL's Queen Square Institute of Neurology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	"Doctors need to be aware of possible neurological effects, as early diagnosis can improve patient outcomes."</p>
<p>
	With more than 11 million confirmed infections worldwide, COVID-19 is known to cause a variety of health complications in addition to lung infection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	While the results of the study suggest that brain complications could be more common among virus patients than first thought, experts said it didn't mean that brain damage cases were widespread.</p>
<p>
	"The scrutiny that the pandemic attracts means it would be very unlikely that there is a large parallel pandemic of unusual brain damage linked to COVID-19," said Anthony David, director of UCL's Institute of Mental Health.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have been bootstrapping Hellonext to make it the best customer feedback software that people would love to use. More like what Intercom has done for website chat, we want to do for customer feedback.</p><p>For the past six months, the focus is purely on growing our customer base and generate revenue by providing value to them. Our starter plans are not as expensive as our competitors, but it starts at an affordable $25 per month.</p><p>Why just $25 for a feature request tool that has iOS, Android and Chrome apps? Well, this is the price I would be willing to pay to use a product like Hellonext for making my product the best in the industry.</p><p>As of today, the money that we invest in building Hellonext comes from the money I’ve been putting aside from <a href="https://www.skcript.com/">Skcript</a> (our consulting business), which is originally where we found the need for a tool like Hellonext in the first place. And the best part, Skcirpt is a bootstrapped company that we started back in 2013. This means, we have very limited funds to invest in a product like Hellonext, very limited development time and above all, very limited ad spend to promote Hellonext as well.</p><p>Today, I sat down to clean things up a bit and arrive at a clean financial statements for <a href="https://hellonext.co/">Hellonext</a>. Here’s how it looks.</p><p>As founders, we usually tend to ignore the hidden cost that comes up here and there when you have so much love for a product. This has happened to me so many times, and it has taken a hit on the company’s revenue as well. My mistake.</p><p>Here are some of the hidden costs that goes under the radar usually:</p><ol><li>Ad hoc costs like buying a book to learn about sales and marketing for SaaS.</li><li>Making an overseas call to a customer where they talk about 45 minutes (sometimes).</li><li>The travel that you do (did? Back in 2019) when you want to interview someone face-to-face or the time when you wanted to work from a cafe.</li><li>The money that you spend in buying coffee, drinks, socializing with others, cakes, small celebrations, mouse, mousepads, and so much more like that.</li><li>Other costs if you are living in a city where the cost is on the higher side. Luckily, I live in Dubai, where the costs are still manageable.</li></ol><p>This cost alone, on a high-level was about $500 in the past six months. Crazy? Yes. Did I think it was essential for the product growth? Maybe.</p><p><strong>Learning:</strong> Try to park the idea of NOT making any impulse purchase for your product. Nothing is a magic wand that gets you more sales.</p><h2 id="the-direct-costs-of-running-a-bootstrapped-saas-in-2020">The direct costs of running a bootstrapped SaaS in 2020<a href="#the-direct-costs-of-running-a-bootstrapped-saas-in-2020">#</a></h2><p>These are the costs that I must spend to keep the product alive and kicking. The costs are calculated for one year (as a SaaS product, they are constantly going to vary depending on your scale):</p><table><thead><tr><th>Utility</th><th>Duration</th><th>Cost ($)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cloud Server Cost</td><td>12 months</td><td>$700</td></tr><tr><td>CloudSQL Cost</td><td>12 months</td><td>$500</td></tr><tr><td>Amazon SES</td><td>12 months</td><td>$300</td></tr><tr><td>Apple Developer Account</td><td>12 months</td><td>$99</td></tr><tr><td>G Suite</td><td>12 months</td><td>$144</td></tr><tr><td>Domain name</td><td>12 months</td><td>$35</td></tr><tr><td>Intercom Startup Plan</td><td>12 months</td><td>$600</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td>$2,378</td></tr></tbody></table><p>There we have it. $2,378 per year to run Hellonext as of writing this article in the midst of a pandemic in July 2020. While these are just the running costs, it does not include the other fixed costs like the cost of design, development, improvements and so much more.</p><h3 id="what-about-other-aspects-of-a-saas-product">What about other aspects of a SaaS product?<a href="#what-about-other-aspects-of-a-saas-product">#</a></h3><p>You are right. There is more to a SaaS product than what I have listed above. For example, how do we manage logs, especially when we are producing over 16.8GB of logs per week. How are we managing them and analyzing them?</p><p>It is simple. We quickly built a tool where we analyze Ruby logs from archives, to visualize and take action on any anomaly. On the other hand, we also use Sumologic to tail our logs which comfortably fits in their free plan already.</p><h2 id="so-are-we-profitable-right-now">So are we profitable right now?<a href="#so-are-we-profitable-right-now">#</a></h2><p>The simple answer is no. Our goal is to reach at least 300 paying customers who can average around $35/month/customer. This will give us enough money to improve the product even more, and to help more customers along the way.</p><p>Thankfully, we are pushing hard to keep the costs low for Hellonext, and this runs as a mantra with our team as well.</p><p>Our intention is not to cut costs, but to write the best possible code, which can run on smallest possible infrastructure to achieve maximum performance to scale the product.</p><p>Right from the beginning, our intention was not to build this exorbitant product that would make it difficult for us to support our customers if we don’t breakeven quickly. I feel that this would have pushed us to do things that are against our selling value and be a bit inhuman to our customers by seeing them as numbers.</p><p>Making decisions like these early-on, to do things that fits Hellonext for the next four months, and taking things slow is enabling us to set sail for the long haul.</p><p>Our goal with Hellonext is to be the operating system for customer feedback. This cannot be done in a day or a year. This would happen over years together. And this video inspired me a lot when building products like Hellonext.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x5nAaxIkmFE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]>

		<div>

			
<p>If you see the letters GNU in a systems design, and that system intersects with cryptography, I can almost guarantee that it will be badly designed to an alarming degree.</p>



<p>This is as <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">true of GnuPG (and PGP in general)</a> as it is of designs like the proposed <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html">GNU Name System</a> (IETF draft) and cryptographic libraries like GnuTLS and libgcrypt. In fact, I cannot recall single GNU-branded cryptography project that isn’t a roaring dumpster fire.</p>



<p>I will elaborate.</p>



<h2>Problems with the GNU Name System’s Cryptography</h2>



<h3>Asymmetric Cryptography</h3>



<p>The GNS (GNU Name System) uses an unconventional construction for zones:</p>



<blockquote><p>A zone in GNS is defined by a public/private ECDSA key pair (d,zk), where d is the private key and zk the corresponding public key. GNS employs the curve parameters of the twisted edwards representation of Curve25519 [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#RFC7748">RFC7748</a>] (a.k.a. edwards25519) with the ECDSA scheme ([<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#RFC6979">RFC6979</a>]).</p><cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-zones">GNU Name System IETF Draft, section 2</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>This is beyond weird: Going out of your way to use the edwards25519 curve from RFC 7748, but not use the Ed25519 signature algorithm, but still choosing to use deterministic ECDSA (RFC 6979).</p>



<p>(If you’re lost, I wrote about digital signature algorithms in <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/04/26/a-furrys-guide-to-digital-signature-algorithms/">a previous blog post</a>.)</p>



<p>The authors acknowledge the unconventional nature of their design choice in section 9.1 of the RFC draft:</p>



<blockquote><p>GNS uses ECDSA over Curve25519. This is an unconventional choice, as ECDSA is usually used with other curves. However, traditional ECDSA curves are problematic for a range of reasons described in the Curve25519 and EdDSA papers. <strong>Using EdDSA directly is also not possible, as a hash function is used on the private key which destroys the linearity that the GNU Name System depends upon.</strong> We are not aware of anyone suggesting that using Curve25519 instead of another common curve of similar size would lower the security of ECDSA. GNS uses 256-bit curves because that way the encoded (public) keys fit into a single DNS label, which is good for usability.</p><cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-cryptography">GNU Name System IETF Draft, section 9.1</a></cite></blockquote>



<p><s>The bold statement (my emphasis) is nonsense: In any design that uses digital signature algorithms, your system should map a private key (some opaque byte string) to a public key (some other opaque byte string) and signatures should also be opaque byte strings. The inclusion of a hash function under the hood of the signature algorithm is a moot point, especially since RFC 6979 also uses HMAC-SHA2 to generate deterministic nonces, thereby rendering their choice of RFC 6979 a contradiction of their stated goal.</s> Edit: <a href="#update-2020-07-09">see below</a>.</p>



<p>Using Ed25519 with a 32-byte private key (instead of a 64-byte private key) is also trivial. To wit: Libsodium offers <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/public-key_cryptography/public-key_signatures#key-pair-generation">crypto_sign_seed_keypair()</a> for this purpose.</p>



<p>But even worse: ECDSA is less secure and slower than EdDSA, even when you use the same curves, due to how the algorithms are implemented. The authors of the RFC do not defend this design choice beyond this hash function non sequitur.</p>

<h4 id="update-2020-07-09">(Update) “But They Need Hierarchical Keys”</h4>



<p>After I initially posted this, Redditor Steve132 informed me that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/hnlyp1/gnu_a_heuristic_for_bad_cryptography/fxdbez4/">I overlooked the reason they made this design decision</a>.</p>



<blockquote><p>Take a look at Section 6.1&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-recursion" target="_blank">https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-recursion</a></p><blockquote><p>From here, the following steps are recursively executed, in order: Extract the right-most label from the name to look up. Calculate q using the label and zk as defined in Section 4.1.</p></blockquote><p>So then if you go to section 4.1, they do h=H(&lt;address string&gt;), (r,R) is some root keypair, then they do C (a child public key), C=hR, then q=H(C).</p><p>the idea behind the calculation of q is to use the root public key to derive a child public key from ONLY the root public key, exploiting the linearity property that in elliptic curves, if bG=B, then (b+s)G=(sG+B)</p><p>This allows a third party to derive child public keys without any knowledge of the private keys for the root. This technique is also used in bitcoin’s bip32 (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0032" target="_blank">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0032</a>) for ‘unhardened’ derivation scheme.</p><cite>Part of Steve132’s correction</cite></blockquote>



<p>I fully admit, I didn’t absorb this detail in my first pass of the RFC draft. It wasn’t clearly spelled out in Section 9 (which aims to justify their cryptography decisions), and I didn’t read the other sections as carefully. This was my mistake.</p>



<p>However, even with this explanation in mind, my original point that this design choice is both unconventional and unnecessary still stands, because <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7966967?section=abstract">BIP32-Ed25519</a> already exists (albeit, it still needs <a href="https://forum.web3.foundation/t/key-recovery-attack-on-bip32-ed25519/44">a carefully designed implementation</a> to be secure against active attackers). </p>



<p>Therefore, the GNU Name System developers didn’t need to roll their own design, they could have used one that’s already seen real-world deployment instead. Why take on unnecessary risk?</p>



<p>Furthermore, trying to push through an implementation of ECDSA over edwards25519 isn’t just unnecessary and weird, it’s also probably dangerous, as Thai Duong noted:</p>

<p>Of course, all cryptography development can be said to be dangerous, but there are other problems fundamental to the GNU Name System design that makes any departure from a well-tread path very suspect.</p>



<h3>Symmetric Cryptography</h3>



<p>The GNU Name System project doesn’t stop there. It further throws <a href="https://tonyarcieri.com/all-the-crypto-code-youve-ever-written-is-probably-broken">IND-CCA2 security</a> out the window and specifies encrypting with AES and TwoFish in a cipher cascade, using Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode.</p>



<p>The authors do not even attempt to defend this decision. Typically this happens when the authors do not understand the risks involved. I sincerely doubt they’ve heard the words “adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack” in the course of their self-study.</p>



<p>(Because, y’know, attackers will surely never be able to replay UDP traffic if a runtime exception occurs because of corrupted data.)</p>



<h4>“Why Is This Bad?”</h4>



<p>Cipher cascades are usually the result of “we want to defend against a backdoored or broken cipher”. Bear in mind, the cipher itself is rarely the first part of a cryptosystem to be broken.</p>



<p>On that note, TwoFish isn’t <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/10/09/so-you-want-to-use-alternative-cipher/">the worst choice</a> of a cascade partner for AES, but I’d prefer a design that employed a different paradigm (since AES is a SPN permutation block cipher, an ARX-based stream cipher like Salsa20 or ChaCha seems reasonable).</p>



<p>AES is a boring choice, because it’s the industry standard. I’m not <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/">particularly fond of AES</a> (due to it not being fast and constant-time in pure software implementations), but if you use it in an authenticated mode (AES-GCM, AES-CCM, AES-EAX, AES-OCB3, … I dunno, Poly1305-AES? Just use an AEAD mode!), it’s fine.</p>



<p><strong>Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode is not an authenticated mode.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re publishing a cryptography design in 2020 that fails the <a href="https://moxie.org/2011/12/13/the-cryptographic-doom-principle.html">Cryptographic Doom Principle</a>, you need to go back to the drawing board.</p>



<h4>“But They Use Digital Signatures”</h4>



<p><a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2016/03/21/attack-of-week-apple-imessage/">Cough.</a></p>







<h2>Other GNU Projects</h2>



<p>If you want to learn about why GnuPG (and the PGP ecosystem in general) is terrible, I recommend <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">Latacora’s takedown</a>.</p>



<p>GnuTLS is an SSL/TLS library created by the same people who created (and then abandoned) libmcrypt, which was the scourge of <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/293930/problematic-php-cryptography-advice-in-popular-questions">bad cryptography in the PHP ecosystem</a> for many years (until it was <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/mcrypt-viking-funeral">finally excised in PHP 7.2</a>). Consequently, the project’s <a href="https://www.gnutls.org/security-new.html">CVE history</a> should be no surprise.</p>



<p><strong>Quick story:</strong> Many years ago, a few timing attacks were discovered in libgcrypt by regular chatters in Freenode’s ##crypto channel. This led a lot of us <a href="https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gcrypt-devel/2015-November/003618.html">to look at libgcrypt for more bugs</a>.</p>



<p>The general consensus of the ensuing IRC discussion was, roughly, “We probably shouldn’t try to fix them all, because a) that’s way too much effort because there’s too much badness and b) this library will be a ripe target for upcoming cryptanalysis researchers to get their first papers published for many years”. And, indeed, the attack papers that have come out over the years that affect libgcrypt <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/432">haven’t disappointed</a>.</p>



<p>To be clear, at the time this happened, I was garbage at writing C (and somehow even less confident than capable) and barely making ends meet, so “drop everything and volunteer to fix all the libgcrypt badness” wasn’t a tenable option for me. And since the world is largely moving away from GnuPG and libgcrypt, it honestly isn’t worth the effort trying to fix all the bad when an easier fix is “use something good instead”.</p>



<h2>Takeaway</h2>



<p>If you see the letters GNU anywhere in a project that intersects with cryptography–except for its public license–it’s almost certainly an error-prone cryptographic design.</p>



<p>Or, as my friend Kye calls it:</p>



<figure><div>

</div><figcaption>The Dunning-GNUger Effect.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>What To Use Instead?</h2>



<p>To replace GPG, you want <a href="https://age-encryption.org/">age</a> and <a href="https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/">minisign</a>.</p>



<p>To replace GnuTLS or libgcrypt, depending on what you’re using it for, you want one of the following: s2n, OpenSSL/LibreSSL, or Libsodium.</p>



<p>For embedded systems, BearSSL is a good options today and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/hdc4o6/new_results_on_gimli_fullpermutation/fvmpnym/">libhydrogen v2</a> will be an attractive choice when it’s released.</p>

                <p>If you are responsible for managing a bunch of your organization’s AWS
resources, you probably know how annoying it is to debug various
deployment-related issues, only to learn that someone accidentally messed with
your setup, yet again. Which you probably resolved by navigating your
command-line history like a maniac (because you don’t use Ansible and have to
<code>Ctrl+R</code>, as you also forgot to put down the setup instructions ;)). We’ve
been there, too. And this is what we learned:</p>
<ol>
<li>You should use Ansible and deploy your environment with a playbook, and</li>
<li>You should make the most of it by taking advantage of both Ansible’s
built-in mechanisms and the modules that allow you to detect
configuration drift, and correct it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our dear sysadmins and DevOps engineers, this post is for you. Stay with
us and read along!</p>
<h2 id="ansible-and-compliance-how">Ansible and compliance? How?</h2>
<p>According to Cambridge Advanced Learner’s Dictionary, compliance is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fact of obeying a particular law or rule, or of acting according to an
agreement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To see what the above definition has got to do with Ansible and the AWS
Ansible Collection, let’s briefly descend to the world of Ansible playbooks
and modules.</p>
<h3 id="its-all-about-state">It’s all about state</h3>
<p>Ideally, playbook tasks describe the <strong>desired final state</strong> of a managed
system - for example, configuration of an AWS EC2 instance. An Ansible module
takes that description and performs the necessary steps to ensure that state.</p>
<p>It’s important to emphasize that it’s easy to write playbook tasks describing
the final state of a managed system when Ansible modules adopt <strong>declarative
APIs</strong>. As a consequence, we can treat playbook tasks as “the rule”, “the
policy”, or simply as something we need to be <em>compliant with</em>. Perhaps even
more importantly, we can treat Ansible playbooks as simple diagnostic tools to
help us detect when we are not compliant anymore, so that we can mitigate the
situation.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with Ansible, all of this probably rings a bell to you
already. Was your first thought the value of the <code>changed</code> variable that you
see every time you run your playbooks? Or perhaps even Ansible’s
<a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_checkmode.html" title="Official check mode documetation"><code>--diff</code> and <code>--check</code> modes</a>? Indeed, this post is about all of
them!</p>
<p>Let’s walk through a practical example demonstrating how you can use the
modules from the AWS Ansible Collection to <strong>detect and resolve configuration
drift</strong>.</p>
<p>To follow along easier, make sure you have completed the tutorial about the
basic usage of the collection in <a href="https://steampunk.si/blog/aws-ansible-collection-basic-usage/" title="Intro post about AWS Ansible Collection">Getting Started with the AWS Ansible
Collection</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make sure you have Steampunk AWS Ansible Collection version 0.8.3 installed.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="set-up-the-desired-state">Set up the desired state</h2>
<p>Let’s start by creating a simple AWS enviromnent that will support running an
imaginary app.  The environment will comprise:</p>
<ul>
<li>an EC2 instance named <em>steamy-server</em>;</li>
<li>a network interface named <em>steamy-eni</em> to attach to the EC2 instance,
which we secure with the VPC’s default security group.</li>
</ul>
<p>We created a playbook called <a href="https://github.com/xlab-si/steampunk-aws-examples/blob/master/enforcing-compliance/setup.yaml" title="Ansible playbook for setting up a demo environment">setup.yaml</a> for spinning up this
environment. And then, we run</p>
<pre><code>$ ansible-playbook setup.yaml --diff
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>

PLAY RECAP ******************************************************************
localhost              : ok=3         changed=2    unreachable=0    failed=0
                         skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0
</code></pre></div><p>We can see two <code>changed</code> tasks, corresponding to the two newly created AWS
resources. Thanks to the <code>--diff</code> flag which instructs the modules to report
the differences they made, we also get a nice visual indication of what
exactly the modules changed. The red-colored lines show the previous state of
the AWS resource  (before a specific task ran), while the green ones show the
current state, i.e. after the task ran.</p>
<p>We can interpret the diff output above as “the instance and network interface
didn’t exist before, so we created them, and they are now configured as
shown”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Typically, we can’t take support for diff mode for granted, as it is up to
individual modules to implement it. This is why some tasks make changes but
report no differences despite running <code>ansible-playbook</code> with <code>--diff</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="a-word-about-idempotence">A word about idempotence</h3>
<p>Can you guess what will happen if we run the same command again? Let’s try it
out!</p>
<pre><code>$ ansible-playbook setup.yaml --diff
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>PLAY [localhost] ************************************************************

TASK [Create the steamy-server instance for running a simple app] ***********
ok: [localhost]

TASK [Retrieve the default security group for the VPC] **********************
ok: [localhost]

TASK [Create a dedicated network interface and attach it to steamy-server] **

PLAY RECAP ******************************************************************
localhost              : ok=3         changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0
                         skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0
</code></pre><p>This time around, we see that there was nothing to be done - the Ansible
modules already did all the hard work when they were invoked the first time.
So no changed tasks, no updates done, and no diff output shown. With other
words, the current state of our managed AWS resources is compliant with the
state described by the tasks in our <code>setup.yaml</code> playbook. This demonstrates
another important aspect related to Ansible’s declarative approach, which is
that playbook tasks should ideally be idempotent.  If the state of the managed
resource is aligned with the desired state as described by the playbook tasks,
running the playbook again will not affect its state.</p>
<p>But how can all of this be useful to me, you wonder? Glad you asked, time to
spice things up a bit!</p>
<h2 id="deviate-from-the-initial-state">Deviate from the initial state</h2>
<p>Now, let’s put ourselves in the shoes of an adversary that wants to tweak the
state of our AWS resources to their taste. In practice, this could be done
accidentally, or worse - with malicious intent. But we’ll be doing it solely
for the purpose of demonstration. Disclaimer: we won’t actually be doing
anything dangerous, we’ll only make some simple configuration changes that
should indicate that configuration has drifted if we take <a href="https://github.com/xlab-si/steampunk-aws-examples/blob/master/enforcing-compliance/setup.yaml" title="Ansible playbook for setting up a demo environment">setup.yaml</a>
as our baseline for compliance.</p>
<p>To make the changes, we could open the AWS Management Console and manually
modify some properties of the EC2 instance or the network interface that we
created with [setup.yaml][setup` earlier. But since we’re all about
automation, let’s put the tweaks in an Ansible playbook called
<a href="https://github.com/xlab-si/steampunk-aws-examples/blob/master/enforcing-compliance/tweaked-setup.yaml" title="Playbook simulating an adversary">tweaked-setup.yaml</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a recap of what we’ll be tweaking with this playbook:</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ll downgrade our <em>steamy-server</em>’s CloudWatch monitoring to the
basic level and modify it’s shutdown behavior;</li>
<li>We’ll update the value of <em>steamy-server</em>’s <code>env</code> tag.</li>
<li>We’ll create a new security group called <em>dangerous-secgroup</em> with
some suspicious permissions;</li>
<li>We’ll associate this <em>dangerous-secgroup</em> with the network interface
attached to the <em>steamy-server</em> instance, and we’ll also disable
source/destination checking for the network interface;</li>
</ul>
<p>Sneaky, right? ;)</p>
<p>If we ran <code>ansible-playbook tweaked-setup.yaml</code> now, we would end up with
three changed tasks. But since we’re learning about Ansible diff mode, let’s
do:</p>
<pre><code>$  ansible-playbook tweaked-setup.yaml --diff
</code></pre>
<p>and we end up with three changed tasks, plus the diff output consistent with
the tweaks described above:</p>

<p>I love using <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a>. At my previous job, we managed our infrastructure entirely with Terraform: tens of thousands of resources spread across several cloud providers. The benefits of infrastructure-as-code and Terraform, in particular, are massive, but well known. While I still consider Terraform the best tool of its kind, this article describes some pain points that my team and I encountered as power users. I hope it can lead to some discussion about ways to improve.</p>

<p>All of these are relevant as recently as Terraform v0.13.0-beta3, July 2020.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#refactoring-is-difficult">Refactoring is difficult</a></li>
<li><a href="#code-reuse-is-limited">Code reuse is limited</a></li>
<li><a href="#type-system-is-too-rigid">Type system is too rigid</a></li>
<li><a href="#upstream-development-frustrating-priorities">Upstream development: frustrating priorities</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This is part one in a series about Terraform. Part two, detailing some Terraform practices that we found effective, will be up shortly.</p>

<h2 id="refactoring-is-difficult">Refactoring is difficult</h2>

<p>Terraform code is unwieldy to refactor. Even giving a resource a new <em>internal</em> name is a hassle. Here’s our simple Terraform definition:</p>

<pre><code>resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
  bucket = "images.bigco.com"
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now it’s a month later, and we’re adding our second bucket, so let’s change our Terraform code to use a more specific name:</p>

<pre><code>resource "aws_s3_bucket" "images_bucket" {
  bucket = "images.bigco.com"
}
</code></pre>

<p>If we naively try to make this innocuous-looking change, Terraform will want to delete and recreate the bucket. We probably all understand why that’s the case, and it helps us appreciate how wonderful the concept of <code>terraform plan</code> is, but it’s ludicrous to have no serious facility for doing this smoothly. <code>terraform state mv</code> exists, but you need to run that separately, outside the plan/apply lifecycle. If you need to do this for ten environments, it’s a lot of work.</p>

<p>And that’s the easy case. Moving across module boundaries is harder, especially if you want to move the resources from the module into the root of the state (spoiler: <code>state mv</code> can’t do it). Moving across state boundaries is harder still. While the <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/state/mv.html">documentation</a> mentions moving to a different state file, there’s no support for hooking it up to an already-existing state in S3 (for example). The tool is not at all user friendly or convenient.</p>

<p>The silver lining is that Terraform state is a simple JSON file, so it’s easy to write your own tooling around it. My team had occasion to do several refactors where we pulled individual projects’ resources out of a monolithic state and into their own states, once for each of our environments. Trying to orchestrate that with <code>state mv</code> would have been an awkward mess, but writing a simple Python script to pull state from S3, modify it, and push it back, was not too bad (if you do this, you’ll also want to remove the state checksum from DynamoDB).</p>

<p>You’re never going to nail the module and state boundaries correctly on your first pass (or ever?). Refactoring is inescapable. It needs to be more convenient. It would be great if there was some way to signal to Terraform “hey, this resource used to have a different address”. Something like this seems reasonable:</p>

<pre><code>resource "aws_s3_bucket" "images_bucket" {
  bucket = "images.bigco.com"

  lifecycle {
    old_addresses = [
      "aws_s3_bucket.bucket",
      "module.images_bucket.aws_s3_bucket.bucket",
    ]
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="code-reuse-is-limited">Code reuse is limited</h2>

<p>Terraform’s main tool for code reuse (i.e. a chunk of resource definitions that can be reused with different inputs) is the <code>module</code> (symlinks may also be useful in some situations, but I haven’t used them for this). Modules are limited in some ways.</p>

<h4 id="it-s-awkward-to-pin-module-versions">It’s awkward to pin module versions</h4>

<p>You <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/1439">can’t do interpolation in a module’s <code>source</code> parameter</a>. So if a dozen modules should all be pointing at the same revision of your <a href="https://blog.gruntwork.io/how-to-create-reusable-infrastructure-with-terraform-modules-25526d65f73d">modules git repository</a>, there’s no clean way to update all those references in one place. My team had a Makefile target, which we ran manually, that used <code>find</code> and <code>sed</code> to update all the references.</p>

<p>Leaving the module source unpinned is not an option I’d be comfortable with because it’s a vector for un-source-controlled drift that can be easily avoided.</p>

<h4 id="can-t-partially-apply-modules">Can’t partially apply modules</h4>

<p>The biggest problem we’ve faced with the module system is the inability to do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_application">partial application</a> (in the computer science sense). In essence, it would be nice to simplify a module’s interface by binding a bunch of common parameters. Here’s an example:</p>

<pre><code>module "service_a" {
  source = "..."

  name = "service_a"

  environment_variables = merge(
    local.environment_variable_defaults,
    {
      THING = "1",
    },
  )

  vpc_id     = local.vpc_id
  subnet_ids = local.subnet_ids
  ...
}

module "service_b" {
  source = "..."

  name = "service_b"

  environment_variables = merge(
    local.environment_variable_defaults,
    {
      THING = "2",
    },
  )

  vpc_id     = local.vpc_id
  subnet_ids = local.subnet_ids
  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>These services have, say, fifteen parameters being passed in, and they only differ in one or two. There should be some more expressive way of writing them so that only those two unique values are prominent. Instead, you’re stuck copy/pasting a bunch of boilerplate, and editing in the unique values. That’s error-prone and a maintenance burden.</p>

<p>There’s an <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/locals.html">analogy</a> between Terraform definitions and a conventional programming language: a set of Terraform definitions (a module) is like a function, with TF variables being inputs to the function, TF locals being local variables, and TF outputs being return values. The extension of that analogy to this use case is partial application, where you give a module some of its inputs, it binds those values and you get back a module with only the rest of the inputs. Terraform doesn’t support it.</p>

<p>Ideally, we’d be able to define some sort of a “submodule” like this:</p>

<pre><code>submodule "service" {
  source = "..."

  environment_variables = merge(
    local.environment_variable_defaults,
    ?
  )

  vpc_id     = local.vpc_id
  subnet_ids = local.subnet_ids
}

module "service_a" {
  source = submodule.service

  name = "service_a"

  environment_variable_overrides = {
    THING = "1",
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We can’t use a proper module for this, because it doesn’t have access to its parent’s locals (which seems right). Notice the unsolved problem here of how to refer to those environment variable overrides in the submodule. This isn’t a fully-formed proposal.</p>

<p>Here are some ways we’ve dealt with this.</p>

<h5 id="code-reuse-workaround-1-big-map-of-config">Code reuse workaround 1: big map of config</h5>

<p>You can pass a big map of config as input to the module, rather than individual variables. That map can be defined as a local, and can include all the common values. Each service can merge on top of it to provide its overrides.</p>

<p>It’s a hack, but it works to reduce boilerplate. There are a couple of serious drawbacks, though:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Terraform’s <code>merge()</code> only performs a shallow merge. This is surprising behavior, and can lead to subtle bugs. You can work around it if you know about it, but the workarounds are often awkward. There’s an <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/25032">open PR</a> adding a <code>deepmerge()</code> function.</p></li>

<li><p>When anything in the map is “not known until after apply” (e.g. an attribute of a resource that hasn’t been created yet), the entire map is considered “not known until after apply”. For example, if our config map looks like</p>

<pre><code>config = {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.vpc.id,
  thing_enabled = true,
}
</code></pre>

<p>and the module does something like</p>

<pre><code>resource ... {
  count = var.config.thing_enabled ? 1 : 0

  ...
}
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>then this will fail to plan if the VPC doesn’t already exist because <code>var.config</code> contains something (the VPC id) which isn’t known yet, and so <code>var.config.thing_enabled</code> is not known until after apply. This is subtle and unexpected, and the error messages you’ll see from it are cryptic. But it’s very easy to do by accident once some resources are created already. Then the next time you try to bootstrap a new state (e.g. a new environment), you’ll find that it won’t plan successfully.</p>

<h5 id="code-reuse-workaround-2-generate-terraform-definitions-from-templates">Code reuse workaround 2: generate Terraform definitions from templates</h5>

<p>In some instances, it can make sense to generate Terraform code from templates. On my team, there were a few places that we did this, and we checked those generated files in to git as regular <code>*.tf</code> files (their names started with <code>generated.</code> to make it obvious). This can work well, but adds some process overhead (pre-processing, knowing which files to not edit, CI validation that the files haven’t been edited).</p>

<p>There are also some TF preprocessors, like <a href="https://pypi.org/project/terraformpy/">terraformpy</a>, but I haven’t tried any.</p>

<h2 id="type-system-is-too-rigid">Type system is too rigid</h2>

<p>In Terraform before 0.12, everything was a string, and that was ugly (<code>count = "${var.enabled ? 1 : 0}"</code>). Terraform 0.12 added proper booleans, numbers, even some data structures like sets and maps. That was an improvement. However:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When defining a module’s contract (i.e. specifying the types for its input variables), it’s not currently practical to use <code>map</code> or <code>object</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>map</code> type requires all values in the map to have the same type, which can be useful in a some cases (environment variable values are always strings), but not very often, in my experience.</p>

<p>The <code>object</code> type is a map without that restriction on value types, but if you’re going to say a variable’s type is <code>object</code>, you need to specify all the names of the keys and the types of their values. Okay… that doesn’t sound so bad. And <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/19898">all of the keys are mandatory</a>. What!? This makes <code>object</code> useless as a variable type, where you’ll often want to just pass in one value as an override and leave some set of defaults.</p>

<p>If you put these types on your variables, you’ll fail to plan in all sorts of surprising ways. You’ll try to pass <code>alarm_config = { enabled = true, threshold_seconds = 30 }</code> to your <code>map</code> variable and fail to plan because the value types aren’t uniform. So you’ll change it to an object, then realize that you can’t omit the <code>period_seconds</code> parameter which was supposed to optionally merge on top of a default. It’s an uphill battle. These types, in this context, are so rigid that they cause a lot of …</p></li></ul></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>This post is a follow-up to the intro post about <a href="https://www.arvarik.com/visiting-the-stable-marriage-problem">The Stable Marriage Problem</a>.
Check out the previous post to understand the problem/solution because this post examines its implications, particularly in the
modern dating world.</p><hr><h2>Modern Times</h2><p>A fascinating consequence of the internet is how much closer it has brought the problem of finding your soulmate, as well as how
much closer the assumptions in the original Stable Marriage Problem (SMP) are true in reality. The <a href="https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/cs286r/courses/fall09/papers/galeshapley.pdf">original paper</a>
from 1962 has assumptions that neither worked then nor now, but it started the discussion on how to best pair people for marriage and any entities for any purpose in general.</p><p>The original SMP assumes that everybody knows everybody so that each person can rank everyone in the opposite gender.
This was a clearly unrealistic assumption back in 1962, however, nothing has been a more unifying resource
in the history of humanity than the interent.</p><p>While the SMP may have been an interesting experiment to replicate in a small closed off town 25 years ago, people are finding other people
at a much greater rate and from a larger and more diverse group, allowing the SMP to simulate real life more accurately.</p><p>The table below shows the top three ways people have met their partner by decade in the past 50 years:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Decade / Rank</th><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1960’s</td><td>Through Friend (19%)</td><td>Through Family (13%)</td><td>Primary / Secondary School (12%)</td></tr><tr><td>1970’s</td><td>Through Friend (21%)</td><td>Through Family (13%)</td><td>Bar / Restaurant (10%)</td></tr><tr><td>1980’s</td><td>Through Friend (18%)</td><td>Through Coworker (16%)</td><td>Bar / Restaurant (14%)</td></tr><tr><td>1990’s</td><td>Through Friend (18%)</td><td>Through Coworker (15%)</td><td>Bar / Restaurant (12%)</td></tr><tr><td>2000’s</td><td>Through Friend (19%)</td><td>Bar / Restaurant (11%)</td><td>Through Coworker (10%)</td></tr><tr><td>2010’s</td><td>Met Online (19%)</td><td>Through Friend (17%)</td><td>Bar / Restaurant (15%)</td></tr></tbody></table><p><a href="https://data.stanford.edu/hcmst2017">Source</a></p><p>The 2010’s showed a monumental rise in online dating, and the number of people who have met their significant other online is only
going to continue to grow. Online dating is interesting in particular because it provides us with a breadth of
information on dating patterns in the modern age.</p><p>I wanted to see how the SMP actually worked when run through some simulations, and how well it actually models real life.</p><p>In order to benchmark some variants of the SMP that model real life more accurately, let's start off by simulating the classic problem scenario
proposed over 50 years ago.</p><h2>Simulations</h2><h3>Classic</h3><p>I created a <a href="https://github.com/Arvind-Arik/stable-marriage-problem/blob/master/classic/stable_marriage_problem_classic.py">Python implementation</a>
of the classic SMP solution in order to calculate some initial results on what a 'perfect' world would be like.</p><p>The assumptions in the classic SMP scenario is that everybody knows each other and people's preference towards the opposite
group is randomly and uniformly distributed. This basically means that everybody has an equal chance to be liked by someone of the opposite gender.</p><p>The standard algorithm was run with different population levels and the number of iterations to find a stable
matching as well as the preference rank each person matched with on average was recorded.</p><p>The latter point is shown in the second graph
and is portrayed as the difference between the rank of what every girl got, minus the rank of what every guy got (notice
the title indicates an advantage for men, this is because in pretty much all scenarios the man came out higher in the matching, a.k.a
the 'reacher')</p><p><span>
      <span></span>

    </span></p><p>From the simulations we can observe two things:</p><ul><li><p>The first graph demonstrates the <code>O(n²)</code> complexity of the algorithm. We can see that as the community grows larger, even
by a small amount, the amount of iterations it takes to solve the matching problem grows exponentially.</p><ul><li>It shows how the difficulty of finding a stable matching between two people grows at a disproportionate rate when population
of the community increases. </li></ul></li><li><p>The second graph shows the difference in preference ranks for each group of people. It is calculated by examining each
matching and seeing where the woman lies on the man's preference rank and where the man lies on the woman's preference rank.</p><ul><li><p>Since the only difference between the two groups is which group 'proposes' first, we see as an outcome that men have an
advantage in this scenario in that, compared to women, they end up with a partner higher on their preference list.</p></li><li><p>The advantage starts off high, and seems to converge at around 13-14% advantage for men</p></li></ul></li></ul><h3>Preference Manipulated by Dating Pattern</h3><p>There are some pretty large assumptions being thrown around in the classic SMP scenario.</p><p>In my opinion, the biggest
assumption made is that preference sets are randomly assigned and uniformly distributed. This means that everyone's preference
is not correlated with one another's, and that for large enough populations everyone's attractivness is roughly the same
(based on how the opposite gender ranks).</p><p>I don't know about you, but I certainly don't have an online following of girls gushing over me like Timothée Chalamet does.</p><hr><p>As mentioned before, one of the interesting ramifications of the rise in online dating is the amount of data we can aggregate from it.</p><p>OkCupid periodically releases dating information in <a href="https://theblog.okcupid.com/">their blog</a>, and some time ago they released
some interesting numbers in how men perceive attractiveness of the opposite sex versus women. The following charts outline the discrepancy:</p><p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="Attractiveness" title="Attractiveness" src="https://www.arvarik.com/static/980433e71b121de8ddd0ab2ecd864ba9/7d769/attractiveness.png" srcset="https://www.arvarik.com/static/980433e71b121de8ddd0ab2ecd864ba9/5243c/attractiveness.png 240w,https://www.arvarik.com/static/980433e71b121de8ddd0ab2ecd864ba9/ab158/attractiveness.png 480w,https://www.arvarik.com/static/980433e71b121de8ddd0ab2ecd864ba9/7d769/attractiveness.png 960w,https://www.arvarik.com/static/980433e71b121de8ddd0ab2ecd864ba9/8ba70/attractiveness.png 1202w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/11/18/okcupid-inbox-attractive/">Source</a></p><p>From the data (specifically the dotted lines) we can see two things:</p><ul><li><p>Men's ranking of women pretty closely resembles a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normal distribution</a>.
This is easy to conceptualize as essentially half of women in mens eyes are above average and half are below.</p></li><li><p>Women's ranking of men is more closely related to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution">Pareto distribution</a>, also known as the 80-20 distribution.
With respect to this problem, it means that if we could quantify attractiveness for every guy, the top 20% of men hold 80% of cumulative attractiveness
in the eyes of women. In an unrelated note, Bernie seems a lot more appealing right about now.</p></li></ul><h3>So how do we change our problem?</h3><p>We can tweak our original code so that each gender's preference rankings are more aligned with their respective distribution of opposite
sex attractiveness.</p><p>Here is the <a href="https://github.com/Arvind-Arik/stable-marriage-problem/blob/master/distribution/stable_marriage_problem_distribution.py">updated code</a>. Take a
look in particular about the shuffling code for preference lists. The new shuffling code applies the normal distribution for guys
and pareto distribution for girls.</p><p>I ran the same simulations again with the updated code and it produced the following results: </p><p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="SMP Distribution" title="SMP Distribution" src="https://www.arvarik.com/static/a637509c86c5ca77b0b6bcb3d10b015f/ff59c/smp_distribution.png" srcset="https://www.arvarik.com/static/a637509c86c5ca77b0b6bcb3d10b015f/5243c/smp_distribution.png 240w,https://www.arvarik.com/static/a637509c86c5ca77b0b6bcb3d10b015f/ab158/smp_distribution.png 480w,https://www.arvarik.com/static/a637509c86c5ca77b0b6bcb3d10b015f/ff59c/smp_distribution.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><p>This is the same type of data analyzed from the previous simulation, but with much different results:</p><ul><li><p>The first graph shows a similar <code>O(n²)</code> complexity of the algorithm, but the constant value for the graph's equation is much higher</p><ul><li><p>The standard SMP for 1000 pairings took around 7,000 iterations to complete - with the new simulations, the SMP algorithm
runs in about 21,000 iterations, or 3 times as much</p></li><li><p>This makes sense in terms of the distributions. Since more women now have the same few men in the top 20% of their preference lists, the number
of conflicts increases when running the algorithm and causes a lot more men to be dumped and subsequently resume their search for a better soulmate</p></li></ul></li><li><p>The second graph is particularly interesting and shows a marked increase in the 'advantage' men have simply for being the proposers</p><ul><li><p>The increase here stabilizes at around 38-39% and is again around 3 times larger than the advantage men had in the classic SMP scenario</p></li><li><p>This increase also makes sense because of the discrepancies in preferences between men and women. If the average man was paired with the average woman,
the OkCupid data shows that the man would see the woman as average in attractiveness while the woman would see the man as below average attractiveness</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2>What Did We Learn From This?</h2><p>There's obviously many gross inaccuaries when trying to reasonably model the dating world, but the SMP offers an initial glimpse as to why dating is so difficult
and why certain tropes exist.</p><h3>Why it's always better to be the initiator</h3><p>A clear callout from the analysis is that men end up having the advantage when everyone is paired. There's two main reason for this:</p><p><strong>1) Societal Expectations:</strong></p><p>Men are traditionally assumed to be the first group to make a move and it is why the men in the code simulations make the first move.
Because men make the first move, the algorithm benefits men as it works in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm">greedy behavior</a> to get them the
best possible partner.</p><p>With respect to the problem, any gender can theoretically be the one to make the first move and reap the benefits demonstrated by the SMP simulations.</p><p><span>

    </span> <em>⠀From WikiHow, I can't really draw this well</em></p><p><strong>2) Preferences of Men vs Women:</strong></p><p>The discrepancy in preferences for the opposite sex between men and women is what caused the stable pairing advantage for men to jump from 13% to 39%. While
all other things are held constant, it was the preferences that caused this jump because it all ends up relating to how people <em>perceive</em> attractiveness.</p><p>The OkCupid data shows that women have higher standards for men than men have for women, and this is the main driver for why there is a larger male advantage
when the SMP algorithm incorporated the gender attractiveness distributions.</p><p>I am in no way concluding that women are unhappier with men in their relationships - there are a million other factors including personality, status and chemistry
that affect how each person in the relationship views each other.</p><p><em>However</em>, it does lead us to how the outside world perceives the relationships...</p><h3>Settlers and Reachers</h3><p>The show <em>How I Met Your Mother</em> was a staple TV show during my coming of age years, and it surprisingly had many apt theories surrounding modern dating.</p><p>One of the most notable ones was the concept of Settlers and Reachers - as said in the show:</p><blockquote><p><em>Every good relationship has a reacher and a settler.

      <p>“What would you say if I asked you to design me a service capable of responding to millions of user requests every second and latency was critical?”</p>

<p>“Umm…that you have to solve this problem at work. But you’re out of ideas, and are looking to interviewees for suggestions”</p>

<p>That’s the actual response I gave the interviewer the first time I was asked a design question. He had a good laugh. But then still made me design the service.</p>

<p>In the decade since I’ve lost track of how many hours I’ve spent in the interview room, on both sides of the table. I’ve worked at Microsoft, Google, and Stripe, and received offers from many other companies. As I interviewed, I realized one thing: standard interviewing advice falls woefully short.</p>

<p>What good does it do to practice coding problems for weeks if your mind goes blank in an interview room? How can you show your “best self” if you’re too afraid to let it out? Everyone says to be wary of the recruiters, but what if you weren’t?</p>

<p>I tested the answers to these questions multiple times (sometimes by accident). Turns out conventional wisdom gets you conventional results. But you can do better. Interviewing is a skill and anyone can learn it.</p>

<p>For some reason no one talks about these challenges with interviewing. But I’ve found some principles that help me over and over again:</p>

<p>We’ll cover:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using recruiters to your advantage</li>
  <li>Going to real interviews for practice</li>
  <li>Being open to learning during interviews</li>
  <li>Keeping those skills sharp even when you’re not job hunting</li>
</ul>



<p>Their voice sounds so friendly and helpful when you chat with them on the phone. “Zain, I’m looking forward to seeing you when you come for your interview!” Clearly it’s all an act, past-me assumed. I was sure they were secretly judging me, deciding if I was good enough to work at the company.</p>

<p>And they do judge. But not in the way I was expecting.</p>

<p>Recruiters aren’t evaluating you technically, not by the time you pick up the phone anyways. Their decision on whether you have the technical chops to be worth interviewing was made well before that call. If you’re being offered an interview: Congratulations, you’ve already passed that bar</p>

<p>Now the recruiter wants to work with you. Their whole job is to, you know, recruit. They know that you statistically have poor interview prep skills, and they’re happy to help fix that flaw. Why discard a strong candidate who can’t interview well? They’ll level the playing field by helping everyone show their best selves when interviewing.</p>

<p><strong>How can you take advantage of this?</strong></p>

<p>Ask them questions! Things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“What are the company values that would be good to highlight during the interview?”</li>
  <li>“I’m interested in X, Y, &amp; Z. What other companies are hiring?” (Only try this if the recruiter reached out to you first, they work for a recruiting agency, and you haven’t had your interview yet)</li>
</ul>

<p>And you can be forthright about any problems you run into:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you get sick the day before the interview, call up the recruiter and ask to reschedule. They want to test you when you’re at your best!</li>
  <li>Work pressures left you with no time to prepare? You can still try rescheduling. At worst they’ll say “sorry, we can’t do that”. It will not hurt your chances of getting in</li>
</ul>

<p>Your mad technical skills no longer matter to them. If anything, humility and an openness to learning will show you in the best light.</p>



<p>You need to build up your interview skills. LeetCode is great, but it doesn’t come close to the real thing. Try to interview at actual companies as much as possible. And don’t limit yourself to the companies you care about.</p>

<p><strong>Learn to deal with pressure</strong></p>

<p>When you’re in a real interview the world changes: You’re locked in a cage with a lion. Every heartbeat is a gorilla bashing to break free. Your mental gears gunk up as your body goes into fight or flight mode. Your clammy hands struggle to write half legible code on the white board. A threat hides behind every shadow. Even an innocuous “Would you like something to drink?” is a nefarious test: do I pick coke or coffee?</p>

<p>You only get that experience in a real interview. And only real interviews teach you how to deal with it. The first interview will kick your ass. So will the second. But once you get a few under your belt you’ll get used to the adrenaline rush. Perhaps enjoy it even. You’ll become a bullfighter, confidently facing down the charging bull. That’s how you get over the fear.</p>

<p>You may even find that these practice interviews are much easier! When the stakes are low that lion doesn’t look so fierce. I’ve found that I perform the best in the interviews where I don’t care about the outcome. I’m much more relaxed and at ease. I can think faster, my brain reaches out to more possibilities. Now, even in important interviews I try to convince myself that I don’t really care. That mindset shift is only possible because I got to experience it in the low stakes games first.</p>

<p><strong>Learn to answer the more ambiguous questions</strong></p>

<p>And what about the questions? After each interview write down all the questions you were asked. The same evening look over the questions while they’re still fresh in your mind. Focus especially on ones which have no clear right answer, such as behavioral and design questions. Think about how you could have responded better. Are there stories from your life you could have referenced? Wait a few days and look at them again. You’ll find better answers.</p>

<p>Each answer you prepare this way becomes a blob of paint on your pallet. Chances are high that you’ll come across similar questions in future interviews. Over time you’ll be able to mix the answers from your pallet to paint a picture demonstrating just how valuable an asset you can be to their company.</p>

<p><strong>Stay open to serendipity</strong></p>

<p>As you do these interviews, you may discover that the “practice” company is actually interesting after all. Recruiters count on that. I’ve had recruiters suggest I interview even when I told them I didn’t care for the company. “Maybe you’ll change your mind after seeing us up close”, they’d suggest.</p>

<p>And I did. More than once.</p>



<p>I learned this one by accident, but boy does it pay off.</p>

<p>I was wandering around the booths with my bag full of swag. My eyes caught a pile of rubik’s cubes being given away by some company I’d never heard of. I wanted one! Of course I couldn’t just go up and ask for it directly, so I went and chatted with the guy manning the booth. His name was Vince. A few minutes later I walked away with my prized rubik’s cube in hand. That evening Vince called me up offering to conduct a full interview loop on campus. I already had a job offer from a company I liked, but I thought “Sure, why not? I could use the experience”</p>

<p>I had no intention of joining the company, they were some boring finance business. There was nothing to lose. So during the interview I felt free to ask any question I wanted. When I thought I got the answer to an interview question wrong, I’d ask “I don’t think I did so great here. What’s the right answer to this problem?” (I wanted to learn the answer for future interviews!). When asked a challenging question I could grin and delight in the problem solving aspect instead of worrying about how badly it would reflect on me. (Remember my smart aleck remark in the intro? That was this interview.)</p>

<p>Turns out they liked that: the next day I had a second job offer. At a significantly higher salary than my first one. Oh, and they wanted to fly me to New York in two weeks for an introduction to the company. I still didn’t want to join, but a free trip to New York? Sign me up! The company’s name: Bloomberg</p>

<p>Bloomberg was a practiced hand at recruiting. They had a full two days of events to leave us starry eyed about the company (I came thiiiiis close to accepting their offer). While there, Vince told me I’d made a great impression by fearlessly asking questions, even when I was stumped.</p>

<p>Since then I’ve stopped hesitating before asking any question in an interview. Let your curiosity run free! Don’t cage it! And as an interviewer, I can attest: sincere interest is always a good sign.</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/docjamesw">James Whittaker</a> recommends trying to get a job offer every year, just to make sure you can.</p>

<p>It’s an extremely liberating feeling knowing that even if you lose your job you’ll be able to find another one quickly. That’s a huge stress off your back.</p>

<p>I haven’t been very good about this myself, but every once in a while I’ll accept an invitation from a recruiter (it helps to set up your LinkedIn account). I don’t bother doing any prep for these interviews, at least not initially. Those interviews show me the areas I need to brush up on or where the industry practices are changing.</p>

<p>For example, in a tech screen I did last summer there was some miscommunication and I didn’t realize they expected actual working code. Instead of the usual pseudo code written in a google doc, the interviewer told me to select my language of choice on an online IDE. Now, I don’t have a particular language I consider myself super proficient in. I touch many different tools at work and end up having to use a different language about every 5 months. So even basic things like “create an array” tends to require googling the syntax. Given that, what’s my favorite language of choice? C#, hands down. So I selected that.</p>

<p>What hadn’t occurred to me at the time is that C# is a very verbose language which Visual Studio beautifully automates away the tedious parts of. This online IDE automated nothing. Even for a basic task like creating an array I had to spend precious interview minutes looking up the right package to import and the exact syntax to use. Needless to say, I ran out of time. I crashed and burned there, but it opened my eyes to the way interviews are changing and how I needed to prepare in the future.</p>

<p>Four months later a company called Stripe reached out to me. They also expect you to write working code and even let you use your own IDE. This time I was ready. And …</p></div></div>

        <p>Automated firmware testing on real embedded hardware is what every hardware
company strives to build. The mission is to repeatedly verify that changes to
firmware being merged into master and shipped to customers will not cause
catastrophic failures like power regressions or bootloops.</p>

<p>The problem with automated firmware testing with real hardware is that it’s
<strong>hard</strong>. Not only does the system require a stable firmware to build on top of,
but it will also require extra hardware, like flashers and power supplies, and
software to orchestrate the tests and capture results.</p>

<p>An alternative to building a complicated orchestration system for automated
tests is to use the popular hardware emulator project, Renode, and its built-in
Robot Framework integration. By using Renode in conjunction with GitHub Actions,
we can ensure that every pull-request and commit to master passes all our tests.</p>

<!-- excerpt start -->

<p>In this post, I cover what it takes to build a simple firmware for use with
Renode, how to build and administer tests with Robot Framework, and how to run
these tests within GitHub’s continuous integration system.</p>

<h2 id="automation-testing-for-firmware">Automation Testing for Firmware</h2>

<p>Test automation is the practice of testing software and/or hardware in a
repeatable and scalable way where expected values are compared against actual
values.</p>

<p>There are various forms of test automation, and they are usually run under a
continuous integration system, such as Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or CircleCI.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Software Unit Tests - Isolated tests that exercise a single module. Usually
run on the host machine and sometimes on an emulator or real device.</li>
  <li>Integration Tests - Tests that exercise a collection of modules that interact
with each other</li>
  <li>End-to-end Tests - Tests that exercise an entire technical stack end-to-end.
These tests would usually communicate with some sort of backend in the cloud
or a mobile phone.</li>
</ul>

<p>These testing approaches are not limited entirely to software, as hardware can
be tested in similar ways. “Hardware unit testing” is a concept where individual
pieces of the larger hardware board are put under test to ensure the chip itself
behaves correctly. Integration tests and end-to-end tests can also be performed
on hardware, but the complexity increases exponentially as more hardware is
thrown into the mix.</p>

<p>A middle ground between host-run tests and hardware tests is testing on an
emulator which emulates the real hardware as much as possible. Renode, by
Antmicro, has become our favorite emulator at Memfault, and its list of support
boards is continually growing<sup id="fnref:renode_boards"><a href="#fn:renode_boards">1</a></sup>. Renode emulates many peripherals
of the board, including the UART, SPI, I2C, RAM, ROM, and GPIO’s.</p>

<p>Renode has a built-in integration with the open-source testing framework called
Robot Framework<sup id="fnref:robot_framework"><a href="#fn:robot_framework">2</a></sup>. Robot Framework is most popular in the web
world, but it is generic and powerful enough to be used for many more use-cases.
It provides the glue between various test scripts, test reporting, and multiple
machines under test.</p>

<h2 id="using-a-shell-for-testing">Using a Shell for Testing</h2>

<p>Whether tests are being run within Renode or on real hardware, there should be a
way to easily run tests on a device.</p>

<p>A common approach is to use a CLI-based shell over serial, which we wrote about
in our post <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/firmware-shell#integration--automated-tests">Building a Tiny CLI Shell for Tiny
Firmware</a>.</p>

<p>The idea is relatively simple.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a test that will execute a series of shell commands on a device.</li>
  <li>After each command or series of commands, the results will be compared
against expected values.</li>
  <li>At the end of the test run, the harness determines whether the test was
successful or not.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thankfully for us, Renode has several utilities and helpers built-in that we can
take advantage of.</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<h3 id="example-repo">Example Repo</h3>

<p>All the code in this post was written for the STM32F429 MCU by ST Micro. While
the examples run fine on the STM32F429i discovery board, they were developed in
Renode, a popular MCU emulation platform.</p>

<p>You can find the complete code example for this blog post in a separate
<a href="https://github.com/memfault/interrupt-renode-test-automation">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/memfault/interrupt-renode-test-automation.git
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="toolchain">Toolchain</h3>

<p>I used the following tools to build my firmware:</p>

<ul>
  <li>GCC 8.3.1 / GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain as our compiler<sup id="fnref:gnu_toolchain"><a href="#fn:gnu_toolchain">3</a></sup></li>
  <li>GNU Make 4.2.1 as the build system</li>
</ul>

<p>Running automated tests with Renode, unfortunately, requires Python 2.7. To keep
things simple for me, I decided to use a Conda environment to keep this entire
environment isolated.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ conda create -n renode
$ conda activate renode
$ conda install -c conda-forge -c memfault \
      python=2.7 gcc-arm-none-eabi make=4.2.1

$ which arm-none-eabi-gcc
/Users/tyler/miniconda3/envs/renode/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Perfect, I now have <code>arm-none-eabi-gcc</code> and <code>python2.7</code> in my path.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Want to learn more about Conda? Check out my previous post on using <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/conda-developer-environments">Conda &gt;
environments for embedded &gt;
development</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It turns out the Renode team packages the application in a
<a href="https://anaconda.org/antmicro/renode">Renode Conda package</a>, but at the time of
writing this post, not all platforms had the latest version released (v1.9,
released in March). For that reason, I chose to install it locally for this
post.</p>

<h3 id="renode--robot-framework">Renode &amp; Robot Framework</h3>

<p>To install Renode, I’ve found the best instructions to be on the
<a href="https://github.com/renode/renode#installation">Renode GitHub Page</a>. In the
example repo, I’ve created a <code>start.sh</code> script which points to my local Renode
installation on my Mac. If you are using another platform, you’ll have to update
this script to point to your own Renode start script.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/sh</span>

sh /Applications/Renode.app/Contents/MacOS/macos_run.command renode-config.resc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To run Robot Framework alongside Renode, we’ll also need to clone the Renode
repository and all of its submodules, as well as install all of the required
Python dependencies.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:renode/renode.git
$ cd renode

# Install Robot Framework and other dependencies
$ pip install -r tools/requirements.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="docker">Docker</h3>

<p>To use Renode with Robot Framework in CI, it’s best to use the official
<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/antmicro/renode">Renode Docker image</a> for running the
tests. If you haven’t already, you’ll want to install
<a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop">Docker</a>.</p>

<h2 id="example-firmware-overview">Example Firmware Overview</h2>

<p>This post builds upon previous ideas and examples written on Interrupt. If you
find yourself missing some context, the following posts would be useful:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/intro-to-renode">Cortex-M MCU Emulation with
Renode</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/firmware-shell">Building a Tiny CLI Shell for Tiny Firmware</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Rather than the STM32Cube HAL, I used an open-source MCU HAL called <code>libopencm3</code>
with excellent support for the STM32. It is included as a submodule in the repo.</p>

<p>The primary way we’ll control the firmware is through a CLI shell written
previously and linked above.</p>

<p>With the shell in place, this means that our main loop of the firmware is
simply:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>clock_setup</span><span>();</span>
    <span>gpio_setup</span><span>();</span>
    <span>usart_setup</span><span>();</span>

    <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"App STARTED</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>

    <span>// Configure shell</span>
    <span>sShellImpl</span> <span>shell_impl</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>.</span><span>send_char</span> <span>=</span> <span>usart_putc</span><span>,</span>
    <span>};</span>
    <span>shell_boot</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>shell_impl</span><span>);</span>

    <span>char</span> <span>c</span><span>;</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>usart_getc</span><span>();</span>
        <span>shell_receive_char</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The supporting <code>*_setup()</code> calls and their implementations can be found in the
other <code>.c</code> files in
<a href="https://github.com/memfault/interrupt-renode-test-automation/tree/master/src"><code>src/</code></a>.</p>

<p>We can build our example firmware by invoking Make.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ make -j4
Building libopencm3
  GENHDR  include/libopencm3/stm32/f4/irq.json
  [...]
  AR      libopencm3_stm32f4.a
  LD    build/renode-example.elf
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we have our <code>renode-example.elf</code> file which we can load into Renode.</p>



<p>And then we see our firmware’s shell in the UART window of Renode.</p>

<p>
  <img width="700" src="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/img/test-automation-renode/renode-start.png">
</p>

<p>We can interact with it exactly as if it was connected to our computer over USB
serial! This would have made writing and testing the firmware for my <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/firmware-shell">Tiny
Shell</a> post <strong>much</strong> easier. I’m glad
I took the time now to learn Renode for the next time.</p>

<h2 id="anatomy-of-a-robot-framework-test">Anatomy of a Robot Framework Test</h2>

<p>Now that we’ve verified that the firmware works within Renode, it’s time to
think about how we are going to test our firmware. We have two shell commands,
<code>help</code> and <code>ping</code> which are probably useful “sanity” checks that we can test, so
let’s start with those.</p>

<p>If we write <code>ping</code> as a command into our shell, the following is printed:</p>



<p>It makes logical sense to test that this exact text is printed. Although
incredibly basic, this is the code that we are testing within our firmware:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>cli_command_ping</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>argc</span><span>,</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>argv</span><span>[])</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>shell_put_line</span><span>(</span><span>"PONG"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The following is a Robot Framework test file that calls the <code>ping</code> shell command
and expects that <code>PONG</code> is printed.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># test_basic.py<span>

            <section>
                <p>Encoding URIs* has always been a tough job. What exactly do we need to encode? Why are there sometimes <code>%20</code> and <code>+</code> signs in the URI? Why do we need to encode anyway? The answers to these questions are written in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986" target="_blank">RFC3986</a>. This article is a practical summary of the RFC.</p>
<p>* Note that URI is just a collective name for both URL and URN</p>

                <h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
                <p>These are the summarized steps that need to be taken when encoding and decoding a URI. An extended explanation can be found below this section.</p>
                <h3 id="encoding-and-decoding-uris">Encoding and decoding URIs</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. Split the URI into its components, based on the <a href="#generic-delimiters">generic delimiters</a>.
                    </li><li>2. Are there scheme-specific (e.g. http, ftp, file) or implementation-specific (a browser or web application) delimiters that need to be used for this URI? *
                        <ul>
                            <li>a. Yes, split the components into subcomponents based on the <a href="#subcomponent-delimiters">subcomponent delimiters</a>. 
                            </li><li>b. No, leave it.
                        </li></ul>
                    </li><li>3. Is there a protocol used that subscribes the encoding?
                        <ul>
                            <li>a. Yes, use the subscribed encoding by the protocol 
                            </li><li>b. No, use the same encoding as the surrounding text
                        </li></ul>
                    </li><li>4a. <strong>ENCODING</strong>: Encode every component and/or subcomponent with the chosen encoding (i.e. transform it into its percent-encoded hexadecimal pair). Use the <a href="#what-characters-to-encode-and-decode?">table</a> to encode all characters except the "never encode" and (depending on your subcomponent delimiters) the "sometimes encode" characters.
                    </li><li>4b. <strong>DECODING</strong>: Decode every component and/or subcomponent, convert all the percent-encoded octets to their decoded value by using the chosen encoding. 
                </li></ul>

                <p>* The RFC only describes the generic syntax of a URI. All URIs should follow that syntax, but every scheme-specific (e.g. http, ftp, file) or implementation-specific (a browser or web application that handles URIs) syntax can have additional rules about which characters are delimiters. It is therefor always necessary to know the additional delimiting rules to 100% correctly encode and decode.</p>

                <h2 id="the-long-read">The long read</h2>
                <h2 id="breaking-the-uri-into-pieces">Breaking the URI into pieces</h2>

<p>
A URI can be divided into components by certain characters that are used as delimiters. The RFC distinguishes generic delimiters and subcomponent delimiters.
</p>

<h3 id="generic-delimiters">Generic delimiters</h3>
<p>
The RFC reserves certain characters to be used as generic delimiters. Those are: <code>:</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>?</code>, <code>#</code>, <code>[</code>, <code>]</code>, <code>@</code>. These might seem familiar if we take a look at a simple URI.</p>

<code>
  foo://alice@example.com:8042/over/there?search=bar#nose
  \_/   \___/ \_________/ \__/ \________/ \________/ \__/
   |	  |        |       |        |         |       |
 scheme userinfo  host    port     path     query  fragment

</code>

<p>* In practice it is also possible to have an IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) instead of a registered host name, but for simplicity's sake we leave those out.<br>
** Old URIs can also contain a password in the userinfo <code>alice:password</code>, but that has been deprecated because of security.
</p> 


<p>When processing a URI into its components, a URI should be delimited using the generic delimiters based on a "first-match-wins" algorithm. The first <code>?</code> that is encountered after the path or host indicates the start of the query part. Other <code>?</code> that come after the first occurence, are not considered generic delimiters anymore, but data. This means that the following URI should be processed like this:</p>

<code>
 foo://alice@example.com:8042/ove@r/there;color=red;height=200?name?color=brown&amp;height=300#nose?
 \_/   \___/ \_________/ \__/ \______________________________/ \_________________________/ \___/
  |      |        |       |                  |                               |               |
scheme userinfo  host    port               path                           query         fragment

</code>

<p>Note that the second <code>@</code> (in the path) is treated as data in a path and not as a delimiter between userinfo and host. Same goes for the second and third <code>?</code> in the query and fragment parts.</p>

<h3 id="subcomponent-delimiters">Subcomponent delimiters</h3>
<p>In every component there are possible subcomponent delimiters defined. All the reserved subcomponent delimiters are: <code>!</code> <code>$</code> <code>&amp;</code> <code>'</code> <code>(</code> <code>)</code> <code>*</code> <code>+</code> <code>,</code> <code>;</code> <code>=</code>.</p>

<p>An implementation-specific entity (e.g. an API of a web application) can have additional delimitation rules with characters from the reserved subcomponent set. But this is only a rule of the implementation-specific entity itself. The RFC doesn't specify anything about which characters to use when, it only shows the allowed characters to be chosen as subcomponent delimiters.</p>

<p>Let's say that an API has two additional subcomponent rules. </p>
<ol>
<li>In the path, we distinguish key-value pairs coupled with the <code>=</code> character and delimited by the <code>;</code> character (back in the day the so called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/MatrixURIs.html">Matrix URIs</a>).<br>
</li><li>In the query, we distinguish key-value pairs coupled with the <code>=</code> character and delimited by the <code>&amp;</code> character (used for handling web forms).</li></ol>

<p> Further processing of the path and query component would give us:</p>

<code>
foo://alice@example.com:8042/ove@r/there;color=red;height=200?name?color=brown&amp;height=300#nose?
                                         \___/ \_/ \____/ \_/ \________/ \___/ \____/ \_/
                                           |    |    |     |      |        |     |     |
                                           k1   v1   k2    v2     k1       v1    k2    v2
                             \______________________________/ \_________________________/
                                             |                             |
                                            path                         query

</code>

<p>For processing of URIs it is always necessary to know the components of the URI (determined by the generic delimiters) and the subcomponents if there are any specified (determined by the subcomponent delimiters) by an API for example. Only then can the right semantics be determined.</p>


<h2 id="why-to-encode?">Why to encode?</h2>
<div><p>We would like to express as many characters of every language in URIs, so the whole world can use URIs. This is powerful. But not all applications that need to display URIs and their characters want to implement the complete <a href="https://www.unicode.org/charts/" target="_blank">Unicode Character Set</a>.</p><p>
Next to that, we've seen that the URI has a certain structure delimited by special characters. We still would like the possibility to use those special characters in a URI as data. In that case, we need to encode them.</p></div>

<h2 id="different-encoding-format">Different encoding formats</h2>
<p>When we determine that a character should be encoded, we should encode it in a percent-encoded hexadecimal pair (a so called percent-encoded octet). There are multiple encoding formats which encode characters from the UCS into 8-bit octets. A few examples are "UTF-8", "UTF-16" or "ISO-8859-1" (not all of them cover the whole UCS). When we want to transform the character <code>æ</code> to the percent-encoded octet in UTF-8, we see in <a href="https://www.fileformat.info/info/charset/UTF-8/list.htm" target="_blank">this table</a> that it has two hexadecimal pairs: <code>C3A6</code>. This would result in an encoding of the form <code>%C3%A6</code>.
When we would transform the same letter <code>æ</code> to the percent-encoded octet in "ISO-8859-1", we see in <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/miles/iso8859.html#ISO" target="_blank">this table</a> that it has one hexadecimal pair: <code>E6</code>. The resulting encoding would look like this <code>%E6</code>.</p>

<p>Different encoding formats will generate different percent-encoded octets. Therefor it is always necessary to determine the encoding that is used to encode or decode.</p>

<h2 id="which-encoding-to-use?">Which encoding to use?</h2>
<p>It could be that a scheme or certain protocol enforces the use of a certain encoding. In that case that encoding is used. When there is nothing subscribed, the same encoding should be used as the surrounding text of the URI.</p> 
                    
<h2 id="what-characters-to-encode-and-decode?">What characters to encode and decode?</h2>
<p>When a URI is split into the right components we are ready to encode! For every component there is a defined list of which characters should never be encoded, which characters should sometimes be encoded because of the implementation and which characters should sometimes be encoded because of their special use in certain parts of the URI. In the following table all the characters from the RFC are summarized and separated.</p>

<div><p><strong>How should we read this table?</strong><br>
Column 2: For every component there are certain characters always allowed and should never be encoded.</p><p>
Column 3: If some of the implementation-specific characters are delimiters and you also want to use those characters as data, you should encode those characters. If none of the implementation-specific characters are delimiters, you can use all characters as data and don't have to encode anything. </p><p>
Column 4: There are some characters that have special meaning within a component and should always be encoded when used as data.</p><p>
Column 5: Indicates if encoding into a percent-encoded octet is even allowed within that component. If not, encoding is never done.
</p></div>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong><br>
Let's take a look at an example. We have a UTF-8 encoded website <code>http://foo.com</code> where the HTTP protocol doesn't subscribe any implementation-specific delimiters. We have a page on our website with the name <code>bar&amp;fuz</code> (path), a subpage called <code>(fux*)</code> (path) and a query with the name <code>crux&amp;crux</code>. The URI should be displayed like this:<br>
</p>
<code>
http://foo.com/bar&amp;fuz/(fux*)?crux&amp;crux

This hacker is responsible for stealing sensitive data from governments and companies totaling over 300 in number and across 44 countries. About $1.5 million was realized from this cyber attack.</p><p>The invisible god hacker, also known as Fxmsp has been revealed to be a 37-year old citizen of Kazakhstan, Andrey Turchin.&nbsp; Sometime in 2019, Andrey Turchin ran adverts of source and access codes of top digital companies that he had stolen online.</p><p>Among the advertised companies were Trend Micro, McAfee, and Symantec – this drew the attention of many and that was how he became popular. The invisible god sold these source and access codes for $300,000 – $1 million. Millions of dollars were lost due to this. In addition to advertising, he also asserted that he’ll make his customers invisible so they can’t be traced.</p><p><strong>Read Also: <a href="https://secureblitz.com/protect-your-organization-from-internal-threats/">Breachers Gonna Breach: Protect Your Organization From Internal Threats</a></strong></p><p>According to reports, his true identity of the invisible god hacker had been long discovered but for reasons relating to him being a foreign hacker, it was kept sealed. Contained in his criminal charges are five felony charges which date back to 2018. It was also around that time that his true identity was discovered.</p><p>Following a ruling by a judge in the Western District of Washington, his charges were unsealed. This was provoked by Group-IB, a cybersecurity company. Last month, Group-IB released a report which revealed the identity of the invisible god hacker, Andrey Turchin.</p><p>Group-IB traced his first appearance on the web to be in 2016. He was tagged as a hacker with so much technical know-how but less business knowledge. By 2017, the invisible god hacker started his advertising with data of hotels and banks.</p><p>Dmitry Volkov from Group-IB described Andrey Turchin as “one of the most prolific sellers of access to corporate networks in the history of the Russian-speaking cybercriminal underground”. Currently, the UK’s National Crime Agency and FBI are now involved in the case as well as some security companies in the private sector.</p><div><ul><li><a href="#abh_about">Author</a></li><li><a href="#abh_posts">Recent Posts</a></li></ul><div><section itemscope="" itemprop="author" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><p><a href="https://secureblitz.com/author/johnray/" title="John Raymond"> <img src="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/gravatar/john-raymond.jpg?w=250&amp;ssl=1" alt="John Raymond" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/gravatar/john-raymond.jpg?w=250&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></p><div><p>John Raymond is an author, writer, and scriptwriter.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the last few years, I've worked on open source distributed systems in Go at Google. I've thought a lot about dependency management, systems configuration, programming languages, and compilers.</p><p>Again and again, I saw the same fundamental data structure underpinning these technologies: the <strong>directed acyclic graph</strong>. The most frustrating part was modeling graph-based configuration in languages that optimized for hierarchical data structures. That's why I created Virgo.</p><p>Virgo is a graph-based configuration language. It has two main features: edge definitions and vertex definitions. The Virgo configuration file then parses into an adjacency list. You can clearly achieve similar results from adding additional conventions and restrictions on YAML or JSON. Much like YAML optimized for human readability, Virgo optimizes for natural graph readability, editability, and representation. </p><pre><code>// config.vgo

a -&gt; b, c, d -&gt; e &lt;- f, g</code></pre><figure><img src="https://matt-rickard.com/content/images/2020/07/Note-Jul-7--2020-copy.png" alt=""><figcaption>A graphical representation of the Virgo graph</figcaption></figure><p><em>Virgo is open to proposals and language changes. Please open up an issue to start a discussion at </em><a href="https://github.com/r2d4/virgo">https://github.com/r2d4/virgo</a><em>.</em></p><p>Graphs are everywhere in configuration management. One graph that engineers may be familiar with is the <code>Makefile</code> target graph. The <code>make</code> tool topologically sorts the targets that it resolves which lets it build the files in order. Virgo's CLI or Go library allow developers to replicate this feature easily.</p><figure><pre><code>clean -&gt; parser, lexer -&gt; "src files" -&gt; test

parser = `goyacc parser.y`
lexer  = `golex lex.l`
clean  = `rm lex.yy.go parser.go || true`
test   = `go test-v`
"src files"  = `go build ./...`</code></pre><figcaption>A simple example to build the Virgo CLI tool with the language itself.</figcaption></figure><p>There are two entrypoints to parsing the Virgo file. You can use the Go library found in the same repository to parse the file into a native Go struct. There is also a published CLI binary that exposes the parsing function for other environments.</p><figure><pre><code>package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
	"log"
	"os"
	"strings"

	"github.com/pkg/errors"
	"matt-rickard.com/virgo/pkg/virgo"

func main() {
	if err := run("config.go"); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
}

func run(fname string) error {
	f, err := ioutil.ReadFile(fname)
	if err != nil {
		return errors.Wrap(err, "reading file")
	}
	g, err := virgo.Parse(f)
	if err != nil {
		return errors.Wrap(err, "parsing virgo file")
	}

	nodes, err := virgo.TopSort(g)
	if err != nil {
		return errors.Wrap(err, "topological sort")
	}

	out := []string{}
	for _, n := range nodes {
		out = append(out, g.Vertices[n]...)
	}
	fmt.Println(strings.Join(out, "\n"))
	return nil
}</code></pre><figcaption>Code snippet to read a Virgo file, topologically sort the graph and print out the vertex definitions for each node in order.</figcaption></figure><figure><pre><code>$ virgo run build.vgo</code></pre><figcaption>Or build with the CLI tool</figcaption></figure><p>One operation we frequently want to perform on graphs is a topological sort. A topological sorting is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge u -&gt; v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.</p><p>The CLI tool topologically sorts the graph, and can even start from a particular vertex (analogous to a Make target).</p><pre><code>$ virgo run build.vgo:parser</code></pre><p>Build systems are not the only type of configuration schema that can benefit from a graphical representation. Some other examples include:</p><ul><li>deployment of microservices</li><li>docker build instructions</li><li>continuous integration pipelines</li><li>package dependencies</li><li>git commits</li></ul><p>For full documentation on the language and features of Virgo, visit the GitHub page <a href="https://github.com/r2d4/virgo">https://github.com/r2d4/virgo</a>.</p></div><div>

<p>SQL is one of the most in-demand technical skills in the workplace today. Developed back in the 1970s, it is still the way we interface most of our data systems today. Regardless of what drag and drop tools come around or what new query paradigms try to overtake it, it has remained.</p>
<p>Many modern database technologies we will talk about today in this article are constantly having to comply with SQL policies vs. SQL needs to be updated.</p>
<p>However, this isn’t to say the SQL landscape hasn’t changed a lot in the past few decades and doesn’t continue to evolve. This is one reason SQL has stuck around so much. It grows and evolves with the times.</p>
<p>This article will summarize some of the major trends currently occurring in the SQL and data analytics world that are impacting teams across the world.</p>
<p>We will be discussing how SQL is becoming more collaborative and open. How the majority of databases our world continues to operate on are open source or switching to open source. As well as bringing up a few technologies you may not have heard of but should watch out for.</p>
<p>With so much going on in the technical world, this will help provide a clear picture of some of the more important changes in the SQL and data world.</p>
<h3><a href="https://dev.to/seattledataguy/what-is-trending-in-the-big-data-and-sql-world-in-2020-5c0n#sql-is-not-just-for-data-engineers-and-analysts-in-datadriven-companies" name="sql-is-not-just-for-data-engineers-and-analysts-in-datadriven-companies"></a>SQL Is Not Just For Data Engineers And Analysts In Data-Driven Companies</h3>
<p>If you have ever worked at a FAANG or even technology-driven start-up like Instacart, then you have probably realized that data drives everything.</p>
<p>To the point that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dataquest.io/blog/data-analyst-skills/">analysts</a>, PMs, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.departmentofproduct.com/blog/sql-skills-for-product-managers/">product managers</a>&nbsp;are starting to understand SQL out of necessity. SQL is the language of data and if you want to interact with data, you need to know it.</p>
<p>Do you want to easily figure out the average amount of time a user spends on your product, but don’t want to wait for an analyst? You better figure out how to run a query.</p>
<p>This ability to run queries easily is also driven by the fact that SQL editors no longer need to be installed. With cloud-based data, warehouses come SaaS SQL editors. We will talk about a SaaS SQL editor more in the next section.</p>
<p>However, the importance here is you don’t have to wait 30 minutes to install and editor and deal with all the hassle of managing it.</p>
<p>Now you can just go to a URL and access your team’s data warehouse. This has allowed anyone in the company easy access to their data.</p>
<p>We know both from anecdotal experience as well as the fact that indeed.com’s tracking in 2019 has shown a steady requirement for SQL skill sets for the past 5 years.</p>
<p>Overall, we foresee a future where not just big tech companies are using SQL and analytics to drive good decisions. For that, we will need tools that make it easier for anyone to access their companies data.</p>
<h2><a href="https://dev.to/seattledataguy/what-is-trending-in-the-big-data-and-sql-world-in-2020-5c0n#sql-and-analytics-are-becoming-more-collaborative%C2%A0" name="sql-and-analytics-are-becoming-more-collaborative%C2%A0"></a>SQL and Analytics Are Becoming More Collaborative</h2>

<p>SQL and analytics are becoming more collaborative. As discussed earlier, getting insights from data is becoming more prolific. That means more people are getting involved in creating queries, analytics, and metrics.</p>
<p>Collaborative work started with products like Google Sheets. The trend has continued to expand into SaaS products like Figma which is collaborative design and&nbsp;<a href="https://popsql.com/?utm_source=seattledataguy">PopSQL</a>&nbsp;which is collaborative SQL.</p>
<p>Technologies like PopSQL offer the ability for your team to collaborate and track your work on queries easily through folders and version control.</p>
<p>Now you don’t have to worry about someone accidentally changing your query on a report or dashboard. Version control, allows you to revert what the query was at a previously saved state. This ensures that your team is constantly on the same page as far as SQL and the logic you are using to calculate your metrics.</p>
<p>You also can easily share queries, update them, fork them, and visualize data.</p>
<p>Also, tools like Figma, Google Sheets, and PopSQL integrate easily with other collaborative tools like Slack. These integrations further allow your team to share charts, queries, designs, and insights with ease.</p>
<p>Your team can easily see what work everyone else is doing, the changes they are making, and understanding why they are making the changes.</p>
<p>With the concept of remote work becoming more and more of a reality for many companies, having tools that make it easy to collaborate will be important.</p>
<p>In the end, technologies like PopSQL are a great step in the direction of self-service analytics because they put the power of querying data outside of just the analysts and the data engineers’ hands.</p>
<h3><a href="https://dev.to/seattledataguy/what-is-trending-in-the-big-data-and-sql-world-in-2020-5c0n#open-source-remains-the-most-popular-database" name="open-source-remains-the-most-popular-database"></a>Open Source Remains The Most popular Database</h3>

<p>Paid licensed database management systems like Oracle and MSSQL might seem like very popular options for teams to develop upon. However, MySQL and Postgres, two open-source database management systems are currently the most popular options for developers to use.</p>
<p>According to a survey conducted in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eversql.com/most-popular-databases-in-2018-according-to-stackoverflow-survey/">2018</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eversql.com/most-popular-databases-in-2020/">2020</a>&nbsp;by EverSQL, MySQL continues to be the most popular database management system to develop on. Also, Postgres has recently surpassed MSSQL as the second most popular database according to Stackoverflow.</p>
<p>Postgres is what is called the object-relational database management system or (ORDBMS). This takes on similar properties as object-oriented programming where you can have classes and inheritance. Also, some other nifty features about Postgres are that it allows for arrays and has some PubSub abilities.</p>
<p>This shift to open source isn’t new. However, the&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/migration-complete-amazons-consumer-business-just-turned-off-its-final-oracle-database/">fact is that many companies are starting to drop the Oracles and Microsofts&nbsp;</a>for the free option. They are opting into paying cloud costs vs. paying licensing cost.</p>
<p>Overall, we are seeing a lot of shifts in the choice of database developers are picking.</p>

<p>Although Postgres has often been a common choice for companies choosing to switch from Oracle to an Open Source solution, Postgres was not developed with Cloud infrastructure and complexities in mind.</p>
<p>This forces teams to develop complex cloud infrastructure to manage applications that are being used all across the world.</p>
<p>But, there are other open-source solutions.&nbsp;<a href="https://thenewstack.io/yugabyte-new-database-solve-sql-vs-nosql-dilemma/">In July 2019 YugabyteDB went 100% open source</a>. Now many of you are probably asking(especially if you are in the US), what is YugabyteDB?</p>
<p>YugaByte’s proprietary document-oriented storage format — a heavily customized form of&nbsp;<a href="http://rocksdb.org/">RocksDB</a>, which provides for low-latency access and a high density of data. It runs on popular and known APIs.</p>
<p>YugaByte aim’s to fill in all the gaps. You want a NoSQL database that also is ACID, then Yugabyte is looking to take over that market.</p>
<p>It is looking to solve the problems that developers have when deploying SQL databases like MySQL that require sharding and complex infrastructure to run multi-region systems.</p>
<p>YugaByteDB does so by auto-sharding and loading balancing as well as several other features that take advantage of the cloud’s first approach.</p>
<p>So why is YugaByte in this update if it has been around since 2016?</p>
<p>This is because Wipro ventures invested 30 million in Yugabyte earlier this month. Also, Wipro plans to take Yugabyte’s open-source SQL database to its clients. There are 1000 new possible companies that could be using Yugabyte.</p>
<p>Although Yugabyte is not on EverSQL’s survey results. In a couple of years, with more traction and users it may be. Now, truth be told, a database that solves all the problems of both NoSQL and standard relational databases would be a miracle. So in many ways, we are surprised there isn’t larger adoption.</p>
<p>We will be curious to see if in the next few years Yugabyte is like many of the other miracle technologies promised to solve all of your organization’s problems or if it will disappear like so many others.</p>

<p>In the tech world, there are two main uses of databases: applications, and analytics.</p>
<p>These two major use cases benefit from different database systems as well as different database designs.</p>
<p>In particular, analytical databases that run millions of calculations for thousands of analysts, data scientists, and data engineers at a single company often benefit from having some form of distributed or parallel component. Think Redshift and how it relies on MPP(massively parallel processing).</p>
<p>But there are a lot of new SQL and NoSQL technologies coming into this space.</p>
<p>For example, Starburst, a fork of Facebook’s Presto, received an<a href="https://www.crn.com/news/applications-os/starburst-collects-42m-in-funding-as-big-data-startup-ramps-up-product-development-channel-expansion">&nbsp;additional $42 million of funding.</a>&nbsp;Starburst is a spin-off of a Facebook open-source project(Presto). Starburst’s goal is to create an enterprise version of Presto since Presto in itself does not have access management, connectors to enterprise systems like Teradata, Snowflake, and DB2, or a management console where users can configure the cluster to auto-scale, for example.</p>
<p>This makes utilizing Presto on its own difficult if not impossible for most companies. This is a shame because Presto allows you to easily run queries across databases without loading the data into a data warehouse.</p>
<p>So the recent funding in Starbursts is great to see. We look forward to seeing where this technology will go and hope that more companies can take advantage of Presto without all the hassle of having to manage all of presto’s complexities.</p>
<p>While we are talking about distributed database systems like Presto, another interesting development this month&nbsp;<a href="http://spark.apache.org/releases/spark-release-3-0-0.html">was the release of Spark 3.0</a>. With this new version of Spark comes many enhancements. Many of these enhancements have been geared to allow Spark SQL to become more ANSI SQL compliant.</p>
<p>This is an important note. One pattern that seems to remain true is that you can’t get rid of SQL as is. Many tools and technologies have tried to develop their query languages. However, at the end of the day, SQL remains. Unlike many programming languages that have died out.</p>
<p>SQL remains the language of data.</p>

<p>A diff algorithm outputs the set of differences between two inputs. These algorithms are the basis of a number of commonly used developer tools. Yet understanding the inner workings of diff algorithms is rarely necessary to use said tools. Git is one example where a developer can read, commit, pull, and merge diffs without ever understanding the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-repack">underlying diff algorithm</a>. Having said that there is very limited knowledge on the subject across the developer community.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is not to detail how <a href="https://ably.com/">Ably</a> programmatically implemented a diff algorithm across its distributed <a href="https://ably.com/platform">pub/sub messaging platform</a>, but rather to share our research and provide systematic knowledge on the subject of diff algorithms that could be useful to implementers of diff/delta/patch functionality.</p>

<p>For Ably customers like Tennis Australia or HubSpot, <a href="https://ably.com/blog/message-delta-compression">Message Delta Compression</a> reduces the bandwidth required to transmit realtime messages by sending only the diff of a message. This means subscribers receive only the changes since the last update instead of the entire stream. &nbsp;Sending fewer bits is more bandwidth-efficient and reduces overall costs and latencies for our customers. To develop this feature we needed to implement a diff algorithm that supported binary encoding and didn’t sacrifice latency when generating deltas.</p>
<figure><img src="https://files.ably.io/ghost/prod/2020/06/delta-savings-1.png"><figcaption>The benefits of providing deltas for realtime messaging</figcaption></figure><h2 id="diff-algorithms">Diff algorithms</h2>
<h3 id="purpose-and-usage">Purpose and usage</h3>
<p>The output of a diff algorithm is called <em>patch</em> or <em>delta</em>. The delta format might be human readable (text) or only machine readable (binary). Human readable format is usually employed for tracking and reconciling changes to human readable text like source code. Binary format is usually space optimized and used in order to save bandwidth. It transfers only the set of changes to an old version of the data already available to a recipient as opposed to transferring all the new data. The formal term for this is <em>delta encoding</em>.</p>
<h3 id="binary-vs-text">Binary vs. text</h3>
<div><p>There seems to be a common misconception that diff algorithms are specialized based on the type of input. The truth is, <strong>diff algorithms are omnivorous and can handle any input</strong>, as long as the input can simply be treated as a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049#section-2.2.2">string of bytes</a>. That string might consist of the English alphabet or opaque binary data. Any diff algorithm will generate a correct delta given two input strings in the same alphabet.</p><p>The misconception that a different algorithm is required to handle binary data arises from commonly used diff/merge tools treating text and binary as if they were actually different. These tools generally aim to provide a human-readable delta, and as such focus on human-readable input to the exclusion of binary data. The assumption is that binary data is not human-readable so the delta between two binary data inputs will also not be human readable, and thus rendering it human-readable is deemed to be too much effort. Equality is the only relevant output in the case of binary diffs, and as such, a simple bit-by-bit comparison is considered to be the fastest and most appropriate solution. &nbsp;This categorization of algorithms by the efficiency of solution causes a partitioning of inputs into different types.</p><p>Another aspect that adds to the confusion is the line-based, word-based, and character-based classification of textual diff outputs produced by diff/merge tools. A diff algorithm that is described as “line-based” gives the impression that it produces “text-only” output, and that this means that it accepts only text input and never binary data inputs. &nbsp;However, line/word/character-based is not a characteristic of a diff algorithm itself; rather, it is an optimization applied to the input before feeding it to the actual diff algorithm. </p><p>Because new lines and spaces have meaning as separators in human-readable text, the diff tool can segment the string based on the hashes of the lines or words in the text. This hash string is much shorter than the original text thus saving time at the cost of reduced granularity of the diff. &nbsp;Additionally, line-based granularity might actually even increase human readability of the diff in some cases.</p><p>However, if the input is known to be opaque binary data, there are no meaningful separators nor human-readable diff to display, so this optimization cannot be applied. &nbsp;Algorithms <em>capable</em> of optimizing human-readable data before it becomes an input are thus prone to getting miscast as wholly <em>incapable</em> of processing binary data. &nbsp;The truth remains, however: apart from pre-processing optimization, both binary and human-readable data can be treated as strings-of-bytes inputs and easily processed.</p></div>
<h2 id="three-generations-of-diff-algorithms">Three generations of diff algorithms</h2>
<p>The notion of how a diff should be generated has evolved over time.</p>
<figure><img src="https://files.ably.io/ghost/prod/2020/06/delta-arrow-1.jpg"></figure><h3 id="string-to-string-correction-or-insert-delete">String-to-string Correction or Insert/Delete</h3>
<p>The first generation of diff algorithms solved the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String-to-string_correction_problem">string-to-string correction problem</a> and emerged in the 60s and 70s. Each of the two inputs is interpreted as a string composed of characters in some alphabet. The output is a sequence of character edits, most commonly insert/delete operations, that could be applied to one of the inputs to transform it to the other input. That makes this class of algorithms particularly suitable for generating human readable diffs on human readable inputs, e.g. different versions of the same text/source code resulting from actual edits being made over time. What helps even further is that in theory, and more often than not in practice, there is more than one minimal length sequence of edit operations that gets the job done. Various heuristics can be used to pick the edit sequences that most closely resembles actual human made edits.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145%2F321796.321811">Wagner-Fischer algorithm</a> set the foundation for this generation of diff algorithms. The <a href="http://www.xmailserver.org/diff2.pdf">Myers Algorithm</a> is the latest improvement and the de facto standard for the generation and is currently used in multiple diff tools including the GNU diff utility.This generation of algorithms usually finds either the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem">longest common subsequence</a> or the minimal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance#Common_algorithm">edit distance</a> (usually that would be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Levenshtein distance</a>) and uses these to generate the sequence of edits needed to transform one input into the other.</p>
<h2 id="block-move-or-copy-insert">Block move or copy/insert</h2>
<h3 id="pure-block-move">Pure block move</h3>
<p>The next generation of diff algorithms was based on seemingly small optimizations over the previous generation. The character edits were upgraded to block-of-characters edits. That is, instead of expressing the diff as operations on single characters, the diff would be expressed as operations on blocks of characters. The operations are usually copy and insert where blocks of data that appear in both inputs are recorded in the delta as copied from one input to the other. The blocks unique to one of the inputs are recorded as insertions. This approach was first proposed by <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.470.9110&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Walter Tichy</a>.</p>
<h3 id="compression-based-block-move">Compression based block move</h3>
<figure><img src="https://files.ably.io/ghost/prod/2020/06/delta-messages-5.png"><figcaption>How Ably generates deltas in its pub/sub messaging platform using the block move approach</figcaption></figure><p>At first glance, the block move approach seems like a minor optimization. However, it has significant impact once you take into account the possibility that some block(s) of characters can repeat in some or both of the inputs. Thinking about diff generation in terms of copying blocks of data and keeping an eye out for the same block repeating more than once opens the door to using compression algorithms to generate a diff and delta file.</p>
<p>Compression algorithms do just that: find the biggest possible repeating blocks of data and replace each consecutive occurrence with a reference to the first occurrence. Blocks of data that never repeat are copied straight to the output. Compression algorithms are in essence block move algorithms.</p>
<p>If the block move analysis done by a compression algorithm is performed on both inputs of a diff algorithm, it will easily identify the common parts of both inputs. It will also point out which blocks of data are unique, that is different in both of the inputs. Once you have this data, it is straightforward to come up with a sequence of block copy/delete operations that will convert one of the inputs to the other one.</p>
<p>The major benefit of using compression algorithms is the greatly reduced size of the delta. A block of data will never appear more than once in the delta. It might be referred to multiple times but the actual data of the block will be contained in the delta only once. That is a major difference from the preceding approaches. It should also be mentioned that the delta size is reduced at the cost of reduced human readability.</p>
<p><strong>xDelta</strong>, <strong>zDelta</strong>, <strong>Bentley/McIlroy</strong> are widely used de-facto standard implementations of diff algorithms of this generation.</p>
<h3 id="latest-upgrades">Latest Upgrades</h3>
<p>This would be the latest generation of diff algorithms. Most of its members exist only in research papers and don’t have any commercial implementations yet. They are largely based on the block move approach but offer substantial implementation optimizations, which result in claims of double-digit factor improvements in speed over the previous generation.</p>
<p>These optimizations are mostly focused on efficiently finding matching blocks of data in the two inputs. Various incremental hashing or compression-like techniques (such as suffix-trees) are used to achieve this purpose.</p>
<p><strong>edelta</strong>, <strong>ddelta</strong>, <strong>bsdiff</strong> could be assigned to this generation of diff algorithms</p>
<h2 id="delta-generation-algorithms-currently-in-use"><strong>Delta generation algorithms currently in use</strong></h2>
<p>This is a short overview of the tools and libraries focused on efficient delta/patch file generation and available at the time of writing (June 2019). Various other existing implementations of general purpose diff algorithms in different languages are omitted here for brevity’s sake.</p>

    <p>After watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417299/">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a> I wanted to experience bending the elements just like in the show.
Of course actually doing this is impossible but could a game give that feeling?</p>

<p><img src="https://fraser-greenlee.github.io/images/katara_waterbend.gif" alt="GIF of katara water bending." title="See the smooth movement of the water."></p>

<p><a href="https://coronalabs.com/">Corona Labs</a> lets you make 2D cross-platform games and it comes with a realistic particle simulator.</p>

<p>It comes with this demo below, <strong>click below</strong> to try it!</p>

<!--  -->
<figure>
    
</figure>
<!--  -->

<p>This gives some interaction with particles but doesn’t create the smooth flows of water you see in the show.</p>

<p>It works by making all particles within the orange box match the box’s velocity.
This is done by repeatedly running <a href="https://docs.coronalabs.com/api/type/ParticleSystem/queryRegion.html"><code>queryRegion</code></a> which sets particle velocity is a given region.
It allows not just setting particle velocity but incrimenting it as well.</p>

<p>Lets picture the first GIF but with imagined forces on the water drawn as arrows.</p>

<p><img src="https://fraser-greenlee.github.io/images/katara_waterbend_arrows.gif" alt="Katara water bending." title="The arrows denote forces on the water."></p>

<p>Now to get a bending effect we can recreate the above GIF it with multiple <code>queryRegion</code> boxes.</p>

<p>Using the grid above, when a user taps the screen a ring of cells are updated with each pointing to the cursor.
To ensure the cursor is always in the middle of a grid cell the whole grid is shifted as the cursor moves between cells.</p>

<p>For cell values I make the magnitude’s greater for further out cells as I found this better holds the particles together.
To get long streams of water I gradually decrease old cell values.</p>

<p>Below I show the cell values with white arrows (longer for greator velocity incriments).</p>

<p><strong>Try water bending below.</strong></p>

<p>Then by making particles with different physical properties you get different materials.
Ice is a solid group of particles, green acid mixes colour with the blue water, slime is a sticky group of particles while mud is viscous.</p>

<p>This could be part of a really great game, I hope to work on it more but I’m not sure I have the time.
For now I’m releasing the <a href="https://github.com/Fraser-Greenlee/benders">code</a> and hoping someone is inspired by this mechanic to make a great game.</p>

				<p>Whatever programming language you use, sooner or later you will want to find out what happens in your program at runtime. The objectives of obtaining such information may differ from developer to developer and from user to user, but whatever the objective one thing remains consistent - you will need the logs of your program to achieve it. Like many before us, we experienced this need.</p><p>Considering the fact that all of our almost-monolithic applications run inside docker containers, at first, work was organized to collect logs from these containers.</p><p>A critical requirement for collecting logs was the need for <strong>an aggregate</strong> search when responding to incidents - ddos ​​attacks, abnormal user behavior, error spikes given to mobile applications, and research on penetration attempts. What free solution can beautifully display our logs at consecutive intervals? We settled on ElasticSearch along with Kibana, which provides out-of-the-box fast aggregate searches within consecutive time intervals.</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/aggregation-2.png" alt=""></figure><p>When inserting non-single records in ElasticSearch, ElasticSearch insists on inserting data with a large set of records (batches) in the format that ElasticSearch defines.</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/Logging-Arc0-1.svg" alt=""></figure><p>As you can see in the picture above, we know the sending point and the destination point of our structured messages (logs). And we want to minimize the number of programs that will convert message formats - from docker-container to the message set format that ElasticSearch requires.</p><p>Elasticsearch for such cases has a special solution - Logstash, thus forming the famous ELK abbreviation (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).</p><p>Among the possible solutions for integrating Logstash together with docker <a href="https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/gelf/">in the documentation</a> we can find the GELF (graylog extended format logging) message format. Let's look at the final log transfer stream.</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/Logging-Arc1.0-1.svg" alt=""><figcaption>initial application logs dataflow</figcaption></figure><p>Inside the docker containers there is a web application written in ruby ​​(best language in the world, btw) that processes each request in a separate thread. To prevent slow clients from slowing down application threads, we, like many, use nginx. Therefore, we would also like to receive request logs from nginx.</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/Logging-Arc1.1-1.svg" alt=""><figcaption>application logs dataflow</figcaption></figure><p>This stack is relatively quick to configure, without blocking the continuous improvements that are still required.</p><hr><h2 id="logging-2-0">Logging 2.0</h2><p>There were several issues with configured logging 1.0.:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>when reconfiguring Logstash, we lost logs</li>
<li>when reconfiguring ElasticSearch, we lost logs</li>
<li>during abnormal work of ElasticSearch, we lost logs</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The need for long-term storage of logs while maintaining the <strong>highest possible availability</strong> forced us to search for the ideal application logging scheme.</p><h2 id="gathering-requirements">Gathering requirements</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>availability in case of emergency<br>
In any emergency mode, it is important for us to be able to find the cause of the problem. It's impossible to do this without the logs.</li>
<li>reliability in normal operation<br>
in normal mode, we would like to have reliable log delivery, so that looking at the logs according to certain criteria, we can always easily find them and not think why they disappeared, and sometimes they disappeared.</li>
<li>short time management<br>
On average, we have 1M active users per backend developer, and it is more profitable for a business to spend our time developing user features than supporting infrastructure (for example, restoring a cluster after unexpected error)</li>
<li>business doesn't like vendor-locks</li>
<li>cost</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="system-architecture">System architecture</h2><p>The first reflex thought that appears in the head when required to provide maximum availability.</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/Logging-availability.svg" alt=""></figure><p>We put a balancer in front of Logstash (haproxy or a ready-made aws solution if you are inside aws), instead of a single elasticsearch instance, we make an elasticsearch cluster. But in this scenario, we begin to pay at least x2 for processing logs, and this comes on top of our reconfiguration and maintenance efforts. So, we increase availability, but somehow it is rapidly becoming very expensive. What do we do?</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/images.jpeg" alt=""></figure><p>Maybe we should look at ready-made solutions? Here is the list of tools we considered at least in passing:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>Riemann</li>
<li>SaaS log management
<ul>
<li>cloudwatch(AWS)</li>
<li>kinesis(AWS)</li>
<li>DataDog</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>fluentd</li>
<li>heka, logstash</li>
<li>rsyslog, syslog-ng</li>
<li>there was probably something else</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>And this the moment when one realises the value of having very smart colleagues who are there to challenge and to help you. The proposed solution turned out to be so concise, simple and amazing that one doesn't immediately realize all of its beauty.</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/Logging-Arc2.0pre.svg" alt=""></figure><p>Let's just write to files, then we can ensure the availability of logs at critical moments, with the advantages of the existing solution.</p><p>You can write to files on the local instance and send all the information to a remote machine at the same time. Therefore, the "Magic Solution" in the general case, we had as follows.</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/Logging-Arc2.1pre.svg" alt=""></figure><p>In emergency situations, we can always make 'grep' and find the source of an emergency, even if the main log collector stops working for us (we provide availability).</p><p>But here we recall that Logstash can take logs from files, watching for changes in them. Thus, we can do this and, at a minimum, get rid of the need for a balancer and Elasticearch cluster (the cost criteria is still important for us).</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/Logging-Arc2.2pre.svg" alt=""></figure><p>And then the question arose: did people really not solve such problems with centralizing file logs before, because we all know that on Linux all logs are in /var/log. This means that earlier developers and administrators had problems collecting and sending them to a centralized log server.</p><p>After an extended study of probably the longest-lasting open source project in logging systems - rsyslog, it became clear that it could easily replace Logstash and our logging system could be made exceptionally simple. But for a start, we had a smooth transition to logging 2.0</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/Logging-Arc2-transition-2.svg" alt=""></figure><p><strong>So we got to the architecture, where on each instance there will be a local rsyslog log collector that sends logs to the central rsyslog server, which in the future can write logs to files and Elasticsearch at the same time. And it seems that this satisfies all our requirements that we set for the logging system.</strong></p><p>To test the solution’s health, we decided to test rsyslog to collect all the logs from our instances, and we have up to 150 of them. It looked like enough to test the health of the whole solution. If the solution justifies itself, then at the same time we will still be able to centralize the collection of logs from instances so that it is possible to resolve incidents during the upcoming <a href="https://dev.sweatco.in/aws-autoscaling-with-ease/">autoscaling</a>.</p><p>After testing and the final transition, our log collection system was completely transformed and met all the requirements that we presented to it.</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/Logging-Arc2.0-final.svg" alt=""></figure><p>In further articles I will talk about why rsyslog satisfies our reliability requirement, about rsyslog inter-server communication, and also look at how logs are transferred inside Linux from byte to byte and, of course, configuration of rsyslog.</p><p>I hope that after reading a series of articles on centralizing logs, you can do it faster, cheaper, more reliable, and without losing availability.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>After reading the article, it may seem that at some point I picked up the logging system and did everything alone, but this is far from the case.</p><p>In the process of moving to our ideal logging system, we constantly discussed the pros and cons of different solutions, and each of us defended the requirement close to them or changed the configuration parameters they needed, asked intriguing questions or sent us back to the original set of requirements.</p><p>In conclusion, I want to thank my colleagues for a creative atmosphere and for their advice and hand-on help which allowed us to create such a system together.</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/06/alex.f201381a-1.png" alt=""><figcaption>Alex - for brilliant ideas and creative atmosphere</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/vlad.d6652863-1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Vlad - because we sleep peacefully at night</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/alexander.710cffd7-1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Alexandr - for general assistance in improving logging</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/ilya.24ad6b15-1.png" alt=""><figcaption>Ilya - for the promotion of important tasks</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/06/oleg.80ee4ad7-1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>and our founder Oleg for making this article more friendly to you</figcaption></figure>

<p>I recently left my high-paying job as a restaurant manager with the intent on creating my own destiny. </p>



<p>But why? Being in charge of such a large organization had all the trappings anyone might want: money, power, status, a comfortable two-bedroom top-floor apartment, and all that comes with such a lifestyle.</p>



<p>I really thought I found the key to success.  I was living the life. And yet, I wasn’t happy. </p>



<p>Not even close.</p>



<p><em>(NOTE: This post, being available for public consumption, may render me totally unemployable. That is my goal. You might ask ‘why?’ By the end you’ll be asking ‘why not?’)</em></p>







<p>Beginning in the early months of 2018, I spent two years as the general manager of a brand new restaurant on the edge of a college campus. The place was huge, and the challenge was immense: 9,000 sq ft, 80+ employees, $4 million+ in revenue per year. The owner of the restaurant rarely spent time there, so from day one I felt it was solely my responsibility to make it a success. </p>



<p>I was in charge of everything, from setting up the new restaurant, to hiring and training hundreds of employees. From daily inventory and ordering, to developing an atmosphere and a community that would set the business on a trajectory to be the hottest thing in the region. </p>



<p>The work was hard, and at times, soul-crushing. But the process of building something meaningful had always appealed to me, and this was my big chance to make my mark. </p>



<p>I felt that I would work there for a long time. I could pay off my student loan debt, save money for my own restaurant one day, and I would never have to worry about money ever again. <em>This path was my destiny</em> …is what I kept telling myself.</p>



<h4>Origins of my “Destiny”</h4>



<p>I had come a long way. In 2017, only a year prior to joining the restaurant business, I was living an aimless life, doing mindless work at a payroll company. I had spent three of the most capable years of my life at the company <em>not pursuing my dreams</em>, and <em>not knowing what my dreams even were</em>. Eventually I decided I wasn’t cut out for shuffling papers for 40 hours a week, and <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/06/08/12-lessons/">I left the 9-5 cubicle life behind</a>. </p>



<p>In the months to follow, I embarked on a journey of self-discovery that would change the trajectory of my life. I <span><a href="http://santiago-compostela.net/">walked 500 miles across northern Spain</a></span> on the fabled Camino de Santiago. And when I returned, I started my own fidget spinner side-hustle during the height of the craze.</p>



<p>The overarching goal of my self-imposed sabbatical was to stretch and redefine my comfort zone every single day. Over that time, I learned what it means to work for myself and I explored the edges of comfort more than I ever could in a cloistered paycheck-to-paycheck cubicle environment. </p>



<p><em><strong>I discovered I had been unconsciously limiting myself my entire life. </strong></em></p>



<h4>Movin’ On Up</h4>



<p>By early 2018, through leveraging my experiences, utilizing my network, and <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/07/06/stand-out-at-work/">solving the principal-agent problem</a>, I had been hired to run the restaurant. With no prior restaurant experience besides dining in them, I was tasked with building and managing this brand new multi-million dollar project from the ground up. </p>



<p>This location would be the largest in the restaurant group, which has dozens of locations in the Philadelphia area. Despite my blatant lack of experience, the owner of the company saw enough character and potential to hand me the keys. Through many long days, hard work, and consistency, I was projected to someday be “the best manager the company has ever seen” by one of the owner’s top lieutenants.</p>



<p>My admiration within the restaurant empire grew rapidly.  I was soon looked to as the standard-bearer of principled leadership within an otherwise ethically-challenged organization. </p>



<p>The team of employees I put together was outstanding. The camaraderie and the energy within the team was remarkable. Employees felt that working at the restaurant was often the best part of their day. In essence, I had cultivated a work environment I was never able to find on my own. </p>



<p>The mayor, local government officials, business owners, and even some professional sports stars began dining there on a regular basis.  And within a large college community, the restaurant achieved success almost instantly.</p>

<p>I was making a comfortable living, I had a fun and engaging job, I had the status, and I had the respect. What more could I want?</p>



<h4>The Inevitable Turn of Events</h4>



<p>The learning curve, after so long in a particular role, inevitably stumbles into unsavory territory. The owner had an inner-circle of lieutenants who he trusted to be his eyes and ears throughout the organization. But there was a catch–he only admitted “yes-men” into this exclusive group, or people who would only tell him what he wanted to hear. By now, I’m sure you can think of one or more leaders with this quality. They’re on TV every day. And you might even deal with them at your job on a daily basis. </p>



<p>I began, by default, as an unofficial member of this inner-circle, but I quickly chose to find my way out. I have never been one to tell people only what they want to hear. With this being in diametric opposition of what the owner liked, it set the stage for a challenging relationship. Put simply, he was always more interested in his way of doing things rather than the best way. It was his company, after all.</p>



<p>Often, he didn’t take kindly to hard truths I would present to him about many of the unfortunate realities within the organization. And as the sole owner of the company, his attitude of denial would ultimately enable such issues to persist. I had eventually lost the ability to convince him of the truth.</p>



<p>But do you know the beautiful thing about <strong>truth</strong>? Truth doesn’t care about what anyone thinks of it. It cannot be molded into something it is not. This powerlessness over truth causes many to avoid it at all costs. Many are scared of the consequences truth brings along. The all-powerful owner of this organization was no different. So be it.</p>



<h4>The Writing on the Wall</h4>



<p>As I grew to learn the inner workings of the power structure within the company, I began to sense that one way or another, I was not going to stay there long-term. </p>



<p>My principles and values would be tested on many occasions, but they were never broken. I did my best to<a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/05/02/keep-your-soul/"><span> </span><span>keep</span><span> </span><span>my soul</span></a> through it all.</p>



<p>It had been almost two years with the organization, but by late 2019, the writing was on the wall. It became increasingly challenging to work with the owner. All the money and status wasn’t enough to keep me motivated. All the cheese wasn’t enough to keep me in the trap. </p>



<p>I became indifferent to the non-sense and to “playing politics.” I was chronically over-stressed and everyone around me felt it. By the time my (“keep it short”) August vacation came around, I decided I needed to make a change. </p>



<p>Shortly after I returned, I sat down with the owner and made the decision to resign. I had reached the point of no return. I had to move on for the sake of my health and my sanity. The <em>destiny</em> I had envisioned for myself was little more than an illusion. I knew that working for someone else would never be the answer to my ambitions. </p>



<p>I needed to take matters into my own hands and create my own destiny.</p>



<h4>That Which You Cannot Buy</h4>



<p>During my time at the restaurant, I learned, firsthand, that money doesn’t solve all your problems, just your money problems. Money doesn’t make you happy, but can buy things that make you happy (momentarily). </p>



<p>I also learned that status is a fleeting concept. You are not your status.  You can enjoy it briefly, but it tends to only bring you more problems, which money cannot solve. </p>



<p>What I was missing was that which you cannot point to, put a finger on, or buy: </p>



<h6><strong>Time</strong></h6>



<p>I was always at the restaurant. 60, 70, 80 hours a week. After all, my top-floor apartment was literally across the street. I could roll out of bed and into work. The downside? Obvious. As the single point of authority and communication of a multi-million dollar restaurant, I constantly lacked the most precious resource of all: <em>time</em>. </p>



<h6><strong>Freedom</strong></h6>



<p>If time is the bathwater, then freedom is the baby. Managing a restaurant will throw both out in a hurry. <em>Want a vacation? Wait until August when it’s slow. Remember, keep it short.</em> <em>Want a second day off? “You have banker’s hours.”</em> <em>Want to take an early day? Go ahead, but you’d better keep your phone with you.</em> I was nothing more than a well-paid tiger in a cage. </p>



<p><em>Everyone wants money and status. Until they know the price for it.</em></p>







<h4><strong><em>Want</em> Makes You a Servant</strong></h4>



<p>I was free! Well, almost. I went from 14-hour days to…</p>



<p>…nothing.</p>



<p>Soon after, out of boredom and recognition of what I thought was another promising opportunity, I began working at a marketing company. Although I learned a lot of skills (many of which I am putting to use now), the company was spinning its wheels. My long-term goals and the short-term discipline of the company were not aligned,  so I decided to leave after two months.</p>



<p>The problem I was having was letting my desires and my wants drive my decisions. As Nassim Nicholas Taleb says “The three most harmful addictions are heroin, carbohydrates, and a monthly salary.” I’ve done fairly well steering clear of the first two, but my addiction to a steady paycheck has always led me to unhappiness.</p>

  <p>Modern OpenGL, and by extension WebGL, is very different from the legacy OpenGL I learned in the past. I understand how rasterization works, so I’m comfortable with the concepts. However, every tutorial I’ve read introduced abstractions and helper functions that make it harder for me to understand which parts are truly core to the OpenGL APIs.</p>

<p>To be clear, abstractions like separating positional data and rendering functionality into separate classes is important in a real-world application. But, these abstractions spread code across multiple areas, and introduce overhead due to boilerplate and passing around data between logical units. The way I <em>learn</em> best is a linear flow of code where every line is core to the subject at hand.</p>

<p>First, credit goes to <a href="https://www.toptal.com/javascript/3d-graphics-a-webgl-tutorial">the tutorial I used</a>. Starting from this base, I stripped down all the abstractions until I had a “minimal viable program”. Hopefully, this will help you get off the ground with modern OpenGL. Here’s what we’re making:</p>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://avikdas.com/assets/images/2020-07-08-barebones-webgl-in-75-lines-of-code/multi-colored-triangle.png" alt="An equilateral triangle, green on top, black on the bottom-left and red on the bottom-right, with colors interpolated in between."></p>
  <figcaption>

</figure>

<h2 id="initialization">Initialization</h2>

<p>With WebGL, we need a <code>canvas</code> to paint on. You’ll definitely want to include all the usual HTML boilerplate, some styling, etc., but the canvas is the most crucial. Once the DOM has loaded, we’ll be able to access the canvas using Javascript.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;canvas</span> <span>id=</span><span>"container"</span> <span>width=</span><span>"500"</span> <span>height=</span><span>"500"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;script&gt;</span>
  <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>DOMContentLoaded</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// All the Javascript code below goes here</span>
  <span>});</span>
<span>&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With the canvas accessible, we can get the WebGL rendering context, and initialize its clear color. Colors in the OpenGL world are RGBA, with each component between <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>. The clear color is the one used to paint the canvas at the beginning of any frame that redraws the scene.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>canvas</span> <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>container</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>const</span> <span>gl</span> <span>=</span> <span>canvas</span><span>.</span><span>getContext</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>webgl</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>

<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>clearColor</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There’s more initialization that can, and in real programs should, be done. Of particular note is enabling the <em>depth buffer</em>, which would allow sorting geometry based on the Z coordinates. We’ll avoid that for this basic program consisting of only one triangle.</p>

<h2 id="compile-shaders">Compile shaders</h2>

<p>OpenGL is at its core a rasterization framework, where <em>we</em> get to decide how to implement everything but the rasterization. This entails running at minimum two pieces of code on the GPU:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A vertex shader that runs for each piece of input, outputting one 3D (really, 4D in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates">homogeneous coordinates</a>) positions per input.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A fragment shader that runs for each pixel on the screen, outputting what color that pixel should be.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In between these two steps, OpenGL takes the geometry from the vertex shader and determines which pixels on the screen are actually covered by that geometry. This is the rasterization part.</p>

<p>Both shaders are typically written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language), which is then compiled down to machine code for the GPU. The machine code is then sent to the GPU, so it can be run during the rendering process. I won’t spend much time on GLSL, as I’m only trying to show the basics, but the language is sufficiently close to C to be familiar to most programmers.</p>

<p>First, we compile and send a vertex shader to the GPU. Here, the source code for the shader is stored in a string, but it can be loaded from other places. Ultimately, the string is sent to the WebGL APIs.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>sourceV</span> <span>=</span> <span>`
  attribute vec3 position;
  varying vec4 color;

  void main() {
    gl_Position = vec4(position, 1);
    color = gl_Position * 0.5 + 0.5;
  }
`</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> <span>shaderV</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>createShader</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>VERTEX_SHADER</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>shaderSource</span><span>(</span><span>shaderV</span><span>,</span> <span>sourceV</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>compileShader</span><span>(</span><span>shaderV</span><span>);</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getShaderParameter</span><span>(</span><span>shaderV</span><span>,</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>COMPILE_STATUS</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>error</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getShaderInfoLog</span><span>(</span><span>shaderV</span><span>));</span>
  <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>Failed to compile vertex shader</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, there are a few variables in the GLSL code worth calling out:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>An <em>attribute</em> called <code>position</code>. An attribute is essentially an input, and the shader is called for each such input.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <em>varying</em> called <code>color</code>. This is an output from the vertex shader (one per input), and an input to the fragment shader. By the time the value is passed to the fragment shader, the value will be interpolated based on the properties of the rasterization.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code>gl_Position</code> value. Essentially an output from the vertex shader, like any varying value. This one is special because it’s used to determine which pixels need to be drawn at all.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>There’s also a variable type called <em>uniform</em>, which is will be constant across multiple invocations of the vertex shader. These uniforms are used for properties like the transformation matrix, which will be constant for all vertices on a single piece of geometry.</p>

<p>Next, we do the same thing with fragment shader, compiling and sending it to the GPU. Notice the <code>color</code> variable from the vertex shader is now read by the fragment shader.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>sourceF</span> <span>=</span> <span>`
  precision mediump float;
  varying vec4 color;

  void main() {
    gl_FragColor = color;
  }
`</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> <span>shaderF</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>createShader</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>FRAGMENT_SHADER</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>shaderSource</span><span>(</span><span>shaderF</span><span>,</span> <span>sourceF</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>compileShader</span><span>(</span><span>shaderF</span><span>);</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getShaderParameter</span><span>(</span><span>shaderF</span><span>,</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>COMPILE_STATUS</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>error</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getShaderInfoLog</span><span>(</span><span>shaderF</span><span>));</span>
  <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>Failed to compile fragment shader</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, both the vertex and fragment shader are linked into a single OpenGL program.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>program</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>createProgram</span><span>();</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>attachShader</span><span>(</span><span>program</span><span>,</span> <span>shaderV</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>attachShader</span><span>(</span><span>program</span><span>,</span> <span>shaderF</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>linkProgram</span><span>(</span><span>program</span><span>);</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getProgramParameter</span><span>(</span><span>program</span><span>,</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>LINK_STATUS</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>error</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getProgramInfoLog</span><span>(</span><span>program</span><span>));</span>
  <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>Failed to link program</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>useProgram</span><span>(</span><span>program</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We tell the GPU that the shaders we defined above are the ones we want to run. So, now what’s left is to create the inputs and let the GPU loose on those inputs.</p>

<h2 id="send-the-input-data-to-the-gpu">Send the input data to the GPU</h2>

<p>The input data will be stored in the GPU’s memory and processed from there. Instead of making separate draw calls for each piece of input, which would transfer the relevant data one piece at a time, the entire input is transferred to the GPU and read from there. (Legacy OpenGL would transfer data one piece at at time, leading to worse performance.)</p>

<p>OpenGL provides an abstraction known as a Vertex Buffer Object (VBO). I’m still figuring out how all of this works, but ultimately, we’ll do the following using the abstraction:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Store a sequence of bytes in the CPU’s memory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Transfer the bytes to the GPU’s memory using a unique buffer created using <code>gl.createBuffer()</code> and a <em>binding point</em> of <code>gl.ARRAY_BUFFER</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>We’ll have one VBO per input variable (attribute) in the vertex shader, though it’s possible to use a single VBO for multiple inputs.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>positionsData</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Float32Array</span><span>([</span>
  <span>-</span><span>0.75</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>0.65</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span>
   <span>0.75</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>0.65</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span>
   <span>0</span>   <span>,</span>  <span>0.65</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span>
<span>]);</span>

<span>const</span> <span>buffer</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>createBuffer</span><span>();</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>bindBuffer</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>ARRAY_BUFFER</span><span>,</span> <span>buffer</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>bufferData</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>ARRAY_BUFFER</span><span>,</span> <span>positionsData</span><span>,</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>STATIC_DRAW</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Typically, you’ll specify your geometry with whatever coordinates are meaningful to your application, then use a series of transformations in the vertex shader to get them into OpenGL’s <em>clip space</em>. I won’t go into the details of clip space (they have to do with homogeneous coordinates), but for now, X and Y vary from -1 to +1. Because our vertex shader just passes along the input data as is, we can specify our coordinates directly in clip space.</p>

<p>Next, we’ll also associate the buffer with one of the variables in the vertex shader. Here, we:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Get a handle to the <code>position</code> variable from the program we created above.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tell OpenGL to read data from the <code>gl.ARRAY_BUFFER</code> binding point, in batches of 3, with particular parameters like an offset and stride of zero.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>attribute</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getAttribLocation</span><span>(</span><span>program</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>position</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>enableVertexAttribArray</span><span>(</span><span>attribute</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>vertexAttribPointer</span><span>(</span><span>attribute</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>FLOAT</span><span>,</span> <span>false</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that we can create the VBO and associate it with the vertex shader attribute this way because we do both one after another. If we separated these two functions (for example creating all the VBOs in one go, then associating them to individual attributes), we would need to call <code>gl.bindBuffer(...)</code> before associating each VBO with its corresponding attribute.</p>

<h2 id="draw">Draw!</h2>

<p>Finally, with all the data in the GPU’s memory set up the way we want, we can tell OpenGL to clear the screen and run the program on the arrays we set up. As part of the rasterization (determining which pixels are covered by the vertices), we tell OpenGL to treat the vertices in groups of 3 as triangles.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>clear</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>COLOR_BUFFER_BIT</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>drawArrays</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>TRIANGLES</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The way we’ve set this up in a linear fashion does mean the program runs in one shot. In any practical application, we’d store the data in a structured way, send it to the GPU whenever it changes, and perform the drawing every frame.</p>

<hr>

<p>Putting everything together, the diagram below shows the minimal set of concepts that go into showing your first triangle on the screen. Even then, the diagram is heavily simplified, so your best bet is to put together the 75 lines of code presented in this article and study that.</p>

  <figcaption>The final, though heavily simplified, sequence of steps needed to show the coveted triangle</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The hard part of learning OpenGL for me has been the sheer amount of boilerplate needed to get the most basic image on the screen. Because the rasterization framework requires us to provide 3D rendering functionality, and communicating with the GPU is verbose, there are many concepts to learn right up front. I hope this article shows the basics are simpler than other tutorials make them out to be!</p>

        <p>The JVM’s garbage collectors make use of Thread-Local Allocation Buffers (TLABs) to improve allocation performance. In this article we’re going to understand what TLABs are, how they affect the code generated by the JIT for allocation and what the resulting effect on performance is. Along the way we’ll learn about the organisation of CPU caches and how multiple CPU cores keep their contents coherent and how you can use this knowledge to avoid multithreaded scalability bottlenecks.</p>
<p>Let’s begin by discussing what TLABs are and why they’re necessary. TLABs are blocks of the Java heap that each JVM thread has into which it can allocate. They are exclusive to one thread for the purposes of allocation but as they are part of the Java heap any other thread may reference or access objects within them. Exclusivity for allocation means an individual thread can allocate efficiently into its TLAB without needing to coordinate or synchronise with any other threads. When a thread runs out of space in its TLAB it requests a new buffer from the JVM’s Garbage Collector. We cover how allocation happens in a TLAB in our related blog post on <a href="https://www.opsian.com/blog/jvms-allocateprefetch-options/">JVM Allocation Prefetching</a> but in summary, it boils down to incrementing a pointer.</p>
<h2>CPU Cache Coherency</h2>
<p>Why are we trying to avoid incrementing the allocation pointer from multiple threads? To understand this we need to look at how caches are organised amongst multiple cores in a multicore processor. Memory in caches is organised in <em>cache lines</em>. These are sequential blocks of normally a fixed size that depends on the CPU architecture and model, on modern AMD/Intel x86 cores this is 64 bytes. There are multiple levels of caches with two or three being usual and with some caches shared between groups or all cores whilst others are exclusive to an individual core. The configuration depends very much on the architecture and specific model of processor. As an example, the AMD’s “Zen 2” Ryzen 7 3700X has 8 cores each of which has a 64kb L1 cache (half for instructions, half for data) and a 512kb L2 cache. The Ryzen 7 cores are in two groups of four, each group of four share a 16MB L3 cache.</p>
<p><img alt="Ryzen 7 3700X cache configuration" src="https://www.opsian.com/images/jvm_tlabs/ryzen_7_caches.png" title="Ryzen 7 3700X cache configuration"></p>
<p>AMD’s Zen 2 cache configuration (taken from <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/AMD/the-path-to-zen-2">https://www.slideshare.net/AMD/the-path-to-zen-2</a>)</p>
<p>Keeping all of these caches in sync is what’s called a <em>cache coherency</em> protocol. It specifies a set of states that each cache line can be in and the valid transitions between those states. The most common protocol on x86 is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MESI_protocol">MESI</a> and both Intel and AMD use variants of it. For each cache, their cache lines can be in one of the following states under MESI:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Modified (M)</strong> - this contents of the cache line have been modified and this cache has the only copy. All other caches corresponding lines are marked <strong>Invalid</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Exclusive (E)</strong> - this cache has the only copy of this cache line and it matches main memory. All other caches corresponding lines are marked <strong>Invalid.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Shared (S)</strong> - this cache line matches memory and is present in other caches, other caches may have this line marked <strong>Shared</strong> too.</li>
<li><strong>Invalid (I)</strong> - this cache line is empty.</li>
</ul>
<p>AMD and Intel’s variants (MOESI and MESIF respectively) add additional states that can reduce writes to main memory and also optimise traffic in NUMA environments.</p>
<p>At a very high level, a memory write under MESI goes as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the cache line is in present in our cache<ul>
<li>If <strong>Exclusive</strong> then modify and transition the line to <strong>Modified</strong></li>
<li>If <strong>Modified </strong>then modify and leave in <strong>Modified</strong></li>
<li>If <strong>Shared</strong> then make other caches invalidate their copies, modify and move to <strong>Modified</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the cache line is not present in our cache<ul>
<li>If another cache has the line in <strong>Modified</strong> they send the line contents to this cache and also to main memory, marking their line <strong>Invalid</strong></li>
<li>If other caches have the line in <strong>Exclusive</strong> or <strong>Shared</strong> state they send their contents and mark their lines <strong>Invalid</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As we can see, concurrent memory writes to the same location from multiple cores can involve cache lines being invalidated and changing state fairly rapidly. The term often used for this effect is called cache line ping-pong.</p>
<h2>Why caches matter for allocation</h2>
<p>The main takeaways from the above steps is that if we have a cache line exclusively or in the modified state then we don’t need to force other caches to do work. If the cache line is shared with other caches we need them to invalidate. Invalidating means those cache lines are now no longer present in other cores’ caches. Subsequent reads could involve cores stalling to re-acquire the data from other caches (50+ cycles depending on which cache and the topology) or worse hitting main memory itself (100s of cycles). This is in contrast with a L1 cache hit which, on the i7 4770k (Haswell) we’ll use later on for benchmarking, is in the region of <a href="https://www.7-cpu.com/cpu/Haswell.html">4-5 cycles</a>.</p>
<p>Put into the context of memory allocation, every thread competing to read and write a single allocation pointer would lead to each core cache repeatedly needing to take ownership of the allocation pointer’s cache line and all other cores invalidating their copies. In comparison, with TLABs each thread has its own local allocation pointer into its buffer which is not visible to other cores and avoids the need to synchronise with other caches.</p>
<h2>Testing allocation with and without TLABs</h2>
<p>That’s the theory, let’s see how well it applies in practise. To test this we’re going to conduct some multithreaded benchmarks using Java’s Parallel Garbage Collector on JDK 13.0.2 with and without TLABs. </p>
<p>We’re using the Parallel GC because for all our benchmarks the instructions for manipulating the allocation pointer get inlined into generated code by the JIT. Other collectors like G1 and CMS actually call in to the collectors themselves on allocation which makes things a little harder to demonstrate. Both G1 and CMS also serialize allocations in the non-TLAB case by taking a lock.</p>
<p>For this we will use the excellent <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/">JMH</a> and the benchmarks themselves are:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>@</span><span>State</span><span>(</span><span>Scope</span><span>.</span><span>Benchmark</span><span>)</span>
<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>TlabTest</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>@</span><span>Threads</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>Object</span> <span>allocateWithTLABOneThread</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>Object</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>@</span><span>Benchmark</span>
    <span>@</span><span>Fork</span><span>(</span><span>jvmArgsAppend</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>"-XX:+UseParallelGC"</span><span>,</span><span>"-XX:-UseTLAB"</span><span>})</span>
    <span>@</span><span>Threads</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>Object</span> <span>allocateWithoutTLABOneThread</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>Object</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It’s worth noting that we’re using <em>Object</em> here which is the smallest allocation we can actually do. This is unrealistic because nobody really allocates like this (if you do, please let me know) but magnifies the effect of the allocation machinery so we can clearly see what effect TLABs have. We’ll look at some benchmarks which allocate larger objects near the end of this post.</p>
<p>We run the benchmarks with the <em>-prof perfasm</em> option so we can dump out the assembly for the two benchmarks. We have simplified and rearranged the assembly below a little to make it easier to read.</p>
<p>For <em>allocateWithTLABOneThread</em> we have:</p>
<pre>try_allocation:
<b>// Load the current thread-local allocation pointer</b>
mov     0x118(%r15),%rax

<b>// Compute new global allocation pointer by adding allocation size (16 bytes)</b>
mov     %rax,%r10
add     $0x10,%r10

<b>// Check that this doesn't go beyond the TLAB limit, if it does call in to the GC to refill</b>
cmp     0x128(%r15),%r10 // check this is not over our buffer
jb      continue_allocation
.. call in to GC and deal with refilling buffer ..

<b>// Allocation was inside TLAB limit, so update limit</b>
continue_allocation:
mov     %r10,0x118(%r15)

<b>// Prefetch for next allocation</b>
prefetchnta 0xc0(%r10) // prefetch for future allocations
.. initialise object with mark word and klass pointer ..
.. benchmark loop logic ..
</pre>

<p>For <em>allocateWithoutTLABOneThread</em> we have:</p>
<pre>try_allocation:
<b>// Load the current global allocation limit into %r10</b>
movabs  $0x7f764804d2d0,%r10
mov     (%r10),%r10

increment_allocation_pointer:
<b>// Load the current global allocation pointer into %r11 and %rax</b>
movabs  $0x7f764804d2f8,%r11 
mov     (%r11),%rax
mov     %rax,%r11

<b>// Compute new global allocation pointer by adding allocation size (16 bytes)</b>
add     $0x10,%r11

<b>// Is the new pointer over the limit? If so call in to the GC</b>
cmp     %r10,%r11
jnb     call_gc

<b>// Atomic compare-and-swap (CAS) global allocation pointer (address in %r9). Old expected value is in %rax, new value is in %r11</b>
movabs  $0x7f764804d2f8,%r9
lock cmpxchg %r11,(%r9)

<b>// If the CAS succeeded continue to initialise the object - otherwise retry</b>
je      continue_allocation // success we can go initialise the object
jmp     increment_allocation_pointer // failure we need to try again

continue_allocation:
<b>// New object address in %r11. Increment thread allocations stats and prefetch for the next allocation, then continue with initialisation.</b>
addq    $0x10,0x190(%r15) // bump thread allocated bytes stats
prefetchnta 0xc0(%r11) // prefetch for future allocations
.. initialise object with mark word and klass pointer ..
.. benchmark loop logic ..
</pre>

<p>As you can see the case without TLABs is a little more involved and also explicitly needs to deal with contention amongst threads, where one thread might be incrementing the allocation pointer in between another thread having loaded it and attempting to increment it.</p>
<h2>The single threaded case</h2>
<p>Let’s see how the two single threaded cases stack up on a Intel Core i7-4770 CPU:</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
   <td>Test
   </td>
   <td>Op/s (throughput)
   </td>
   <td>Error (for 99.9% CI)
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>allocateWithTLABOneThread
   </td>
   <td>279,772,768
   </td>
   <td>± 4,153,915
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>allocateWithoutTLABOneThread
   </td>
   <td>101,167,412
   </td>
   <td>± 128,394
   </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>So even with one thread where we’re sure there’s no contention, we’re only seeing half the performance when compared to using a TLAB. This is because the Atomic Compare-And-Swap (CAS) instruction required when not using a TLAB (<code>lock cmpxchg</code> in the above assembly snippet) is more expensive than the normal load and store combination used in the TLAB test.</p>
<h2>Digging deeper on Atomic CASes</h2>
<p>There are a couple of reasons for this. The first is that, on modern x86 cores, a normal store doesn’t immediately …</p></div></div>

<p>At user groups and in online communities they keep talking about Vim and how cool it is to use this text editor. Let’s explore what all the Fuzz is about.</p>



<h3>What is Vim?</h3>



<p>Vim is a text editor that operates within the terminal and works with keyboard shortcuts only. It is known for the editing speed you can achieve and therefore increased productivity.</p>



<h3>Why is Vim so popular?</h3>



<p>Despite its age (at the time of writing, 28 years) it’s still popular among a lot of software developers. Vim is available on almost any operating system. It comes preinstalled on Linux Distributions and macOS, and there are packages available for Windows as well. Once you mastered the keyboard shortcuts, you can edit files very quickly. </p>

<h3>How can I get started with Vim?</h3>



<p>If you’re on Linux or macOS, open a terminal and type in <code>vim</code>. This will open the editor and it’s ready to open a file. On Windows, you might need to <a href="https://www.vim.org/download.php" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.vim.org/download.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">install it first</a>.</p>



<h3>Vim Foundations</h3>



<p>If you have used other editors such as Notepad++, Sublime, TextMate or Visual Studio Code, Vim will seem quite obscure. In these other editors, you use keyboard shortcuts as well as the mouse to open, save and edit files. <br>Since Vim is keyboard-only, it comes with shortcuts for all operations (also those you’d use a mouse for otherwise). <br>The main difference to other editors is its two different modes. Vim has a Normal and Insert Mode. </p>



<h4>Normal Mode</h4>



<p>In Normal Mode you execute commands such as open or save file but also navigating across the file. </p>



<p>Vim is already in Normal Mode once it opens. Some commands consist of a single letter such as <code>i</code>, <code>p</code> or <code>w</code>. Others require a colon, such as <code>:w</code>, <code>:q</code> or <code>:e</code>. (More on those commands below.)</p>



<h4>Insert Mode</h4>



<p>Once in Insert Mode, every key you hit will result in a character in your file as you’re used to it in other editors. </p>



<h4>Switching Between Modes</h4>



<p>When you open Vim, it’s in Normal mode already. To get into Insert Mode, press <code>i</code>. You will see <code>-- INSERT --</code> in the bottom left corner. </p>

<p>Once you’re done adding / changing characters, hit the <code>&lt;ESC&gt;</code> key to switch back to Normal mode. You will notice, that <code>-- INSERT --</code> will disappear again. </p>



<p>When you edit a file, you will constantly change between both modes, with Normal as the default mode. When you navigate through a file, copy or delete characters, you do all of that in Normal Mode. Insert Mode is for character manipulation (Insert and Delete) only.</p>



<h3>Vim Commands</h3>



<p>The list of Vim Commands is pretty long, but you won’t need to know all of them to get started.<br>In fact, only a handful commands will do in the beginning:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><code>&lt;ESC&gt;</code></td><td>Switch into Normal Mode</td></tr><tr><td><code>i</code></td><td>Switch into Insert Mode</td></tr><tr><td><code>:w</code></td><td>Save file</td></tr><tr><td><code>:q</code></td><td>Close Vim</td></tr><tr><td><code>:wq</code></td><td>Save file and Close Vim</td></tr><tr><td><code>:e &lt;filename&gt;</code></td><td>Open a file</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Vim Commands you need to know to get started</figcaption></figure>



<p>These six commands will get you quite far already, allowing you to open, manipulate and save files, as well as closing Vim. </p>



<p>Additionally, download the Cheat Sheet below with additional commands that build on top of the foundational commands above.</p>







<p>It will take time to pick up speed and come back to a productivity level you’re used to. Start with the commands in the table above and focus your effort on switching between Normal and Insert Mode. <br>Once you’re comfortable with that, add one command at a time from the Cheat Sheet to your repertoire. You will notice over time how your muscle memory will build up. That will also be the time to install additional plugins. </p>



<p>Let’s get started with learning! I’m curious about your learning experience. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/ganzefolge" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/ganzefolge" target="_blank">Follow me on Twitter </a>and share your progress with me!</p>

The promise of blockchain is huge. And large companies are continuing to hire and expand their blockchain teams, incl. Facebook, Amazon, Microsft, EY, Deloitte, IBM, and Oracle, to name a few. So, it should be well worth the effort to become familiar with how blockchain works, what its perceived benefits are, and as a developer starting building on top of them. </p>
<p>Over the past few years, I’ve been helping and on-boarding new team members and developers into the blockchain space. This helped me to collect blogs, links, materials, and resources and see which worked well for everyone’s learning journey. It’s time to share that with a broader audience. This guide provides a starting point for developers who’re keen to learn more about blockchain and development on top of Ethereum. It will be opinionated and not contain a full list of everything available. But rather, a concise list of highly recommended options, from my own experiences. </p>

<p>Once you’ve gone through all (or at least most) of the above, you should have a solid grasp of all the concepts. So now we can finally move on to the fun part: actually building stuff! </p>
<p>To get a full, comprehensive overview of the Ethereum development landscape, check out:</p>

</ul>
<p>The Ethereum portal covers sections per programming language, to help you filter out what’s relevant for you. Though JavaScript is most commonly used, I’d start with something that you’re already familiar with, to flatten the learning curve. Use the above only for future reference. As mentioned previously, I’m trying to keep it simple and offer a few recommended options, from my own experiences. Feel free to discover, try, and learn everything from the developer portals, once you’ve covered these.</p>

<p>Above should cover everything you need to write your own smart contracts and build decentralized applications on top of Ethereum. </p>

<p>The goal of this guide is mainly to help new developers to enter the space and I won’t go into much depth on advanced topics, such as design &amp; architecture, scalability, privacy, etc.</p>
<p>But a few pointers, for those who feel up to it. </p>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>The following diagram is a stack representation of the enterprise Ethereum architecture. While this is aimed towards enterprises, it gives a good overview of the relationship between components and can be part of any implementation. </p>

<p>As you can see in the diagram, we’ve covered most from the application layer to the tooling, core blockchain, and networking layer. What’s missing really are the Enterprise 3 P’s.</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance</li>
<li>Permissioning</li>
<li>Privacy</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, this does not only apply to enterprise but applies to any Ethereum application. I’ll leave these for a future blog post.</p>
<h2>Security &amp; best practices</h2>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><p>You've worked remotely, and you've worked in an office. You like both. You're not alone—there are countless people missing the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/never-go-back-office/611830/" rel="noopener">perks of going into an office</a>.</p><p>You know it’s not an either-or question. Legions of workers like you are all too aware that it's less about the location, and more about creating the proper mind space and vibe to get into your <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/flow-at-work/" rel="noopener">flow</a>. That's how you and your team get things done. </p><p>Just being able to work from home without this mixed in is a recipe for chaos and <a href="https://www.range.co/blog/how-to-prevent-workplace-burnout-on-your-team">burnout</a>. Not to mention being forced to work from home due to a pandemic is not the same as intentional remote work.</p><p>For a long, long time, research has shown that <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/07/to-be-happier-at-work-invest-more-in-your-relationships" rel="noopener">social connection inspires purpose, well-being, effectiveness</a>, and overall happiness in the workplace. And it’s very, very good for business in a number of ways. </p><p>While building these relationships is possible via video chat, it takes more effort and intention—something not all teams are taking into account. Get this: a whopping <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90433799/want-a-happy-employee-give-them-an-office" rel="noopener">77%</a> of people who work in open offices reported being happy in their jobs. The numbers remain more or less the same when private office spaces and cubicles come into the picture. People just like going into the office (even if they suppose they want to work from home).</p><p>So why all the fuss about remote-only? You don't want to choose between the two—you're not ready to cross that bridge yet. Just because the buzzword 'remote work' has put a stranglehold on the zeitgeist, doesn't mean you have to get on board.</p><p>I hear you: working from home exclusively, FOREVER actually doesn't sound that rad. But how do you put it into words? Hear me out.</p><p><strong>1. The office is not your enemy! It's poor work practices</strong></p><p>Think about the last time you wanted to storm out of a meeting or your office. What caused you to want to do this? Was it the neat whiteboard where you jot down all of your best ideas for new products or campaigns? Was it the coffee maker that gave you life some mornings when you couldn't even? Maybe it was the sweet lounge area where you have inspiring chats or a good laugh with Bob from IT?</p><p>I'm willing to bet it was none of the above. It was probably someone who talked over you in a meeting or booked a session that you didn't need to be in over your deep focus time. So, why does the office get all the flack? Your office was a destination that actually offered a lot. I’m just saying, I think the hate on the actual physical spaces must stop.</p><p>Instead, we should focus on building a stronger work culture and address the issues creating a bad one.</p><p><em>P.s. Could you imagine storming out of your own house? It would be so awkward and anti-climatic because you'd have to go back at some point that night.</em></p><p><strong>2. Not everyone has a sprawling home to work from</strong></p><p>Some people (maybe even most people these days) live in tiny studio apartments or share a flat with roommates who are also working from home. There's no space to roam, no areas to spread your wings or change the scenery up, and indeed, no rooms to have productive meetings free of children playing or your roommate's lousy taste in music.</p><p>Sure, there are ways to get around this at home. You could come up with a schedule for who gets what common area, when—or duel to the death. The point is, a team of expert designers probably crafted your office space to encourage movement and inspire creativity. It's difficult to mimic this at home where you just want to chill, wear flowy pants, and not care about anything other than <a href="https://bgr.com/2020/03/28/coronavirus-news-streaming-increase-during-office-hours-netflix/" rel="noopener">Netflix</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21185114/twitch-youtube-livestreaming-streamelements-coronavirus-quarantine-viewership-numbers" rel="noopener">Twitch</a>, or reading a good book. Also, you probably don't have a degree in interior design, so there's that.</p><p><strong>3. Say it with me: Communication!</strong></p><p>We speak to one another through body language as much as we do with our words. So when it comes to communicating with coworkers, it's easy to see why being in an office makes it a little easier to get your message across without confusion. Every time we greet each other in the morning, we renew belonging cues. They help us feel connected to the environment and to each other. We add little deposits of trust to the relationships we share, helping to maintain them.</p><p>That's not to say office communication is perfect and that issues work themselves out without internal communications processes for support. It just means that you don't have the same handicap working in an office that you do when trying to express your ideas over a video call or <a href="https://slack.com/apps/A938TS1QS-range" rel="noopener">Slack</a>. You could gesticulate like a madman, but I'm not sure that will get you where you need to go. You're free to give it a try, though!</p><p>In any case, it's another +1 for being in an office.</p><p><strong>4.Taking your office perks for granted</strong></p><p>Who doesn't love a fully stocked snack wrack or a fridge with the latest dairy-free milk craze for your coffee obsession or bourgie flavored water with hard-to-pronounce names that spark loud conversations with coworkers, none of which you have to pay for out of pocket? As they say, talk is cheap, and so is not paying for your snacks.</p><p>If you're one of the few people still clinging to their New Years' resolution to nibble less and eat healthier, you may think working from home is a blessing in disguise. But then you look at your cupboard and find oreo cookies, hot Cheetos, and a ton of other crap that you had to get because you need emotional support after working way too many hours. Alternatively, in the last few years, office snacks have gotten healthier and healthier (mostly).</p><p>Plus, being at home is the ultimate cheat day excuse. Admit it: the office has just the right amount of social pressure to keep you accountable for those health goals you broadcasted to everyone in a two-mile radius. I'm just saying.</p><p><strong>5. The hidden fees of working from home</strong></p><p>On top of buying snacks out of your hard-earned moola (lame sauce), you may have noticed that your electricity bill and Amazon spending have skyrocketed. Who's paying for that?! You are my friend. You and you alone!</p><p>At that moment, you realize that your company was paying for a ton of stuff this whole time (who knew). Paying for it yourself is just less desirable. Some companies that get how much a home workspace and services matter let you expense part of your internet bill, desk purchase, office chair, and even gourmet coffee (you should ask!). But this isn't universal. Part of the point I'm making here is that not all home offices are created equal.</p><p><strong>6. (Work) is where the heart is</strong></p><p>But seriously, we need to separate productivity and work from the physical space we do it in. What's more important is being able to form bonds and connections with your team and establish practices that help you become a highly tuned working machine.</p><p>The hard truth is that for some—heck, maybe even most—this happens in a well-designed office that takes all of these ideas into account. There are distractions that you cannot control for when everyone is at home. It's one of the reasons why Range CEO, Dan, advocates for <a href="https://www.cmswire.com/collaboration-productivity/why-flexible-working-will-be-the-new-normal/?utm_source=cmswire.com&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=cm&amp;utm_content=all-articles-rss" rel="noopener">flexible and windowed work</a>, which gives people and teams permission to create the schedules and environments that work best for their productivity and sense of belonging. It could mean working exclusively at home for some, and in the office for others. Or maybe it's a little of both. The point is that 9-5 work is outdated and outmoded, and runs counter to the way modern work life functions.</p><p>While this is a rant about the joys of the office, this is a +1 for anywhere you want to be!</p><p><strong>7. It's okay to step away from your desk (ICYMI while working from home)</strong></p><p>There have been reports recently about how people are <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/remote-work-challenges/" rel="noopener">overworking themselves</a> during this critical time when they should be finding balance. They figure they don't have a commute now so they can just work more and later. Not only is sitting non-stop in front of your computer terrible for your physical health, it's bad for your mental health as well.</p><p>Traditionally, going into the office and coming home was a nifty marker to wind down one part of your life and engage with another. Eliminate the office, and you need to create new ways to do this. Unfortunately, this is tricky and will look different for everyone and their situation. And not enough teams are thinking critically about this. The result is burnout and complete obliteration of productivity. As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydmPh4MXT3g" rel="noopener">Sweet Brown</a> has infamously remarked, "ain't nobody got time for that!"</p><p>The office is a super useful shorthand for this type of switching that helps us maintain a sense of balance and happiness.</p><p><strong>8. I promise, you're not an alien for wanting human contact outside of your living unit</strong></p><p>Last, but certainly not least, being in the office means you interact with real-life humans, not just digital, video versions of them.</p><p>While you can schedule social time, and it can work well, there's just no way to replace the spontaneity of running into people and sparking up a great conversation. This style of connecting isn't for everyone. But, remotely-only offices and cultures take this popular, age-old way of building relationships off the table from those who value it. Not so good. You have to be much more intentional about how you build and maintain relationships, which can feel like, well, work.</p><p>Remote work certainly has its perks: no commutes, more time with people close to you, family and friends, and privacy. But it doesn't mean that the office has no value.</p><p>There are countless reasons to miss the office that are quite specific to you, your workplace, and the community you've built. It's about more than singing the praises of remote work—it's about acknowledging what makes people productive.</p><p>Oh!

<p>This is particularly frustrating as the Concorde ‘B’ model was already designed and the engines were available for incorporation into the next airframe number 217.</p>



<p>This was the aircraft the airlines really needed and the aircraft the manufacturers wanted to build. Unfortunately political pressure intervened and the will to proceed with it simply evaporated.</p>



<p>The new engine (the Olympus 610 +25%) had, as its name suggests, more thrust and eliminated noisy, fuel-guzzling afterburners.</p>



<p>The wing was redesigned, had leading edge ‘droop’ and carried more fuel. With better lift/drag, specific fuel consumption and more fuel the range of the Concorde Model ‘B’ increased over the original Concorde ‘A’ Model.</p>
</div><div data-packed="false" data-vertical-text="false" id="i2kylena"><p>Just four months after Concorde began her scheduled services in 1976, a Concorde ‘B’ model was first discussed and designed with slightly larger fuel capacity and slightly larger wings with leading edge slats to improve aerodynamic performance at all speeds.</p>

<p>It featured more powerful engines with sound deadening and without the fuel-hungry and noisy reheat. It was speculated that it was reasonably possible to create an engine with up to 25% gain in efficiency over the Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593.This would have given 500&nbsp;mi (805 km) additional range even with greater payload, and would have made new commercial routes possible. This was cancelled due in part to poor sales of Concorde, but also to the rising cost of aviation fuel in the 1970s.</p>



<p>During 1976 Jacques Mitterrand, the Chairman and Managing Director of Aerospatiale, submitted a proposal to investigate an improved version of Concorde – the “Version B” to Mr. Cavaille, French Secretary of State to Transport a similar letter was submitted to the British government at that time.</p>



<p>The letter that he sent elaborated on the quality of the work which had been carried out and the know-how that had now been acquired by the four French and British engineering companies (Aerospatiale, BAe, Rolls Royce and SNECMA). In this letter he also stressed the importance of the role that the manufacturers of Concorde could have in the development of a second-generation supersonic aircraft, that would be foreseeable during the 1990’s, could lead to probably in some form of a collaboration between Europe and the United States.</p>



<p>An exploratory study was actually already underway during this time, looking into upgrading the capabilities of the current Concorde design for the early 1980’s. The letter submitted also gave the official go ahead for this exploratory study and proposed a full feasibility study for a Concorde ‘B’ design.</p>



<p>Due to the manufactures having great difficulty selling the remaining five Concorde airframes that were built during the initial production run, Concorde 216 (G-BOAF) was to be the last Concorde ‘A’ built, and 217 was planned to be a Concorde ‘B’ version. Had Concorde ‘B’ been built, what type of future would we be living in now? If the additional range and performance had been available then many more airlines might have purchased Concorde and passenger air travel as we know it today might have been completely different.</p>



<p>She was planned to have a range approaching and even exceeding 5000 miles. But it is easy to imagine the potential range of Concorde ‘B’ design, when you consider that the Concorde “A” model used by British Airways had a design specification range of 3690 miles, had to regularly fly 4250 miles on a route between London Heathrow and Barbados. This was made possible due to operational improvements that pushed the range of Concorde ‘A’ to nearly 4500 miles. The improvements have included small changes to the aerodynamics of the original model’s specifications. One interesting fact is that the take-off weight was made very low and close to the figures estimated for the Concorde ‘B’ design.</p>



<p>The Concorde ‘B’ design would of also benefited from increased subsonic performance and reduced noise emissions.</p>

<p>The cost of the Concorde Project was massive and with the poor sales of Concorde, and cancelled options from airlines, adding to that the rising cost of aviation fuel during the 1970s, the development of the Model ‘B’ version was considered too expensive and cancelled. Although the study carried out was a pretty comprehensive one and could of given Concorde a real future in during the years to come right into the 1990s and even on into the 2000s, after this time it was generally expected that a new generation SST with a new type of variable cycle engines would enter into service (BAe AST3 or Aerospatiale Alliance)</p>



<h3>Exploratory and feasibility study for a Concorde ‘B’ design.</h3>



<p>The study into a Concorde ‘B’ design had two aims:</p>



<p>1. To ensure the expansion and future demand for supersonic transport (SST), where the Anglo-French group was now and into the future as the main and only player,</p>



<p>2. To maintain the high knowledge level gained by the manufacturers in Britain and France, and to provide a solid position for the participation in a future program of a second-generation SST.</p>





<p>This feasibility study, was planned to last 9 months and was estimated to cost 9 million French francs, it was to comprise three areas:</p>



<p>1. Engineering</p>



<p>2. Development costs</p>



<p>3. Markets</p>



<p>If this exploratory and feasibility study was to confirmed an economic interest for the manufacturers, and then led to the decision of the launch of an improved version of Concorde, such an improved version (allowing for a 5 year development programme) could be ready by spring 1982 for the 17th production Concorde 217</p>



<p>Civil aviation history shows that almost all new aircraft constituted a base point for the start of improved versions (The Boeing 747-100 evolved into today’s 747-400) and at this stage this was the plan for the Concorde program.</p>



<p>The interest in this development process would have been beneficial to both the airlines and the manufacturers of Concorde:</p>



<p>1. For the airlines, it would have offered performance improvements (lower direct operation costs, extension of the operating range, and reduction of environmental effects) while conserving the existing investments in crew training, maintenance procedures, etc.</p>



<p>2. For the manufacturers, it would have made it possible to carry out these improvements at a minimum capital cost. Indeed the development of the initial production version generally revealed aerodynamic areas where gains could be made along with structural margins, but these could not be exploited due to the time constraints in getting Concorde into passenger service successfully.</p>



<p>3. If the decision to build the B model would have been taken, the modifications would have been relatively inexpensive as they were just some minor changes to the existing production process, allowing the majority of the tooling to be maintained. The high level of knowledge that was gained during the certification of the current model would have greatly reduced time and costs during the certification of the B model.</p>



<p>These considerations should have applied particularly to the case of Concorde, considering the exceptional degree of innovation obtained and the great amount of technical knowledge accumulated during the twelve years of development of the initial production version.</p>



<p>The broad objectives of the Concorde ‘B’ version were to ensure the expansion of the network of routes that supersonic aircraft could use.</p>



<p>The following improvements were considered to be necessary:</p>



<h3>The Reduction of&nbsp; harmful acoustic effects on the airport environment:</h3>



<p>Although the level of noise produced by Concorde at takeoff and landing is equivalent to that of the first generation long haul aircraft in service (B 707, DC8), only the second generation of long haul aircraft (B747, DC10, L1011) equipped with high-bypass jet engines satisfied the new international noise rules.

<p>Poor cache utilization can cripple your performance and limit your ability to optimize elsewhere. This makes optimizing your cache one of the most impactful changes you can make. This piece will provide some tips on optimizing your cache and help you avoid some common pitfalls that can tank your performance. By looking at examples of what isn’t cache friendly, we will learn what is.</p>

<p>This post is aimed at developers familiar with lower-level languages like C++ and assumes some exposure to concepts like dynamic memory allocation and pointers.</p>

<p>As with everything performance related, there is no one-size-fits-all solution that will work for every problem, so always profile before and after changes. Likewise, I’m a human first and programmer second so apologies if I got something wrong here, this is a very complex topic!</p>

<p>Part one of this extended piece will cover the basics such as how much cache you have, the granularity of the cache and the limits of the compiler's ability to help you.</p>
									
<h2>Cache sizes &amp; cache lines</h2>

<p>Memory gets increasingly more expensive the faster you need to access it. The amount of cache you have is tied to your specific CPU and has no relation to the amount of RAM you have. Even if you have 16GB of RAM, your CPU likely has less than 16MB of cache; and unless you have server or workstation grade CPU, less than 1mb of L1 cache split across all cores.</p>

<p>CPU-Z says the following about my CPU:</p>

<figure>
	<img src="https://www.inorris.com/Blog/CacheCrashCourse/cpuz.png" alt="Output from CPU-Z for the author's CPU">
	<figcaption>A high end desktop CPU with 32KB of cache per core.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The “cache line” on a modern processor is typically 64 bytes. The cache line is the minimum granularity of a fetch from main memory into any cache. Only need 10 bytes? Tough! The processor is fetching 64. Want 65 bytes? The CPU is now fetching you 128! Those 64 byte blocks are “aligned”, so if your data structure falls across a boundary, you may pay the cost for several cache lines.</p>

<p>When data is fetched from main memory you pay a penalty called a cache miss. If you’re loading a lot of data sequentially, the CPU may be able to predict what you’ll need next by loading it in advance. If you’re reading a large data structure but the data you need is spread out or accessed erratically, you might have several cache misses until all the data is loaded.   In this scenario you’re paying a high cost for every byte read. Some cache misses are unavoidable, our goal is to eliminate the avoidable ones.</p>

<h2>Compiler optimizations</h2>

<p>Compilers are fantastic at identifying dead code and reorganizing to maximize the CPU pipeline, hiding cache latency and much more. However, there’s one thing compilers won’t do – optimise your structures.</p>

<p>It is up to the programmer to identify dead data within structures and classes. The compiler can’t know if you’re going to use the structure for something later (like reading from disk), or if the programmer knows something about memory layout that the compiler doesn’t (for example embedded hardware). As a result, it won’t change your layout beyond the alignment rules we discuss later.</p>

<p>Note, this applies to classes and structures only and not local variables, function parameters and so on. The compiler will happily eliminate those for you, and all the code associated with it if it knows the value is never used.</p>

<h2>Big N, Big :O</h2>

<p>The saying goes that you shouldn’t prematurely optimize, however the larger your N, the more care you need to take with the design of a system. Some design consideration now can pay dividends later when system designs are harder to optimize for performance.</p>

<p>Here are a few rules to make your life easier:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Design your external interface to be agnostic of the internal data organization. Avoid exposing internal structures.</li>
	<li>If your system can take ownership (or control creation of) for data it inherits, this will give you more flexibility.</li>
	<li>The fewer places you are allocating the better. Less allocations means less indirection.</li>
	<li>Minimize inheritance and prefer composition. A lot of interfaces on an object means it is over-generalized and will suffer from poor data locality.</li>
	<li>Your classes and structures should do as few things as possible with as little data as possible.</li>
</ul>

    <section>
      <div> 

        <div>
          <div>

              
    <div>
      
            
      <p>June 19th 2020 EU introduced the new <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/303600_303699/303645/02.01.01_60/en_303645v020101p.pdf" target="_blank">Cyber Security standard</a> for Consumer Internet of Things products. Following the rapid growth in connected devices combined with the increased risks associated with insecure devices, the EU hopes the new standard will lead to better security practises and more vendors adopting a security by design principle when developing new connected consumer products.</p>

<h3>Why this new standard?</h3>
<p>The IoT market behaves like the wild-west. The lack of regulation, abundance of cheap technology and the promise of enormous markets and profits have evolved into a scary and unfortunate reality.  Vendors of connected devices have little to no incentive to make their products secure. Technologically illiterate consumers who barely know how to configure their home router fail to use their purchasing power to command security in the products. The result is a marketplace where neither the demand nor the supply side value security. Hence, a world of highly insecure and fragile connected devices have emerged.</p>
<p>For some years, the EU realized potential risks following the digital revolution, and therefore decided to put forward standards to set the bar with regards to what is to be expected from connected devices. A standard is the first important step towards eventual regulation.</p>
<h3>The new standard in brief</h3>
<p>The EU sought to make the standard outcome oriented, as opposed to prescriptive. This allows vendors to comply without any stifling of innovation. The bar was set to establish a baseline of minimum security measures to protect against the most fundamental and elementary cyber security attacks.</p>
<p>The standard consists of 13 provisions. We are happy to report that our own Mender product comes with so many security features that almost half of these provisions will be covered if Mender is being used to secure an IoT device.</p>
<p>The 13 provisions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>No universal default passwords </li>
<li>Implement a means to manage reports of vulnerabilities </li>
<li>Keep software updated </li>
<li>Securely store sensitive security parameters </li>
<li>Communicate securely </li>
<li>Minimize exposed attack surfaces</li>
<li>Ensure software integrity</li>
<li>Ensure that personal data is secure </li>
<li>Make systems resilient to outages</li>
<li>Examine system telemetry data</li>
<li>Make it easy for users to delete user data </li>
<li>Make installation and maintenance of devices easy </li>
<li>Validate input data </li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these provisions have easy to understand and tangible sub provisions. An example would be: <em>“Provision 5.3-1: All software components in consumer IoT devices should be securely updateable”</em>. </p>
<p>Further, each sub provision comes with examples equally easy to understand and tangible. An example would be:<em> “The first stage boot loader on a device is written once to device storage and from then on is immutable.”</em></p>
<p>Jump to <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/303600_303699/303645/02.01.01_60/en_303645v020101p.pdf" target="_blank">page 13</a> in the standard to read more about each of the provisions and its sub provisions and examples.</p>
<h3>Expected implications of the new standard</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, this standard does not address the fundamental marketplace problem (illiterate consumers and profit seeking vendors). Consumers will remain ignorant to their insecure devices and the vendors continue to push for profit and view security as an extra unnecessary cost. Only naive politicians should expect a change in behavior following a standard like this.</p>
<p>The main implication of the new standard lies in its referenceable value. The EU finally has a recommended way to secure the world’s connected devices. </p>
<p>This standard already serves as the basis for UK’s law to require security labelling on connected devices (read more about that <a href="https://mender.io/blog/united-kingdom-to-introduce-security-labelling-on-connected-devices" target="_blank">here</a>). </p>
<p>Security auditing and consulting companies now possess a practical check-list to use in client work. By complying with the EU standard, devices will be orders of magnitude more secure than the typical IoT product of today.</p>
<p>If we don’t see a drastic improvement in the security of connected devices, the EU will impose regulations. When this happens this standard can be expected to form the basis for such regulation.</p>
<h3>GDPR for IoT is one big disaster away</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, a standard will not fix the fundamental demand-supply problem related to the security of IoT products. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, it seems like a big disaster following insecure IoT devices must occur before politicians step up and use their legislation sledge hammer. </p>
<p>Hopefully, such a big disaster comes in the form of geopolitical defense/military realizations that will not impact the life or health of humans. Worse case, somewhere in the world, we will witness some sort of critical infrastructure blow-up. Such an incident will serve as a huge wake-up call for everyone. When it happens, in the same way Facebook and social media brought us GDPR, such disaster will bring us strict IoT regulations.</p>

</span></code></pre></section></section><section><h2 id="what-are-foreign-data-wrappers">What are foreign data wrappers?</h2><p>The easiest way to describe foreign data wrappers is by considering UNIX files. A UNIX file isn't always pointing to a local file on your disk. It could be a file stored on NFS, in a remote S3 bucket or even a shim that lets you manipulate a device on your machine.</p><p>In UNIX, a file is a pretty strong abstraction that doesn't get broken. An IDE doesn't need to know that the file it's editing is on a remote filesystem. It can work with it by issuing the same ordinary read and write calls. Someone who writes a new filesystem doesn't need to make sure that it's compatible with all existing tools. Instead, they can write a driver that mounts the filesystem to a mountpoint.</p><p>PostgreSQL FDWs resemble mounting in that respect. Foreign tables mostly behave like normal tables and can receive the same <code>SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE</code> queries. Behind the scenes, the wrapper's only job is to emit tuples.</p></section><section><h2 id="why-should-i-use-fdws">Why should I use FDWs?</h2><p>Foreign data wrappers are a great alternative to ETL. Instead of loading data into your warehouse that you might never use, you can mount the remote database and query it on demand.</p><p>Because they integrate with the PostgreSQL query planner, FDWs have a decent performance. The FDW can push down qualifiers and even aggregations to the remote database. FDWs can report the rough costs of starting a scan and fetching a tuple back to the query planner. This lets the query planner choose, for example, whether running multiple small single scans or one big one is a better strategy for satisfying a JOIN.</p><p>It's straightforward to write your own FDW and the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/fdwhandler.html" as="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/fdwhandler.html">PostgreSQL documentation</a> covers it extensively. The <a href="https://github.com/wikrsh/hello_fdw/" as="https://github.com/wikrsh/hello_fdw/">hello-world FDW</a> that returns "Hello, World" in a table is only a couple hundred lines of C code. If you prefer to focus on development simplicity, you can use Multicorn instead of raw C.</p><p>There are plenty of open-source foreign data wrappers available. They let you query other RDBMSs, NoSQL databases, CSV files or column stores. The <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers" as="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers">PostgreSQL wiki</a> lists some of them.</p><p>Using a foreign data wrapper for your database or data source gives you access to a huge ecosystem of software that works with PostgreSQL. We can almost call this a network effect. A new data source that is accessible via an FDW enhances everything that works with PostgreSQL.</p></section><section><h2 id="why-use-fdws-with-splitgraph">Why use FDWs with Splitgraph?</h2><p><a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/foreign-data-wrappers/introduction" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/foreign-data-wrappers/introduction">Foreign data wrappers</a> are one of the ways that Splitgraph aims to make data engineers' and data scientists' work easier.</p><p>Splitgraph's <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/sgr/data-import-export/mount" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/sgr/data-import-export/mount"><code>sgr mount</code></a> command handles the boilerplate around FDW initialization.

People can’t work together effectively if they don’t understand each other; and the traditional “directory” of names, titles, and contact information doesn’t provide the context people need in today’s fast-paced, cross-functional, increasingly remote workplace.</span></p><p><span>We believe that everyone should be empowered to find and understand their colleagues, and also the teams and projects at their organization. In Rimeto, each person has a profile that represents them holistically and authentically at work - an insightful and automatically-generated picture of their experience, affiliations, skills, focus areas, and much more.</span></p><p><span>Like Rimeto, Slack transforms the way organizations collaborate. Joining Slack is a special opportunity to accelerate Rimeto’s mission and impact with greater reach, expanded resources, and the support of Slack’s impressive global team. As part of Slack, we will be working to ensure that Slack is the place people find and learn about the people they work with - both inside their organization and beyond.</span></p><p><span>We’re proud that many prominent organizations have deployed Rimeto to their global workforces.</span><strong> </strong><span>To our customers: we deeply appreciate your trust in us. We will continue to deliver the great experience you value. And we’re excited to bring new capabilities to the 750,000 organizations using Slack, including 65 of the Fortune 100. We look forward to sharing our product roadmap over the coming months. If you're interested in Rimeto for your organization,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://slack.com/rimeto"><u>click here</u></a><span>&nbsp;to contact our team.</span></p><p><span>And there would be no Rimeto without our tremendously talented team.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>Newsletters are great, but too much of a distraction if they end up straight in your inbox with no predictable schedule.</p>
<p><a href="https://hey.com/">Hey</a> — the email service by the Basecamp folks — solves this by creating a separate space for newsletters, "The Feed". Here newsletters are shown in a timeline UI without read states. You can casually scroll through newsletters whenever you feel like it, and you do not see them in your main inbox. For most newsletters, this is a great experience.</p>
<p>I liked this concept so much that I decided to integrate it in <a href="https://mailbrew.com/">Mailbrew</a>, my SaaS that lets people receive an email digest from their favorite sources (even DHH himself <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1214356945932435457?s=20">uses it</a>).</p>
<p>My implementation works like this: when signing up for Mailbrew, you get your own email address to receive newsletters: <code>&lt;username&gt;@inbox.mailbrew.com</code>. </p>
<p>All emails sent to that address end up in daily digest with the schedule you decided. We also created a Hey-style feed browsable at <code>app.mailbrew.com/inbox</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://frankdilo.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/mailbrew-inbox.gif" alt="Mailbrew Inbox in action"></p>
<p>We built all of this in a couple of weeks and it was easier to setup than I originally predicted. The tooling around email is great these days.</p>
<h3>Backend</h3>
<p>Amazon SES handles our inbound emails with some help from Lambda.</p>
<p>Here's how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>When an email arrives at an <code>@inbox.mailbrew.com</code> address, SES uploads the raw email message to S3 and launches a lambda function. Configuring this from the AWS console was 5-10 minutes work.</li>
<li>The lambda function calls Mailbrew's backend (a majestic Django monolith), webhook-style, with recipient address, sender address, and message id.</li>
<li>If we don't recognize the recipient address (no user with that username) we send a special response to the lambda that causes the email to bounce.</li>
<li>If the recipient address matches, then we use the message id to retrieve the raw message content from S3 and process it.</li>
<li>Processing the message consists in extracting the <code>text/html</code> version of the email, applying some basic CSS styles, uploading this processed version to S3 and saving the message metadata in Postgres for easy retrieval.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Frontend</h3>
<p>In the frontend, emails are presented in a CRA React app. We embed the content of each email in a dedicated <code>iframe</code>. </p>
<p>A cool trick that we used was to create the <code>iframe</code> in JavaScript and set its content programmatically instead of settings its <code>src</code> property. This granted us an higher degree of customization and allowed us to do things like having all links inside newsletters open in new tabs.</p>
<p>The HTML of the emails in the S3 bucket is private, so we generate signed urls backend-side to show them. </p>
<p>One last cool thing we wanted to do was to have a link that allowed to read a single newsletter without the hassle of authentication. When opening a newsletter from the links in the daily email digest that we send users, we didn't want them to have to authenticate each time (almost a certainty with multiple devices and the in-app browsers of email clients).</p>
<p>We achieved this by using JSON Web Tokens. Each linked newsletter email in the digest has a token in the URL allowing read-only access to just that message. These links don't look great, but they work, are sharable, and don't require me to keep any state in the backend.</p>
<hr>
<p>This update brings the product closer to my vision of <strong>the single email you read everyday</strong> to stay on top of your game without wasting time. </p>
<p>You can now create a daily digest with Newsletters, Hacker News posts, RSS feeds, Reddit links, <a href="http://dev.to/">Dev.to</a> posts, YouTube videos and much more. The best part is that you receive this just once per day, on your own schedule. </p>
<p>Mailbrew is how I have stayed informed for the past 6 months and here is my <a href="https://app.mailbrew.com/frankdilo/morning-brew-fsKPZhXeFabm">daily digest</a> if you want to check out what the product is capable of.</p>
<p>I am <a href="https://twitter.com/frankdilo">@frankdilo</a> on Twitter if you have any feedback about Mailbrew or this post.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<p>Bashing the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) seems to have become one of American activists’ favourite hobbies in the tech field. Some criticism is entirely justified. But many claims that the GDPR is “counterproductive” or “misses the point” are based on misconceptions, rather than an accurate understanding of European data protection laws.</p>
<p>As a result, several US privacy advocates have therefore suggested alternative principles or rules… many of which, actually, have been part of EU data protection law since 1995.</p>
<p>So, <a href="https://twitter.com/hugoroyd/status/1246024493144911873">as promised</a>, here is:</p>
<p><strong>The GDPR as accidentally explained by people in the US who criticize the GDPR for its pitfalls, while calling for what’s actually in the GDPR</strong></p>
<p>If you have other examples to illustrate this, let me know so I can add them to this post. I may update this post from time to time, so <a href="https://hroy.eu/tags/gdprExplainedByUS/index.atom">subscribe to the feed</a> to get notified!</p>
<p><em>A short note:</em> My intention with this post is to help you, my reader from the US or elsewhere, understand better what’s actually in the GDPR. I have great respect for many of the people mentioned below (some of whom I consider or have considered personal heroes). I hope they are fine with a bit of teasing ;-)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Snowden also directed some criticism at data privacy authorities that have tried to step up regulation on companies over how they handle user data. He said the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation […] “misplaces the problem.”</p>
<p>“The problem isn’t data protection, the problem is data collection,” Snowden said. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/04/edward-snowden-warns-about-data-collection-surveillance-at-web-summit.html">Source</a></p>

<p><em>Edward Snowden said this at the Web Summit: “I think GDPR is not the solution, but the problem is with data collection not data use. It gives a false sensation of reassurance.” What are your thoughts on this?</em></p>
<p>[Tim Wu:] I think he has a point…that’s what my criticism of GDPR is. It doesn’t actually stop anyone from doing anything. Collect all you want…and I think that’s where the problem starts.

<p>Edward Snowden and Tim Wu argue that regulations on data use are not sufficient to protect people. For them, a good regulation should start with data collection.</p>
<p>That is why, since 1995<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, EU data protection law regulates not only data use, but also the collection of personal data.</p>
<p>More specifically, the GDPR covers the processing of personal data. Processing is defined in the GDPR as “<em>any operation</em>” performed on personal data. <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679#d1e1489-1-1">Article 4(2) of the GDPR</a> includes data “<em>collection</em>” explicitly.</p>
<p><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679#d1e1797-1-1">Article 5(1)</a> sets the principle of “<em>data minimisation</em>”, and also provides that personal data must be “<em>collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes</em>.”</p>
<p>If personal data is collected in breach of these rules, the company responsible for the infringement may be fined up to 4 % of their global annual turnover (or EUR 20,000,000 if higher). Authorities may also order the company to destroy the data collected in breach – regardless of whether the data was ever used or not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are so many ways to use data to hurt people that the only safe database is the one that was never collected. Thus, instead of the EU’s approach (in the GDPR) of mainly regulating how personal data may be used, I propose a law to stop systems from collecting personal data.</p>
<p>The robust way to do that, the way that can’t be set aside at the whim of a government, is to require systems to be built so as not to collect data about persons. The basic principle is that a system must be designed not to collect certain data, if its basic function can be carried out without that data. Improving efficiency must explicitly not count as a justification for collecting more data. <a href="https://stallman.org/articles/real-privacy-laws.html">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Richard Stallman argues that laws must prohibit data collection if it is not necessary or not justified, and that systems must be designed not to collect certain data.</p>
<p>That is why, since 1995, EU data protection law regulates not only data use, but also the collection of personal data (see <a href="#snowdenwu">above</a>).</p>
<p>Moreover, since 2018, the GDPR has extended the set of rules with the principles of data protection “by design” and “by default”.</p>
<p><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679#d1e3063-1-1">Article 25</a> provides, specifically, that systems must be designed to implement data minimisation effectively. In addition, technical and organisational measures must by default ensure that “<em>only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose of the processing are processed. That obligation applies to the amount of personal data collected […].</em>”</p>
<p>One last bit: Richard Stallman argues that “improving efficiency” of a system must not be a justification for collecting personal data.</p>
<p><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679#d1e1797-1-1">Article 5(1)</a> already provides that personal data must be “<em>collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes</em>.” Therefore, it seems that Richard Stallman’s interpretation of this principle means that “improving efficiency” may never be considered legitimate. Do you agree?</p>
<h2 id="consent">2. Individuals’ consent is not the right approach for privacy</h2>
<h3 id="maciej">Maciej Cegłowski (April 2020)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The European approach to privacy legislation has been to add layers of complexity, based on a kabuki dance of individual consent, where all that is needed are some strong legal limits on what data can be collected and how long it can be stored. <a href="https://twitter.com/Pinboard/status/1245699326522712064">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maciej argues that basing privacy legislation on individual consent is not the right approach and, instead, regulations should provide strong legal limits on data collection and data retention.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>That is why, since 1995, individual consent is only <em>one</em> among six legal bases that allow lawful collection of personal data. <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679#d1e1888-1-1">Article 6</a> of the GDPR requires at least one of six legal bases to be applicable. In many circumstances, “consent” is not considered as an adequate basis (e.g.&nbsp;in employee-employer relationships).</p>
<p><span id="consent-conditions">Even where consent may be considered adequate, it must fulfil strong conditions: to be a “<em>freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication</em>” of agreement expressed “<em>by a statement or by a clear affirmative action.</em>” (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679#d1e1489-1-1">Article 4(11)</a>)</span></p>
<p>If you thought that it’s sufficient to obtain consent to anything by checking a box to read and agree to the terms of service, or that merely browsing a website meant accepting cookies — you’ve been misled by the kabuki dance of people who wished the GDPR was centered around weak individual consent. In spite of GDPR strengthening conditions for consent, the online ad and tracking industry is still trying with their complex cookie banners and settings!</p>
<p>And, where sensitive data is concerned:</p>
<ul>
<li>collection is prohibited as a general rule,</li>
<li>unless explicit consent has been obtained and no EU or national laws rule out consent<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, or</li>
<li>unless one of the nine other exemptions listed in Article 9(2) applies (many of which require a EU or national law).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Additionally, the GDPR provides the principle of “<em>storage limitation</em>” in <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679#d1e1797-1-1">Article 5(1)(c)</a>.</p>
<p>Pursuant to this principle, personal data must be “<em>kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed</em>” i.e.&nbsp;when data is not necessary any more, it must be destroyed or anonymized.</p>
<p>The GDPR allows, however, for retaining data longer, in particular for archival, research or statistical purposes - subject to certain conditions (see Article 5 and Article 89 among others).</p></li>
<li><p>For the argument on data <a href="#collection">collection</a>, see above.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><small>To be entirely fair, and exhaustive — specific regulations may provide otherwise. The GDPR as its title suggests, is a “general” body of law. In certain circumstances, specific rules may contravene the general principles stated above. For instance, since 2009, the “EU cookie directive” (which modifies the “ePrivacy Directive” of 2002) requires consent as the <em>only</em> available basis for storing information or identifiers on a user’s device, or for accessing such stored information. There are, however, some exceptions, i.e.&nbsp;if necessary to provide services expressly requested…</small></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The EU’s GDPR regulation is well-meant, but does not go very far. It will not deliver much privacy because its rules are too lax. They permit collecting any data if it is somehow useful to the system, and it is easy to come up with a way to make any particular data useful for something.</p>
<p>The GDPR makes much of requiring users (in some cases) to give consent for collection of their data, but that doesn’t do much good. System designers have become expert at manufacturing consent (to repurpose Chomsky’s phrase). Most users consent to a site’s terms without reading them; a company that required users to trade their first-born child got consent from plenty of users. Then again, when a system is crucial for modern life, like buses and trains, users ignore the terms because refusal of consent is too painful to consider.</p>
<p>To restore privacy, we must stop surveillance before it even asks for consent. <a href="https://stallman.org/articles/real-privacy-laws.html">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Richard Stallman argues that it is too easy to trick users into consenting to the collection of their data, and that is it too easy to claim that data is “somehow useful”. Instead, we should stop surveillance before it even asks for consent.</p>
<p>That is why, under EU data protection laws:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Where individual consent is an adequate legal basis (which is not always the case), the GDPR puts strong legal conditions on what valid consent requires (see <a href="#consent-conditions">above</a>), so it cannot be considered “easy” to trick people into giving consent.</p></li>
<li><p>Where data is collected and used in connection with a contract (e.g.&nbsp;terms and conditions of an online service), only data that is “<em>necessary</em>” may be lawfully processed.</p>
<p><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679#d1e1888-1-1">Article 6</a> provides that processing in that context must be “<em>necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract</em>” — it is, therefore, not sufficient to consider that the data is “somehow useful”.</p></li>

Inspired by Docker and Git, it works on top of PostgreSQL and integrates seamlessly with anything that uses PostgreSQL. Our <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/explore" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/explore">data catalog</a> already includes over 40,000 datasets from government open data portals, all queryable via SQL.</p><p>The Splitgraph catalog classifies these datasets as <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/splitgraph-cloud/external-repositories">external repositories</a>. These are different from the default <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/concepts/repositories">Splitgraph repositories</a>, which are collections of <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/concepts/images">Splitgraph images</a>. Yet Splitgraph allows you to query them in the same way as you do Splitgraph images. For example, you can use SQL to query any repository or <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/socrata#using-metabase-to-join-and-plot-data-from-multiple-data-portals" as="/docs/ingesting-data/socrata#using-metabase-to-join-and-plot-data-from-multiple-data-portals"><code>JOIN</code> between multiple of them</a>. Or you can use Splitfiles to <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/socrata#splitfile" as="/docs/ingesting-data/socrata#splitfile">build reproducible datasets</a> from them. And every external repository includes an <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/splitgraph-cloud/publish-rest-api">auto-generated PostgREST API</a>.</p><p>External repositories allow Splitgraph Cloud to index live data without actually ingesting it. This way, you can use the catalog to discover live data. But you only need to ingest it when you're ready to query it, or snapshot it as part of a Splitgraph image.</p></section><section><h2 id="data-should-be-discoverable-and-composable">Data should be discoverable and composable</h2><p>Many services exist for cataloging data and making it discoverable. For example, <a href="https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/" as="https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/">Google Dataset Search</a> provides a nice interface for searching and discovering datasets (in fact, <a href="https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/search?query=opd%20crimes&amp;docid=jrM9a8yTUXMZaY1QAAAAAA%3D%3D" as="https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/search?query=opd%20crimes&amp;docid=jrM9a8yTUXMZaY1QAAAAAA%3D%3D">it even includes Splitgraph repositories</a>). The problem is, the data is fragmented and siloed across different data portals. It's nice to be able to search for data and download a CSV file. But most datasets are uninteresting in isolation. The real power comes from the ability to combine datasets and query them together.</p><p>Splitgraph does not only provide an index for discovering open data. It also provides the tools for composing open datasets together. For example, mounting the data from the <a href="https://data.cambridgema.gov/" as="https://data.cambridgema.gov">Cambridge</a> and <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/" as="https://data.cityofchicago.org">Chicago</a> data portals is as simple as running two commands:</p><pre><code metastring=""><span><span>$</span> <span>sgr <span>mount</span> socrata chicago -o <span>'{"domain": "data.cityofchicago.org"}'</span></span></span>
<span>Connecting to remote server...
Mounting Socrata domain...
Getting Socrata metadata
warning: Requests made without an app_token will be subject to strict throttling limits.

<span>Connecting to remote server...
Mounting Socrata domain...
Getting Socrata metadata
warning: Requests made without an app_token will be subject to strict throttling limits.
Loaded metadata for 137 Socrata tables
</span></code></pre><p>At this point, all the datasets in these two data portals are available for querying. You can query them in isolation, or you can query them together. You can use a Splitfile, <code>sgr sql</code>, or any standard SQL client:</p><p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitgraph/splitgraph.com/master/content/docs/0300_ingesting-data/images/socrata/1_dbeaver_overview.png" as="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitgraph/splitgraph.com/master/content/docs/0300_ingesting-data/images/socrata/1_dbeaver_overview.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitgraph/splitgraph.com/master/content/docs/0300_ingesting-data/images/socrata/1_dbeaver_overview.png" alt="DBeaver overview"></a></p><p>Here's how you can compare daily COVID cases in Chicago and Cambridge (from two separate data portals) with a standard <code>JOIN</code> query:</p><pre><code metastring=""><span>SELECT</span>
    cambridge_cases<span>.</span><span>date</span> <span>AS</span> <span>date</span><span>,</span>
    chicago_cases<span>.</span>cases_total <span>AS</span> chicago_daily_cases<span>,</span>

</code></pre><p>(For more details and in-depth instructions, see the <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/socrata">Socrata FDW documentation</a>.)</p><p>Note that this is not limited to combining multiple public datasets. Often, the work of a data analyst includes combining internal data with public or licensed datasets from external vendors. The same semantics of "mounting" data in Splitgraph apply.</p></section><section><h2 id="mounting-vs-cloning-data">Mounting vs. Cloning Data</h2><p>With Splitgraph, there are two primary ways to ingest data: cloning it or mounting it.</p><p><a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/working-with-data/clone-vs-checkout">"Cloning" (and checking-out)</a> an image means downloading a versioned data image, which is a snapshot of a database comprised of delta-compressed diffs. For example, the result of running a Splitfile is an image.</p><p>"Mounting" means establishing a connection to a live data source. The term comes from the idea of "mounting" a filesystem. A mounted table uses a <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/foreign-data-wrappers/introduction">foreign data wrapper</a> (FDW), and you don't ingest data from it until you query it. For example, the <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/socrata">Socrata FDW</a> translates SQL queries to <a href="https://dev.socrata.com/docs/queries/" as="https://dev.socrata.com/docs/queries/">SoQL queries</a> and forwards them to the Socrata server.</p><p>(For more details on mounting data, FDWs and custom mount handlers, read our recent <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/blog/foreign-data-wrappers">"foreign data wrappers" blog post</a>.)</p></section><section><h2 id="mounting-data-in-splitgraph-cloud">Mounting data in Splitgraph Cloud</h2><p>Mounting is the key abstraction that allows Splitgraph Cloud to index external repositories with features like an auto-generated REST API. On the backend, the "query API" (a subject for a later post) uses the Splitgraph library and Socrata mount handler to mount repositories on demand. Then it exposes the mounted schemata to a customized version of <a href="http://postgrest.org/" as="http://postgrest.org/">PostgREST</a> which creates the API.</p><p>Separately, a periodic Airflow task queries the Socrata metadata API to discover and index over 40,000 repositories. Conveniently, the same Socrata software powers over 200 government open-data portals, so one mount handler provides a large catalog of useful live data.</p></section><section><h2 id="avoiding-the-pull-of-data-gravity">Avoiding the pull of Data Gravity</h2><p>Mounting is a powerful abstraction because it allows you to interact directly with upstream data sources, avoiding the need for ETL. In 2010, GE Engineer Dave McCrory coined the term "<a href="https://datagravitas.com/2010/12/07/data-gravity-in-the-clouds/" as="https://datagravitas.com/2010/12/07/data-gravity-in-the-clouds/">data gravity</a>." In his blog post, he observed that "data if large enough can be virtually impossible to move."</p><p>Splitgraph, as a data versioning solution, should work with all your data, not just the subsets of it that you can move. Traditional ETL tools force you to ingest or duplicate your data before you can interact with it. With Splitgraph, you only need to pull upstream data into your images at query time. This allows incremental adoption and quick experimentation; there is no need to move your data warehouse to start using Splitgraph. Instead, you only need to setup an FDW.</p><p>Note that the idea of data gravity applies to versioned data images (which you clone) as much as it does to upstream, live data (which you mount). What if you want to import only a subset of data from a large image? This is the use case for <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/large-datasets/layered-querying">layered querying</a>, which allows you to "check out" an image without downloading it. Instead, Splitgraph creates an FDW that queries only the "layers" of the image necessary to satisfy the query. You can think of layered querying like a mount handler for Splitgraph images.</p></section><section><h2 id="looking-to-the-future">Looking to the future</h2><p>At the moment, Splitgraph Cloud only uses the <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/socrata">Socrata FDW</a> as a mount handler for external repositories, since the <a href="https://www.tylertech.com/products/socrata" as="https://www.tylertech.com/products/socrata">Socrata data platform</a> powers most government open-data portals.  In the future, it could use additional mount handlers to provide access to a wider array of upstream sources. To create an external repository, Splitgraph just needs a suitable FDW and a way to index the upstream data. For example, it's easy to imagine indexing Google BigQuery datasets. More interestingly, an on-premise version of Splitgraph could index private databases or data warehouses behind a firewall.</p><p>Our goal for Splitgraph is to make tools for data science as easy and pleasurable to use as tools for coding. That's why our main philosophy is to "stay out of the way." Mounting data is a great example of this philosophy in action. Why force your data warehouse to talk to Splitgraph, when Splitgraph can talk to your data warehouse?</p><p>In the meantime, make sure to <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/explore">explore data</a> on Splitgraph. If you know SQL, you can <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/getting-started/five-minute-demo">get started</a> in less than 10 minutes.</p></section></div></article></section></div>]]>

<h3><span id="Https_Redirection_middleware"></span>Https Redirection middleware<span></span></h3>



<p>In asp.net core <a href="https://pradeeploganathan.com/http/https/">https </a>is enabled by default. The <a aria-label="HttpsRedirection middleware class  (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/aspnet/BasicMiddleware/blob/354cb18d6304b24063d460e0a41c6c1d51ea4000/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy/HttpsRedirectionMiddleware.cs#L139" target="_blank">HttpsRedirection middleware class </a>provides the necessary functionality to enforce redirection from http to https. The UseHttpsRedirection extension method in startup is used to enforce this. This extension method issues a 307 temporary redirect response by default. It then uses the configured https port to specify the redirection endpoint. If the https port is not specified in code, this class will get the https port from HTTPS_PORT environment variable or the IServerAddress feature. If either of them is not specified, then the middleware will log a warning and will not redirect. The code below shows an example of adding the https redirection middleware to the services collection and using it. The code below checks the environment and sets a permanent redirect to the HTTPS endpoint in production and a temporary redirect in development environment.</p>



<p><figcaption>Adding HTTPRedirection</figcaption></p>



<h3><span id="Development_certificates"></span>Development certificates<span></span></h3>



<p>To enable the use of HTTPS in the development environment, .net core provides a global tool that creates a self-signed certificate on the local environment. The following command can install this tool</p>



<blockquote><p>dotnet tool install –global dotnet-dev-certs</p></blockquote>



<p>The tool can now be used to generate self-signed certificates with the following command. The -ep flag signifies the export path where the certificate will be exported and the -p flag signifies the password required to generate the certificate. We can use the –trust option to trust the certificate generated.</p>



<blockquote><p>dotnet dev-certs https -ep &lt;path_to_certficate&gt;/certificate.pfx -p &lt;certificate_password&gt; </p><p>dotnet dev-certs https –trust</p></blockquote>



<p>On Linux/Mac OS we can use OpenSSL to generate the certificate for the local environment. Trusting the certificate is however a much more involved process depending on the version and flavor of the Linux OS.</p>



<blockquote><p>openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout dev-certificate.key -out dev-certificate.cer -days 365 -subj /CN=localhost<br>openssl pkcs12 -export -out dev-certificate.pfx -inkey dev-certificate.key -in dev-certificate.cer</p></blockquote>



<p>The certificate path can be specified using the environmental variable  ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path   &amp; the password using environment variable ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password </p>



<h3><span id="Kestrel_as_edge_server"></span>Kestrel as edge server<span></span></h3>



<p>Kestrel can be deployed either as an edge server or with a reverse proxy such as IIS, NGINIX or Apache.</p>



<figure><img src="https://pradeeploganathan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kestrel.png" alt="" srcset="https://pradeeploganathan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kestrel.png 657w, https://pradeeploganathan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kestrel-300x115.png 300w, https://pradeeploganathan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kestrel-610x234.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px" data-lazy-srcset="https://pradeeploganathan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kestrel.png 657w, https://pradeeploganathan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kestrel-300x115.png 300w, https://pradeeploganathan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kestrel-610x234.png 610w" data-lazy-src="https://pradeeploganathan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kestrel.png?is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Kestrel deployment scenarios</figcaption></figure>



<p>When Kestrel is deployed as a public facing edge server it can be configured to use https and a specific certificate and port using the below code</p>



<p><figcaption>Configuring Kestrel as edge server</figcaption></p>



<h3><span id="Terminating_TLS_at_a_Reverse_proxy"></span>Terminating TLS at a Reverse proxy<span></span></h3>



<p>If a reverse proxy such as Apache or NGNIX is used, then the forwarded headers middleware should be configured and setup before calling the Https redirection middleware. The forwarded headers middleware should set the X-Forwarded-Proto to https. This will enable https offloading at the proxy and a plain http call to the web application with a guarantee that the original call was made over a secure https channel. This is critical especially in non-IIS scenarios such as NGINIX or Apache.  See the code below to configure the forwarded headers middleware</p>



<p><figcaption>Forwarded headers from a reverse proxy</figcaption></p>



<h3><span id="HTTPS_in_containerized_environment"></span>HTTPS in containerized environment<span></span></h3>



<p>In a containerized environment an option is to generate the certificates as part of container creation or startup and specify the same in the docker compose file. The environment files can then be used to configure the necessary environment variables as below</p>



<p><figcaption>Using certificates in a docker volume </figcaption></p>



<p>The corresponding environment files to specify the necessary environment variables are below</p>



<p><figcaption>using environment variables in docker to specify certificate path</figcaption></p>



<h3><span id="HTTPS_strict_transport_security_(HSTS)"></span>HTTPS strict transport security (HSTS)<span></span></h3>



<p>Using HTTPS redirection still presents a minor security risk as the user can make an initial request using HTTP before being redirected to a secure HTTPS connection. To overcome this the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) Protocol adds a header in responses indicating that only HTTPS should be used when sending requests to the web endpoint. Once an HSTS header has been received, clients that support the HSTS protocol will always send requests to the application using HTTPS even if the user specifies an HTTP URL. In .NET Core 3.1, We can add the HSTS middleware to the pipeline as below.</p>



<p><figcaption>Adding HSTS</figcaption></p>



<p>In the above code we are specifying HSTS preload to be set to true. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.chromium.org/hsts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HSTS preloading</a> is a function built into the browser whereby a global list of hosts enforces the use of HTTPS ONLY on their site. The domains are hard coded into the browser, which avoids the initial insecure request and ensures that only HTTPS is used. Another crucial point that trips up a lot of folks is that the HSTS header is not set even if you specify the use of HSTS middleware for localhost and the loopback address for IPV6 and IPV4. This is because the ExcludeHosts parameter by default excludes these addresses.</p>



<p>In summary .NET core provides a lot of ways to configure https for web applications with Kestrel as an edge server or through SSL offloading/TLS termination. It also provides for options to configure the same through code or through configuration or using a docker compose file.</p>

<p>… or it took a while to get here 😀</p>
<h4>Origins</h4>
<p>This project is fully lead by Willy/Lamers with my minor participation.</p>
<p>It all started with an idea to create the most convenient modern USB mouse adapter for as many retro machines as possible.</p>
<p>Willy started working on it in his spare-time six years ago. The project goals were simple.</p>
<ul><li>small, smooth and not expensive design</li><li>reliable</li><li>quadrature encoder mouse support</li><li>easy to use and maintain</li><li>easy to personalize/configure</li><li>quick firmware upgrade</li></ul>
<p>The project came about quite quickly and Willy ordered the first batch. Unfortunately, It met almost all conditions but one – reliability. The design was based on the FTDI Vinculum2 chip. Although the layout is not bad, the toolchain is terribly underdeveloped (at least it was at that time). There were memory leaks all over the place, debugging was almost impossible, mainly due to the processor for which there is no documentation. In addition, the configuration saved from time to time destroyed the config itself …<br>It was too much. The project has been abandoned. If you are a strong-willed person you can try it yourself. All work that was done on it, is accessible <a href="http://jil.guru/16bit/projects/abbannddonnedd/hid2st.rar">HERE</a>. You can view or use it if you have the energy to break through the unfinished, wrong and undocumented code</p>
<h4>The new hope</h4>
<p>In the meantime, the design was repeatedly unearthed from a drawer, but unfortunately without much effect. Some of the original goals turned out to be impossible to fulfill.</p>
<p>Up to <a href="http://sillyventure.eu/pl/">Silly Venture 2019</a> which turned out to be a breakthrough. the demand for a functional Atari ST adapter turned out to be quite large. The mouSTer project was born.</p>
<p>The project received a new name “The mouSTer” and <a href="http://www.ha.art.pl/wydawnictwo/autorzy/5334-piotr-kroll-mietniowski.html">Kroll</a> (translator required) became its godfather. I hope he doesn’t mind :). Kroll is the best tester of an Atari equipment around.</p>
<p>The project has gained a new shape and new strengths.</p>
<p>Some early prototype pics:</p>
<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/j2aoKg8.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/j2aoKg8.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>

<p>At the moment, the current size has been reduced to a minimum – DB9 plug size + USB-A socket</p>
<p>Below some highlights:</p>
<ul><li>it works with every mouse and with every Game USB pad</li><li>PS4 pad support – USB </li><li>config via USB flash drive – INI file + default config</li><li>config transfer via USB flash drive</li><li>firmware upgrade via USB flash drive (takes 3 seconds, of which 2 seconds is the time the bootloader needs to recognize the flash drive)</li><li>tested with flash drives from 32MB to 32GB</li><li>mouse emulation mode defaults – Amiga, Atari ST, joystick/gamepad</li></ul>
<h4>Current state</h4>
<p>Finally, after a few months of testing in laboratory conditions, everything works rock-solid. Changing the firmware and configuration works confidently and is trouble-free.</p>

<p><br>What’s left to be done<mark id="annotation-text-c72ef339-eeed-462d-a5c9-61b4fb1fb90d"></mark>:</p>
<ul><li>making a test batch in the target size – closing the plant due to COVID19 did not help at all 🙁</li><li>configuration file tuning</li><li>creating a poly-urethane case</li><li>adding config options for Commodore 64/128, Spectrum, and every other possible retro machine.</li><li>PS4 pad full support for all platforms.</li><li>8-bit Atari will receive a special mode that will cover all the PS4 pad functions, mouse and other HID class devices</li><li>testing, testing, testing …</li></ul>
<p><strong>What has to be highlighted is that mouSTer started as an ATARI add-on but it aims to be multi-platform adapter!!</strong></p>

		<p>I have a confession to make: I can’t eat spicy food.</p>
<p>As a person of South Asian descent, it’s incongruous, I know. I’m left adrift with the certain type of person who orders food Indian spicy. While my dining companions make an effort to signal their identity as capsaicin-consuming, I wonder if I should order my food white-guy mild. It’s not like I don’t enjoy the stinging heat or the bleary-eyed trip of something made extra hot—it’s just that I can’t digest it.</p>

<p>I blame dysentery. A bout of it when I was three left two lasting effects on my life: it introduced me to my oldest friendship through a circuitous game of chance (a story for another time), and it rendered my digestive system subject to pains that feel like someone is reaching into me to wring out my guts like wet laundry.</p>
<p>I’m often told by well-meaning people how much they love Indian food, and then asked if I cook it at home. I never know quite how to respond. Does roti count—especially if it’s the buss-up shut <i>parāthā</i> of Trinidad? Where do Bihari staples like <i>sattū</i> (ground-up roasted gram) or <i>chōkha</i> (mashed and roasted eggplant) fit into this understanding? But their question isn’t an interrogation of the narrowness of national cuisines. Their question isn’t a question at all—it’s a chance to share. The woman who loves her corner Indian restaurant. The man who just took an Indian-cooking class through adult education. The reasons are usually the same: they love the heat, the fieriness, the spice.</p>
<p>All the things I’m doomed to avoid.</p>

<p>This all had me wondering: what’s Indian food without the heat? The historian in me has an answer: spiciness is historically contingent. In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue and the entire world changed: slavery, war, disease, colonization, and an immense transfer of wealth to Europe. And with that wealth too came New World nightshades—potatoes, tomatoes, tobacco, peppers of all kinds. It took some time for these fruits and vegetables to plant themselves into European cuisine. The tomato, for example, wasn’t widely used in Italian cuisine until the eighteenth century.<span id="easy-footnote-1-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-69820" title="David Gentilecore, <i>Pomodoro! A History of the Tomato in Italy</i> (New York: Columbia University Press, 2010), 45–68."><sup>1</sup></a></span> But what about food further out from Europe? What about India?</p>
<p>Soon after Columbus’ first expedition, the treaties of Tordesillas and Saragossa divided the oceans of the newly-known world. The Portuguese effectively took the Atlantic and Indian oceans, while the Spanish took the Pacific. With that, the Portuguese established forts and trading posts along India’s Malabar coast. In time, <i>aloo</i> (potato), <i>tamātar</i> (tomato), and <i>mirchī</i> (chilies) were available on the western coast of the Indian subcontinent. Later, the English set up their first trading posts in India in the eastern Gangetic plain, bringing these same staples into North India.<span id="easy-footnote-2-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-69820" title="K.T. Achaya, <i>Indian Food: A Historical Companion</i> (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1998), 225–27."><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>
<p>So what was curry like before Columbus? Well, <i>curry</i> didn’t exist.</p>
<p>In these cases, I find it useful to consult my <i>Hobson-Jobson</i>, the nineteenth-century dictionary of Anglo-Indian loan words. According to that source, curry comes from the Portuguese word <i>karil (caril)</i> via the Tamil word <i>kari</i> (sauce, relish for rice). In the sixteenth century, this was transliterated into English as caril, but by the 1680s entered English as <i>carrees</i>, perhaps from <i>caris</i>, an Anglicized plural form of the Portuguese.<span id="easy-footnote-3-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-69820" title="Sir Henry Yule, “Curry,” in <a href=&quot;https://dsalsrv04.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/hobsonjobson_query.py?page=281&quot;><i>Hobson-Jobson: A Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases, and of Kindred Terms, Etymological, Historical, Geographical and Discursive</i></a>, ed. William Crooke, B.A (London: J Murray, 1903), 281."><sup>3</sup></a></span> It’s a circle: I’m back to Tordesillas and Saragossa.</p>
<p>It looks like the curry too came after Columbus. And not only that: it’s a meaningless word in the context of daily life. Indian food is cipher, built upon a matrix of regionalism, religion, and caste. A Dalit from Mararashtra’s Marathwada region might mix bovine blood with <i>yesur</i> (a local spice mix) to make <i>lakuti</i>, while a Tamil Brahmin might mix eight spices with <i>tur dāl</i> and onions to make a <i>sambar</i>.<span id="easy-footnote-4-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-69820" title="Shahu Patole, <a href=&quot;http://www.expressfoodie.com/main-course/why-i-wrote-a-book-on-dalit-food/&quot;>“Why I Wrote a Book on Dalit Food,”</a> <i>Express Foodie</i>, September 10, 2016."><sup>4</sup></a></span> Beyond the hyper-regionalism is a blunt truth as well: there are actual words for the plethora of regional dishes that can be reduced to a curry.</p>
<p>Still, curry can be a somewhat useful concept. It’s an outsider’s perspective, a shorthand glossing over an entire subcontinent’s worth of food. It’s the type of concept that takes what it wants from the original, and mixes in whatever else is ready-to-hand.</p>
<p>I went to the source: the first example of a curry recipe found in a Western cookbook. Hannah Glasse’s 1747 <i>The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy</i> featured a recipe “To make a Currey the Indian way” alongside one “To make a Pellow the Indian way.”<span id="easy-footnote-5-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-69820" title="Hannah Glasse, <i>The Art of Cookery, New</i> (London: L. Wangford, 1777), 74."><sup>5</sup></a></span></p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ArtofCookery.png?resize=771%2C372&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="771" height="372" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ArtofCookery.png?resize=771%2C372&amp;ssl=1 771w, https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ArtofCookery.png?resize=336%2C162&amp;ssl=1 336w, https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ArtofCookery.png?resize=768%2C370&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ArtofCookery.png?resize=1536%2C741&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ArtofCookery.png?resize=2048%2C987&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ArtofCookery.png?resize=1170%2C564&amp;ssl=1 1170w" sizes="(max-width: 771px) 100vw, 771px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Upon first glance, I can’t tell how this recipe differs from a fricasseed chicken. But it’s there: “an ounce of Turmerick [turmeric], a large spoonful of ginger and beaten pepper.” What makes this curry in an Indian way is not the chicken or the cream, but these three spices taken mixed together and served.</p>
<p>Before spicy came spice: the history of curry before Columbus is a history of spice. And so I wonder: what spices were used? In what quantities?</p>
<p>The best spice to help answer these questions might be asafetida (also spelled asafetida). Known in Hindi as <i>hīng</i>, it’s the dried resin taken from the root of the Ferula herb, and is used throughout Indian cuisine in nearly all Indian regions. When fried in oil, it adds a lovely umami flavor to any dish, one reminiscent of garlic or onions.</p>
<p>I’ve also known it as an extremely smelly spice.</p>

<p>I had never heard of it until I was an adult. Family lore says that my father hated the smell so much, he told my mother early in their marriage to keep it out of the spice cabinet forever. But it wasn’t just him—the smell has a noxious reputation across the world, going back centuries. The Portuguese physician and naturalist Garcia de Orta wrote in his sixteenth-century <i>Colóquios</i> that “the nastiest smell in the world for me is Assa-fetida [sic].” But he also wrote that “the thing most used throughout India, and in all parts of it, is that Assa-fetida.”<span id="easy-footnote-6-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-6-69820" title="Garcia da Orta, <i>Colloquies on the Simples and Drugs of India</i>, ed. Conde de Ficalho, trans. Sir Clements Markham, New Lisbon Edition (London: Henry Sotheran and Co, 1913), 44–45."><sup>6</sup></a></span></p>
<p>This was as true in the twelfth century as it was in the sixteenth. One of the earliest South Asian texts that featured non-medicinal recipes was the Sanskrit <i>Mānasollāsa</i>. Written in 1129 CE by Someshvara III, king of the Western Chalukya Empire in the western Deccan and South India, the book is an encyclopedic treatise on all aspects of life in his kingdom. One of those most common ingredients found in its chapter on the enjoyment of food is asafetida.<span id="easy-footnote-7-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-7-69820" title="Colleen Taylor Sen, <i>Feasts and Fasts: A History of Food in India</i>, Overdrive (eBook) edition (London: Reaktion Books, 2015), chap. 7."><sup>7</sup></a></span></p>
<p>For example, his general practices or preparing meat dishes called for the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>For getting good smell, dry coriander seeds, jeera, and hingu; for giving colour haridra; for good taste the powder of saindhvam, visvamarichim are sprinkled over the food and covered with a clean cloth and mixed slightly with oil.<span id="easy-footnote-8-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-8-69820" title="P. Arundhati, trans., <i>Royal Life in Mānasôllāsa</i> (New Delhi: Sundeep Prakashan, 1994), 120."><sup>8</sup></a></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Various other recipes, including those for <i>dāl</i>, meat dishes, and fish were also spiced with asafetida.<span id="easy-footnote-9-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-9-69820" title="Sen, chap. 7."><sup>9</sup></a></span> My first inclination when I saw this was to question it: of course a king would spice his food. Spices were a luxury, and it goes without saying that a king could afford to command his kitchen to use whatever spices were available to him.</p>

<p>But a century prior to the publication of the <i>Mānasollāsa</i> came the <i>Lokopakara</i> (roughly translates to “For the benefit of the people”). Written in 1025 by the Jain scholar Chavundaraya II, the<i> Lokopakara</i> featured a section on cooking with a recipe for <i>dāl </i>that recommended a garnish of mustard, cumin seeds, asafetida, and curry leaves.<span id="easy-footnote-10-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-10-69820" title="Sen, chap. 7."><sup>10</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Asafetida too made an appearance in recipes dating from the Sultanate era. From 1206 to 1526, a succession of Islamic dynasties known as the Delhi Sultanate ruled northern India. Nasir ud-Din Shah, a ruler of the Malwa Sultanate (a breakaway state from one of the Delhi Sultanate dynasties) produced the <i>Ni’matnama</i> (“The Book of Delights”). The book contained some of the recipes loved by his father, the Sultan Ghiyath Shah. Interestingly enough, the book contains a handful of recipes considered rustic or common—food for the common folk.</p>
<p>One recommends to:</p>
<blockquote><p>take root vegetables and boil them well, then take them off and fry them in ghee flavoured with sesame and asafetida.</p>
<p>Add lime juice, salt and burned vegetable oil and mix it as explained above. Take some of it, flavor it and cook it.<span id="easy-footnote-11-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-11-69820" title="Norah M. Titley, ed., <i>The Ni’matnama Manuscript of the Sultans of Mandu: The Sultan’s Book of Delights</i> (London: Routledge, 2004), 44–45."><sup>11</sup></a></span></p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure how burned vegetable oil would taste, but I’m sure the asafetida would make up for it. Maybe.</p>
<p>Humble <i>hīng</i> too made an appearance in the royal accounts of the Mughals. The Mughal Emperor Akbar reigned from 1556 to 1605. His court historian, Abu’l-Fazl ‘Allami, dutifully chronicled his reign in <i>Ain-i-Akbari</i> (“Administration of Akbar”). The work remains a quintessential source for the workings of Akbar’s government. It also contains a repertoire of recipes. For example, a recipe for <i>bādinjān</i> (eggplant) asks for:</p>
<blockquote><p>10 s. [<i>sīr</i>, approximately 640 grams] rice; 1 ½ s. g’hí [ghee], 3 ¾ s. onions; ¼ s. ginger and lime juice; pepper and coriander seed, 5 m. [misqal, approximately 6 grams] of each; cloves, cardamums [cardamom], and assafoetida, each ½ m.<span id="easy-footnote-12-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-12-69820" title="Abu’l-Fazl ’Allami, <i>The Ain I Akbari</i>, trans. Henry Blochmann, vol. 1 (Calcutta: Rouse, 1873), 59."><sup>12</sup></a></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Strangely enough, the recipe for eggplant lacks any mention of eggplant. But regardless, there it is: a half <i>misqal</i> of asafetida.<span id="easy-footnote-13-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-13-69820" title="A unit of mass equal to 4.25 grams. Misqal is sometimes written as mithqāl."><sup>13</sup></a></span> Even the kitchens of the Mughal court were filled with the wondrous odors of <i>hīng</i>.</p>
<p>The history of curry before Columbus is truly a history of spice. There are, of course, more spices to find in the archives: turmeric, coriander, and cumin come to mind. These are spices that cross region and class, the staples thrown into the pot in meal after meal. But ubiquitous, smelly, resinous <i>hīng</i> gives a chance to take a peek into the flavors of Indian food prior to the Columbian exchange. Perhaps there should be a new way to order something, not Indian spicy, but Indian spiced, with plenty of asafetida. I’ll hold my nose and ask for a generous portion, just like all those food chroniclers over the past millennium.</p>

July 7, 2020 | https://lord.io/blog/2020/usernames/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://lord.io/blog/2020/usernames/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In 2006, Robert Andersen sent <a href="https://twitter.com/rsa/status/55281">the first tweet that @mentioned another user</a>, and an internet convention was born.</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of a tweet reading &quot;@ buzz - you broke your thumb and youre still twittering? that's some serious devotion&quot;" src="https://lord.io/images/2020/usernames_1.png"></p>
<p>In a world without smartphones, Twitter’s primary interface was SMS. There were no threads, no @username autocomplete. If a user said something and you wanted to reply, your only option was to compose a new text to 40404, manually typing the @mention into your phone’s SMS text box. SMS was also the origin of Twitter’s original <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/counting-characters">140 character</a> limit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Twitter began as an SMS text-based service. This limited the original Tweet length to 140 characters (which was partly driven by the 160 character limit of SMS, with 20 characters reserved for commands and usernames).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also a holdover from the SMS days, Twitter does not allow any formatted or rich text. Users today work around this limitation by using the wide array of possibilities that Unicode affords. <a href="https://technastic.com/bold-text-twitter-mobile-web/#List_of_Online_Text_Generators">Text generators</a> convert ASCII characters into 𝔲𝔫𝔲𝔰𝔲𝔞𝔩 𝔘𝔫𝔦𝔠𝔬𝔡𝔢 𝔠𝔥𝔞𝔯𝔞𝔠𝔱𝔢𝔯𝔰. Memes take advantage of repeated spaces to position text, or to draw Unicode houses. (All of that is, of course, completely inaccessible to screen readers.) Emoji modifiers allow expressing a wide range of emotions with modifiers for skin tones and gender.</p>
<p><img alt="two screenshots, one of a unicode house reading &quot;in this house we worship unicode&quot; and another with a tweet from @helllzgirl that say &quot;cashiers 🤝 ariana grande ... thank u, next&quot;" src="https://lord.io/images/2020/usernames_5.png"></p>
<p>Critically, this “plain” text is fully copy-pastable into any app with Unicode support. While many Twitter users from 2006 were likely limited to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM_03.38#GSM_8_bit_data_encoding">GSM-7 encoding</a>, the limitations of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T9_(predictive_text)">T9 keyboard</a>, and their phone’s limited text rendering and shaping, modern users have found new ways to express themselves using the full Unicode character space. Nowadays, tweets, names, URLs, hashtags, basically <em>everything</em> can contain Unicode characters. Of course, everything except the @mention.</p>
<p>Usernames on Twitter have more or less the same requirements as during the SMS era — up to 15 letters from <code>a-z</code>, numbers from <code>0-9</code> and the underscore <code>_</code>. This requirement is similar to many other websites: GitHub only allows alphanumeric characters and non-repeating hyphens, and Facebook allows just alphanumeric characters and the period.</p>
<p>As we will see, this limitation is one of several problems with usernames.</p>
<h2>Unicode Usernames</h2>
<p>Imagine if instead of alphanumerics, GitHub allowed usernames to only be made up of the numbers <code>0-9</code> and Chinese characters. It would be pretty frustrating, right? If forced to use a system like this, we would likely ignore the Chinese characters, and just use the numbers as usernames. This is often what happens on social media platforms in countries that don’t use Latin script. In China, the QQ instant messaging service (originally started in 1999) completely got rid of usernames used by similar services like AOL. Instead, each user is assigned a unique number, their QQ ID. This number cannot be chosed by the user, and is immutable. WeChat similarly assigns users a random number when they sign up, although it does allow each user exactly one opportunity to change it to an alphanumeric string of their choice. Typing long numbers isn’t particularly ergonomic, which could help explain the widespread use of QR codes in China.</p>
<p>Even in Latin-speaking countries, AOL-style usernames had issues. By requiring a username when logging in, and <em>also</em> requiring usernames to be unique among all users, users are often forced to use different usernames on different services, creating a second password that they had to memorize. Thankfully, most services have fixed at least this small problem by having login be email- instead of username-based.</p>
<p>Throughout the world, usernames are alphanumeric only. Why can’t we just allow Unicode, so that usernames could contain Chinese, Cyrillic, or other non-Latin alphabets? Unfortunately Unicode usernames have their own issues — just look at the largest username system in the world, the domain name system and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name">extension that allowed non-ASCII characters</a>. This was an essential upgrade, and yet it has inperfections, allowing the <a href="https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2017/04/chrome-firefox-unicode-phishing/">registration of websites</a> such as this one:</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of browser window, URL bar reads &quot;epic.com&quot;" src="https://lord.io/images/2020/usernames_2.png"></p>
<p>This is latest Firefox, as of July 2020, displaying what appears to be “epic.com”, the website of a large healthcare company. However, as you can see, the content is actually some random blog reminding people to drink water. How is this possible? If we stick the code into a Unicode character inspector, we can see what’s going on:</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of unicode character inspector revealing &quot;epic&quot; to actually be &quot;еріс&quot;. of course you, a screen reader user, aren't fooled." src="https://lord.io/images/2020/usernames_3.png"></p>
<p>Byte-wise, the real “epic.com” and the false website “еріс.com” are completely different. But visually, they’re indistinguishable from each other in the URL bar, allowing phishing problems to run amock. Unicode <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence">canonicalization and normalization</a> can help with certain cases of this problem, but does nothing for our epic.com example.</p>
<p>This particular example isn’t visible in Chrome, which instead shows <code>https://xn--e1awd7f.com/</code>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode">“punycode”</a> representation of the domain name. This is thanks to Chrome’s complex, <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/76be97d896f266d6b73b2fe0af5d6d479ca31306/docs/idn.md">13 step process</a> for detecting if a domain name is likely to be a Unicode phish or not. “Well, it may be complex,” you tell me, “but at least it solves the phishing problem!” Unfortunately it does not.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specific instances of IDN homograph attacks have been reported to Chrome, and we continually update our IDN policy to prevent against these attacks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Unicode spec is apparently too large to solve this problem 100% perfectly, and so their “solution” is to pay $2000 to anybody who finds new edge cases. This also doesn’t actually solve the problem for non-Latin alphabets — if for example, I own a Chinese domain name, it will never show punycode, and attackers can phish my site using duplicate encodings for those Chinese characters. Chrome just attempts to solve the much smaller problem of the numerous Unicode characters that visually look like the Latin alphabet.</p>
<p>This is probably frustrating to read, and you may want to point fingers at Unicode, for failing to provide canonical encodings for a series of graphemes. Or perhaps we can blame the domain name registrars, for allowing visually identical registrations. But I think the real culprit here is the incorrect assumption we Latin script users have when we build usernames into our systems. We assume that two visually-identical printed text tokens will have the same bytewise encoding. This is simply not true for a huge portion of computer users, and is a root failing with username-based systems today. The only solution is to develop systems that don’t have usernames.</p>
<p>Even in a trusted system with no bad actors, there is no guarantee a user retyping a non-Latin username from a printed document will end up with the same bytes as the original document.</p>
<h2>Changing Usernames</h2>
<p>Let’s say you’re building a site for English use only, and so even after reading all of this, you think perhaps it’s ok to have usernames. After all, you’ll probably find, like Twitter did, that this makes text entry for @mentions <em>much</em> simpler to implement. You get to use just a plain text field, instead of building an input field that can insert custom @mention objects.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you will still run into the issue of somebody <em>changing</em> their username. This is often an extremely complex problem. Take <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/changing-your-github-username">GitHub</a> for example. Changing your username there will redirect your old repository links to new ones. However, somebody else can come in and use your old username. What happens if they create a repo with the same name as your old one?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the new owner of your old username creates a repository with the same name as your repository, that will override the redirect entry and your redirect will stop working.</p>

<p>URLs aren’t the only place GitHub usernames are used. Using the web interface, in some cases, will create commits with the email <code><a href="https://lord.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="a6cbdfd3d5c3d4c8c7cbc3e6d3d5c3d4d588c8c9d4c3d6cadf88c1cfd2ced3c488c5c9cb">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code>. These commits will permanantly be disconnected from your account, unless you somehow are able to force push edited commit headers to every repository you’ve ever contributed to. Good luck with that.</p>
<p>Instagram has issues with changing usernames, too. Up until 2015, updating your username would cause you to lose all your previous @mentions. They’ve since fixed this; old @mentions eventually update. Twitter supposedly will also preserve your replies, although my testing shows this is an unreliable feature at best. Updating the actual @mention as it’s listed in the Tweet would have other issues, since if a user mentioned in a 280-character tweet adds 5 characters to their username, you’d suddenly get a 285-character tweet. Hope your Twitter clients can all support that.</p>
<p>The final example of username switching pains I have is from my year at Google. I was fortunate enough to never switch my username, perfectly satisfied every morning when I opened my laptop and saw <code><a href="https://lord.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="4a262b382e0a2d25252d262f64292527">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code> on the login screen. But countless internal systems used by engineers there assume usernames are immutable, making a username switch a multi-day process that is never really complete.</p>
<p>There is one easy “solution” to all of this, of course, which is to make it impossible to change your username. This is <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/19870?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en">what gmail does</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your account’s email address ends in @gmail.com, you usually can’t change it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love the “usually”. I guess in certain, mysterious cases it’s possible to change it? In any case, making a random, numeric user ID immutable is fine. But if that user ID contains letters and is user-selected, making it immutable is an unacceptable solution for real-world situations. Whether it contains a user’s deadname, or an old nickname they don’t go by any longer, or even for those of us who, in sixth grade, decided “lordjubjub” would be an excellent and professional email address (just a hypothetical example, of course), usernames need to be editable. If they’re editable, why not avoid all these username troubles and just go for a fully-Unicode, non-unique display name instead?</p>
<h2>Username Alternatives</h2>
<p>250 million people have registered for Discord, a chat app similar to Slack or IRC. However, unlike Slack and IRC whose usernames are local to a particular server, Discord has just one server, and usernames are universal. With 250 million users in a single username …</p></div></div>

July 7, 2020 | https://secret.club/2020/07/06/bottleye.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://secret.club/2020/07/06/bottleye.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>The popular anti-cheat <a href="https://battleye.com/">BattlEye</a> is widely used by modern online games such as <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/">Escape from Tarkov</a> and is considered an industry standard anti-cheat by many. In this article I will demonstrate a method I have been utilizing for the past year, which enables you to play any BattlEye-protected game online without even having to install BattlEye.</p><p>BattlEye is dynamically loaded by the respective game on startup to initialize the software service (“BEService”) and kernel driver (“BEDaisy”). These two components are critical in ensuring the integrity of the game, but the most critical component by far is the usermode library (“BEClient”) that the game interacts with directly. This module exports two functions: <code>GetVer</code> and more importantly <code>Init</code>.</p><p>The <em>Init</em> routine is what the game will call, but this functionality has never been documented before, as people mostly focus on BEDaisy or their <a href="https://secret.club/tags#battleye">shellcode</a>. Most important routines in <em>BEClient</em>, including <em>Init</em>, are protected and virtualised by <a href="https://vmpsoft.com/">VMProtect</a>, which we are able to devirtualise and reverse engineer thanks to <a href="https://github.com/vtil-project">vtil</a> by secret club member <a href="https://secret.club/author/can1357">Can Boluk</a>, but the inner workings of <em>BEClient</em> is a topic for a later part of this series, so here is a quick summary.</p><p><em>Init</em> and its arguments have the following definitions:</p><pre><code><span>// BEClient_x64!Init</span>
<span>__declspec</span>(dllexport)
battleye<span>::</span>instance_status Init(std<span>::</span><span>uint64_t</span> integration_version,
                               battleye<span>::</span>becl_game_data<span>*</span> game_data,
                               battleye<span>::</span>becl_be_data<span>*</span> client_data);
  
<span>enum</span> instance_status

    NOT_INITIALIZED,
    SUCCESSFULLY_INITIALIZED,
    DESTROYING,
    DESTROYED
};

<span>struct</span> <span>becl_game_data</span>
{
    <span>char</span><span>*</span>         game_version;
    std<span>::</span><span>uint32_t</span> address;

    remove_peer_t remove_peer;
};
</code></pre><p>As seen, these are quite simple containers for interopability between the game and <em>BEClient</em>. <code>becl_game_data</code> is defined by the game and contains functions that <em>BEClient</em> needs to call (for example, send_packet) while <code>becl_be_data</code> is defined by <em>BEClient</em> and contains callbacks used by the game after initialisation (for example, received_packet). Note that these two structures slightly differ in some games that have special functionality, such as the recently introduced packet encryption in <em>Escape from Tarkov</em> that we’ve already <a href="https://secret.club/2020/06/19/battleye-packet-encryption.html">cracked</a>. Older versions of BattlEye (DayZ, Arma, etc.) use a completely different approach with function pointer swap hooks to intercept traffic communication, and therefore these structures don’t apply.</p><p>A simple <em>Init</em> implementation would look like this:</p><pre><code><span>// BEClient_x64!Init</span>
<span>__declspec</span>(dllexport)
battleye<span>::</span>instance_status Init(std<span>::</span><span>uint64_t</span> integration_version,
                               battleye<span>::</span>becl_game_data<span>*</span> game_data,
                               battleye<span>::</span>becl_be_data<span>*</span> client_data)
{
    <span>// CACHE RELEVANT FUNCTIONS</span>
    battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>o_send_packet    <span>=</span> game_data<span>-&gt;</span>send_packet;

    <span>// SETUP CLIENT STRUCTURE</span>
    client_data<span>-&gt;</span>exit                   <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>exit;
    client_data<span>-&gt;</span>run                    <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>run;
    client_data<span>-&gt;</span>command                <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>command;
    client_data<span>-&gt;</span>received_packet        <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>received_packet;
    client_data<span>-&gt;</span>on_receive_auth_ticket <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>on_receive_auth_ticket;
    client_data<span>-&gt;</span>add_peer               <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>add_peer;
    client_data<span>-&gt;</span>remove_peer            <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>remove_peer;

    <span>return</span> battleye<span>::</span>instance_status<span>::</span>SUCCESSFULLY_INITIALIZED;
}
</code></pre><p>This would allow our custom BattlEye client to receive packets sent from the game server’s <em>BEServer</em> module.</p><p>The function <code>received_packet</code> is by far the most important routine used by the game, as it handles incoming packets from the BattlEye server component. BattlEye communication is extremely simple compared to how important the integrity of it is. In recent versions of BattlEye, packets follow the same general structure:</p><pre><code><span>#pragma pack(push, 1)
</span><span>struct</span> <span>be_fragment</span>
{
    std<span>::</span><span>uint8_t</span> count;
    std<span>::</span><span>uint8_t</span> index;
};

<span>struct</span> <span>be_packet_header</span>
{
    std<span>::</span><span>uint8_t</span> id;
    std<span>::</span><span>uint8_t</span> sequence;
};

<span>struct</span> <span>be_packet</span> <span>:</span> be_packet_header
{
    <span>union</span> 
    {
        be_fragment fragment;

        <span>// DATA STARTS AT body[1] IF PACKET IS FRAGMENTED</span>
        <span>struct</span>
        {
            <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>uint8_t</span> no_fragmentation_flag;
            std<span>::</span><span>uint8_t</span> body[<span>0</span>];
        };
    };
    <span>inline</span> <span>bool</span> fragmented()
    {
        <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span>fragment.count <span>!=</span> <span>0x00</span>;
    }
};
<span>#pragma pack(pop)
</span></code></pre><p>All packets have an identifier and a sequence number (which is used by the requests/response communication and the heartbeat). Requests and responses have a fragmentation mode which allows <em>BEServer</em> and <em>BEClient</em> to send packets in chunks of <code>0x400</code> bytes (seemingly arbitrary) instead of sending one big packet.</p><p>In the current iteration of BattlEye, the following packets are used for communication:</p><h3 id="init-00"> <a href="#init-00">INIT (<code>00</code>)</a></h3><p>This packet is sent to the <em>BEClient</em> module as soon as the connection with the game server has been established. This packet is only transmitted once, contains no data besides the packet id <code>00</code> and the response to this packet is simply <code>00 05</code>.</p><h3 id="start-02"> <a href="#start-02">START (‘02’)</a></h3><p>This packet is sent right after the ‘INIT’ packets have been exchanged, and contains the server-generated guid of the client. The response of this packet is simply the header: <code>02 00</code></p><h3 id="request-04--response-05"> <a href="#request-04--response-05">REQUEST (<code>04</code>) / RESPONSE (<code>05</code>)</a></h3><p>This type of packet is sent from <em>BEServer</em> to <em>BEClient</em> to request (and in rare cases, simply transmit) data, and <em>BEClient</em> will send back data for that request using the <code>RESPONSE</code> packet type.</p><p>The first request contains crucial information such as service- and integration version, not responding to it will get you disconnected by the game server. Afterwards, requests are game specific.</p><h3 id="heartbeat-09"> <a href="#heartbeat-09">HEARTBEAT (<code>09</code>)</a></h3><p>This type of packet is used by the <em>BEServer</em> module to ensure that the connection hasn’t been dropped. It is sent every 30 seconds using a sequential index, and if the client doesn’t respond with the same packet, the client is disconnected from the game server. This heartbeat packet is only three bytes long, with the sequential index used for synchronization being incremental and therefore easily emulated. An example heartbeat could be: <code>09 01 00</code>, which is the second heartbeat (sequence starts at zero) transmitted.</p><p>With this knowledge, it is possible by emulating the entire BattlEye anti-cheat with only two proprietary points of data: the responses for request sequence one and two. These can be intercepted using a tool such as wireshark and replayed as many times as you want for the respective game, because the packet encryption used by BattlEye is static and contextless.</p><p>Emulating the <code>INIT</code> packet is as stated simply responding with the sequence number five:</p><pre><code><span>case</span> battleye:<span>:</span>packet_id<span>::</span>INIT<span>:</span>
{
    <span>auto</span> info_packet <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>be_packet{};
    info_packet.id       <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>packet_id<span>::</span>INIT;
    info_packet.sequence <span>=</span> <span>0x05</span>;

    battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>o_send_packet(<span>&amp;</span>info_packet, <span>sizeof</span>(info_packet));
    <span>break</span>;
}
</code></pre><p>Emulating the <code>START</code> packet is done by replying with the received packet’s header:</p><pre><code><span>case</span> battleye:<span>:</span>packet_id<span>::</span>START<span>:</span>
{
    battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>o_send_packet(received_packet, <span>sizeof</span>(battleye<span>::</span>be_packet_header));
    <span>break</span>;
}
</code></pre><p>Emulating the <code>HEARTBEAT</code> packets is done by replying with the received packet:</p><pre><code><span>case</span> battleye:<span>:</span>packet_id<span>::</span>HEARTBEAT<span>:</span>    
{
    battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>o_send_packet(received_packet, length);
    <span>break</span>;
}
</code></pre><p>Emulating the <code>REQUEST</code> packets can be done by replaying previously generated responses, which can be logged with code hooks or man-in-the-middle software. These packets are game specific and some games might disconnect you for not handling a specific request, but most games only require the first two requests to be handled, afterwards simply replying with the packet header is enough to not get disconnected by the game server. It is important to notice that all <code>REQUEST</code> packets are immediately responded to with the header, to let the server know that the client is aware of the request. This is how BottlEye emulates them:</p><pre><code><span>case</span> battleye:<span>:</span>packet_id<span>::</span>REQUEST<span>:</span>
{
    <span>// IF NOT FRAGMENTED RESPOND IMMEDIATELY, ELSE ONLY RESPOND TO THE LAST FRAGMENT</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>auto</span> respond <span>=</span> 
        <span>!</span>header<span>-&gt;</span>fragmented() <span>||</span> 
        (header<span>-&gt;</span>fragment.index <span>==</span> header<span>-&gt;</span>fragment.count <span>-</span> <span>1</span>);

    <span>if</span> (<span>!</span>respond)
        <span>return</span>;

    <span>// SEND BACK HEADER</span>
    battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>o_send_packet(received_packet, <span>sizeof</span>(battleye<span>::</span>be_packet_header));

    <span>switch</span> (header<span>-&gt;</span>sequence)
    {
    <span>case</span> <span>0x01</span>:
    {
        battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>respond(header<span>-&gt;</span>sequence,
            {
                <span>// REDACTED BUFFER</span>

    }
    <span>default:</span>

It has allowed the world to examine what happens in a pandemic when a government allows life to carry on largely unhindered.</p><p>This is what has happened: Not only have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/15/world/europe/sweden-coronavirus-deaths.html" title="">thousands more people died </a>than in neighboring countries that imposed lockdowns, but Swedenâ€™s economy has fared little better.</p><p>â€œThey literally gained nothing,â€� said Jacob F. Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. â€œItâ€™s a self-inflicted wound, and they have no economic gains.â€�</p><p>The results of Swedenâ€™s experience are relevant well beyond Scandinavian shores. In the United States, where the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html" title="">virus is spreading</a> with alarming speed, many states have â€” at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/us/when-lockdown-ending-coronavirus.html" title="">President Trumpâ€™s urging</a> â€” avoided lockdowns or lifted them prematurely on the assumption that this would foster economic revival, allowing people to return to workplaces, shops and restaurants.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In Britain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson â€” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/world/europe/boris-johnson-coronavirus-hospital-intensive-care.html" title="">previously hospitalized </a>with Covid-19 â€” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/world/europe/uk-coronavirus-reopening.html" title="">reopened pubs</a> and restaurants last weekend in a bid to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/world/europe/uk-coronavirus-reopening.html" title="">restore normal economic life</a>.</p><p>Implicit in these approaches is the assumption that governments must balance saving lives against the imperative to spare jobs, with the extra health risks of rolling back social distancing potentially justified by a resulting boost to prosperity. But Swedenâ€™s grim result â€” more death, and nearly equal economic damage â€” suggests that the supposed choice between lives and paychecks is a false one: A failure to impose social distancing can cost lives and jobs at the same time.</p><p>Sweden put stock in the sensibility of its people as it largely <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/world/europe/sweden-coronavirus.html" title="">avoided imposing government prohibitions</a>. The government allowed restaurants, gyms, shops, playgrounds and most schools to remain open. By contrast, Denmark and Norway opted for strict quarantines, banning large groups and locking down shops and restaurants.</p><p>More than three months later, the coronavirus is blamed for 5,420 deaths in Sweden, according to the <a href="https://covid19.who.int/region/euro/country/se" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">World Health Organization</a>. That might not sound especially horrendous compared with the more than 129,000 Americans who have died. But Sweden is a country of only 10 million people. Per million people, Sweden has suffered 40 percent more deaths than the United States, 12 times more than Norway, seven times more than Finland and six times more than Denmark.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"><img alt="Per million people, Sweden has suffered 40 percent more coronavirus-related deaths than the United States." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-jumbo.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-superJumbo.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" decoding="async" itemprop="url" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"></picture></div><figcaption><span itemprop="copyrightHolder"><span>Credit...</span><span>Jonathan Nackstrand/Agence France-Presse â€” Getty Images</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>The elevated death toll resulting from Swedenâ€™s approach has been clear for many weeks. What is only now emerging is how Sweden, despite letting its economy run unimpeded, has still suffered business-destroying, prosperity-diminishing damage, and at nearly the same magnitude of its neighbors.</p></div><div><div><p>Swedenâ€™s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/sweden-cenbank-forecast/table-swedish-cbank-forecasts-key-rate-at-0-for-coming-years-idUSS3N2AC001" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">central bank</a> expects its economy to contract by 4.5 percent this year, a revision from a previously expected gain of 1.3 percent. The unemployment rate jumped to 9 percent in May from 7.1 percent in March. â€œThe overall damage to the economy means the recovery will be protracted, with unemployment remaining elevated,â€� Oxford Economics concluded in a recent research note.</p><p>This is more or less how damage caused by the pandemic has played out in Denmark, where the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-denmark-economy/denmarks-central-bank-sees-economy-shrink-by-41-this-year-idUSFWN2DT0WQ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">central bank</a> expects that the economy will shrink 4.1 percent this year, and where joblessness has edged up to 5.6 percent in May from 4.1 percent in March.</p><p>In short, Sweden suffered a vastly higher death rate while failing to collect on the expected economic gains.</p><p>The coronavirus does not stop at national borders. Despite the governmentâ€™s decision to allow the domestic economy to roll on, Swedish businesses are stuck with the same conditions that produced recession everywhere else. And Swedish people responded to the fear of the virus by limiting their shopping â€” not enough to prevent elevated deaths, but enough to produce a decline in business activity.</p><p>Here is one takeaway with potentially universal import: It is simplistic to portray government actions such as quarantines as the cause of economic damage. The real culprit is the virus itself. From Asia to Europe to the Americas, the risks of the pandemic have disrupted businesses while prompting people to avoid shopping malls and restaurants, regardless of official policy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-03/merlin_171448116_dc72db1b-94a8-4bf3-89c9-4ae78673174b-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div></div></div><figcaption><span itemprop="copyrightHolder"><span>Credit...</span><span>Jonathan Nackstrand/Agence France-Presse â€” Getty Images</span></span></figcaption><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-03/merlin_171448116_dc72db1b-94a8-4bf3-89c9-4ae78673174b-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp"></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Sweden is exposed to the vagaries of global trade.

Aerosols are released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts, who <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798">have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World Health Organization</a>.</p>

<p>It all began with a scratchy throat on Friday, March 13. A colleague had brought the novel coronavirus back with him from the Austrian ski resort <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/the-ischgl-outbreak-families-of-covid-19-victims-seek-justice-a-bbf9aa92-dfed-42d0-870c-ff9d17125d45" data-link-flag="english">Ischgl</a>. Shortly thereafter, Alexander Riesch, 26, whose name has been changed for this story, also tested positive for the virus.</p>


<div>
<p>"At first I thought, well, at least now you'll have gotten it over with," Riesch says. His doctors also had no doubt: The body of a young, healthy person wouldn't take long to vanquish the virus. They sent Riesch home to recover. But a few days later, he felt so miserable that he had to call an emergency doctor. He spent a week in the hospital.</p><p>Officially, Riesch has been recovered for nearly three months. He has antibodies against the virus in his blood. Yet he still goes through spells in which he feels very sick. So far, none of his doctors have been able to explain why.</p>

<p>In addition to suffering from sore throats that range from mild to severe and seem to come and go at random, his lungs are also still affected. The symptoms didn't begin until after the doctors released him from the hospital and he returned home. A respiratory physician prescribed him an asthma inhaler and advised him to be patient. The cortisone does help a little, Riesch says, but his cough and the tightness in his chest return as soon as he stops taking it.</p>

<div>
<p>There's also the sudden muscle pain. Sometimes the left half of Riesch's body becomes numb, other times he feels so weak that he has to lay down immediately. And that's not even to mention the abdominal pain and nausea, skin rash and severe fatigue.</p><p>Riesch was on sick leave for 10 weeks. Meanwhile, he's back at work as a real estate agent. But every now and then, he has to cancel appointments because he simply feels too exhausted. Most of the time, he tries to live a normal life. "I've come to accept the pain I'm in now."</p><h3>A Very Strange Disease</h3><p>Half a year since the pandemic began, doctors are now observing an increasing number of coronavirus patients like Riesch who are officially recovered but in reality are far from healthy.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>"COVID-19 is very unpredictable," says Timothy Spector of King's College London, who is tracking the course of the disease in more than 200,000 COVID-19 patients over a longer period of time, with the help of a mobile app, as part of a major research project. "I am trained as a rheumatologist, so I am used to strange diseases. But COVID-19 is the strangest disease I know."</p><p>Roughly one in 10 people with the disease continue to suffer from unexplainable symptoms for more than a month, many for more than two months. The most common are exhaustion, headaches, a loss of smell, trouble breathing, dizziness, diarrhea and skin rashes. "And some of our participants still have a fever after three months," Spector says.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Severe damage to the lungs, heart and nervous system in some people is also of concern. The disease can cause cardiac arrhythmia or even trigger diabetes mellitus. Some patients suffer from severe concentration and memory disorders, much like dementia. Even young people can be affected. More than 1,000 children around the world have contracted multisystem inflammatory syndrome in connection with a SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can lead to myocarditis and circulatory failure.</p><h3>Nothing To Be Done</h3><p>"Many patients say: 'Before the coronavirus infection, I was a different person,'" says the Swiss heart surgeon Paul Vogt. Doctors now fear that the pandemic will leave behind an army of chronically ill people. Some hospitals in Germany are already beginning to set up outpatient clinics for the follow-up care of COVID-19 patients.</p><p>"People tend to think: Either you are dead, or you are healthy again," says the British physician Helen Salisbury. "But it does not work like this."</p><p>For weeks, all people talked about was intensive care units and artificial ventilation. "But now there are all these people, that will maybe be ill for a long time."</p><p>Salisbury treats several people who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and still suffer from exhaustion and bouts of fever or coughing and who quickly get out of breath. "All the tests are normal," she says. "There is no therapy I can offer to them." Many of the chronically sick are young -- and desperate. "But I can do nothing but listen to them," Salisbury says.</p><p>It's still a mystery to experts as to why the symptoms are so persistent and severe even after the patients have supposedly recovered from the disease. Doctors suspect it could be due to malfunctions in the immune system caused by an infection. It's also possible that once the virus succeeds in establishing itself somewhere in the body, it can strike repeatedly.</p><p>Or the lasting ailments could be a consequence of a lack of oxygen during the acute phase of the disease. Young COVID-19 patients in particular often don't notice for a long time just how badly their body is doing.</p><h3>Like Other Viruses</h3><p>Doctors see a parallel to another coronavirus disease. After the SARS pandemic in 2003, doctors continued to notice many chronically sick people, for instance in Toronto, Canada, where the worst outbreak outside of Asia took place. "When I heard of the SARS-CoV-2 long-term patients, I thought: Oh, I was waiting for this," says Harvey Moldofsky, a sleep and pain researcher and a professor emeritus at the University of Toronto.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>A physician, Moldofsky has been a specialist in unusual diseases since early on in his career. That's why he was asked to step in and help after the 2003 SARS pandemic had subsided. "There was a group of 50 people that had all survived SARS, but although they had gone through rehab, they could not go back to work full time," Moldofsky says.</p><p>He interviewed 22 of those people in detail, and the stories he heard all sounded similar. "Over one year post-infection, they were still fatigued, weak, had muscle pain, sleeping problems and could not think straight," says Moldofsky.</p><p>All of these grievances are familiar to experts. Patients suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome also complain of muscle, head and neck pain. Many also speak of a "brain fog" that prevents them from being able to concentrate.</p><p>A number of viruses are believed to cause chronic fatigue syndrome. Among them are the influenza and Epstein-Barr viruses, the latter of which is known to cause infectious mononucleosis, or mono. Researchers now suspect that the strange affliction is, in fact, an autoimmune reaction triggered by the viral infection, which can affect the autonomic nervous system. Other symptoms can include heart palpitations, an increased susceptibility to infection and sleep disorder.</p><h3>Neurological Problems</h3><p>Carmen Scheibenbogen, the head of the outpatient clinic for adult immunodeficiencies at Berlin's Charité University Hospital, is one of the few German experts on chronic fatigue syndrome. Many people with COVID-19 are currently turning to the physician for answers about their odd symptoms.</p><p>But even she has to disappoint them for the time being. A reliable diagnosis can only be made six months after infection. "By then, there's a good chance that everything will calm down on its own," Scheibenbogen says. Only symptoms that last longer than six months are considered chronic. And even then, there are few options for treatment.</p><p>Scheibenbogen advises those affected to take good care of their bodies. "Overexerting oneself or doing sports that exacerbate symptoms should definitely be avoided. This can make things worse," she says.</p><p>In addition to chronic fatigue, COVID-19 patients can also suffer from a number of other neurological complications. "The neuroscience research community is slowly waking up to this," says Benedict Michael, a senior clinician scientist and neurologist at the Health Protection Research Unit and the University of Liverpool. He adds that 20 to 30 percent of patients who require hospitalization develop some neurological complication.</p><p>In late June, Michael and some colleagues published a study on the matter in the medical journal <em>The Lancet Psychiatry</em>. In it, they examined 125 patients who developed neurological problems as a result of COVID-19. Around 60 percent of participants, mainly older people, suffered a stroke after being infected. Close to a third of them showed signs of other cognitive or psychiatric changes, including many younger patients.</p><p>In all, 8 percent of the 125 people examined developed a psychosis in connection with their coronavirus infection. Just under 5 percent developed dementia. "Many young people are still living their lives in the pandemic and do not even think about the fact that there is a potential risk of developing problems for them too," warns Michael.</p><p>At least in some cases it's easy to explain what caused the brain damage. Strokes can occur because COVID-19 often causes blood to clot. It's also known that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can sometimes lead to encephalitis.</p><p>In many other cases, however, the cause of the complications is still unclear. "It is quite possible that this is an immune reaction," Michael says. For some, it could also be a result of stress or a lack of oxygen -- or everything altogether.</p><h3>Not the Only One</h3><p>For many patients, there's still hope that the neurological and psychiatric problems, as well as the other persistent complications like exhaustion, will diminish or eventually disappear.</p><p>The case of the general practitioner Stephanie de Giorgio from Kent in the UK is also cause for hope. The 44-year-old was likely infected by one of her patients. A mother of two, de Giorgio had no risk factors other than mild asthma and being a bit overweight could have been cause for concern. "Well, now it has got me, too," she thought. Fifteen days later, her fever subsided.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-bcedcce2f0e613cfa45d"><div><p>As a new and small team, it's easy for us to experiment with different ways of working. We don't have a lot data or code locked away in legacy systems, and we don't have the inertia of established workflows.</p><p>One of our experiments in "how to work" has been surprisingly successful, and that is using <a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank">Jupyter notebooks</a> in the wet lab.</p><p>We initially resisted the idea, even though we were already big fans of Jupyter. Instead, we tried to make purpose-built wet lab tools work for us, but we kept feeling like the problems they were solving were less important than the problems they <em>weren't</em> solving.</p><p>What finally pushed us over the edge was our experience developing a protocol to produce a protein from a new construct. In those kinds of situations, you usually have a basic framework for a protocol, but you need to work out the specifics in the lab — which depend on whatever is "new" about what you're doing.</p><p>We think of those specifics, which include things like time, temperature, and concentration as well as more complicated biological variables, as parameters of an abstract protocol. However, our tools didn't allow us to express the problem this way, and every time we adjusted a "parameter" or some assumption of our protocol, we needed to manually rederive the protocol steps.</p><p>Translating this protocol into a Jupyter notebook allowed us express the protocol design and steps as functions of parameters, which more closely matched our conceptual model. This immediately solved our practical pain points, and it also made scaling up production trivial, since the protocol was paramterized over all inputs.</p><p>We've put together a notebook to illustrate some of the concepts behind our Jupyter workflows. You can play around with a live version using <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gl/ivynatal%2Fpublic-notebooks/master">Binder</a> or just view it using <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/gitlab.com/ivynatal/public-notebooks/-/raw/master/jupyter-workflows-wet-lab.ipynb">nbviewer</a> . The source is in a <a href="https://gitlab.com/ivynatal/public-notebooks">GitLab repository</a>.</p><p>We've since transitioned all of our lab protocols and notebooks (and some of our analyses) to Jupyter notebooks, and we've discovered that our Jupyter-based workflows increase documentaiton, reduce data duplication, and ease analysis.</p><p>So far, we haven't had any trouble working with partners or collaborators, because a PDF of a well annotated notebook is as good or better than many alternatives.</p><p>We hope over time to share more details of our workflows because we think they could be useful to other labs. Of course, this approach won't be for everyone; it's technology that our team was already comfortable with, and our switching costs were low.</p><p>We'd love to hear what you think — please <a href="https://www.ivynatal.com/contact" target="_blank">drop us a line</a>!</p><p>—Jeff and Colin</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Everyone has the same amount of time in a day, except for the day they are born and the day that they die. Those days are started late and ended early, respectively. Every other day is the same, 24 hours. </p>



<p>Most of what happens within our days are the results of choices, concious or otherwise. I may choose to sleep 8 hours while someone else chooses only to sleep 5. I am sure you have often heard people respond to something that they say they want to do with “I don’t have time”. “I know I should work out but I don’t have time … I wish I spent more time with my kids but I don’t have time … I love to read but I just don’t have time anymore.” These people are either lying to you, or more likely, they are lying to themselves. </p>



<p>Most of us feel we do not have time for things but in reality we do not have the relative desire for them. We may want them, but we do not want them as much as the other things we are doing with our time. If we did, we would do them instead. Importantly, I am not referring to a spoken want but an actual one. I can say I want six pack abs but if I am not willing to put in the physical work to get there I don’t really want that more than the other things I spend my time doing during my days.</p>



<p>Most of the time, most people don’t truly want hardly anything as much as they want to check Instagram or Twitter or email. Of course, these are not the things they want directly but a means towards getting them. A dopamine hit from an Instagram like, a bite size piece of information or entertainment from a Tweet, or a sense of purpose through a feeling that one is needed, good at their job, and therefore good at something because they are known to respond to their emails in less than 10 minutes no matter the hour or the day. I know these things from experience.</p>



<p>The fact is that when one truly wants something and wants it more than everything else competing for the time in their day, one will absolutely make the time for that thing. Time does not come out of thin air. It comes from the other things we occupy ourselves doing. Everything is a trade-off. We operate based on a descending list of the things we care about whether we know them are not. </p>



<p>To understand what a real want feels like, it is helpful to think about and experience the fundamentals. Years ago, I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLcJHC9J7l4">an awesome motivational speech by a guy named Eric Thomas</a> where he tells his students they will be successful when they want it as badly as a person who is drowning wants to breathe (if you want to watch the first 3 minutes you will get the gist). Occasionally, I run several miles without a water bottle and I am reminded in the last couple of miles what it feels like to be truly thirsty, to want nothing but water. When you are sick, you usually want nothing but to feel better. When you are starving, all you want to do is eat. You will make time for what you want most. We can only do so much at a time and more distractions than ever are competing for our attention. This is why so many people feel there is not enough time in the day. </p>



<p>Next time you think about something you want to do or know you should do but “don’t have time” for, think again. You have the time, you just don’t care enough. In many cases, you will be content with that realization. In others, you will want to change it. Fortunately, you can. It is not about time. It is about you.</p>

<p>The growth and adoption of web-based APIs is key to the transformational technology journey of any enterprise. Those APIs, whether they are RESTful or not, remain synchronous. They, like the web, utilize the pattern of HTTP to implement a request-response interaction approach.</p>

<p>To illustrate, assume we have a project management API with the following interactions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a project (e.g. POST /projects)</li>
<li>Create a new task (e.g. POST /projects/{projectId}/tasks)</li>
<li>Assign the task to someone on our team (e.g. POST /tasks/{taskId}/assignees)</li>
<li>The assignee marks the task as complete (e.g. PUT /tasks/{taskId})</li>
</ol>

<p>An API following this design works if design of the user interface closely mirrors those endpoints. But suppose an additional application requirement is to ‘automatically’ update a task’s status when marked complete by another user. With a request/response web-API, an option is to incessantly poll a status API on the chance a status might have changed. This is both cumbersome and error-prone.
Instead of polling, we can introduce an <strong>event-driven architecture</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-to-event-driven-architecture">Introduction to Event-Driven Architecture<a href="#introduction-to-event-driven-architecture" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>In an event-driven architecture (or EDA), an application is composed of independent components that react to events published by other components. EDA is popular for distributed applications, as new components may be introduced into a solution to solve emerging problems — without the knowledge of previously developed components. Message brokers are used as an intermediary for communication, producing a loosely coupled design by preventing components from directly communicating with one another.</p>

<p>If you are familiar with service-oriented architecture (SOA), you have experienced EDA. Most service-oriented architectures used an enterprise service bus (ESB) for service communication rather than a message broker. Events were published to the ESB, where they were then routed to other services to integrate two or more software systems. However, ESBs proved problematic as they were used as “integration glue”, causing integration code to become scattered across services, apps, and the ESB; fragile systems were created. This fragility produced a greater need for coordination between teams, slowing software delivery.</p>

<h2 id="the-emergence-of-a-microservice-and-event-driven-architecture">The Emergence of a Microservice and Event-Driven Architecture<a href="#the-emergence-of-a-microservice-and-event-driven-architecture" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>To overcome this increased coordination, the microservice architecture was introduced as a replacement for traditional SOA. This newer distributed architecture, built on APIs and microservices, encourages “dumb pipes, smart endpoints.” Integration logic is pushed to the consumers and producers. Message brokers, rather than ESBs, are used for message routing, not integration logic. Services and APIs talk to one another while hiding implementation details. This loose coupling makes software more resilient to evolution as new requirements emerge.</p>

<p>As enterprises shift to APIs backed by a microservice architecture, the number of published events has grown considerably. Message brokers are typically transactional in nature, ensuring once-and-only-once delivery of messages. While useful for traditional software development, the transactional nature of message brokers limits the scalability of service communication.</p>

<p>Distributed streaming data platforms, such as Apache Kafka, now offer enterprises higher throughput than traditional message brokers. Kafka removes the need for transactional messaging found in message brokers, opting instead for turning events into message streams. These streams are accessible by any authorized subscriber and may be accessed real-time or processed sequentially from a predetermined location or at the start of the stream.</p>

<h2 id="api-design-with-event-streaming">API Design with Event Streaming<a href="#api-design-with-event-streaming" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>Event streams help software extend beyond the request-response approach common to web API styles such as REST, GraphQL, and gRPC. Software can communicate bi-directionally, removing the need for API consumers to continually poll for state changes. Instead, APIs publish events to an event stream for notification of data changes or important business events to any number of subscribed services for further processing.</p>

<p>Let’s revisit our previous example. We needed to solve two separate requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>Notification when a task is marked as completed. Our only option without a message-driven architecture is to require interested parties to constantly make API calls to see if the task has been completed (aka polling)</li>
<li>Alerting a project owner when a task has been modified or marked as completed. Our only option is to mix our user interface concerns with our API by making the API send an email. The API is no longer responsible for managing projects and tasks — it is now responsible for the content and look-and-feel for email alerts</li>
</ol>

<p>If we introduce a message-driven architecture to our solution, we can develop an API that delivers project and task resources that offer the necessary capabilities (create, read, update, delete, and mark as complete). Our API doesn’t need to know about how the task completion event notification will be used, including that an email will be sent. All it needs to do is publish event messages when those events occur and allow other services to take action as appropriate. Events this API may publish include:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/images/posts/event-streaming-an-additional-architectural-style-to-suplement-api-design/event-examples.webp" alt="Example of API events" title="Example of API events"></p>

<p>Interested parties can then subscribe to the event(s) they are interested in and safely ignore the rest. In our example, we may end up with three components:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Projects API</strong> — Manages the Projects and Project Tasks resources via a REST-based API. The API may be comprised of one or more microservices that implement the capabilities offered by the REST API. When any event, from the list in the table above, occurs then the API publishes an event into the appropriate message stream for consumption by event subscribers</li>
<li><strong>Task Completed Email Microservice</strong> — Subscribes to the Task.Completed event, notifying project manager(s) via email when any task has been marked as completed</li>
<li><strong>Task Modified Email Microservice</strong> — Subscribes to the Task.Updated event, notifying all team members via email when any task has been edited</li>
</ol>

<p>The API has no awareness of the two microservices subscribed to the specific events; it just publishes the events to the appropriate message stream. The solution is considered loosely coupled and therefore capable of evolving over time as new requirements emerge, perhaps with new types of notifications (e.g. SMS, web dashboard alerts) or integrations (e.g. synching to JIRA).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>The demand for more robust methods of software communication is pushing the limits of today’s interface solutions. Request/response-based APIs are essential. However, today’s technical problems are now demanding event-driven support — in addition to request/response — to improve an API’s capability offerings.</p>

<p>As API designers, we must strive to use all available tools to offer a better developer experience. As you enhance your existing APIs and new APIs emerge, ask yourself:</p>

<ol>
<li>How can my solution architecture be improved by moving beyond standard REST APIs and into a loosely-coupled event-driven architecture?</li>
<li>What events should my API publish that would benefit API consumers?</li>
<li>How will my API consumers benefit from the addition of these events and how do they take advantage of them?</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s shift our approach from strictly request-response to thinking in terms of how our APIs can not only offer endpoints for requests, but events that enable the API to push to other services. The result will be increased innovation and more transformative APIs both within and across our LOBs.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                <p>When running your business, you engage with the services of many different suppliers. This can range from your power company to your web hosting service. In all of these arrangements, your business is buying a specific service at an agreed upon price.</p><p>For example, when you pay a web hosting provider, they are managing your server, your website content management system <em>(like WordPress)</em>, backups, availability, and security. This simplifies all of that for your business and the monthly fee you pay them is a fair exchange of value for the services they provide.</p><p>Now let's look at YouTube. Everyone knows the power of embedding marketing videos on their website. YouTube greatly simplifies this, allowing you to easily add videos to help build your business. In return for this life-bettering service, you pay YouTube… <strong>nothing (?)</strong>. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><mark>Sounds like a great deal, except when you think about it, would <em>your</em> business provide its service for free?</mark></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Most businesses are built to, ultimately, exchange risk and hard work <em>(what it takes to build a business)</em> for financial return. While it might be nice to give away services for free, most business owners can’t afford to do so and keep the doors open due to all the costs associated with keeping those doors open.</p><p>So when YouTube offers their service to you for free, it doesn't mean they aren't looking to do the same things with their business as you are doing with yours. It just means that <strong>you aren't the customer</strong>.</p><p>So who <em>is</em> the customer? <em>Someone </em>must be paying YouTube for the service that they provide. We know it's not you the business owner embedding videos using their player on your website. Who is paying their bills?</p><p>Here's the answer: <strong>YouTube's customers are the advertisers</strong> who pay for access to the large audience and detailed targeting data that YouTube provides them. This is similar to the way advertisers pay for the ability to show commercials on television networks, or banners on media websites. These advertisers are the <em>real </em>customers, therefore, YouTube's business model is optimized to solve for the problems and needs of these paying customers.</p><p>So what does this mean for you, the web guy or small business owner that embeds videos using YouTube on your website? It means that YouTube is offering that free service to you in order to serve their actual customer the advertisers. Let's go through a couple of the ways that YouTube ends up benefiting from your video embed that you may not have thought about.</p><h3 id="showing-ads-">Showing Ads 👀</h3><p>The simplest, most direct way is that each video embed is a source of your customer/leads’ eyeballs that YouTube can now show ads to. This is in the form of inserting video commercials into your content, banner overlays on top of the video, and suggesting other videos after the user watches your video. </p><p>These are all fairly obvious and they <em>do </em>offer switches to turn some of this off during the embed process. However, the difficulty lies in keeping up with this as <strong>YouTube continually adds new ways to monetize these free video views on your website</strong>. So while you may believe you have ads on your videos turned off <em>today</em>, when YouTube introduces a new banner format, icon, or related videos format <em>tomorrow</em>, you’ll need to figure out how to turn them off all over again. You must continually stay on top of these changes and keep adjusting your embeds, otherwise, what you thought would be a clean video promoting your business ends up showcasing ads for other products. Or worse... ads for <strong>your competitors</strong>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>At Swarmify, our mission is to bring an accelerated, distraction-free video experience to websites of all sizes. Whether you’re a  <a href="https://swarmify.com/pricing/"><strong>website owner</strong></a>, <a href="https://swarmify.com/agencies/"><strong>an agency</strong></a>, or you just want to get in on <a href="https://swarmify.com/affiliate-program/"><strong>our affiliate program</strong></a>, we have a plan for you!</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="user-siphoning">User Siphoning</h3><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>This is a much more subtle cost but one that can have an incredible impact on your business. If you have ever watched a video on YouTube, you’ve most definitely seen related videos appear at the end of the video you watched. These related videos are personalized to each user’s behavior and fine-tuned with the strength of a million Google AI servers to pull them into watching more content. <mark>To be blunt, this is weaponized AI</mark> being used to maximize YouTube's chances of convincing a user on your website who watched your video, to watch additional videos chosen by YouTube. And with each of these videos watched, YouTube is able to serve more ads and make more revenue. That's the payoff on their end. Get your customers/leads to watch more YouTube videos and show them more ads.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure><img src="https://buzz.swarmify.com/content/images/2019/05/xtraffic_funnel-1.png.pagespeed.ic.x-xBpQW1fh.png" alt="YouTube costs you customers"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>In addition to related videos, there's the not-so-subtle YouTube logo shown overtop your video. This means you are contributing to the company’s branding with every single watch of content on your website. By the time a user finishes watching one of your videos, it can be hard to tell who gets more benefit; your business or YouTube with all of the branding they throw on top.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id="secret-weapon-detailed-targeting-">Secret Weapon: Detailed Targeting 🎯</h3><p>As discussed above, part of what YouTube is selling are the eyeballs to watch advertiser videos. But what becomes just as important for advertisers is the ability to target ideal potential customers. <strong>Showing ads for dog food to people without pets would be a huge waste of money</strong>. So YouTube needs to be able to deliver as much detail as possible on the motivations, demographics, and current needs each user has in order to better target ads for their advertisers.</p><p>The latest in AI-powered targeting is called <em>"in-market targeting"</em>. It uses AI to attempt to determine which users are likely to be ready to purchase some category of goods or services. This makes sense as we are all in-market for various goods or services at a given time. We might be tired of fixing our old car and so we are ready to start looking for a new one, but it might also be lunchtime and we are hungry and trying to figure out what food to get delivered. We are constantly <em>"in-market"</em> for purchases both large and small. Allowing an advertiser to show us their ad for a healthy and convenient chicken sandwich when we are ready to head out for lunch can be <em>devastatingly effective</em> at driving our behavior. Whereas showing us that same ad late in the evening when we are about ready to go to sleep would be almost useless.</p><p>Great. So <em>"in-market targeting"</em> is the greatest thing since sliced bread for YouTube's advertisers. How does this matter to your website where you simply embed a video showing off your beautiful dental office and smiling, friendly staff? Maybe it’s hit you how this ties together. <strong>YouTube is tracking the audience that views your website and feeding that into AI servers</strong> to determine what each user is in-market for. What that means, using the example of the dentist, is YouTube now knows these users are in the market for dental services. It learned that because they came to your dental website and watched your office promo video.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Now the value for advertisers kicks in. Those users will start seeing ads for other dental offices nearby as you have just clued YouTube (Google) into very valuable potential leads for your competitors. Every dentist using Google or YouTube ads can now start showing banner and video ads around the web talking about why they should choose their office over yours. <mark>By embedding a simple video on your website, you have just given all of your competitors access to your hard-earned leads</mark> who were highly likely to buy from you since they were already on your website. But now, they start researching or second guessing as they suddenly see ads for other options at every turn. All of us have been the victim of viewing a certain product and then, suddenly, every ad across the Internet seems consumed with selling variations or alternatives to that product. Now you know how it works. Its all enabled by an unassuming, <em>“free”</em> video player.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id="other-options">Other Options</h3><p>At least now you know the <em>actual </em>cost of that video player. Part of the reason YouTube seems like such a great bargain for you is because of the imbalance in understanding the amount of value they get every time a business like yours uses their player. If you are fine trading off some of your leads and customers in return for the free price, then YouTube may work for you.</p><p>On the other hand, if the cost of leads and customers being siphoned away seems too high, then there are other options. Just like your web hosting and other services, there are providers that will give you simple tools to embed videos just as easily as YouTube. You pay a small monthly fee in exchange for a video player that is focused on delivering your video to your customers and keeping those high value leads on your website where they belong. Matching your site’s look, feel, and color scheme, with no obnoxious logos or branding to distract from your message.</p><p>We provide unlimited video hosting at <a href="https://swarmify.com/">Swarmify</a>, but there are many other providers depending on your needs.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><a href="https://swarmify.com/pricing/#pricing-table"><img src="https://buzz.swarmify.com/content/images/2020/06/xbottom-cta.png.pagespeed.ic.l6DzEnm0ti.png" alt="Try SmartVideo today!"></a></p>

July 7, 2020 | https://www.elastic.co/blog/macos-windows-what-kernels-tell-you-about-security-events-part-1 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.elastic.co/blog/macos-windows-what-kernels-tell-you-about-security-events-part-1">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>How would you compare the Windows and macOS operating systems? In what ways are they similar? Why do they each take different approaches to solving the same problem? For the last 19&nbsp;years I've developed security software for Windows. Recently, I’ve started implementing similar features on macOS. Since then, people have asked me questions like this. The more experience I gained on these two operating systems, the more I realized they’re very different. Even when the problems they set out to solve are common, their paths differ. In this two-part series, I will focus on the operating system events supported by Windows and macOS, and explain each operating system's approach.
</p><h2>Overview</h2><p>In Part 1, we’ll discuss process events.&nbsp;In Part 2, we’ll discuss file and network events. These events&nbsp;are crucial for endpoint security analysis. Through multiple perspectives in this post, I hope to:
</p><ul><li>Help you better understand the general differences between macOS and Windows on the system level
	</li><li>Help those who want to expand their experiences onto another platform be better prepared and adapted to differences that might seem to be shocking from their past experiences
	</li><li>Help cybersecurity professionals enrich their toolsets for creating innovative security products</li></ul><p>This post is based on some of my own experiences.&nbsp;It does not intend to be an exhaustive list.
</p> <p><strong><h3>Open vs. closed</h3></strong></p><p>Microsoft Windows has traditionally been open. It runs on hardware from different vendors and allows third-party developers to write applications on top of it. macOS is part of Apple’s end-to-end integrated ecosystem, which is quite the opposite of being “open.” This article does not try to take sides on the decades-long “open vs. closed” debate. Apart from end-to-end user experience, developers and researchers usually care about other things.&nbsp;
</p><p>The abundance of APIs and documents provided by Windows really enabled developers to do virtually anything in the cyber world. While on the macOS side, the beauty of simplicity reminds people that Apple takes lots of things as their own responsibility instead of sharing them with third-party developers. If you find something from Apple difficult to use, it’s perhaps because you’re looking at something&nbsp;Apple feels is their own backyard.&nbsp;Take&nbsp;<a href="https://knight.sc/debugging/2018/08/15/macos-kernel-debugging.html">kernel mode debugging</a> or <a href="http://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2004/tn2118.html">kernel core dumps</a>&nbsp;as examples. On the upside though, macOS developers can indulge themselves in the open source&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/apple/darwin-xnu">Darwin kernel</a>, whereas Windows’ kernel is closed source&nbsp;and yet Windows developers feel spoiled with an abundance of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/">documentation</a>.
</p> <p><strong><h3>Microkernel vs. monolithic kernel</h3></strong></p><p><img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt0a39b4008faf9cb9/5eea6e7d18cea32a006fba82/macos-windows-kernels-blog-monolothic-kernel-vs-microkernel.png" data-sys-asset-uid="blt0a39b4008faf9cb9" alt=""></p><figcaption>Figure 1: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microkernel">Structure of monolithic and microkernel-based operating systems</a></figcaption><p>Modern macOS and Microsoft Windows both have hybrid kernels, which are neither a pure microkernel, nor monolithic. However, one cannot infer that the two kernels are similarly architectured based on the same kernel type — they actually came from different places.
</p><p>Microsoft Windows, in the Windows 9x days, used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_kernel">monolithic</a> kernel. macOS <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XNU">XNU</a> consists of several core building blocks, one of which came from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_(kernel)">Mach kernel</a> that carries the genes of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microkernel">microkernel</a>. Even though both operating systems have evolved into today’s “hybrid” form, their early influences still manifest and affect developers’ daily lives. For example, Apple announced in WWDC 2019 it’s going to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/702/">deprecate kernel extensions (kext) support</a> for third-party developers starting with macOS 10.16. This means they are kicking third-party developers out of the kernel. For some, this may seem shocking. However, thinking from a microkernel point of view, this change sounds just like a logical next step.
</p><p>Over the years, Microsoft created a new <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/">Windows Driver Framework</a>. It also moved lots of traditional kernel mode driver support into user mode, encouraging people to implement <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">drivers in user mode</a>. However, caveats exist. For example, in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fwp/windows-filtering-platform-start-page">Windows Filtering Platform</a>, even though most of the functionalities can be done in user mode, some of the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23533627/is-it-possible-to-implement-user-mode-callouts-in-wfp-windows-filtering-platfor">crucial functionalities</a> still have to be done in the kernel.&nbsp;
</p> <p><strong><h3>Backward compatibility vs. complete rewrite</h3></strong></p><p>Some people have doubts about Apple's WWDC 2019 kext deprecation announcement, as it means that backward compatibility is broken for any third-party software that includes kexts. People will have to rewrite things in user mode from scratch. It’s understandable that some may want Apple to delay or cancel the deprecation. Regardless, deprecation is&nbsp;happening as <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=g28d5j9l">planned</a>. Because it is a closed ecosystem and Apple retains end-to-end control, backward compatibility is never on its menu and deprecation has been a consistent part of macOS releases. Check out the “Deprecation” sections in a few of the past release notes: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos_release_notes/macos_mojave_10_14_release_notes?language=objc">Mojave</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos_release_notes/macos_catalina_10_15_release_notes?language=objc">Catalina</a>, and the coming release of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-big-sur-11-beta-release-notes">Big Sur</a>.
</p><p>This means, as a macOS developer, you may frequently find yourself rewriting everything from scratch — even if your software is well-architected and implemented. Windows, on the other hand, has been keeping its promise of backward compatibility. You may find applications created for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1x">Windows 3.1</a> still run on the latest Windows 10. Microsoft does occasionally attempt to deprecate things. For example, it has been trying to deprecate support for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ifs/about-file-system-legacy-filter-drivers">legacy file system drivers</a> ever since the introduction of its replacement —&nbsp; <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ifs/filter-manager-concepts">file system minifilter</a> — in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP">Windows XP SP2</a> on August 25, 2004. But, as of today, it’s still unable to do so. However, this doesn’t mean legacy file system drivers remain a viable choice for third-party developers.
</p> <p><strong><h2>Process events</h2></strong></p><p>Windows and macOS organize process events very differently. Windows provides a single kernel callback, set by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-pssetcreateprocessnotifyroutine">PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine</a>/<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-pssetcreateprocessnotifyroutineex">Ex</a>, to trace all process creations and terminations. macOS process events are mainly retrieved from two sources:
</p><ul><li>An executable file’s <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vnode.9">vnode</a> operations
	</li><li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/System/Conceptual/ManPages_iPhoneOS/man2/vfork.2.html"><em>fork()</em></a> system call activities</li></ul> <p><strong><h3>Windows</h3></strong></p><p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-pssetcreateprocessnotifyroutineex">PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx</a> allows developers to register a callback with Windows. Later on when a process is created or exits, Windows will notify the caller by invoking the callback. The callback can be used for both prevention and notification. The parameters passed to the callback contain a rich set of information useful for process events, shown in the following figure:

</figcaption><p>To learn how to use <strong><em>PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx</em></strong>, take a look at Microsoft’s <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/tree/master/general/obcallback">ObCallback&nbsp; Registration Driver</a> sample code.&nbsp;<br></p><p>It’s also worth mentioning the <a href="http://www.tldp.org/LDP/LG/issue23/flower/context.html">context of a process</a>. On Windows, when the callback registered by <strong><em>PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx</em></strong> is invoked, it’s in the context of the creating process for process creations. For process terminations, it’s in the context of the terminating process (see the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-pssetcreateprocessnotifyroutineex">document</a>). Inside the Windows kernel, most of the time you can find out the actor process by simply calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-psgetcurrentprocessid">PsGetCurrentProcessId</a>, because the kernel service usually shares context with the actor process. However, in the macOS kernel (for <a href="http://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2005/tn2127.html#SECLISTENERGOTCHAS">reasons</a>), developers are advised to avoid calling <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/kernel/1488975-proc_self?language=objc">proc_self</a> in the kernel to find out the actor process. This is easier to understand from a microkernel’s point of view, because most of the system services are delegated to other processes on a microkernel system. Particularly, when <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KernelProgramming/Extend/Extend.html">kernel extensions</a> are replaced by <a href="https://developer.apple.com/system-extensions/">system extensions</a> (which runs in user mode) in macOS 10.16, the same advice should be strictly followed.
</p> <p><strong><h3>macOS</h3></strong> <strong><h4>Kauth/MACF</h4></strong></p><p><a href="http://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2005/tn2127.html">Kauth</a> is a Kernel Programming Interface (KPI) provided by macOS to allow third parties — primarily security software developers — to intercept select operations.<sup>1</sup> As the definition suggests, it can only be used in kernel mode. There’s another KPI, called <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/mac.html">Mandatory Access Control Framework</a> (MACF), which is way more powerful than Kauth, but it’s Apple’s private KPI and not “open” for third-party developers. With the kext deprecation announcement, both Kauth and MACF won’t be available for third-party developers, starting with macOS 10.16. I briefly describe Kauth here to present a continuity view for you to get an idea of macOS's evolution:
</p><p>Kauth defines “scopes,”&nbsp;which Apple describes as “areas of interest” for authorization within the kernel.<sup>1</sup> A couple scopes in Kauth provide means for third-party software to get notified when a process is launched.
</p><ul><li><a href="http://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2005/tn2127.html#SECVNODESCOPE">Vnode scope</a>&nbsp;- Vnode scope is capable of preventing a process from being launched. By calling KPI <em>kauth_listen_scope(KAUTH_SCOPE_VNODE,...)</em>, a developer can register a vnode scope listener callback. When an operation on a vnode is about to happen, macOS will invoke the callback. The callback can then block or allow the operation. Vnode operations are not limited to executions. There are other types of vnode operations as well, such as open/close/read/write/etc. By checking <em>KAUTH_VNODE_EXECUTE</em> flag against the vnode operation (<em>action</em>), we know a file is executed — which roughly translates to “a process is launched” in Windows language.</li></ul><ul><li><a href="http://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2005/tn2127.html#SECFILEOPSCOPE">File operation scope</a>&nbsp;- Similar to vnode, file operation scope is able to report operations on a file. The <em>KAUTH_FILEOP_EXEC</em> flag in the <em>action</em> parameter indicates that a file is being executed. However, file operation scope works only in listening mode. It can not be used to prevent a file from being executed inline.</li></ul> <p><strong><h4>Endpoint Security system extensions</h4></strong></p><p>macOS <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/endpointsecurity">Endpoint Security</a> (ES) is a kind of System Extension which runs in user mode, and it’s the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/702/">replacement</a> for Kauth. In the new ES framework, event types are better organized in one enum definition 
	<strong><em><a href="#es_event_type_t">es_event_type_t</a></em></strong> defined in XCode’s SDK header file:
</p><p>/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/EndpointSecurity/ESTypes.h
</p><p>You can see that process events are just a subset of ES events (more discussion about ES events can be found in the next File Events section). The few types of ES events pertaining to process events are:&nbsp;
</p><ul> <em><li><em>ES_EVENT_TYPE_AUTH_EXEC</em></li></em> <em><li><em>ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_EXEC</em></li></em> <em><li><em>ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_FORK</em></li></em> <em><li><em>ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_EXIT</em></li></em></ul><p>Note that if you find “<strong><em>AUTH</em></strong>” in the event …</p></div></div></div></div></div>
