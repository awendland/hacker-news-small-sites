Its findings are limited because it does not look at the full set of mutations found in either of the new variants of the rapidly spreading virus.</p>  <p>Dormitzer said it was encouraging that the vaccine appears effective against the mutation, as well as 15 other mutations the company has previously tested against.</p>  <p>"So we've now tested 16 different mutations, and none of them have really had any significant impact. That's the good news," he said. "That doesn't mean that the 17th won't."</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH | What scientists know about the new coronavirus variant:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="What scientists know about the new coronavirus variant" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1842141251676-metadata-" title="What scientists know about the new coronavirus variant"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/643/819/COVID-VARIANT-SCI-BIRAK-080121.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>The B1-17 coronavirus variant, first discovered in the U.K., is now in at least 40 countries, including Canada. It has 23 mutations, including one that attaches to healthy cells like a key going into a lock.<!-- --> <!-- -->1:56</span></span></span></p>  <p>Dormitzer said another mutation found in the South African variant, called the E484K mutation, was also concerning.</p>  <p>The researchers plan to run similar tests to establish whether the vaccine is effective against other mutations found in the British and South African variants and hope to have more data within weeks.</p>  <p>The variants are said by scientists to be more transmissible than previously dominant ones, but they are not thought to cause more serious illness.</p>  <p>The virus's spikes act as a key that must unlock our cells to cause the infection.&nbsp;The variant first identified in the U.K. has a mutation that appears to make it easier for the coronavirus to grab hold of the lock more tightly, scientists say.</p>    <p>Scientists said the results of the study would help calm concerns that people will not be protected by vaccines being given to millions of people around the world in the fight against the pandemic, which has killed more than 1.8 million people and roiled economies.</p>  <p>But they cautioned that more clinical tests and data are still needed to come to a definitive conclusion.</p>  <p>"This is good news, mainly because it is not bad news," said Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the&nbsp;London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine.</p>  <p>"So, yes this is good news, but it does not yet give us total confidence that the Pfizer (or other) vaccines will definitely give protection."</p>  <h2>AstraZeneca, Moderna, CureVac testing against variants</h2>  <p>AstraZeneca, Moderna and CureVac are also testing whether their shots work against the fast-spreading variants.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>In my <a href="https://markjames.dev/2021-01-04-why-learning-fsharp-2021/">previous post</a>, I discussed how I’ve decided to learn F# in 2021 for a number of reasons. Around the same time, I also happened to setup my Sim Racing rig so that I could continue to play <a href="https://www.iracing.com/" target="_blank">iRacing</a> with my VR headset (HTC Vive). Its been several years since I’ve last played, but with COVID-related curfews being implemented here in Montreal tomorrow, I’ve been increasingly taking up home-based pursuits which I didn’t always have the time for pre-lockdown. Since the last time I played iRacing, I’m running a PC with a much better processor, motherboard, and only SSDs. The VR performance has been a huge leap forward since I used to play with my old machine and I was quite impressed. After spending a couple of hours setting up, here’s what my current humble racing setup looks like:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/irsdk-fsharp/racing-rig.jpg" width="650" height="488" alt="Photo of my current iRacing VR setup"></p>

<p>Having a dedicated table really helps, as in my old apartment it was fairly difficult to setup a station with limited space, but now I can fortunately just jump in. Despite the past limitations, I was able to get fairly competitive and still remember the thrill of my first win agaisnt a field of real racers in a Mazda MX-5:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/irsdk-fsharp/iracing-win.jpg" width="500" height="279" alt="Photo of my iRacing first win certificate"></p>

<p>Inspired by setting everything up and doing some laps to practice for an eventual return to comeptition, I started thinking about how I once experimented with using the <a href="https://github.com/kutu/pyirsdk" target="_blank">Python implementation</a> of the iRacing SDK to connect to an arduino and display a speedometer readout in realtime on a small screen. In reminiscing about the experience, I thought about how I could look into writing an F# implementation of the SDK as a learning project. In addition to learning through the project, it also has the benefit of being of use in a future project involving an iRacing stats tracker web app that I’ve been thinking about writing as a project for my upcoming <a href="https://markjames.dev/2020-12-09-back-to-school/">cloud computing courses</a>.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>I tend to learn best when projects are slightly outside of my comfort zone, and this would be both my first time writing a library, as well as writing one in a functional language! Having used an array of libraries at this point, I had some confidence in choosing an organizational structure, and the Python implementation is only <a href="https://github.com/kutu/pyirsdk/blob/master/irsdk.py" target="_blank">739 lines of code</a> which felt doable compared to some of the larger libraries out there.</p>

<p>Moreover, the python implementation of the SDK has the ability to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get session data (WeekendInfo, SessionInfo, etc…)</li>
  <li>Get live telemetry data (Speed, FuelLevel, etc…)</li>
  <li>Broadcast messages (camera, replay, chat, pit and telemetry commands)</li>
</ul>

<p>and I figured that this would be a good featureset to aim for in the final version of the F# SDK. Out of these features, the session data and live telemetry data would be the ones I plan to implement first.</p>

<h2 id="creating-the-library">Creating the Library</h2>

<p>After coming up with some desired features, the first step was to create a new FSharp solution called iRacingFSharp. Inside the solution, I created two projects. One was our actual library, called iRacingFSharp, and the other was a basic console app called SDKReader (located in the Examples Folder) to test the functionality of the library as I worked on it. Note, if you’d like to see the full codebase you can <a href="https://github.com/markjamesm/irsdk-fsharp" target="_blank">here on github</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-first-function">The First Function</h2>

<p>Starting small, I decided that a good first function would be to find out the state of the simulator. Fortunately, the iRacing SDK allows you to check if the sim is running using the following URL which points to a localhost server:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>http://127.0.0.1:32034/get_sim_status?object=simStatus
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Getting this URL in Postman returns a JSON object which looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>var simStatus={
   running:0 // 1 if the sim is running
};
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I decided to make use of the <a href="https://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/Http.html" target="_blank">F# Data HTTP library</a> in order to download the response and so I installed it from NuGet at this point.</p>

<p>Next, inside my iRacingFSharp project I created a file called Irsdk.fs and wrote the following code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>namespace</span> <span>IrsdkFS</span>

<span>open</span> <span>FSharp</span><span>.</span><span>Data</span>

<span>///&lt;summary&gt;F# implementation of the iRacing SDK.&lt;/summary&gt;</span>
<span>module</span> <span>IrsdkFS</span> <span>=</span>

    <span>///&lt;summary&gt;Returns the simStatus in string format&lt;/summary&gt;</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>SimStatus</span><span>()</span> <span>=</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>simStatusURL</span> <span>=</span> <span>"http://127.0.0.1:32034/get_sim_status?object=simStatus"</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>simStatusObject</span> <span>=</span> <span>Http</span><span>.</span><span>RequestString</span><span>(</span><span>simStatusURL</span><span>)</span>
        <span>simStatusObject</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the above code, I’ve created a module which contains a function called SimStatus that takes no parameters. It then binds the JSON response to simStatusURL and passes it to the HTTP library via Http.RequestString(). Finally, simStatusObject is returned in string format which can be parsed further by another function in a later step.</p>



<p>With this simple function in place, the next step was to create SDKReader.fs inside my SDKReader console app. This file contained code to call the SimStatus() function and print the output:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>[&lt;</span><span>EntryPoint</span><span>&gt;]</span>
<span>let</span> <span>main</span> <span>argv</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>test</span> <span>=</span> <span>IrsdkFS</span><span>.</span><span>SimStatus</span><span>()</span>
    <span>printf</span> <span>"%s"</span> <span>test</span>
    <span>0</span> <span>// return an integer exit code</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running dotnet build inside the SDKReader folder displayed the following output while iRacing was running:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>"var simStatus={
   running:1
};
"</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Success! With this method working, we now have the very beginnings of an F# implementation of the iRacing SDK! Although it is a small step, we were also able to create and structure the project. Lastly, I also setup a a basic .NET build through Github Actions for CI.</p>



<p>iRacing’s API telemetry comes in three variations; data written to a .ibt file 60 times a second, live data exposed to the telemetry API 60 times per second, and a session string in YAML format that contains more or less static information about the session. The YAML string is appended to the end of the .ibt file but only a small portion of that data is exposed. This means that going forward, I’ll need to look into parsing the YAML as well as mapping more of the API endpoints. The iRacing API appears to be nonstandard and so it may take a little more work than just a typical REST API.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for Part Two where I plan to implement some telemetry functions and look into parsing the aforementioned YAML. In addition, be sure to follow along with the <a href="https://github.com/markjamesm/irsdk-fsharp" target="_blank">Github Repo here</a> if you’re interested in seeing how to project progresses (or would like to contribute)!</p>

<p>There are lots of problems with ad-tech:</p>
<ul>
<li>being spied on all the time means that the people of the 21st century are less able to be their authentic selves;
</li>
<li>
<p>any data that is collected and retained will eventually breach, creating untold harms;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>data-collection enables for discriminatory business practices ("digital redlining");</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the huge, tangled hairball of adtech companies siphons lots (maybe even most) of the money that should go creators and media orgs; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>anti-adblock demands browsers and devices that thwart their owners' wishes, a capability that can be exploited for even more nefarious purposes;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That's all terrible, but it's also <em>ironic</em>, since it appears that, in addition to everything else, ad-tech is a fraud, a bezzle.</p>
<p>Bezzle was John Kenneth Galbraith's term for "the magic interval when a confidence trickster knows he has the money he has appropriated but the victim does not yet understand that he has lost it." That is, a rotten log that has yet to be turned over.</p>
<p>Bezzles unwind slowly, then all at once. We've had some important peeks under ad-tech's rotten log, and they're increasing in both intensity and velocity. If you follow Aram Zucker-Scharff, you've had a front-row seat to the fraud.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Chronotope/status/1078003966863200256">https://twitter.com/Chronotope/status/1078003966863200256</a></p>
<p>Time and again, everything in the ad-tech stack has been demonstrated to be fraudulent: fake audiences firing fake clicks at fake videos on fake sites that suck real dollars out of advertisers' accounts.</p>
<p>This was masterfully elucidated in Tim Hwang's short 2020 book SUBPRIME ATTENTION CRISIS, whose thesis is: we must deflate the ad-tech bubble intentionally, lest we get a messy rupture that destroys many of the good things the parasite has colonized.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/05/florida-man/#wannamakers-ghost">https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/05/florida-man/#wannamakers-ghost</a></p>
<p>The ad-tech fraud is many-layered. On the surface, there's the counting frauds: fake clicks, fake sites, fake videos, etc. But there's a deeper fraud, a theory fraud, the fraud that with enough surveillance data and machine learning, ad-tech can sell anyone anything.</p>
<p>That is: even if we count accurately, ads are still overvalued and underperforming. This is also a lesson whose examples are coming with increasing tempo, as when Ebay simply stopped buying Google search ads and saw <em>no</em> decrease in sales.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/06/surveillance-tulip-bulbs/#adtech-bubble">https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/06/surveillance-tulip-bulbs/#adtech-bubble</a></p>
<p>In a piece for Forbes, marketer-turned-antifraud-auditor Dr Augustine Fou rounds up some of the grossest things festering under the ad-tech log.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/augustinefou/2021/01/02/when-big-brands-stopped-spending-on-digital-ads-nothing-happened-why/?sh=5a4f9c9a1166">https://www.forbes.com/sites/augustinefou/2021/01/02/when-big-brands-stopped-spending-on-digital-ads-nothing-happened-why/?sh=5a4f9c9a1166</a></p>
<p>Like that time in 2018 when Procter and Gamble – inventors of "brand marketing" – turned off $200m worth of ad-tech buys and saw no change to their sales. Or when Chase killed 95% of its advertising and kept all of its business.</p>
<p>Most interesting is the tale of how Uber allowed itself to be defrauded of $150m/year, for years, by ad-tech intermediaries. It's a story told in detail by former Uber head of "performance marketing" Kevin Frisch on the Marketing Today podcast:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.marketingtodaypodcast.com/194-historic-ad-fraud-at-uber-with-kevin-frisch/">https://www.marketingtodaypodcast.com/194-historic-ad-fraud-at-uber-with-kevin-frisch/</a></p>
<p>It starts with the revelation that $50m of its annual spend on customer acquisitions – money paid when an ad leads to a new Uber customer downloading the app, entering payment details and taking their first ride – was fraudulent.</p>
<p>Here's how that worked: scummy marketers fielded low-quality apps (like battery monitors) that requested root access. These apps spied on every app you installed. If you installed Uber, they "fired a click" to the system to report you as having been "converted" by an ad.</p>
<p>After clearing $50m of fraud, Frisch continued to dig into the system. In the end, about $120m of the $150m was being stolen, pocketed for fake clicks on fake sites by fake users.</p>
<p>In a fascinating turn, Frisch describes how his colleagues were indifferent or actively hostile to his efforts. Uber was in "growth mode," trying to beef up its numbers prior to the IPO where suckers would relieve its Saudi royal investors.</p>
<p>Uber is a company that will never, ever be profitable. It, too, is a bezzle. It only "works" if outside investors – marks – can somehow be convinced to buy the insiders' stock, which requires the appearance of growth – AKA "A pile of shit this big <em>must</em> have a pony under it!"</p>
<p>So execs like Frisch were required to "spend to budget" – to maintain the appearance of growth, including (especially) the growth of its "precision analytics" marketing, where ad-tech spends turned into directly attributable customer acquisitions.</p>
<p>This is the story that keeps on giving, because it all starts with Sleeping Giant's campaign to force Uber to stop advertising on Breitbart, and Uber's inability to get its ad-tech "partners" to definitively switch off Breitbart ads.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nandoodles/status/1345774768746852353">https://twitter.com/nandoodles/status/1345774768746852353</a></p>
<p>The system's layers of misdirection – there to hide the fraud – meant that it behaved nondeterministically and couldn't fulfil simple requests, which triggered the search.</p>
<p>There's a theory that the reason Big Tech spies on us so much is that they're really good at turning data into sales (and, by extension, influence, as in elections, referenda, etc). But it is increasingly apparent that Big Tech's spying is part of a bezzle.</p>
<p>That is, we're being surveilled, doxed, placed under automated suspicion and digitally discriminated against all to put on a show that separates marks from their dollars.</p>
<p>This is the theme of my 2020 book HOW TO DESTROY SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM:</p>
<p><a href="https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59">https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59</a></p>
<p>Namely, that we are under constant surveillane because monopolies can get away with obviously fraudulent and dangerous conduct by mobilizing their monopoly profits to buy political outcomes that serve their ends.</p>
<p>This is also what happened with California's Proposition 22, the most expensive ballot initiative in US history: Uber didn't spearhead a $200m campaign to legalize worker misclassification to become profitable.</p>
<p>Uber will never be profitable.</p>
<p>All that money was spent to maintain the fiction, the fraud, the bezzle – it was an appeal to rescue the wholly fictional pony underneath that gigantic pile of shit.</p>

<p>Google workers have announced their intention to form a union, under the auspices of CWA Local 1440. The union is called The Alphabet Workers Union (Google maintains the legal and accounting fiction that it is a division of a holding company called "Alphabet").</p>
<p>Speaking of legal fictions, the union is opening membership to "TVCs" – temps, vendors and contractors – employees who have been deliberately misclassified so as to avoid paying them benefits or extending normal workplace protections to them.</p>
<p>It's a bold move, a countermeasure to thwart the other commercial advantage from worker misclassification: by creating multiple categories of workers, bosses can pit employees against one another, by dangling privileges in front of one group but not the other.</p>
<p>But it comes at a high price: to gain official legal recognition, more than 50% of eligible workers must join the union. By including more workers, the union is setting a higher bar for official status.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3an5q9/google-workers-publicly-launch-union">https://www.vice.com/en/article/3an5q9/google-workers-publicly-launch-union</a></p>
<p>But the union has momentum: a series of high-profile googler uprisings – driven by official tolerance for sexual misconduct, complicity in US military drone programs, secret collaboration with Chinese surveillance and censorship, and more – show how radicalized googlers are.</p>
<p>Google's management – who cultivated an air of participatory, cuddly collaboration – have arrived at a point where the contradictions between their "values" and the company's profits can no longer be reconciled.</p>
<p>In Dec 2020, Google fired Timnit Gebru, an eminent Black AI scientist who refused to retract a paper critical of its profitable Big Data research. Management compounded their sins by making false claims about Gebru's dismissal.</p>
<p>The unionization drive is under the CWA's #CODE (Coalition to Organize Digital Employees) project. Though CODE is no stranger to conflict, Google represents a serious challenge, thanks to its partnership with notorious union-busters IRI Consultants.</p>
<p>(IRI's tactics pale in comparison to the mercenaries that Amazon has hired to bust its unions: the Pinkerton company, who have spilled rivers of workers' blood in their murderous history):</p>

<p>For important context on the drive, check out Collective Action in Tech's article on the announcement, which explains why googlers have formed a "non-contract union" that does not yet have official recognition.</p>

        <h2>Donald Trump Twitter Screenshot Archive</h2>
      </p>
      
        
      

      <div><p>Donald Trump loves to tweet and everyone knows that.
Twitter is his favorite medium to express his ideas and to communicate with the world.
He has been an active Twitter user since 2009. Much longer than many other world leaders.</p>
<p>Last month (May 2020) he tweeted 845 times â€” that's 28 tweets per day on average!</p>
<center>
  <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/491324429184823296"><img src="https://pikaso.me/blog/files/pikaso.me-realDonaldTrump-20140721_205046-491324429184823296.png" alt="Trump Tweet" width="500" height="244"></a>
</center>
<p>A while ago we received a request from one of our users who was looking for a way to screenshot all Donald Trump tweets.
We realized that's a good opportunity to put <a href="https://pikaso.me/">Pikaso</a> into test and see if it can perform such a task without any problems.
It went smoothly and there was only an issue with one of his tweets which included a deleted image.</p>
<p>Today, we are releasing the resulting files to the public.
This archive contains screenshots of 43,475 Donald Trump tweets from May 2009 to May 2020.
Whether you are pro- or anti- Trump, this is an important part of Internet history that we believe should be preserved.</p>
<h3 id="download">Download</h3>
<p>The Donald Trump Twitter Screenshot Archive can be downloaded through the following links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pikaso.me/go/trump-twitter-archive-v1.zip">trump_twitter_archive_v1.zip</a> (Direct download, 2.6 GB)</li>
<li><a href="https://pikaso.me/go/trump-twitter-archive-v1.torrent">trump_twitter_archive_v1.torrent</a> (Torrent download, 28.2 KB)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="howthiswasmade">How This Was Made?</h3>
<p>To create this archive, we first extracted all tweet ids from the realDonaldTrump.csv file that was provided to us.
That file only contained Donald Trump tweets up to March 29, 2020. To get the later tweets, we used <a href="http://trumptwitterarchive.com/">trumptwitterarchive.com</a>.</p>
<p>We then used the <a href="https://pikaso.me/api">Pikaso API</a> to screenshot each individual tweet.</p>
<h3 id="updates">Updates</h3>
<p>We have no plans to keep this archive up to date after the initial release.
However, if you are interested in doing so, you can use <a href="https://pikaso.me/">Pikaso</a>.
You can even <a href="https://pikaso.me/automate">automate</a> it so that each time he tweets, an automatic screenshot is taken.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><article><header></header><p>How do you send a password over the internet? You acquire a SSL certificate and let TLS do the job of securely transporting the password from client to server. Of course it’s not as cut-and-dry as I’m making it out to be, but the gist of it holds true and stood the test of time. This hasn’t always been this way though, and one incredibly popular storefront on the world wide web prefers to add a little extra to this day. I’ll be discussing Steam’s unique method of logging in their users, and go down a deep rabbit hole of fascinating implementation details.</p><h3 id="pointing-out-the-obvious">Pointing out the obvious</h3><p>I found a StackOverflow question from 2013 <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1582894/how-to-send-password-securely-over-http">asking how to securely send a password over HTTP</a>. The answers are pretty unanimous: get a SSL certificate. Here’s an experiment: set up your favorite traffic-capturing proxy, browse to a service you frequently use, log in with your account (or preferably a throwaway), and inspect the requests. You will most certainly find that your username and password are sent as-is in a HTTP request body. The only reason this works is because your connection to the server is encrypted using TLS.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/steam-rsa/so-real-host.png" alt="StackOverflow user asking what to do if a webhost doesn't support SSL certificates, told to move to a real webhost"><figcaption><p>Weird to think that this used to be an issue</p></figcaption></figure><p>The internet was a different place though in the early 2010s, let alone the many years prior. We now have services like <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a> which issue SSL certificates free of charge for a period of three months, with automatic renewals if desired. There really wasn’t much of a way around acquiring a SSL certificate for money, but usually with extended validity and support. You could certainly argue that there is a price to be paid for the security and privacy of your users, but that didn’t stop questions like the one I linked from appearing.</p><p>Now that we all agree that TLS is important, let’s switch it up. Let’s pretend we cannot send a password over HTTPS and have to somehow make it work with plain HTTP, while also providing users with some level of security. There’s the <code>Authorization</code> header which is standardized and widely accepted. However, in conjunction with the “Basic” HTTP Authentication scheme, it provides no security if used in plain HTTP.</p><p>There are tried and tested challenge-response algorithms, most notably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol">SRP</a> which is designed to do password-based authentication without ever actually sending the password, but you probably have to implement them yourself and a slight oversight could cause serious harm. You could also defer authentication to an external service. “Sign in with service XYZ” is commonly used, but comes with its own ramifications. All things considered, it’s not trivial to send secrets over an inheretly insecure connection.</p><p>So when me and a friend took Steam apart in search for traces of personally identifiable information, I was surprised to see that Steam’s login page doesn’t only rely on TLS to ensure that your password stays protected.</p><h3 id="crypto-cherry-on-top">Crypto cherry on top</h3><p>Again, grab your favorite traffic-capturing proxy and navigate to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/login">Steam’s login page</a>. Enter your username and password and you will (hopefully) be asked to enter a one-time token generated by your preferred two-factor authentication method. You can stop right there, because the magic I want to point out has already happened. You’ll find that pressing the login button launches a request against an odd endpoint: <code>/login/getrsakey</code>, followed by <code>/login/dologin</code>.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/steam-rsa/getrsa-call.png" alt="Requests to fetch script assets, acquire RSA key and perform login"><figcaption><p>All relevant assets and requests in succession</p></figcaption></figure><p>Inspect the request for <code>/login/getrsakey</code> and you’ll find a JSON-formatted response, containing fields with names that should look very familiar to anyone who’s briefly dealt with public key cryptography. You’re given a RSA public key, though the exact values might look a bit odd. It’s clear that <code>publickey_mod</code> and <code>publickey_exp</code> define the modulus and the exponent used in encryption, but the former is given in hexadecimal while the latter appears to be given in binary (I’ll get back on that later). There’s also a timestamp which has no immediately recognizable starting point. As to what the purpose of <code>token_gid</code> is, I have no clue yet.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span>
    <span>"success"</span><span>:</span><span>true</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"publickey_mod"</span><span>:</span><span>"c85ba44d5a3608561cb289795ac93b34d4b9b4326f9c09d1d19a9923e2d136b8..."</span><span>,</span>

    <span>"token_gid"</span><span>:</span><span>"2701e0b0a4be3635"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The login page pulls some scripts on load. There is the main login handler contained in <code>login.js</code> which is completely unobfuscated, so anyone can just analyze it and find out what it does. The site also loads some additional dependencies, namely <code>jsbn.js</code> and <code>rsa.js</code>.</p><p>A quick search for the name mentioned in the first line of <code>jsbn.js</code> reveals that these two scripts are the work of <a href="http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/">Tom Wu</a> — a MIT and Stanford graduate who likes software engineering and computer cryptography. They released <code>jsbn.js</code> and <code>rsa.js</code> as pure JavaScript implementations of arbitrary precision integers and RSA encryption/decryption respectively. You’ll also find that these libraries have had their most recent updates in 2005 and 2013 which is a bit of information I’ll come back to later. For now, just keep it in mind.</p><h3 id="going-down-the-rsabbit-hole">Going down the r(s)abbit hole</h3><p>So now that we have all relevant assets, let’s dig around in <code>login.js</code>. The code is a bit of a mess with lots of callbacks and proxied function calls, but it turns out the parts of interest can be easily condensed. In essence, the script can be boiled down to a couple of steps, each step assuming that everything went fine in the previous step.</p><ol><li>The user enters their username and password and presses the login button.</li><li><code>DoLogin</code> is called, which checks if the login mask was filled out correctly and launches a request against <code>/login/getrsakey</code>.</li><li><code>OnRSAKeyResponse</code> is called. This checks if the response is well-formed.</li><li><code>GetAuthCode</code> is called. It runs some platform-specific code in case there are any 2FA measures active on the user’s account.</li><li><code>OnAuthCodeResponse</code> is called. This is where the password is encrypted using RSA and the request against <code>/login/dologin</code> is prepared and executed.</li><li><code>OnLoginResponse</code> is called. The user is logged in and redirected to the Steam storefront.</li></ol><p>The code in <code>OnAuthCodeResponse</code> shows why the requested public key is formatted the way that it is. Starting at line 387 in the source file, the modulus and exponent of the <code>/login/getrsakey</code> response are passed as-is to the RSA library. The user’s password is then encrypted with the given public key and added to the request against <code>/login/dologin</code> in the subsequent login step.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>var</span> <span>pubKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>RSA</span><span>.</span><span>getPublicKey</span><span>(</span><span>results</span><span>.</span><span>publickey_mod</span><span>,</span> <span>results</span><span>.</span><span>publickey_exp</span><span>);</span>

</code></pre></div><p>I copied the source files onto my local machine to explore the RSA library a little bit. Both the modulus and the exponent are passed to the function <code>RSAPublicKey</code> which behaves like a constructor in the “pre-class” JavaScript era. <code>RSAPublicKey</code> simply wraps both values into instances of <code>BigInteger</code> provided by the <code>jsbn.js</code> script. It was to my surprise that the exponent is actually not represented in binary but, just like the modulus, in hexadecimal. (Also, turns out <code>0x010001</code> is a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6098381/what-are-common-rsa-sign-exponent">very common encryption exponent</a> in RSA implementations.) So now it’s clear that the password encryption is based on 2048-bit RSA with an encryption exponent of 65537.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>let</span> <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>RSA</span><span>.</span><span>getPublicKey</span><span>(</span><span>"c85ba44d5a360856..."</span> <span>/* insert your own long modulus here */</span><span>,</span> <span>"010001"</span><span>);</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>.</span><span>encryptionExponent</span><span>.</span><span>toString</span><span>());</span> <span>// =&gt; "65537"
</span><span></span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>.</span><span>modulus</span><span>.</span><span>bitLength</span><span>());</span> <span>// =&gt; 2048
</span></code></pre></div><p>Moving on to the <code>timestamp</code> field. The <code>/login/getrsakey</code> response contains an <code>Expires</code> header. It references a date in the past, meaning that the response is absolutely not meant to be cached or persisted in any way. If you check back on <code>/login/getrsakey</code> over a longer period of time, you’ll notice that the public key changes ever so often and, as such, its timestamp value too. This means there’s only a limited time frame in which a certain Steam-issued RSA public key can be used to authenticate.</p><p>This becomes even more evident when examining the subsequent request against <code>/login/dologin</code>. Among many other things, it contains the username, encrypted password as well as the timestamp of the issued RSA public key. Trying to perform a login attempt while altering the timestamp fails as expected. But more importantly, it’s also not possible to reuse an older public key, even if the password is correctly encrypted.</p><p>I went one step further and <a href="https://gist.github.com/JoogsWasTaken/8a8e60859e1721255c57e9185eb6cb10">wrote a simple Python script to collect public keys</a> over the span of three days using a throwaway account. I let it run every five minutes using a cronjob. The goal was to check just how often Steam’s public keys change and to hopefully find out how the <code>timestamp</code> field behaves.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/steam-rsa/sqlite-pubkeys.png" alt="SQLite database containing public keys sourced from Steam"><figcaption><p>Lots and lots and lots of public keys</p></figcaption></figure><p>I found that the public key changes every 12 entries, meaning that it’s safe to assume that they rotate every hour. The encryption exponent stays the same — no surprises here. More intriguing however is the aforementioned <code>timestamp</code> field. For every 12 public keys, the value of the <code>timestamp</code> increases by a certain amount, namely 3600000000 and then some. And what’s more is that this number wraps around after some period of time as can be seen in the following image. Be warned, because all of what I’m about to say is highly speculative.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/steam-rsa/sqlite-wraparound.png" alt="Public key entries where the timestamp value wraps around in-between"><figcaption><p>Timestamp field wrapping around</p></figcaption></figure><p>I found that 3600000000 microseconds is equal to one hour, making me assume that the value of the <code>timestamp</code> field is, in fact, given in microseconds. However, I already hinted at the fact that the timestamp value doesn’t increase by one hour exactly with every new public key. In my own data, I observed that the difference between two successive timestamps is one hour plus 1 to 2.6 seconds, with most being in the order of about 1.05 to 1.25 seconds. But this raises another interesting possibility.</p><p>Let’s assume that a new public key is generated every hour plus one second. If I query the public key …</p></article></section></div>

Such inflammation can contribute to a variety of diseases and conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease, dementia, certain cancers, atherosclerosis, liver fibrosis, diabetes and arthritis. </p><p>“The gut lining is an amazing entity. It is comprised of a single layer of cells that are meant to seal the body from the trillions of microbes, defend our immune system, and at the same time allow absorption of essential nutrients,” said Ghosh. “Anything we eat or drink, our lifestyle choices in other words, has the ability to impact our gut microbes, the gut barrier and overall health. Now we know that what we smoke, such as e-cigarettes, negatively impacts it as well.”</p><p>The researchers found that two chemicals used as a base for all e-cigarette liquid vapor — propylene glycol and vegetable glycerol — were the cause of inflammation.</p><p>“Numerous chemicals are created when these two are heated to generate the fumes in vaping that cause the most damage, for which there are no current regulations,” said Ghosh. “The safety of e-cigarettes have been debated fiercely on both sides. Nicotine content, and its addictive nature, has always been the major focus of those who argue against its safety, whereas lack of chemicals in the carcinogens that are present in the cigarette smoke has been touted by the makers of e-cigarettes when marketing these products as a ‘healthy alternative.’ In reality, it’s the chemicals making up the vapor liquid that we should be more concerned about as they are the cause of gut inflammation.” &nbsp;</p><p>For the study, the team used 3D models of human intestinal tracts generated from patient cells and simulated what happens when e-cigarette vapors enter the gut lining. Researchers validated the findings using mice models of vaping in collaboration with Laura Crotty-Alexander, MD, associate professor of medicine in the Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine at UC San Diego School of Medicine and section chief of Pulmonary Critical Care at Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System.</p><p>To produce the 3D gut organoids, the researchers collected stem cells from patients’ biopsies during colonoscopies and grew them in vitro. The stem cells differentiated into the four different cell types that make up the gut lining. The team then exposed the organoids to e-cigarette liquid vapor, mimicking the frequency of a chronic vaper.</p><figure data-orig-width="640" data-orig-height="400"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/4cd0a7df45ff92ad73c77d47869af825/1c0ff7a9c3fdd454-ab/s640x960/5d6405078c464994050bbc8bc369bc2296633165.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="640" data-orig-height="400" width="640" height="400"></figure><p><i>Image: In the bottom frames, burst cell junctions in the gut lining can be seen after being exposed to e-cigarette chemicals as compared to healthy cells in the top frames.

In the future, Ghosh said she and colleagues plan to look at different flavorings of e-cigarettes to determine what effects they might have on the gut. </p><p>Additional study co-authors include: Aditi Sharma, Jasper Lee, Ayden G.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div id="articleBody"><p dir="ltr">U.S. states that rely on private prisons incarcerate more people for longer periods of time, according to a first-of-its-kind study that establishes a causal connection between private prisons and incarceration.Â&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927537120301123">paper</a>, published in the December issue of <em>Labour Economics</em>, adds to researchersâ€™ understanding of financial incentives in the criminal justice system, according to authors Gregmar Galinato and Ryne Rohla, both economists at Washington State University.</p><p dir="ltr">The researchers found that states that opened private prisons saw a 4% jump in prison population, or an average of between 6 and 37 extra prisoners per million residents, based on a review of data from 1989 to 2008. Incarcerating those extra people cost states an extra $1.9 million to $10.6 million per year if all additional prisoners were housed in private prisons.</p><p dir="ltr">Galinato and Rohla found that the growth in prison population experienced by states with private prisons was caused by an increase in the number of people being sent to prison, as well as judges handing down longer sentences for particular crimes.Â&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Specifically, a 1% increase in private prison beds per capita will increase sentencing lengths for regulatory offenses by 29 days, weapons offenses by 13 days, drug offenses by 7 days and fraud offenses by 2 days, the researchers found.Â&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">However, those figures might underestimate the actual amount of time incarcerated people spend in private prisons, the researchers added, pointing to a 2019 <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2523238">paper</a> by Wisconsin School of Business professor Anita Mukherjee that found that private prison inmates in Mississippi served a full three months longer than people convicted of the same crimes who were sent to public prisons. Mukherjee attributed the lengthier time served to the fact that conduct violations, which can tack extra time onto prisonersâ€™ sentences, are more common in private prisons than in public ones.Â&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">While Galinato and Rohla found that people convicted of weapons and drug offenses saw harsher sentences in states with more private prison beds, sentencing for other crimes such as murder did not change.Â&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">â€œThat was a good marker for us, because that showed that this wasnâ€™t random noise going on or some correlation,â€� said Galinato of the fact that only some crimes saw a sentencing difference.Â&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">In order to establish a causal relationship, the researchers created an instrument called â€œprivatization knowledgeâ€� that indicated academic support for privatization by state from 1989 to 2008. That instrument, which was partially based on the use of words like â€œneoliberalismâ€� in academic journals, corresponded only to the proliferation of private prisons -- not the incarceration rate, the researchers said. Â&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Galinato said that finding an instrument to establish causality was one of the most difficult parts of the project, as the connection between private prisons and incarceration can be self-perpetuating. Developing and using the â€œprivatization knowledgeâ€� instrument took years.Â&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Galinato came up with the idea in 2015, and Rohla began compiling data shortly thereafter. It took about one year to get permission to use Department of Justice data, he said.Â&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to establishing a causal relationship between private prisons and incarceration, Galinato and Rohla also examined two factors that could lead authorities to hand down more and harsher sentences in the first place.Â&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Political corruption could lead politicians to enact stricter laws and cause judges to hand down harsher sentences, the researchers said, pointing to the 2008 â€œkids for cashâ€� <a href="https://nypost.com/2014/02/23/film-details-teens-struggles-in-state-detention-in-payoff-scandal/">scandal</a> in which Pennsylvania judges received kickbacks in exchange for giving juvenile offenders harsher prison sentences.Â&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Judges may also consider prison capacity when sentencing people, Galinato added. â€œIf you have a crowded public system, the judge will say, â€˜OK, this is a marginal person, weâ€™ll probably put them on probation because we donâ€™t want to overcrowd the prison.â€™â€�Â&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">However, the researchers did not find a strong enough link to claim that either factor has definitively led to higher incarceration rates at private prisons.Â&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">â€œThe best we can say is thereâ€™s a hint,â€� said Galinato. â€œThere could be more mechanisms [affecting incarceration rates] out there.â€�Â&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Rebecca Riddell, the co-director of New York University Law Schoolâ€™s Human Rights and Privatization Project, <a href="https://twitter.com/Rebecca_Riddell/status/1305884832153718785">praised</a> the study on Twitter.</p><p dir="ltr">â€œIt's appalling that private prisons increase incarceration levels,â€� said Riddell. â€œBut should we be surprised? Or is this a foreseeable outcome of creating a powerful industry that profits from every [additional] incarcerated person, takes in billions in taxpayer [dollars] and spends millions lobbying?â€�Â&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Galinato told <em>The Academic TimesÂ&nbsp;</em>that the link between private prisons and incarceration must factor into government policy.Â&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">â€œThere is this potential link, and this link becomes more significant if thereâ€™s more corruption and you donâ€™t have oversight,â€� he said, adding that policymakers donâ€™t typically consider that choosing private prisons over public ones increases overall incarceration.Â&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Galinato, who typically works as a natural resource and development economist, said he was inspired to conduct the study when watching an episode of the television show â€œElementary,â€� in which a prison warden murders an inmate in order to appease the owner of a private prison who wants to influence a lobby group.Â&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">The idea of private prison companies influencing governments to set harsher sentences initially â€œmade me laugh a little bit in terms of how ludicrous it was,â€� Galinato said.Â&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">â€œI wasnâ€™t really aware of private prisons in the U.S.,â€� he added. â€œI come from the Philippines. We don't have them.â€�Â&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">His experience studying corruption in relation to natural resources came in handy when examining the criminal justice system, he added.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of further research, Galinato said he was interested in examining the relationship between private prisons and private halfway houses, which are often owned by the same companies. The owners of halfway houses can set house rules that, if violated, send residents back to prison. That could incentivize halfway houses to set overly harsh rules in order to make more money.Â&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Galinato is also interested in examining private prisonsâ€™ incentive structures, which currently involve significant moral hazard. Private prisons are paid based on how many prisoners they house on a given day, potentially leading them to push for unjustly harsh punishments.Â&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">â€œThat kind of contract incentivizes more prisoners and increases the length of stay,â€� said Galinato. â€œWhat if the payment would be based on when they came out of jail and became a better member of society, then the private prison would get a bonus?â€�</p><p dir="ltr"><em>The paper, titled â€œDo privately-owned prisons increase incarceration rates?â€� was first published in the December issue of Labour Economics.Â&nbsp;</em><em>The authors were Gregmar Galinato of Washington State University and Ryne Rohla, who earned a PhD from Washington State University and now works for the Washington State Attorney General's Office. Galinato was lead author.Â&nbsp;</em></p></div></div></div>]]>

      <p>GitHub Repo : <a href="https://github.com/nuwandavek/you">https://github.com/nuwandavek/you</a></p>
<p><em>You</em> is an auto-completion tool that completes your sentences. It lets you train a generative model that can mimic your personal style over all your text communication. Currently, You trains on WhatsApp chat history, and offers autocomplete suggestions on WhatsApp Web via a Chrome/Firefox extension and a flask server. This can be extended to train and autocomplete on more personal communication apps (Messenger, email, Slack, Twitter, etc.). Everything runs locally and is completely private.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>Most text-based applications we use have some or the other form of aid to help us spell-check words, complete words or even complete sentences. Most primitive ones are based on simply looking up your words against a corpus, determining the most probable word and helping you complete them (spell-checks, Word docs). Intermediate tools use your own data to predict the most frequent bi-gram pairs (mobile keyboards), and advanced tools use neural networks (GMail, Google Docs). Predicting the next word (or token), however, is the most popular way of training a language model model using neural networks. The last couple of years has seen remarkable innovation in the field of NLP using neural networks from Bi-LSTMs to BERT to GPT3. We think the algorithms are already in place for tools to leverage their power and offer delightful personalized predictions - complete all your sentences. :)</p>
<p>We are also excited about the prospect of a language model that is tailor-made for you, across all platforms. A single model that understands how you speak to strangers over mail, colleagues over Slack, and friends over chat. We want people to be able to control and experiment with their experience and run everything locally, as much as possible - since these are after all, your personal messages only read by a handful of corporations and government agencies.</p>
<h2 id="demo">Demo</h2>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nuwandavek/you/master/demo.gif" alt="Chat With Rishi"></p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-run-this">How do I run this?</h2>
<p>Currently You works on web Whatsapp, and running You involves 3 steps</p>
<ul>
<li>Training (fine-tuning) a pre-trained DistilGPT2 model on your own chats on Google Colab (or locally if you have a GPU)</li>
<li>Running a flask server with the model downloaded from the above step</li>
<li>Installing a Chrome/Firefox extension that talks to your server and injects the prompts to your browser</li>
</ul>
<p>For more detailed steps, checkout the  <code>README</code> file on the <a href="https://github.com/nuwandavek/you">github repository</a>.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>We have a bunch of ToDos on the <code>README</code>. Mostly we will be experimenting with new models or with better training strategies to improve the prompts. We’ll  also be working on supporting more chat and other communication applications.</p>

  <p><span>06 Jan 2021</span></p><p>With the <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2020/12/25/ruby-3-0-0-released/" target="\_blank">Ruby 3.0 release</a>, there’s been a lot of chatter about concurrency, parallelism, and async IO.</p>

<p>For my own reflection, I wanted to write down what that means for performance and capacity/costs of apps, and what would be the impact on the Ruby ecosystem.</p>

<p>I will assume that the audience already knows the difference between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)#Threads_vs._processes_pros_and_cons" target="\_blank">threads vs processes model in UNIX</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%27s_law" target="\_blank">Little’s law</a>.</p>

<p>
Updated on Jan 9, 2021: thanks to the feedback from <a href="https://github.com/ioquatix" target="_blank">Samuel Williams</a>, I’ve revised the post with findings from <a href="https://github.com/socketry/falcon" target="_blank">Falcon</a>, the async web server written in Ruby.</p>

<h2 id="learning-from-python">Learning from Python</h2>

<p>It’s always good to take learnings from other languages. There’s an excellent <a href="http://calpaterson.com/async-python-is-not-faster.html" target="\_blank">write-up “Async Python is not faster” by Cal Paterson</a>.</p>

<p>It argues that process-based (aka forking) web servers <strong>show better latencies for web requests</strong> when they are compared to async IO-powered servers.</p>

<p>But why? That’s because async IO brings co-operative scheduling, which means that the execution is only yielded upon language keywords like <code>await</code>.</p>

<p>Quoting the author, this means that execution time is not distributed “fairly” and one thread can inadvertently starve another of CPU time while it is working. This is why latency is more erratic.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In contrast, traditional sync webservers use the pre-emptive multi-processing of the kernel scheduler, which works to ensure fairness by periodically swapping processes out from execution. This means that time is divided more fairly and that latency variance is lower.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="learning-from-falcon">Learning from Falcon</h2>

<p>
(added on Jan 9, 2021)
</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/socketry/falcon">Falcon</a> is a multi-process, multi-fiber HTTP server written in Ruby that is already utilizing async IO.</p>

<p>It has a great <a href="https://github.com/socketry/falcon-benchmark">set of benchmarks</a> that let us compare Falcon’s async IO with other non-async web servers like Passenger, Puma and Unicorn. Those benchmarks have been showing that <strong>async IO-powered server like Falcon</strong> provides better latencies on web requests.</p>

<p>Interestingly, that’s a very different story than Python! Looking at Python, I’ve expected that the thread driven server should be more “balanced” but it turns out the opposite.</p>

<p>Falcon’s authors explain that the fiber scheduler naturally scales according to load much better than the worker pool implementation in Puma. When fibers are busy handling requests, they don’t call <code>accept</code> so the requests are naturally picked up by other workers who are less busy.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-that-mean-for-us-ruby-developers">What does that mean for us Ruby developers?</h3>

<p>Scheduling threads and fibers is nuanced, and you can see that similar approaches demonstrate different results on Python and Ruby/Falcon examples.</p>

<p>In the first revision of this post, I’ve argued that async IO may often increase the latency. Thanks to the data <a href="https://github.com/socketry/falcon-benchmark">shown</a> by Samuel Williams, we can see that’s not the case.</p>

<p>One of the benefits of async IO is that concurrency is archived by the <code>yield</code>/<code>await</code> instruction, not by the constant interrupt of threads. Every interrupt causes the context switch - and it’s nice to reduce context switching where we can because scheduler switching from one task to another always adds a little overhead. Since that happens thousands of times every second, <strong>less context switching would mean fewer CPU cycles wasted</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="where-does-ractor-fit-in">Where does Ractor fit in?</h2>

<p>The Ractor pattern allows parallel execution (which wasn’t possible in Ruby before) of more than one Ruby thread by limiting the shared state of a block of code that you want to execute in parallel. Those “blocks of code” (aka “actors”) can also talk to each other through messages. This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">Actor model</a> used in other languages.</p>

<p>There are two ways we could leverage Ractors for modern apps: from the top (wrap every worker into a Ractor) and from the bottom (selectively use Ractors within existing code to parallelize CPU-intensive work).</p>

<p>While I see more to be gained from the top way, it seems like there’s so much shared and mutable state in Ruby libraries that it’s going to be quite tricky, although not impossible. It will likely take some efforts and at least a year of work from the community to push libraries towards less shared state. For the next year, we’ll mostly see Ractor maturing and getting adopted in the “bottom” use cases.</p>

<h2 id="impact-on-the-ruby-ecosystem">Impact on the Ruby ecosystem</h2>

<p><strong>By itself, async IO will help to use CPU more efficiently by reducing context switching.</strong></p>

<p>Better support for async IO in Ruby 3.0 will increase community’s adoption of async web servers like Falcon, and will hopefully give birth to async background job systems.</p>

<p>Having Sidekiq execute jobs concurrently through the async IO and event loop instead of threads could increase the throughput and save CPU work, especially for IO-bound workloads like webhook delivery.</p>

<p><strong>We’ll need to push the Ruby ecosystem to have less shared state to fully leverage the Ractor pattern.</strong> That will take us some time.</p>

<p>If you’ve enjoyed reading this, I highly recommend to read <em><a href="http://wjwh.eu/posts/2020-12-28-ruby-fiber-scheduler-c-extension.html" target="\_blank">Ruby 3.0 and the new FiberScheduler interface</a></em> by Wander Hillen.</p>

<p>Thanks to Samiel Williams and to Julik Tarkhanov for providing early feedback on this post.</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this in the comments!</p>

						<p><a href="https://0fps.wordpress.com/2012/07/10/smooth-voxel-terrain-part-1/">Last time</a> we formulated the problem of isosurface extraction and discussed some general approaches at a high level.&nbsp; Today, we’re going to get very specific and look at meshing in particular.</p>
<p>For the sake of concreteness, let us suppose that we have approximated our potential field <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" title="f"> by sampling it onto a cubical grid at some fixed resolution.&nbsp; To get intermediate values, we’ll just interpolate between grid points using the standard <a href="http://paulbourke.net/miscellaneous/interpolation/">trilinear interpolation</a>.&nbsp; This is like a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C%5E0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="C^0" title="C^0"> generalization of Minecraft-style voxel surfaces.&nbsp; Our goal in this article is to figure out how to extract a mesh of the implicit surface (or zero-crossings of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" title="f">).&nbsp; In particular, we’re going to look at three different approaches to this problem:</p>
<h2>Marching Cubes</h2>
<p>By far the most famous method for extracting isosurfaces is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_cubes">marching cubes</a> algorithm. &nbsp;In fact, it is so popular that the term `marching cubes’ is even more popular than the term `isosurface’ (at least according to Google)!&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s quite a feat when an algorithm becomes more popular than the problem which it solves!&nbsp; The history behind this method is very interesting.&nbsp; It was originally <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=37422">published back in SIGGRAPH 87</a>, and then summarily patented by the Lorensen and Cline. &nbsp;This fact has caused a lot of outrage, and is been widely cited as one of the classic examples of patents hampering innovation.&nbsp; Fortunately, the patent on marching cubes expired back in 2005 and so today you can freely use this algorithm in the US with no fear of litigation.</p>
<p>Much of the popularity of marching cubes today is due in no small part to a famous article written by <a href="http://paulbourke.net/">Paul Bourke</a>. &nbsp;Back in 1994 he made a webpage called <a href="http://paulbourke.net/geometry/polygonise/">“Polygonizing a Scalar Field”</a>, which presented a short, self-contained reference implementation of marching cubes (derived from some earlier work by Cory Gene Bloyd.)&nbsp; That tiny snippet of a C program is possibly <strong><em>the most copy-pasted code of&nbsp;<span>all time</span></em></strong>. &nbsp;I have seen some variation of Bloyd/Bourke’s code in <strong>every</strong> implementation of marching cubes that I’ve ever looked at, without exception.&nbsp; There are at least a couple of reasons for this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Paul Bourke’s exposition is really good. &nbsp;Even today, with many articles and tutorials written on the technique, none of them seem to explain it quite as well.&nbsp; (And I don’t have any delusions that I will do any better!)</li>
<li>Also their implementation is very small and fast. &nbsp;It uses some clever tricks like a precalculated edge table to speed up vertex generation.&nbsp; It is difficult to think of any non-trivial way to improve upon it.</li>
<li>Finally, marching cubes is incredibly difficult to code from scratch.</li>
</ol>
<p>This last point needs some explaining, &nbsp;Conceptually, marching cubes is rather simple. &nbsp;What it does is sample the implicit function along a grid, and then checks the sign of the potential function at each point (either +/-). &nbsp;Then, for every edge of the cube with a sign change, it finds the point where this edge intersects the volume and adds a vertex (this is just like ray casting a bunch of tiny little segments between each pair of grid points).&nbsp; The hard part is figuring out how to stitch some surface between these intersection points.&nbsp; Up to the position of the zero crossings, there are&nbsp;<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E8+%3D+256&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^8 = 256" title="2^8 = 256"> different possibilities, each of which is determined by the sign of the function at the 8 vertices of the cube:</p>

<p>Some of the marching cubes special cases. &nbsp;(c) Wikipedia, created by Jean-Marie Favreau.</p>
<p>Even worse, some of these cases are ambiguous!&nbsp; The only way to resolve this is to somewhat arbitrarily break the symmetry of the table based on a case-by-case analysis. What a mess!&nbsp; Fortunately, if you just download Bloyd/Bourke’s code, then you don’t have to worry about any of this and everything will just work. &nbsp;No wonder it gets used so much!</p>
<h2>Marching Tetrahedra</h2>
<p>Both the importance of isosurface extraction and the perceived shortcomings of marching cubes motivated the search for alternatives. &nbsp;One of the most popular was the <a href="http://search.ieice.org/bin/summary.php?id=e74-d_1_214">marching tetrahedra</a>, introduced by Doi and Koide.&nbsp; Besides the historical advantage that marching tetrahedra was not patented, it does have a few technical benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>Marching tetrahedra does not have ambiguous topology, unlike marching cubes.&nbsp; As a result, surfaces produced by marching tetrahedra are always manifold.</li>
<li>The amount of geometry generated per tetrahedra is much smaller, which might make it more suitable for use in say a geometry shader.</li>
<li>Finally, marching tetrahedra has only <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E4+%3D+16&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^4 = 16" title="2^4 = 16"> cases, a number which can be further reduced to just 3 special cases by symmetry considerations. &nbsp;This is enough that you can work them out by hand.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Exercise:&nbsp; </strong>Try working out the cases for marching tetrahedra yourself. &nbsp;(It is really not bad.)</p>
<p>The general idea behind marching tetrahedra is the same as marching cubes, only it uses a tetrahedral subdivision. &nbsp;Again, the standard reference for practical implementation is Paul Bourke (<a href="http://local.wasp.uwa.edu.au/~pbourke/geometry/polygonise/">same page as before</a>, just scroll down a bit.) &nbsp;While there is a lot to like about marching tetrahedra, it does have some draw backs. &nbsp;In particular, the meshes you get from marching tetrahedra are typically about 4x larger than marching cubes. &nbsp;This makes both the algorithm and rendering about 4x slower. &nbsp;If your main consideration is performance, you may be better off using a cubical method. &nbsp;On the other hand, if you really need a manifold mesh, then marching tetrahedra could be a good option. &nbsp;The other nice thing is that if you are obstinate and like to code everything yourself, then marching tetrahedra may be easier since there aren’t too many cases to check.</p>
<h2>The Primal/Dual Classification</h2>
<p>By now, both marching cubes and tetrahedra are quite old. &nbsp;However, research into isosurface extraction hardly stopped in the 1980s.&nbsp; In the intervening years, many new techniques have been developed. &nbsp;One general class of methods which has proven very effective are the so-called `dual’ schemes. &nbsp;The first dual method, surface nets, was proposed by Sarah Frisken Gibson in 1999:</p>
<p>S.F. Gibson, (1999) “<a href="http://www.merl.com/papers/docs/TR99-24.pdf" target="_blank">Constrained Elastic Surface Nets</a>”&nbsp; Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs, Technical Report.</p>
<p>The main distinction between dual and primal methods (like marching cubes) is the way they generate surface topology.&nbsp; In both algorithms, we start with the same input: a volumetric mesh determined by our samples, which I shall take the liberty of calling a&nbsp;<em>sample complex</em> for lack of a better term.&nbsp; If you’ve never heard of the word&nbsp;<a href="http://www.inperc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Cell_complex">cell complex</a>&nbsp;before, you can think of it as an n-dimensional generalization of a triangular mesh, where the `cells’ or facets don’t have to be simplices.</p>
<p>In the sample complex, vertices (or 0-cells) correspond to the sample points; edges (1-cells) correspond to pairs of nearby samples; faces (2-cells) bound edges and so on:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="534" data-permalink="https://0fps.net/2012/07/12/smooth-voxel-terrain-part-2/samplecomplex/" data-orig-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/samplecomplex.png" data-orig-size="533,419" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="samplecomplex" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/samplecomplex.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/samplecomplex.png?w=533" title="samplecomplex" alt="" src="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/samplecomplex.png?w=300&amp;h=235" height="235" width="300" srcset="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/samplecomplex.png?w=300&amp;h=235 300w, https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/samplecomplex.png?w=150&amp;h=118 150w, https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/samplecomplex.png 533w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>Here is an illustration of such a complex. &nbsp;I’ve drawn the vertices where the potential function is negative black, and the ones where it is positive white.</p>
<p>Both primal and dual methods walk over the sample complex, looking for those cells which cross the 0-level of the potential function. &nbsp;In the above illustration, this would include the following faces:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="535" data-permalink="https://0fps.net/2012/07/12/smooth-voxel-terrain-part-2/boundarycells/" data-orig-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/boundarycells.png" data-orig-size="533,419" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="boundarycells" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/boundarycells.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/boundarycells.png?w=533" title="boundarycells" alt="" src="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/boundarycells.png?w=300&amp;h=235" height="235" width="300" srcset="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/boundarycells.png?w=300&amp;h=235 300w, https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/boundarycells.png?w=150&amp;h=118 150w, https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/boundarycells.png 533w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<h3>Primal Methods</h3>
<p>Primal methods, like marching cubes, try to turn the cells crossing the bounary into an isosurface using the following recipe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edges crossing the boundary become vertices in the isosurface mesh.</li>
<li>Faces crossing the boundary become edges in the isosurface mesh.</li>
<li>…</li>
<li>n-cells crossing the boundary become (n-1)-cells in the isosurface mesh.</li>
</ul>
<p>One way to construct a primal mesh for our sample complex would be the following:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="536" data-permalink="https://0fps.net/2012/07/12/smooth-voxel-terrain-part-2/primalcomplex/" data-orig-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcomplex.png" data-orig-size="533,424" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="primalcomplex" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcomplex.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcomplex.png?w=533" title="primalcomplex" alt="" src="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcomplex.png?w=300&amp;h=238" height="238" width="300" srcset="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcomplex.png?w=300&amp;h=238 300w, https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcomplex.png?w=150&amp;h=119 150w, https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcomplex.png 533w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>This is pretty nice because it is easy to find intersection points along edges. &nbsp;Of course, there is some topological ambiguity in this construction.&nbsp; For non-simplicial cells crossing the boundary it is not always clear how you would glue the cells together:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="537" data-permalink="https://0fps.net/2012/07/12/smooth-voxel-terrain-part-2/primalcell/" data-orig-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcell.png" data-orig-size="929,198" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="primalcell" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcell.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcell.png?w=640" title="primalcell" alt="" src="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcell.png?w=300&amp;h=63" height="63" width="300" srcset="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcell.png?w=296&amp;h=63 296w, https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcell.png?w=591&amp;h=126 591w, https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcell.png?w=150&amp;h=32 150w, https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcell.png?w=300&amp;h=64 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>As we have seen, these ambiguities lead to exponentially many special cases, and are generally a huge pain to deal with.</p>
<h3>Dual Methods</h3>
<p>Dual methods on the other hand use a very different topology for the surface mesh.&nbsp; Like primal methods, they only consider the cells which intersect the boundary, but the rule they use to construct surface cells is very different:</p>
<ul>
<li>For every edge crossing the boundary, create an (n-1) cell.&nbsp; (Face in 3D)</li>
<li>For every face crossing the boundary, create an (n-2) cell. (Edge in 3D)</li>
<li>…</li>
<li>For every d-dimensional cell, create an (n-d) cell.</li>
<li>…</li>
<li>For every n-cell, create a vertex.</li>
</ul>
<p>This creates a much simpler topological structure:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="538" data-permalink="https://0fps.net/2012/07/12/smooth-voxel-terrain-part-2/dualcomplex/" data-orig-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dualcomplex.png" data-orig-size="537,419" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="dualcomplex" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dualcomplex.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dualcomplex.png?w=537" title="dualcomplex" alt="" src="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dualcomplex.png?w=300&amp;h=234" height="234" width="300" srcset="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dualcomplex.png?w=300&amp;h=234 300w, https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dualcomplex.png?w=150&amp;h=117 150w, https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dualcomplex.png 537w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>The nice thing about this construction is that unlike primal methods, the topology of the dual isosurface mesh is completely determined by the sample complex (so there are no ambiguities).&nbsp; The disadvantage is that you may sometimes get non-manifold vertices:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="465" data-permalink="https://0fps.net/2012/07/12/smooth-voxel-terrain-part-2/dualmesh/" data-orig-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dualmesh.png" data-orig-size="589,245" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="dualmesh" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dualmesh.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dualmesh.png?w=589" title="dualmesh" alt="" src="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dualmesh.png?w=300&amp;h=124" height="124" width="300" srcset="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dualmesh.png?w=298&amp;h=124 298w, https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dualmesh.png?w=150&amp;h=62 150w, https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dualmesh.png 589w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<h2>Make Your Own Dual Scheme</h2>
<p>To create your own dual method, you just have to specify two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>A sample complex.</li>
<li>And a rule to assign vertices to every n-cell intersecting the boundary.</li>
</ol>
<p>The second item is the tricky part, and much of the research into dual methods has focused on exploring the possibilities. &nbsp;It is interesting to note that this is the opposite of primal methods, where finding vertices was pretty easy, but gluing them together consistently turned out to be quite hard.</p>
<h3>Surface Nets</h3>
<p>Here’s a neat puzzle: what happens if we apply the dual recipe to a regular, cubical grid&nbsp;(like we did in marching cubes)? &nbsp;Well, it turns out that you get the same boxy, cubical meshes that you’d make in a Minecraft game (topologically speaking)!</p>
<p><a href="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/exampledualmesh.png"><img title="exampledualmesh" alt="" src="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/exampledualmesh.png?w=150&amp;h=145" height="145" width="150"></a><a href="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/spheresmoothed.png"><img title="spheresmoothed" alt="" src="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/spheresmoothed.png?w=150&amp;h=138" height="138" width="150"></a></p>
<p>Left: A dual mesh with vertex positions snapped to integer coordinates.&nbsp; Right: A dual mesh with smoothed vertex positions.</p>
<p>So if you know how to <a href="https://0fps.wordpress.com/2012/06/30/meshing-in-a-minecraft-game/">generate Minecraft meshes</a>, then you already know how to make smooth shapes! &nbsp;All you have to do is squish your vertices down onto the isosurface somehow. &nbsp;How cool is that?</p>
<p>This technique is called “surface nets” (remember when we mentioned them before?) &nbsp;Of course the trick is to figure out where you place the vertices. &nbsp;In Gibson’s original paper, she formulated the process of vertex …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This week Europol launched an innovative decryption platform, developed in close cooperation with the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/departments/joint-research-centre_en" target="_blank">European Commission's Joint Research Centre</a>. It will significantly increase Europol’s capability to decrypt information lawfully obtained in criminal investigations.</p>
<p>The launch of the new decryption platform marks a milestone in the fight against organised crime and terrorism in Europe. In full respect of fundamental rights and without limiting or weakening encryption, this initiative will be available to national law enforcement authorities of all Member States to help keep societies and citizens safe and secure. A virtual inauguration ceremony brought together senior representatives from Europol, the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en" target="_blank">European Parliament</a>, the <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/" target="_blank">Council of the EU</a> and the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/index_en" target="_blank">Commission</a>.</p>
<p>The event highlighted strong organisational cooperation within the EU and the considerable potential in innovation, research and development of the EU innovation hub for internal security.</p>
<p><strong>Ylva Johansson, EU Commissioner for Home Affairs</strong> said:</p>
<blockquote><p>This decryption platform will help police to investigate terrorism and serious and organised criminality. It will be important in the fight against online child sexual abuse. National police forces can now send lawfully obtained evidence to Europol for decryption.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Addressing the event, <strong>Europol’s Executive Director Catherine De Bolle</strong> said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today marks the end of a three-year-long journey. We have made a significant step forward in combating the criminal abuse of encryption with the aim of keeping our society and citizens safe while fully respecting fundamental rights. The new Europol Decryption Platform, funded by the European Commission, will allow us to further enhance our support for Member State investigations. This is the result of successful inter-organisational collaboration within the EU and shows the potential for further joint work and support for the EU innovation hub for internal security. I would like to express my gratitude to the Joint Research Centre for their strong partnership in this project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Europol’s <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/about-europol/european-cybercrime-centre-ec3">European Cybercrime Centre (EC3)</a> will operate the platform and leverage its in-house expertise in providing the most effective support to national Member State investigations.<br>
EC3 is dedicated to strengthening the law enforcement response to cybercrime in the EU and focuses on cybercrime committed by organised crime groups, which generate large profits (online fraud), seriously harm victims (online child sexual exploitation) or impact critical infrastructure and information systems in the EU, including through cyber-attacks.</p>
<hr><p>Headquartered in The Hague, the Netherlands, Europol supports the 27 EU Member States in their fight against terrorism, cybercrime and other serious and organised forms of crime. We also work with many non-EU partner states and international organisations. From its various threat assessments to its intelligence-gathering and operational activities, Europol has the tools and resources it needs to do its part in making Europe safer.</p>

<div><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>thought experiment: twitter has a dialog box that you have to fill out one day next year. if you press yes, trump and every interaction with him is irrevocably filtered from your feed. no, and they aren’t. </p><p>what do you press?</p></div>— (wannabe) Ƀreaker of (the Bad) Loops (@generativist) <a href="https://twitter.com/generativist/status/1326739583699095553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 12, 2020</a></blockquote></div><p>Most answered in the affirmative. I would answer in the same way. No interaction with him – whether in favor or against – has ever been worth my time.<label for="sn-0"></label><span>I’ve never followed him but, FWIW, I have reply-guy’d in anger</span></p>
<p>That isn’t to say I want to simply ignore all references to him, period. That would be foolish. Not only was he the President of the United States, but he was a despotic megalomaniac. America is the country I call home, so it very much matters to me. Yelling “just ignore him” isn’t even a good solution for when two siblings fight in the back seat of your wood-paneled station wagon.</p>

<p>Yet, <strong>I am willing to rely on trusted mediation</strong>.</p>

<p>And, I have!</p>

<p>You probably have, too.</p>

<p>To a large degree, that is the generalized power and promise of social media.<label for="sn-1"></label><span>Of course, social media is not just also but is mostly an expressive medium. Thinking about it through a purely instrumental lens is an exercise of futility, at best.</span> “The real environment is altogether too big, too complex, and too fleeting for direct acquaintance.” We <em>require</em> indirect sources of information. Historically, such sources were bound by space and time. Technological progression slowly liberated us from both. Now, social media grants us the ability to select our intermediaries from what approaches the world’s entire population.<label for="sn-2"></label><span>The revolution wasn’t televised – it was topological. Or, something like that.</span> This power is truly incredible. We exist in a space our ancestors could only imagine through the magic of fiction.</p>

<p>However, with great power comes great potential fuckery.</p>
<p>Like ‘propaganda’, ‘manipulation’ currently has negative connotation. The more comfortable and consequently common word to reach for is “influence.” It amounts to the same thing though. When we say someone “influences” us, we mean we’ve escalated their permissions over our beliefs in some critical way. And as we extend trust, we constrict incredulity.</p>
<p>Ideally, this relationship isn’t paired with passivity. When someone’s expressions fail to match either our direct experience or our careful interrogation (or both), our trust in them <em>should</em> degrade. And, with degraded trust, our skepticism of what they have to say grows accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>This is an adaptive process.</strong> Human sociality affords distributed search and specialization. The titanic polymath who could deeply understand the entirety of human knowledge is a romanticized relic of a long departed past. Having the world’s information at your fingertips means that you can <em>enter</em> a mind-boggling large amount of the terrain at any given time. But, <em>you can’t explore it all</em>. Time still binds us individually. We need we.</p>
<p>This process becomes mal-adaptive in proportion to the degree that trust becomes a function of something <em>other</em> than our accumulated evaluations of what someone says.<label for="sn-3"></label><span>In political science literature, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_partisanship">negative partisanship</a> refers to one symptomatic manifestation of the syndrome.</span> As it does, the harms associated with the negative connotations of manipulation and propaganda manifest. We find both our emotions and beliefs manipulated in ways <em>at odds with what we would discover independently, given sufficient time and information.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://generativist.falsifiable.com/metaverse/dunbars-number-is-quadratic">On social media, this happens with fluid ease</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://dispatches.artifexdeus.com/donald-trump-is-hari-seldon-75bd789637d9">Trump leverages this form of attack relentlessly</a>. Enjoying (pathological) agenda setting power in both traditional media and as social media supernode,<label for="sn-4"></label><span>I believe <a href="https://generativist.falsifiable.com/metaverse/the-real-supernode-problem">supernodes on social media represent a problem in their own right</a>.</span> his ability and inclination to induce mal-adaptive contagion is unrivaled in recent times.</p>
<p>For these reasons, I think Facebook and Twitter banning Trump is, at face-value, reasonable. <a href="https://medium.com/@generativist/dear-jack-ban-donald-trump-7c57e86c8ed9#.ee2bsxwu9">I also thought it was the correct thing to do in 2016</a>. It’s an emergency scram button to shut down our the hypercritical reactor. Banning Trump broadly facilitates the discovery and expression of beliefs for all participants – online and elsewhere – save Trump. <strong>However, I don’t think it’s reasonable to pretend doing so represents a <em>good</em> solution.</strong> Instead, it’s merely the best one constrained to those that are easy and without admitting the possibility of better architectures.</p>
<h2 id="a-decent-proposal">A Decent Proposal</h2><p>Trump’s grip on culture and social media strangles both. But only the latter affords straight-forward technological interventions. Individual action has proven insufficient. There are a myriad of incentives (many of which are also pathological) that prevent people from using mutes and blocks. It is a collective action problem for which the collective has no binding means of consensus formation. The question posed by my tweet allows me to propose a minimally viable one: <em>ask the users</em>.</p>

<p>To be more specific, consider a candidate specification:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On <code>promptDate</code>, all users will be presented with a modal dialog asking them to make a <code>YES</code>/<code>NO</code> decision. If they answer <code>YES</code>, neither <code>@realdonaldtrump</code> nor any interaction with him gets placed in their feed. That is, twitter filters all of his tweets and replies from both your timeline feed and all user feeds (from the perspective of your account). If you answer <code>NO</code>, your subjective view does not change. The aggregate vote tallies are visible on each day up until <code>bindingDate</code>. You may change your vote any time until then. Afterwards, votes and resulting infrastructure changes are commited <em>and irrevocable for each particular account</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this solution would facilitate healthy conversation with effects that reverberated offline. Moreover, it does so in a way that expands the agency of twitter users, rather than unilateral restricts it.<label for="sn-5"></label><span>I’m only interested in twitter because I think it’s a far more important medium and because I think facebook and King Zuck are irredeemable.</span> However, neither hypothetical benefit motivates my reasoning.</p>
<h2 id="platform-balkanization">Platform Balkanization</h2><p>I’ve demanded the digital pound of metaphorical flesh many times. In the case of Donald Trump, I’d revel in it. That is to say, I understand viscerally the impulse towards participant expulsion, generally and in this particular.<label for="sn-6"></label><span>I no longer do, for a variety of reasons, many of which are in this post, but also <a href="https://twitter.com/generativist/status/1254475955478790144">at least in part because of interactions with twitter friends @sonyasupposedly and @aelkus</a>.</span> But Banning Trump is unique because it is possible that his move to, say Parler, <em>could</em> drive a mass exodus.<label for="sn-7"></label><span>I make no claims as to the odds.</span></p>

<p>The first order effects of such a potential outcome are delightful for many parties, including me. Twitter (and facebook), gets to discharge an asset-that-has-predictably-curdled-into-a-liability. There is a reason neither has acted until recently. And, Gab and Parler aren’t even competitors – they’re White knights. More importantly, those subject to durable social media abuses get genuine harm reduction. Dismissing that is just a smug variant on “fuck your feelings.”</p>

<p>But, reduction associated with displacing the shittiest participants of social media onto a new medium <em>could be an ephemeral mirage.</em> <strong>Out of sight, out of mind, <em>and into commercialized hate breeder reactors</em> may not be a good strategy</strong>. Thus, the risk I am more interested in at least injecting into the current frenetic conversation is platform balkanization.</p>
<p>Broadly, there are two hypotheses about what happens when these users get isolated on a new network partition (here, in the form of a different platform),</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Smothered fire</strong>: The echo-chamber becomes a circle jerk; participants get bored for lack of targets; raids on larger networks will occur sporadically but they can’t trigger the same dynamics; the medium fizzles out.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Coal-seam fire</strong>: The echo-chamber splits consensus reality in an enduring way; people with similar corrosive beliefs form an even more cohesive orthodoxy; the distance between them and people outside the partition grows; in-group trust pins on maximal, granting uncritical reception of escalatingly radical beliefs.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The smothered fire scenario is seductive. And, it may happen! But, increasingly, the coal seam fire seems…if not more likely, than at least the one that deserves way more focused consideration. 2016 and everything after wasn’t a wildly unlikely bad sample path. It was a continuation. We hid some things from ourselves before then; we want to do so yet again. While criticisms of social media are extremely valid – there is an impressive inventory of problems – blame assignment then and now has some convenience borne of desperation. But, there is at least one critical difference: Public passions and fiduciary responsibilities are currently aligned.</p>
<h2 id="freedom-of-speech-vs-reach">Freedom of Speech vs Reach</h2><p>Censorship is easy to defend against at low temperatures. It’s our cultural’s default stance. But at high social temperatures where norms diffusely lose stability, so does the strength of our convictions. It becomes easier to withdraw principled support when principles no longer broadly bind.</p>

<p>Things are very hot now.</p>

<p>I have neither the desire nor inclination to defend Donald Trump on free speech grounds. I think people who do so are fools – those who do so in deference to a principle and with precisely zero context, doubly so.</p>

<p>I also think people who pretend it isn’t censorship – that it is a question of reach, rather than speech – miss the point in similar ways. Yes, Twitter is a private company. It has every legal right<label for="sn-8"></label><span>Section 230 questions aside.</span> to ban anyone, and especially someone as malignant as Trump. But, I treat it as something more important than that – I treat it as a public commons in hyper-space. Celebrating the corporate entities ability to unilateral tear up a large portion of the social graph makes the contrast obvious. In it, I find myself in a curious position: imploring Lord Jack to consider better …</p></section></div>

      <p>It seems like every few months, someone publishes a machine learning paper or demo that makes my jaw drop. This month, it’s OpenAI’s new image-generating model, <a href="https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/">DALL·E</a>.</p>

<p>This behemoth 12-billion-parameter neural network takes a text caption (i.e. “an armchair in the shape of an avocado”) and generates images to match it:</p>

<p><img src="https://daleonai.com/images/screen-shot-2021-01-06-at-1.37.37-pm.png" alt="Generated images of avocado chairs" title="Generated images of avocado chairs"></p>

<p><em>From https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/.</em></p>

<p>I think its pictures are pretty inspiring (I’d buy one of those avocado chairs), but what’s even more impressive is DALL·E’s ability to understand and render concepts of space, time, and even logic (more on that in a second).</p>

<p>In this post, I’ll give you a quick overview of what DALL·E can do, how it works, how it fits in with recent trends in ML, and why it’s significant. Away we go!</p>

<h2 id="what-is-dalle-and-what-can-it-do">What is DALL·E and what can it do?</h2>

<p>In July, DALL·E’s creator, the company OpenAI, released a similarly huge model called GPT-3 that wowed the world with <a href="https://daleonai.com/gpt3-explained-fast">its ability to generate human-like text</a>, including Op Eds, poems, sonnets, and even computer code. DALL·E is a natural extension of GPT-3 that parses text prompts and then responds not with words but in pictures. In one example from OpenAI’s blog, for example, the model renders images from the prompt “a living room with two white armchairs and a painting of the collosseum. the painting is mounted above a modern fireplace”:</p>

<p><img src="https://daleonai.com/images/screen-shot-2021-01-06-at-2.39.07-pm.png" alt="DALLE generated images" title="DALLE generated images"></p>

<p><em>From https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/.</em></p>

<p>Pretty slick, right? You can probably already see how this might be useful for designers. Notice that DALL·E can generate a large set of images from a prompt. The pictures are then ranked by a second OpenAI model, called <a href="https://openai.com/blog/clip/">CLIP</a>, that tries to determine which pictures match best.</p>

<h2 id="how-was-dalle-built">How was DALL·E built?</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, we don’t have a ton of details on this yet because OpenAI has yet to publish a full paper. But at its core, DALL·E uses the same new neural network architecture that’s responsible for tons of recent advances in ML: the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">Transformer</a>. Transformers, discovered in 2017, are an easy-to-parallelize type of neural network that can be scaled up and trained on huge datasets. They’ve been particularly revolutionary in natural language processing (they’re the basis of models like BERT, T5, GPT-3, and others), improving the quality of <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/search-language-understanding-bert/">Google Search</a> results, translation, and even in <a href="https://daleonai.com/how-alphafold-works">predicting the structures of proteins</a>.</p>

<p>Most of these big language models are trained on enormous text datasets (like all of Wikipedia or <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/"></a><a href="https://commoncrawl.org/">crawls of the web</a>). What makes DALL·E unique, though, is that it was trained on sequences that were a combination of words and pixels. We don’t yet know what the dataset was (it probably contained images and captions), but I can guarantee you it was probably massive.</p>

<h2 id="how-smart-is-dalle">How “smart” is DALL·E?</h2>

<p>While these results are impressive, whenever we train a model on a huge dataset, the skeptical machine learning engineer is right to ask whether the results are merely high-quality because they’ve been copied or memorized from the source material.</p>

<p>To prove DALL·E isn’t just regurgitating images, the OpenAI authors forced it to render some pretty unusual prompts:</p>

<p>“a professional high quality illustration of a giraffe turtle chimera.”</p>

<p><img src="https://daleonai.com/images/screen-shot-2021-01-06-at-1.39.04-pm.png" alt=""></p>

<p><em>From https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/.</em></p>

<p>“a snail made of a harp.”</p>

<p><img src="https://daleonai.com/images/screen-shot-2021-01-06-at-1.39.12-pm.png" alt=""></p>

<p><em>From https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/.</em></p>

<p>It’s hard to imagine the model came across many giraffe-turtle hybrids in its training data set, making the results more impressive.</p>

<p>What’s more, these weird prompts hint at something even more fascinating about DALL·E: its ability to perform “zero-shot visual reasoning.”</p>

<h2 id="zero-shot-visual-reasoning">Zero-Shot Visual Reasoning</h2>

<p>Typically in machine learning, we train models by giving them thousands or millions of examples of tasks we want them to preform and hope they pick up on the pattern.</p>

<p>To train a model that identifies dog breeds, for example, we might show a neural network thousands of pictures of dogs labeled by breed and then test its ability to tag new pictures of dogs. It’s a task with limited scope that seems almost quaint compared to OpenAI’s latest feats.</p>

<p>Zero-shot learning, on the other hand, is the ability of models to perform tasks that they weren’t specifically trained to do. For example, DALL·E was trained to generate images from captions. But with the right text prompt, it can also transform images into sketches:</p>

<p><img src="https://daleonai.com/images/screen-shot-2021-01-06-at-1.41.02-pm.png" alt=""></p>

<p><em>Results from the prompt, “the exact same cat on the top as a sketch on the bottom”. From https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/</em></p>

<p>DALL·E can also render custom text on street signs:</p>

<p><img src="https://daleonai.com/images/screen-shot-2021-01-06-at-2.51.53-pm.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Results from the prompt <em>“a store front that has the word ‘openai’ written on it’”. From https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/.</em></p>

<p>In this way, DALL·E can act almost like a Photoshop filter, even though it wasn’t specifically designed to behave this way.</p>

<p>The model even shows an “understanding” of visual concepts (i.e. “macroscopic” or “cross-section” pictures), places (i.e. “a photo of the food of china”), and time (“a photo of alamo square, san francisco, from a street at night”; “a photo of a phone from the 20s”). For example, here’s what it spit out in response to the prompt “a photo of the food of china”:</p>

<p><img src="https://daleonai.com/images/screen-shot-2021-01-06-at-1.42.22-pm.png" alt=""></p>

<p><em>“a photo of the food of china” from https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/.</em></p>

<p>In other words, DALL·E can do more than just paint a pretty picture for a caption; it can also, in a sense, answer questions visually.</p>

<p>To test DALL·E’s visual reasoning ability, the authors had it take a visual IQ test. In the examples below, the model had to complete the lower right corner of the grid, following the test’s hidden pattern.</p>

<p><img src="https://daleonai.com/images/screen-shot-2021-01-07-at-1.22.26-pm.png" alt=""></p>

<p><em>A screenshot of the visual IQ test OpenAI used to test DALL·E</em> <em>from https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/.</em></p>

<p>“DALL·E is often able to solve matrices that involve continuing simple patterns or basic geometric reasoning,” write the authors, but it did better at some problems than others. When the puzzles’s colors were inverted, DALL·E did worse–“suggesting its capabilities may be brittle in unexpected ways.”</p>

<h2 id="what-does-it-mean">What does it mean?</h2>

<p>What strikes me the most about DALL·E is its ability to perform surprisingly well on so many different tasks, ones the authors didn’t even anticipate:</p>

<p>“We find that DALL·E […] is able to perform several kinds of image-to-image translation tasks when prompted in the right&nbsp;way.</p>

<p>We did not anticipate that this capability would emerge, and made no modifications to the neural network or training procedure to encourage it.”</p>

<p>It’s amazing, but not wholly unexpected; DALL·E and GPT-3 are two examples of a greater theme in deep learning: that extraordinarily big neural networks trained on unlabeled internet data (an example of “self-supervised learning”) can be highly versatile, able to do lots of things weren’t specifically designed for.</p>

<p>Of course, don’t mistake this for general intelligence. It’s <a href="https://lacker.io/ai/2020/07/06/giving-gpt-3-a-turing-test.html">not hard</a> to trick these types of models into looking pretty dumb. We’ll know more when they’re openly accessible and we can start playing around with them. But that doesn’t mean I can’t be excited in the meantime.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><div><p><em>This is a guest post authored by <a href="https://jacobian.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jacob Kaplan-Moss</a>, co-creator of Django.</em></p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I’ve spent a good deal of my career with my feet in two different worlds. I came up as a web developer and helped create a popular web framework (Django). And I’ve spent a sizable chunk of my career working in information security.
Unfortunately, I’ve seen these two roles clash far too often. Engineering often sees Security as standing in the way of delivery, or as creating meaningless busywork. Security thinks Engineering is irresponsible, willing to ship broken or vulnerable code.</p>
<p>I’ve spent more than a decade trying to bridge this gap. There’s no silver bullet. But, over and over, I’ve seen one practice be quite effective: automated security tests — and particularly integrating security checks and tests into an existing CI pipeline.</p>
<h3>Bringing Security along on the CI/CD journey</h3>
<p>Engineers have largely embraced CI as a critical part of quality assurance, and that a robust test suite that runs on every commit is a huge enabler of velocity. We can be bold about making changes, knowing that the test suite will catch us if we’ve messed up. A mature CI/CD pipeline is a reliable litmus test for good software.</p>
<p>Historically, though, Security has been left out of this CI/CD journey. We’ve relied on manual security assessments; hands-on exercises like threat modelling and threat hunting; and bespoke penetration tests. These are important activities that will always have a place in a mature product security lifecycle, but they increasingly are difficult to integrate into an agile delivery model that relies on incremental changes and automated tests. Much of the friction between modern engineering and security teams can come down to this impedance mismatch.</p>
<p>So, to get Security and Engineering playing well together, one massively useful tool is getting security work integrated into continuous delivery. When done right, Security and Engineering work together to produce automated checks that cover security issues in the same test suite that’s already in CI. This maintains delivery cadence, gives confidence about the security of the product, and — most importantly — gives a place where Security and Engineering collaborate, rather than conflict, to produce secure code.</p>
<p>How does this look in practice? Each organization is different, but there’s a typical progression of maturity that Security and Engineering orgs go through as they build a continuous integration and automation pipeline:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 1: Security finds problems; Engineering fixes them</li>
<li>Level 2: Security and Engineering collaborate to produce test cases and remediations</li>
<li>Level 3: After the issue is fixed, Security and Engineering collaborate to find systemic fixes and develop checks</li>
<li>Level 4: Security and Engineering now also proactively look for new classes of issues and create systemic checks before an actual problem occurs</li>
</ul>
<p>For the rest of this post, I’ll walk through each of these phases with a specific example about a team that systemically fixed an issue with logging sensitive tokens.</p>
<h3>Level 1: Security finds problems; Engineering fixes them</h3>
<p>This is (unfortunately) how many organizations operate. Nobody really works together: Security is off in one corner looking for vulnerabilities (or, worse, waiting for a breach and then responding!). When they find one, they tell Engineering, who (hopefully) fixes the problem.</p>
<p>Let’s begin the example and see how this could shake out in practice. A few months ago, Nathan Brahams <a href="https://r2c.dev/blog/2020/fixing-leaky-logs-how-to-find-a-bug-and-ensure-it-never-returns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote about systemically fixing an issue around accidentally logging sensitive tokens</a>. His article illustrates the steps a quite mature security/engineering organization would take, but I’ll use this issue as a jumping-off-point to imagine how teams earlier in their journey might approach discovering a similar issue.</p>
<p>So, imagine a budding team has found this security issue: SQLAlchemy debug logging is turned on and sensitive tokens are being logged. The issue is fixed with a clever technique that uses a custom <code>ObfuscatedString</code> column that prevents SQLAlchemy from logging the token's value. So, we just swap in <code>ObfuscatedString</code> for the token column. Problem solved, right?</p>
<p>Well, while this does fix the issue, it has many problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Verification</strong>: If Engineering just rolls out this fix, how do we verify that the issue is actually fixed? Usually at this level of maturity, the Security team will manually verify the fix, but that’s error-prone. It’s also slow; if the fix didn’t work or is incomplete, the cycle has to repeat itself.</li>
<li><strong>Regression</strong>: If another engineer, some time later, doesn’t understand this <code>ObfuscatedString</code>, it could get reverted or modified in a way that re-introduces the issue. How would we know if this happens? (Spoiler alert: with an automated test, which we’ll discuss in the next section.)</li>
<li>Is this a one-off issue, or <strong>is it a systemic issue</strong>? Are there other sensitive values elsewhere that might be logged?</li>
<li><strong>Conflict</strong>: Most importantly, this workflow sets up conditions ripe for conflict between Security and Engineering. It creates a dynamic where it’s easy for Engineering to feel like Security’s just creating work for them, and where Security can feel ignored or powerless to fix problems. I’ve never seen this model produce a really healthy relationship; just ones with varying levels of dysfunction. Even when Security helps write the fix, the lack of any sort of robust verification or systemic analysis means it’s very likely they’ll need to come back later with this issue or a similar one again, which both parties will resent.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Level 2: automated tests</h3>
<p>The next rung on the maturity ladder is one that’s becoming increasingly common: instead of just fixing a security issue, Security and Engineering will collaborate on producing a test case (and often the fix). Following along with the example above, we might write a test case that sets up a test model with an <code>ObfuscatedString</code> column, captures some logs, and verifies that the value is correctly obfuscated.</p>
<p>This relatively simple addition fixes a bunch of problems we had before:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Verification</strong>: If the test case passes, we can be confident the security issue is fixed.</li>
<li><strong>Regression</strong>: Because this test case is part of our test suite, if it ever regresses the test case will fail, and we won’t risk re-introducing it to production.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration</strong>: Security and Engineering are now working more closely together, increasing the chances both teams will see this as “our issue” and “our fix”, not “their problem”.</li>
</ul>
<p>But: we still lack any sort of understanding of whether this issue occurs elsewhere, or any sort of holistic fix for the entire class of issues. In the case of logging sensitive tokens, it’s easy to imagine this issue occurring elsewhere. So when — inevitably — a similar issue occurs elsewhere, we’re likely to be bitten again. And this, in turn, will continue to produce the kind of resentment that can be so damaging to Security/Engineering working well together.</p>
<h3>Level 3: systemic fixes and checks</h3>
<p>The next step, then, is for Security and Engineering to work together to find systemic problems and fixes. Things start out as above — it’s important to fix the specific vulnerability first, before getting fancy! But after the specific fix is in, Security and Engineering come together to figure out if this is a systemic problem. If so, they work to develop a check or a fix.</p>
<p>Sometimes this can be a fairly simple holistic fix. For example, <a href="https://r2c.dev/blog/2020/understanding-and-preventing-dos-in-web-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I wrote about ReDoS last time</a>. Discovery of a ReDoS vulnerability might lead to discovering other similar potential problems. That in turn could lead to the decision to switch to <a href="https://github.com/google/re2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">re2</a>, which isn’t vulnerable to ReDoS.</p>
<p>But much of the time, the systemic fix is more complex — there isn’t a simple drop-in replacement that eliminates a class of vulnerabilities. That’s true of this sensitive-logging issue: we don’t have any sort of logging module that can magically know when variables are sensitive, and obfuscate them.</p>
<p>This is where code scanning tools like Semgrep come in. They are a terrifically important part of a mature product security workflow. Traditional testing practices — unit tests, integration tests, etc — are great for reproducing specific security issues, and ensuring that they’re fixed and won’t regress. But they struggle to discover whole classes of security issues, and this is what code scanners enable. Traditional code linters (e.g., Flake8, RuboCop) help to ensure code consistency and find some common issues, but since they have to apply generally to all kinds of projects, they tend to only provide a one-size-fits-all best-practices check. Tools that understand code semantically, like Semgrep, can be used to write tests for <em>your unique codebase</em> and find whole classes of security issues — including, most importantly, new instances of a problem that might be added after the check has been written.</p>
<p>And indeed, that’s what Nathan and his team did: they wrote a Semgrep rule that finds columns with names suggesting they’re sensitive (e.g., containing “token”, “secret”, “key”, etc), and issues a warning.</p>
<p>At this point, we’re in a pretty good spot. New code is continually scanned for this issue, and when found, they are fixed robustly. We have a workflow and tooling that ensures that the original, specific issue is fixed and that it stays fixed, and we ensure that similar issues — present and future — are discovered and fixed. Security and Engineering collaborate on this work, which is now well-automated. There’s still (of course) room for teams to not get along, but we’ve removed some of the most common pain points (verification, regression, conflict between teams).</p>
<p>If suddenly blocking builds with new checks will only increase conflict in your organization, you could softly roll out checks that do not block Engineering and only notify Security. For issues that arise, Security can begin conversations with Engineering to collaborate on both specific and systemic fixes. Once the check is satisfactory to both …</p></div></div></div></section></div>

<p>Four years ago, after the unthinkable happened and the wrong guy won the US election of 2016. <a href="https://easydns.com/blog/2017/02/24/the-cultural-purge-will-not-be-televised/">I wrote an article</a> about how I had feared a type of “cultural purge” from within the corporate media, Big Tech and cancel culture spheres. Like everybody else, I didn’t expect Trump to win (like most other Libertarians, I was holding my nose and pulling for Gary Johnson, whose running mate, Bill Weld, endorsed Hillary Clinton <em>during the election campaign).</em></p>
<p>What I expected then, after Trump would have unceremoniously lost the 2016 election,&nbsp; was a type of cultural purge against anybody and everybody who enabled his run or supported him. What surprised me was that after he won the cultural purge proceeded anyway. In retrospect it seems obvious, at the time it blindsided me.<span id="more-1501"></span></p>
<p>For the next four years we watched any (remaining) semblance of objectivity and impartiality wither away from the mainstream media. Even more troubling, was that it was also happening within<em>&nbsp;</em>Big Tech. Everything polarized and all judgement calls became characteristically asymmetrical. As I noted on occasion, that compared to the post 9/11 era when the Neocons controlled the narrative and the word “liberal” was a slur, everything flipped. Now it was the word “conservative” that was unusable and being a single micron to the right of centre was equated with being “literally Hitler”.</p>
<p>I could list the countless examples of deplatformings, cancellations, character assassinations and careers destroyed in the intervening time. It became so ridiculous, so devoid of any attempt at a claim to due process or fairness that an entire counter-culture has formed around criticizing or ridiculing it. <a href="https://easydns.com/blog/2019/10/22/unassailable-the-book-that-protects-you-from-cancel-culture-and-deplatform-attacks/">I wrote a book</a> about <a href="https://easydns.com/blog/2019/10/22/unassailable-the-book-that-protects-you-from-cancel-culture-and-deplatform-attacks/">defending from deplatform attacks</a>, which I started <a href="https://axisofeasy.com/aoe/the-missing-manual-for-defending-yourself-against-deplatforming-and-cancel-culture/">giving away for free</a> in April when Big Tech started deplatforming deviant reporting on the COVID-19 crisis. Babylon Bee sprang into existence and quickly rivalled The Onion, <a href="https://babylonbee.com/news/op-ed-anyone-who-claims-cancel-culture-is-real-is-a-bigot-who-should-lose-his-job">riffing on cancel culture</a> and hitting headwinds on multiple occasions when their scathing satire <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/twitter-apologizes-mistakenly-suspending-babylon-154401646.html">was indistinguishable from the reality</a> they were lampooning.</p>
<div id="attachment_1511"><p><a href="https://babylonbee.com/news/op-ed-anyone-who-claims-cancel-culture-is-real-is-a-bigot-who-should-lose-his-job"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1511" loading="lazy" src="https://outofthecave.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/oped-e1610129919714.png" alt="" width="800" height="745"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-1511">TL,DR: Cancel culture is a right-wing conspiracy promulgated by Qanon Incels</p></div>
<p>More than once I thought “This is it, this has to be Peak Outrage”, and then somebody else’s career or business would be destroyed, sometimes for imagined transgressions that may or may not have taken place years ago or even before the target even started a position they’d just been canceled from having (David Collum’s section on cancel culture, featuring his own cancelation, lays many of these out in his famous Year In Review series, <a href="https://www.peakprosperity.com/dave-collum-2020-year-in-review-part-2/#cancelculture">the 2020 issue</a>).</p>
<p>Once the 2020 election was finally in the rear-view mirror and it appeared likely the administration had changed I thought, once again, that the worst was over. The world was mired in lockdown fatigue, we’re not even dealing with the economic fallout of COVID yet, and “ding dong the witch is dead”. Surely cancel culture and social justice extremism would taper off, if only out of exhaustion.</p>

<h2>Boy am I wrong, again.</h2>
<p>The ignominy with which TheDonald has chosen to close out his term, the lack of humility, of which is he likely congenitally incapable of, will instead reignite the flames of the culture wars and propel them to new heights. As investing legend (and Fed critic) Bill Fleckinstein observed in his subscriber note yesterday, there is a right way and a wrong way to go out, even if you feel like you got shafted:</p>
<blockquote><p>On the subject of yesterday’s violence, although it is unlikely to have long-lasting economic impacts and thus is largely in the realm of politics, which I tend to avoid, I think there is a worthwhile lesson to point out. Obviously, Trump’s worst qualities, which stem from his being a petulant egomaniac, have been on display since he lost the election and I’m reminded of a very valuable lesson I learned from my investment business mentor, who told me that when you get fired by a client (yes, that happens), rather than be upset and act petulantly what you should say is, “How can I make the transition easier for you?”</p>
<p>In other words, you turn a loss into a bit of a victory by being a class act. I can’t tell you how many times over my investment career when that lesson and corollaries to it have been quite useful, and no matter what, trying to comport yourself in such a manner pays big dividends over time in my opinion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Like Fleck, I don’t even want to get into the gory details of the events of Jan 6, the storming of the capital, the riots, other than to say that when we talk about the twilight of the nation state and the rise of the Network State <a href="https://axisofeasy.com/salon">in our #AxisOfEasy podcasts,</a> these are the sort of disorderly episodes we fear punctuating or worse, defining, this oncoming societal shift.</p>
<p>We certainly seem to be <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/670089.The_Fourth_Turning">into The Fourth Turning now</a>, a book I have been rereading and was just finishing up listening to the day of the DC riots. Their prescience is creepy, especially as they outlined the “climax” phase of the Crisis period, which, by their reckoning started around… 2020 and would last another 6 to 10 years:</p>
<div>
<blockquote><p>One or both of today’s dominant parties could go the way of the Whigs…History warns that when a crisis catalyzes, a previously dominant political party or regime can find itself perceived or blamed for direct mistakes that led to the national emergency.</p>
<p>Whoever holds power when the Fourth Turning arrives could find themselves joining the ranks of the 14th century Lancastrians, circa 15th century Catholics, circa 1680 Stewarts, circa 1770 Tories, circa 1860 Democrats, and circa 1929 Republicans. That party could find itself out of power for a generation.</p>
<p>Key persons associated with it could find themselves defamed, stigmatized, harassed, economically ruined, or even personally punished”</p></blockquote>
<p>Since that day, Big Tech and corporate media moved at a new speed that I found dizzying. Twitter pile-ons are ugly enough spectacles and that’s just watching end-users gang up on the sacrificial deviant of the day. But <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218776/shopify-trump-store-disable-campaign-ecommerce-sites-capitol">watching&nbsp;<em>Shopify</em></a> of all companies, pile on to Facebook and Twitter’s deplatforming of a sitting president (which at this moment he is, like it or not), <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/07/media/josh-hawley-book-canceled/index.html">Simon and Schuster canceling their contract</a> to publish Sen Josh Hawley’s book <em>on Big Tech censorship</em> (which I wanted to read) and I’m sure the list will go on after I’m done writing, this is just fucking crazy.</p>
<p>(I paused writing this to take a meeting, an hour later I come back to finishing it off and a friend, who fled Chicago this past summer because of the complete breakdown of civil order there, among other US cities at that time, <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2021/1/7/22219360/trump-rally-capitol-tank-noodle-insight-studios-properties">sent me this story</a>. It outlines numerous other firings and cancelations of Chicagoans who attended the DC rally (but not necessarily involved in the violence), and businesses who even commented in social media about it.</p>

<h2><strong><em>Think it through people.</em> </strong></h2>
<p>Do you want to live in a society where Facebook and Twitter decide not only what is <em>permissible</em> to say but even <em>which narratives can be explored</em> and which ones can’t?</p>
<p>Yes I know, “private companies, their own AUP, blah blah blah” – I’m a libertarian and a tech company CEO, so I know all this. I’ll preempt these objections with what I said in my book, which is that when tech companies base platform/deplatform decisions on something that is happening&nbsp;<em>outside&nbsp;</em>of their platforms, they are in effect, exercising jurisprudence and adjudicating international law. All any company can competently assess is what is happening on within their respective platforms, how their employees are fulfilling their roles and serving the businesses customers <em>and nothing else.</em></p>
<p>Would you be ok with your employer firing you if enough strangers who don’t know you, don’t do business with your company and have no first hand knowledge of events or what your circumstances are scream at your boss to cut you loose?</p>
<p>Do you want contracts to be subject to negation by&nbsp; public sentiment of events 2 or 3 or more degrees separated from the contracted parties?</p>
<p>Do you want to have every aspect of your life scrutinized by somebody else’s measure of moral and ideological purity before you can say anything online? How about before you can book a hotel room? Fill up your car with gas? Go shopping? Get on a plane?</p>
<p>After all, we have big data and AI now, <em>so this is all doable.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Do you really want to live within the constraints of a type of societal social credit system where your every action, <em>your very thoughts</em> are bounded by external and ever shifting, subjective and <a href="https://outofthecave.io/articles/merriam-webster-modifies-word-definition-after-left-manufactures-offensive-meaning-for-it/">revisionist social mores</a>? Many of them defined by the most oversensitive, self-absorbed hysterics on social media?</p>
<p>Be very careful if you think this is a good thing, because sooner or later, you’re going to be on the wrong side of it. By then it’ll be too late.</p>

<p>Tether has become a plain old fiat central bank, issuing new USDTs against debt. USDTs are backed, but not by US dollars. They are backed by promises to make good on their debts by the receivers of newly minted USDTs.</p>



<p>While it’s not fraudulent per se, the fact that USDTs aren’t backed by US dollars opens the door to unlimited USDT printing. The gatekeepers are the people in charge of the Tether printing press. In an ideal world, they should ensure that proper reserve requirements are met and that the receivers of newly minted USDTs are properly capitalised.</p>



<p>However, Bitcoin’s exponential price rise, happening in lockstep with ever-increasing USDT issuance, shows that the Tether press has gone in overdrive. When the mania will end, crypto investors will lose everything, in a second.</p>



<h2>The Tetheral Reserve</h2>



<p>Long gone are the days when Tether claimed that USDTs were backed by cash. Its own website states:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.18.26.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.18.26.png 659w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.18.26-300x41.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 659px) 100vw, 659px"><figcaption>source: tether.to/legal</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s not necessarily a bad thing for the crypto ecosystem that Tether doesn’t have cash on hand to the amount of USDTs issued. First off, that would be a central point of failure. Tether the institution is currently under investigation, USDTs are used for money laundering, and having $20 billion in a bank account would expose you to having your assets frozen – as has <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitfinex-files-for-subpoena-in-bid-to-recover-880-million-in-frozen-funds">already happened in the past</a>.</p>



<p>It’s much more practical to have all your assets in loans to counterparties, from a solvency and operational point of view. The problem is, of course, that is exposes you to:</p>



<h3>Liquidity risk</h3>



<p>The role of USDTs is to replace US dollars in the crypto ecosystem. USDTs are much easier to transfer, because you don’t have to deal with a bank that will ask you all sorts of questions about the origins of the funds, the purpose of the transfer, and the identity of the receiver. In short, you don’t have to bother with AML (“anti money laundering”), KYC (“know your client”), and capital controls regulations. In shorter, USDTs empower you to launder money.</p>



<p>But as much as USDTs are more practical than US dollars, their usage requires convertibility. We live in the real world where nobody accepts USDTs as payment, and you need to be able to cash out your USDTs for real money. You can do this by buying Bitcoin with USDTs on an exchange that trades the BTC/USDT pair, wiring them to an exchange that trades the BTC/USD pair, and cash out. Or, if you are a big player, you can go to a crypto OTC desk and sell your USDTs directly for cash:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.33.42-1024x277.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.33.42-1024x277.png 1024w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.33.42-300x81.png 300w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.33.42-768x208.png 768w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.33.42.png 1038w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>source: https://www.coindesk.com/tether-usdt-russia-china-importers</figcaption></figure>



<p>This act of financial hot potato, where someone else buys your USDTs, works for as long as the crypto bull run goes on. However, you need a backstop for when things go south, namely, when people suddenly stop wanting to acquire USDTs, and want to cash out for real money. Then, someone has to redeem the USDTs for cash, and that someone should be the issuer: Tether.</p>



<p>If Tether doesn’t have enough cash on hand to process redemption requests, you have a good old liquidity crunch, when panic sets in, and people start dumping their USDT holdings en masse, for whatever price of thing they can get in exchange. Much like a real world financial crisis.</p>



<h3>USDT redemptions?</h3>



<p>Tether’s willingness to redeem USDTs for real money has been questioned over the last few years, not least because it seems that they’ve ever barely done it, as the number of USDTs outstanding never goes down:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.41.33.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.41.33.png 946w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.41.33-300x104.png 300w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.41.33-768x266.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 946px) 100vw, 946px"><figcaption>USDT market cap, source: coin360</figcaption></figure>



<p>Note that the dip in October 2018 was due to Tether loaning $850m to Bitfinex, not actual redemptions.</p>



<p>Other reasons to question Tether’s willingness to redeem USDTs are the fact that, well, a lot of people couldn’t get Tether to redeem them, despite Tether’s own assurances that proper mechanisms were in place. Moreover, Tether’s own handling of this “FUD” has been anecdotal and shady:</p>



<blockquote>— Paolo Ardoino (@paoloardoino) <a href="https://twitter.com/paoloardoino/status/1346101912677048320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2021</a></blockquote> 



<p>In the tweet above, the CTO of Tether shares “proof” that USDTs can be redeemed. However, the “proof” is just a list of USDT transactions to and from Bitfinex supposedly performed by an OTC desk, and without a matching set of USD transactions, it means nothing. The original question was, after all:</p>



<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If anyone…anywhere….has redeemed USDT for USD and can show proof of this transaction I would be happy to compensate you for your time and effort. Thanks! <a href="https://t.co/wScl7s1ZAc">https://t.co/wScl7s1ZAc</a></p>— Santiago Capital (@SantiagoAuFund) <a href="https://twitter.com/SantiagoAuFund/status/1345970353747578882?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2021</a></blockquote> 



<p>Notice the “redeem <strong>for USD</strong>” part that gets ignored by Tether. Yup.</p>



<h2>The mother of all speculative manias</h2>



<p>Remember the real estate bubble of 2003-2007? How people who could barely pay their bills would buy five condos, see their price go up as other people would also buy five condos, and everyone would seemingly get rich out of thin air, together? The reasons for that bubble, in short, were lax lending requirements. A more complete explanation was that banks found ways (thanks to securitisation, reverse engineering credit rating agency rulebooks, and shadow banking) to issue mortgages to people who should have never, ever, qualified for those mortgages. As more mortgages were issued, housing prices went up, in a seemingly infinite loop.</p>



<h3>Infinite money</h3>



<p>Fiat money is issued against debt. I come into a bank, ask for $10,000, and the bank gives me the money in exchange of me acknowledging that I owe the bank $10,000 – plus interest.</p>



<p>Why can’t I come into a bank and ask for $10,000,000,000? Because banks have rules governing how much they can lend and to whom. The first rule is common sense: if customers aren’t able to repay their loans, the bank will go bust, and because the bank doesn’t want to go bust, it will only lend to people whom it deems creditworthy.</p>



<p>Other rules are regulatory. Banks must have adequate capital to absorb losses on their loan portfolio. It means that their assets must exceed their loans, and the riskier the loans, the larger that excess must be. Banks must also perform maturity matching – meaning that their sources of funding can’t be all short term, when they’re underwriting 30 year mortgages. Then there is risk weighting of assets, Basel II capital frameworks, etc., etc. Just look at this monstruosity:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IRB_Basel2.jpg" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IRB_Basel2.jpg 577w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IRB_Basel2-300x265.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px"><figcaption>Banking is complicated<br></figcaption></figure>



<p>There are many, many, many rules in place that are intended to prevent bubbles and manias. Despite the meme that “banks print fiat out of thin air”, they don’t – because of those rules. If they did, you’d have a new tulip bulb mania on every Thursday, and civilisation would collapse before summer.</p>



<h3>Infinite almost-money</h3>



<p>What rules are in place at Tether? What prevents them from printing USDTs out of thin air, without any rules? What prevents Binance from calling Tether and asking for 10,000,000,000 USDTs?</p>



<p>At first glance, the answer is: reality. Were Tether to issue too many USDTs, and start buying BTC and ETH and XRP with it, the price of USDT would get below $1. This has happened in the past, albeit for short periods of time.</p>



<p>But the USDT peg has remained exceptionally stable throughout 2020, despite the greatest financial and economic crisis in recent memory. Exchanges are maintaining the USDT peg, because their very existence depends on it. And USDT has replaced USD  in the crypto ecosystem, they cannot allow it to fail. They have USDT on their books. More importantly, their clients own USDT, and account for it as if it were real US dollars. Should USDT’s price fall, people would sell other cryptocurrencies as well, because they’d need to make up for the lost USDT liquidity – and the whole crypto ecosystem would collapse.</p>



<p>Remember, there is a very real need for USDTs, as long as they are pegged to the US dollar, and can be used for immediate, KYC and AML – free transactions.</p>



<p>The USDT/USD peg is founded on the premise that people won’t try to cash out en masse. As long as they don’t, USDT printing can continue.</p>



<h3>Creating value out of thin air</h3>



<p>Bitcoin doesn’t have intrinsic value. Seriously, it doesn’t. It has no use case (transactions don’t create sustainable demand – you buy Bitcoin, transact, and the other party sells it, a few minutes later), produces no cash flows, gives you no rights or claims. It’s always been a confidence game.</p>



<p>How do you create confidence?</p>



<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If the higher demand is self-sustaining without manipulation then the manipulation actually bootstrapped genuine value. Maybe like an entrepreneur who aggressively exaggerates the state of development of a project and raises funds but then creates the product and justifies value</p>— Ari Paul ⛓️ (@AriDavidPaul) <a href="https://twitter.com/AriDavidPaul/status/965744440303374342?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2018</a></blockquote> 



<p>As long as things go up, and people don’t see any reason why they should stop, things will continue going up. Of course, people at large are unreliable, and they could stop thinking that things will continue going up, because there’s a huge economic crisis, for example. Then things go down very fast:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-11.33.12.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-11.33.12.png 597w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-11.33.12-300x241.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px"><figcaption>Bitcoin’s price crash during the COVID-19 rout in March 2020</figcaption></figure>



<p>Had this selling been allowed to continue, there wouldn’t be a crypto ecosystem left to speak of, today. This is why Tether and the exchanges came together and crossed the Rubicon, and decided to create USDT liquidity to stop the selling, by minting a huge 1.6 BILLION USDTs on March 31, 2020, and distributing it across main exchanges.</p>



<p>And it worked. The Tetheral Reserve was born – an infinite pool of USDT liquidity, backed by the exchanges themselves, who committed to hold the USDT/USD peg, in order to save the crypto ecosystem.</p>



<h3>To infinity, and beyond</h3>



<p>Since that fateful day nine months ago, the Tether press has been picking up speed. As the price of Bitcoin increases, the confidence in the crypto ecosystem rises to new highs, and people don’t bother to question the exponential rise of USDTs outstanding.

              <div>
                <div><p>Earlier this week, OpenAI dropped a bomb on the computer vision world: two new groundbreaking models that hint at what's to come as massive GPT3-esque Transformer models encroach on the vision domain. While <a href="https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/">DALL-E</a> (a model that can generate images from text prompts) has garnered much of the attention this week, this post focuses on <a href="https://openai.com/blog/clip/">CLIP</a>: a zero-shot classifier which is arguably even more consequential.</p><p>Until now, <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/custom-resnet34-classification-model/">classifying images</a> has involved collecting a custom dataset of hundreds, thousands, or even millions of labeled images that suitably represent your targeted classes and using it to train a supervised classification model (usually a convolutional neural network). This approach (and extensions of it like <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/object-detection/">object detection</a>) has led to the rapid proliferation of computer vision over the past decade (powering everything from <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/self-driving-car-dataset-missing-pedestrians/">self driving cars</a> to <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/designing-augmented-reality-computer-vision-apps/">augmented reality</a>).</p><p>The downside of supervised training is that the resultant models do not generalize particularly well. If you show them an image from a different domain, they usually do no better than randomly guessing. This means you need to curate a wide variety of data that is sufficiently representative of the exact task your model will perform in the wild.</p><h2 id="enter-openai-clip">Enter OpenAI CLIP</h2><p>The recent introduction of <a href="https://openai.com/blog/clip/">CLIP</a> (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) has disrupted this paradigm. It's a zero-shot model, meaning it can identify an enormous range of things it has never seen before.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-08-at-12.55.41-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-08-at-12.55.41-PM.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-08-at-12.55.41-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-08-at-12.55.41-PM.png 1367w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>CLIP is like the best AI caption writer. It's able to say what is in an image from 32,768 sampled captions. Image credit: <a href="https://openai.com/blog/clip/">OpenAI</a></figcaption></figure><p>In traditional classifiers, the meaning of the labels is ignored (in fact, they're often simply discarded and replaced with integers internally). By contrast, CLIP creates an encoding of its classes and is pre-trained on over 400 million text to image pairs. This allows it to leverage transformer models' ability to extract semantic meaning from text to make image classifications out of the box without being fine-tuned on custom data.</p><p><strong>All you need to do is define a list of possible classes, or descriptions, and CLIP will make a prediction for which class a given image is most likely to fall into based on its prior knowledge. Think of it as asking the model "which of these captions best matches this image?"</strong></p><p>In this post, we will walk through a demonstration of how to test out CLIP's performance on your own images so you can get some hard numbers and an intuition for how well CLIP actually does on various use case. <strong>We found that CLIP does better than <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/custom-resnet34-classification-model/">our custom trained ResNet classification models</a> on a <a href="https://public.roboflow.com/classification/flowers_classification">flower classification</a> task. </strong>It also does surprisingly well over a range of more obscure and challenging tasks (including identifying mushroom species in pictures from our camera roll and <a href="https://public.roboflow.com/object-detection/oxford-pets/2">identifying breeds of dogs and cats</a>).</p><p>Resources in this tutorial:</p><ul><li><a href="https://public.roboflow.com/classification/flowers_classification">Public flower classification dataset</a></li><li><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LXla2q9MCRRI_kTjpvag2Vz-7EGLnki5#scrollTo=lOF3Feb7jrnu">CLIP benchmarking Colab notebook</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/openai/CLIP">CLIP repo</a></li><li>Corresponding YouTube</li></ul><figure><iframe width="356" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8o701AEoZ8I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><h2 id="assembling-your-dataset">Assembling Your Dataset</h2><p>To try out CLIP, you will need to bring a dataset of images that you want classified, partitioned into the classes that you would like to see. </p><p>If you do not already have a dataset, and would like to just try out the new technology, take a look at Roboflow's <a href="https://public.roboflow.com/">public computer vision datasets</a>.</p><p>In this post, we'll be benchmarking CLIP on the public <a href="https://public.roboflow.com/classification/flowers_classification">flower classification dataset</a>. If using your own data, <a href="https://docs.roboflow.com/adding-data/classification">uploading your data to Roboflow</a> is easy and free (up to 1000 images), and then you can follow the same flow in this blog.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2021/01/image-9.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-9.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/image-9.png 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/image-9.png 1600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2021/01/image-9.png 1690w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The example flowers classification dataset used in this post</figcaption></figure><p>Once you've assembled your dataset, it on to the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LXla2q9MCRRI_kTjpvag2Vz-7EGLnki5#scrollTo=lOF3Feb7jrnu">CLIP benchmarking Colab notebook</a>.</p><h2 id="installing-clip-dependencies">Installing CLIP Dependencies</h2><p>To try CLIP out on your own data, make a copy of the notebook in your drive and make sure that under Runtime, the GPU is selected (Google Colab will give you a free GPU for use). Then, we make a few installs along with cloning the CLIP Repo. </p><h2 id="downloading-your-dataset-into-colab">Downloading Your Dataset into Colab</h2><p>The next step is to download your classification dataset into Colab. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2021/01/image-8.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-8.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2021/01/image-8.png 858w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Downloading classification data into the notebook</figcaption></figure><p>If you made a dataset in Roboflow, this is achieved by hitting <code>Generate</code>, then <code>Download</code> in the <code>OpenAI CLIP Classification</code> format. This will put all of your test images in a folder called <code>test</code> with separate subdirectories of images for each class in your dataset and give you a <code>_tokenization.txt</code> file that lets you experiment with "Prompt Engineering" which can drastically improve or degrade the model's performance.</p><p>We've also created a converter for object detection datasets which will create a textual description from the bounding boxes present. We had mixed results with these but they are certainly interesting to play with.</p><p>Additionally, we have made all of <a href="https://public.roboflow.com/">our open source datasets</a> available to download for free in the CLIP format.</p><h2 id="inferring-class-labels-with-clip">Inferring Class Labels with CLIP</h2><p>The final step is to pass your test images through a predictions step. </p><p>CLIP takes an image and a list of possible class captions as inputs. You can define the class captions as you see fit in the <code>_tokenization.txt</code> file. Be sure to make sure they stay in the same order as the alphabetically sorted <code>class_names</code> (defined by the folder structure).</p><p><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LXla2q9MCRRI_kTjpvag2Vz-7EGLnki5#scrollTo=lOF3Feb7jrnu">The notebook</a> contains code to iterate over each of the class folders in the test set and pass the relevant images through a prediction step. </p><h3 id="experimenting-with-ontologies-and-results">Experimenting with Ontologies and Results</h3><p>When you use CLIP for your classification task, it is useful to experiment with different class captions for your classification ontology, and remember that CLIP was trained to differentiate between image captions.</p><p>On the flowers dataset, we tried the following ontologies and saw these results:</p><ul><li><code>"daisy" vs "dandelion"]</code> &nbsp;--&gt; 46% accuracy (worse than guessing)</li><li><code>"daisy flower" vs "dandelion flower"</code> --&gt; 64% accuracy</li><li><code>"picture of a daisy flower" vs "picture of a dandelion flower"</code> --&gt; 97% accuracy</li></ul><p><strong>97% accuracy is higher than any <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/custom-resnet34-classification-model/">other classification model</a> that we have trained on this dataset. </strong></p><p>These results show the importance of providing the right class descriptions to CLIP and express the richness of the pretraining procedure, a feature that is altogether lost in traditional, binary classification. OpenAI calls this process "prompt engineering".</p><h2 id="flipping-the-script">Flipping the Script</h2><p>CLIP may have many additional use cases including ranking images against a target query string, or sorting images among their uniqueness.</p><p>In <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LXla2q9MCRRI_kTjpvag2Vz-7EGLnki5#scrollTo=lOF3Feb7jrnu">the notebook</a>, you'll see code defining two variables <code>image_features</code> and <code>text_features</code>. The cosine similarity between any pair of these features represents their semantic distance - and from our experience thus far, it is strikingly accurate. These are the early days... </p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>If you find that CLIP's performance is not as high as you would like, you may still want to consider <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/custom-resnet34-classification-model/">training a custom image classification model with supervision</a>.</p><p>For more on CLIP research, consider reading <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/papers/Learning_Transferable_Visual_Models_From_Natural_Language_Supervision.pdf">the paper</a> and checking out <a href="https://openai.com/blog/clip/">OpenAI's blog post</a>. And we'd love to hear if you discover anything interesting when playing around with the model!

    <h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>Around the end of 2019, as we were going through our few last months of
engineering school, we ended up having a quite consequent amount of free
time due to the highly irregular organisation of courses throughout the year.</p>

<p>Daniel, a friend of mine from school who has
been a huge fan of chess for a while now told us one night about how he read 
about this chess variant with three players and how he thought it would be
interesting to build a game engine for it.</p>

<p>Since I had time to <del>waste</del> spend building something <del>funny</del> meaningful,
I was interested in getting involved in this project to make it grow and be
something more than only a game engine (which I thought nobody would use
anyway, since playing chess through command line on a single computer does not
seem that appealing).</p>

<p>That’s how, Daniel, Vincent (another friend from school with whom I had
worked on many side projects), and I decided that we were going to build a
website so that people could come and play chess with two of their
friends.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-three-player-chess">What is three-player chess?</h2>

<p>Some might wonder what really is 3-player chess, do the rules change
when introducing a third player, and if they do, how?</p>

<p>Even though 3-player chess seems like a simple and precise concept, there are many variations
with light differences and not one set of rules for 3-player chess. These different
variations come in variants with different names (Trichess, Chess for three, Three-Player
Chess, Yalta chess…) but not every mention of one variant describes the same rules and
there is a huge lack of norm here.</p>

<p>The variation of chess played on <a href="https://yalta-chess.com/">yalta-chess.com</a> can be
considered as a unique variant, but mostly inspired by <strong>Yalta Chess</strong> (not much suspense
here) from which we tried to follow the rules as much as possible, but once again, the rules
differed depending on the articles.</p>

<p>On our website, you’ll play on a 96-cell board (32 for each player, just like usual chess).</p>

<p><img src="https://smlep.github.io/assets/yalta-animation4.gif" alt="Yalta board"></p>

<p>The moves are the same as classic chess, but it can take some time to get used to the
moves around the center or the board when starting to play <strong>Yalta Chess</strong>. The only real difference
with 2-player chess is how winners and losers are handled.</p>

<p>The winner is the first player to checkmate another player, meaning that there are one
winner and two losers. This makes the game more interesting, rewarding aggressive strategies
since playing too defensive might end up in a loss where one of the other players checkmated
the third player.</p>

<h2 id="early-development">Early development</h2>

<p>Our initial goal was pretty simple and seemed easy to accomplish, the
tasks which needed to be done could have been summed up as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Building a game engine, implementing every rule and move.</li>
  <li>Having a game page on which 3 players could play together with a decent user
experience.</li>
  <li>Having a basic matchmaking system, so that players could join games easily.</li>
</ul>

<p>It looked easy and fast, the game engine was the main challenge since the special
shape of the board made the classic 2-player chess implementation unsuitable for
our needs and we needed to come up with a smart way to handle the board. Once the
game engine was out of the way, the only remaining thing would be to build a simple
website with basic functionalities.</p>

<p>Two of us already had some web development knowledge which we acquired through previous
side-projects, I would not say that we were <strong>amazing</strong> (or good) web developers,
but we were at least decent. Well, for the backend at least, our UI/UX level was (and
still is, but those who saw the website already know that) pretty bad.</p>

<p>Since we weren’t looking for high performances in our game engine because a few
milliseconds were not going to impact the user experience, building the engine was
actually pretty fast. One of us focused on it, and after a few days we had a game engine
implementing the rules and about everything we needed except <em>promotions</em>, <em>castling</em>, and
<em>en passant</em> which came later.</p>

<p>Our implementation relied on the fact that instead of using one 8x8 board as in 2-player
chess, we considered the board as 3 distinct 4x8 sub-boards, each sub-board filled with a
different color on the example below: 
<img src="https://smlep.github.io/assets/yalta-subboards.png" alt="Yalta debug mode"></p>

<p>The website, on the other hand, was way more complicated than we anticipated, handling
concurrent plays with real-time information transfer between the players (without
refreshing after each move) and implementing a decent user experience was much more
challenging than we expected.</p>

<p>Our first playable version looked like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://smlep.github.io/assets/yalta-debug.gif" alt="Yalta debug mode"></p>

<p>With the three boards representing the three sides of the board as explained above.</p>

<p>This first version allowed us to check that our engine worked as intended, but
required us to refresh a page to see the other players’ moves and wasn’t very user friendly.</p>

<p>That’s when we really became aware that the website part of the project would require
an amount of work strongly higher than the game engine implementation.</p>

<h2 id="a-basic-project">A basic project</h2>

<p>The more we implemented new features on our website, the more features we thought about
which seemed to be required to have a decent user experience on the website. Some of these features
were not necessary but seemed like good ideas/interesting to implement so we implemented some of them
and the others were listed and put aside for later.</p>

<p>After a few weeks, we had a decent result for the play part of the website; three players could
play on the same page, moving by selecting a piece and moving it to its location and seeing the actions’
results in real-time.</p>

<p>Our first <em>matchmaking</em> system was fairly basic, there was a list of created games, and any player
could join any game, if the user was the third player to join a game, it would start, and if there were
3 players already in the game, the user would be considered as a spectator. On top of that, any user
could create a new game.</p>

<p>At this time we had already spent way more time on this project than we thought we were going to,
even though we had only implemented the features we thought were necessary to have a good time
playing the game. The website’s current state was enough to send the link to some friends and play
games with them if we wanted to, the global design of the website wasn’t nice, but playing stayed pretty intuitive.</p>

<p><img src="https://smlep.github.io/assets/yalta-landing-1.png" alt="Landing page"></p>

<h2 id="not-so-basic-anymore">Not so basic anymore</h2>

<p>When we started this project, we did not define the real scope of users who would use it,
the more we worked on it and the more features we started implementing, the more we started to
want to make it public so that everyone could come and play.</p>

<p>As we started having less free time due to school projects and then the real jobs we got
after graduating, we spent way less time developing this project the following months but we kept working
on it and added a lot of new sfeature. Some of those being necessary for a public release,
some that we felt were a really nice addition for users and some which might just be
really useless (Hello, in-game chat). Among these extra-features are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A custom game system to play with friends with custom settings</li>
  <li>A public queue system to play with random unknown players</li>
  <li>A training mode to play against bots in different difficulties</li>
  <li>A profile system with ranks, elo, skins, themes, and statistics</li>
  <li>Game timers</li>
  <li>A board rotation system, to see the board as one of your opponents</li>
  <li>An in-game chat</li>
  <li>The possibility to show replays of games</li>
  <li>A documentation section to explain the website and the game rules</li>
  <li>A landing page to explain to new users what happens here</li>
  <li>A new implementation of the game engine with improved performances
and a graph system (replacing the 3x4x8 sub-boards implementation)</li>
</ul>

<p>And of course, a landing page to welcome new players to our website.
The old matchmaking system based on a game list was removed, since the public
queue and private game system fully replaced the need for it.</p>

<p><img src="https://smlep.github.io/assets/yalta-ways-to-play.png" alt="Ways to play"></p>

<h2 id="costs-and-revenues">Costs and revenues</h2>

<p>As we added new features and new services which started to increase potential costs, we had to
consider the <em>business</em> aspect of the website. We were not fully against trying to monetize it but
we did not want this to impact the user experience, driving potential users away because of
<em>aggressive advertising</em> or <em>pay-to-win</em> systems.</p>

<p>We considered <strong>ads</strong>, but generic ads (such as adsense) would require to have a huge 
amount of traffic to really generate money and they usually don’t fit well into a website. We did
not want our website to get significantly less enjoyable for users just to win a few euros every month (or year).</p>

<!--
Another thing we considered was to bring premium content to the website, allowing users to purchase
differents assets such as skin. The issue with this solution is that it is really hard to find good
content which will not impact the other users impact experience.
We did implement a skin system, so that players could update the apparences of their pieces, so that
we could set up a system where the users would be able to buy these apparences. But the impact on the
other players which were just trying to focus would be too high, who wants to start a game and be
matched again a player with flashy purple pieces?
There are options to prevent this scenario such as adding a button to hide every opponents skin, but
players won't buy skins if the other players can't see it.
-->

<p>We considered some other solutions than ads but in the end, <strong>we did not find an adequate business model</strong>.
Not being able to generate revenue is not currently an issue, since the goal never was to quit our jobs and
start working on this project every day of the week. Nevertheless, we did not anticipate when we started this
project (before we decided to add many unexpected features) that there were gonna be real costs to run
the website.</p>

<p>Indeed, the website now runs using many different services and tools which come with a cost, meaning
that we cannot sustain with this business model (which is not one, since we generate no revenue) if
our user count grows too much.</p>

<p>As long as our monthly costs stay under a few dozen of euros, it is
fine, I’d say that we are happy to pay for it if some people are happy to play on
<a href="https://www.yalta-chess.com/">yalta-chess.com</a>. But if this website became too popular, we would have
to scale up the different services we pay for (hosting, Redis, database…), resulting in hundreds of
euros bills.</p>

<p>Hence, if too many people end up enjoying our website, at some point we will have to <strong>shut it
down</strong> (or strongly restrict traffic) if we still cannot generate revenue.</p>

<p>This is really <strong>unlikely</strong> to happen since we don’t plan on doing real advertising for this project,
and we are not so presumptuous as to think that this website is good enough to deserve this much 
success. But we still have to consider this scenario, and if it happens we will still try to consider
ways to generate revenue, we are not fully closed to ads, but we feel like right now nothing …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
  <p>To create relevant search, processing clickstream data is key: you frequently want to promote search results that are being clicked on and purchased, and demote those things users don’t love.</p>
<p>Typically search systems think of processing clickstream data as a batch job run over historical data, perhaps using a system like Spark. But on Shopify’s Discovery team, we ask the question: What if we could auto-tune relevance in real-time as users interact with search results—not having to wait days for a large batch job to run?</p>
<p>At Shopify—this is what we’re doing! We’re using streaming data processing systems that can process both real-time and historic data to enable real-time use cases ranging from simple auto boosting or down boosting of documents, to computing aggregate click popularity statistics, building <a href="https://elasticsearch-learning-to-rank.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core-concepts.html#judgments-expression-of-the-ideal-ordering" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">offline search evaluation sets</a>, and on to more complex reinforcement learning tasks.</p>
<p>But this article is introducing you to the streaming system themselves. In particular, to Apache Beam. And the most important thing to think about is <em>time</em> with those streaming systems. So let’s get started!</p>
<h2>What Exactly is Apache Beam?</h2>
<p><a href="https://beam.apache.org/" target="_blank" title="Apache Beam" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Apache Beam</a> is a unified batch and stream processing system. This lets us potentially unify historic and real-time views of user search behaviors in one system. Instead of a batch system, like Spark, to churn over months of old data, and a separate streaming system, like Apache Storm, to process the live user traffic, Beam hopes to keep these workflows together.</p>
<p>For search, this is rather exciting. It means we can build search systems that both rely on historic search logs while perhaps being able to live-tune the system for our users’ needs in various ways.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through an early challenge everyone faces with Beam: that of <strong><em>time!</em></strong> Beam is a kind of time machine that has to reorder events in their right spot after getting annoyingly delayed by lots of intermediate processing and storage step. This is one of the core complications of a streaming system - how long do we wait? How do we deal with late or out of order data?</p>
<p>So to get started with Beam, the first thing you’ll need to do is Hack Time!</p>
<h2>The Beam Time Problem</h2>
<p>At the core of Apache Beam are <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#creating-a-pipeline" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">pipelines</a>. They connect a source through various processing steps to finally a sink.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data flowing through a pipeline is timestamped. When you consider a streaming system, this makes sense. We have various delays as events flow from browsers, through APIs, and other data systems. Finally the events arrive at our Beam pipeline. They can easily be out-of-order or delayed. Beam source APIs, like the one for <a href="https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/2.5.0/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/kafka/KafkaIO.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Kafka</a>, maintain a moving view of the event data to emit well-ordered events known as a <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#watermarks-and-late-data" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">watermark</a>.</p>
<p>If we don’t give our Beam source good information on how to build a timestamp, we’ll drop events or receive them in the wrong order. But even more importantly for search, we likely must combine different streams of data to build a single view on a search session or query, like below:</p>
<figure><img alt="combine different streams of data to build a single view on a search session or query, like below" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Beam_for_Search__Getting_started_with_the_Beam_time_machine.png?format=jpg&amp;quality=90&amp;v=1610128718" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Beam_for_Search__Getting_started_with_the_Beam_time_machine.png?format=jpg&amp;quality=90&amp;v=1610128718"></figure>
<p>Joining (a Beam topic for another day!) needs to look back over each source’s watermark and ensure they’re aligned in time before deciding that sufficient time has elapsed before moving on. But before you get to the complexities of streaming joins, replaying with accurate timestamps is the first milestone on your Beam-for-clickstream journey.</p>
<h2>Configuring the Timestamp Right at the Source</h2>
<p>Let’s set up a simple Beam pipeline to explore Beam. Here we’ll use Kafka in Java as an example. You can see the full source code <a href="https://gist.github.com/geekigirl/738ead73033ae673483ab9690452f10f" target="_blank" title="Timestamp policy example with Kafka source with Apache BEAM" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">in this gist</a>.</p>
<p>Here we’ll set up a Kafka source, the start of a pipeline producing a custom SearchQueryEvent stored in a search_queries_topic.</p>

<p>You’ll notice we have information on the topic/servers to retrieve the data, along with how to deserialize the underlying binary data. We might add further processing steps to transform or process our SearchQueryEvents, eventually sending the final output to another system.</p>
<p>But nothing about <strong>time</strong> yet. By default, the produced SearchQueryEvents will use Kafka <em>processing</em> time. That is, when they’re read from Kafka. This is the least interesting for our purposes. We care about when users actually searched and clicked on results.</p>
<p>More interesting is when the event was created in a Kafka client. Which we can add here:</p>
<p><code>.withCreateTime(Duration.<em>standardMinutes</em>(5))</code></p>
<p>You’ll notice above, when we use create time below, we need to give the source’s Watermark a tip for how out of order event times might be. For example, below we instruct the Kafka source to use create time, but with a possible 5 minutes of discrepancy.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Appreciating The Beam Time Machine</h2>
<p>Let’s reflect on what such a 5 minute possible delay actually means from the last snippet. Beam is kind of a time machine… How Beam bends space-time is where your mind can begin to hurt.</p>
<p>As you might be picking up, <em>event time </em>&nbsp;is quite different from <em>processing time</em>! So in the code snippet above, we’re *not* telling the computer to wait for 5 minutes of execution time for more data. No, the event time might be replayed from historical data, where 5 minutes of event time is replayed through our pipeline in mere milliseconds. Or it could be event time is really now, and we’re actively streaming live data for processing. So we DO indeed wait 5 real minutes!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s take a step back and use a silly example to understand this. It’s really crucial to your Beam journey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine we’re super-robot androids that can watch a movie at 1000X speed. Maybe like Star Trek The Next Generation’s Lt Commander Data. If you’re unfamiliar, he could process input as fast as a screen could display! Data might say “Hey look, I want to watch the classic 80s movie, The Goonies, so I can be a cultural reference for the crew of the Enterprise.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beam is like watching a movie in super-fast forward mode with chunks of the video appearing possibly delayed or out of order relative to other chunks in movie time. In this context we have two senses of time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Event Time: the timestamp in the actual 1h 55 minute runtime of The Goonies aka movie time.</li>
<li>Processing Time: the time we actually experience The Goonies (perhaps just a few minutes if we’re super-robot androids like Data).</li>
</ul>
<p>So Data tells the Enterprise computer “Look, play me The Goonies as fast as you can recall it from your memory banks.” And the computer has various hiccups where certain frames of the movie aren’t quite getting to Data’s screen to keep the movie in order.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commander Data can tolerate missing these frames. So Data says “Look, don’t wait more than 5 minutes in *movie time* (aka event time) before just showing me what you have so far of that part of the movie. This lets Data watch the full movie in a short amount of time, dropping a tolerable number of movie frames.</p>
<p>This is just what Beam is doing with our search query data. Sometimes it’s replaying days worth of historic search data in milliseconds, and other times we’re streaming live data where we truly must wait 5 minutes for reality to be processed. Of course, the right delay might not be 5 minutes, it might be something else appropriate to our needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beam has other primitives such as <a href="https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/2.0.0/org/apache/beam/sdk/transforms/windowing/Window.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">windows</a> which further inform, beyond the source, how data should be buffered or collected in units of time. Should we collect our search data in daily windows? Should we tolerate late data? What does subsequent processing expect to work over? Windows also work with the same time machine concepts that must be appreciated deeply to work with Beam.</p>
<h2>Incorporating A Timestamp Policy</h2>
<p>Beam might know a little about Kafka, but it really doesn’t know anything about <strong>our</strong> data model. Sometimes we need even more control over the definition of time in the Beam time machine.</p>
<p>For example, in our previous movie example, movie frames perhaps have some field informing us of how they should be arranged in movie time. If we examine our SearchQueryEvent, we also see a specific timestamp embedded in the data itself:</p>
<p><code>public class SearchQueryEvent {</code></p>
<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public final String queryString;</code></p>
<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public final Instant searchTimestamp;</code></p>
<p><code>…</code></p>
<p><code>}</code></p>
<p>Well Beam sources can often be configured to use a custom event time like our searchTimestamp. We just need to make a TimestampPolicy. We simply provide a simple function-class that takes in our record (A key-value of Long-&gt;SearchQueryEvent) and returns a timestamp:</p>

<p>We can use this to create our own timestamp policy:</p>

<p>Here, we’ve passed in our own function, and we’ve given the same allowed delay (5 minutes). This is all wrapped up in a factory class TimestampPolicyFactory SearchQueryTimestampPolicyFactory (now if that doesn’t sound like a Java class name, I don’t know what does ;) )</p>
<p>We can add our timestamp policy to the builder:</p>
<p><code>.withTimestampPolicyFactory(new SearchQueryTimestampPolicyFactory())</code></p>
<h2>Hacking Time!</h2>

          <p><b>Check out <a href="https://my-qr.art/">My-QR.art</a> for the final result!</b></p>

          <p>QR codes provide a clear and approachable way of translating the physical world to the
          digital world. When I see a QR code, I always want to scan it to find out what is behind
          it, somehow they always fascinate me. But QR codes always look very similar, could there
          be a way to make them look more cool? Make them a certain specific shape or contain pixel
          art?</p>

          <p>People already (ab)use the error correction build into QR codes to embed their logo
          in it, they simply put their logo over a part of the QR code and let the error correction
          handle the missing data. However, you can never obscure more than 30% of the code (and
          usually a lot less) if you choose this approach. But QR codes are mostly a visualisation
          of data. Can we approach the problem from the other side? What if we don't try to
          design a QR code to fit the data, but fit the data to the design of the QR code that we
          want.</p>

          <p>Spoiler, we can. Check out <a href="https://my-qr.art/">My-QR.art</a>. All the code is
          totally free and open source, so feel free to
          contribute <a href="https://github.com/raatmarien/my-qr.art">on GitHub</a></p>

          <h2 id="the-idea">The idea</h2>

          <p>Say, we want to promote our website. And we have a nice grayscale logo. Now we want to
          have an engaging QR code that looks like our logo.</p>

          <p><img src="https://marienraat.nl/assets/img/blog/hacking-qr-codes/my-qr.art-logo.svg" alt="My-QR.art logo"></p><p>And we have an URL that we want the QR code to lead us too, for
            example: <a href="https://my-qr.art/">https://my-qr.art</a>.</p>
          
          <p>We set up a web server that can redirect certain URLs to other URLs. Then we can make
          the beginning of the data of our QR code the URL to that web-server and the rest of the
          QR's data can be anything. So we can choose the rest of the data in any way that makes
          our QR code look most like our design!</p>

          <p>For example the QR code could send you
            to <code>https://my-qr.art/r/arbitrary-super-long-string</code>. On the back-end we tell
            the server to redirect any request with the
            URL <code>https://my-qr.art/r/arbitrary-super-long-string</code>
            to <code>https://my-qr.art</code>. And tada! We have a functional QR code that sends us to
            the address we want, while having way more control over how the QR code looks! Up to 80%
            of the code can be freely designed this way!</p>

          <p>When we have this all working, we could even make nice scannable QR gifs. We could make
          each frame separately and let them all redirect to the same page. I admit, most QR codes
          are printed, so gifs might not make the most sense, but they look pretty cool! To keep you
          excited for the rest of the article, here is world's first ever working QR gif (as far
          as I know)!</p>
          
          <p><img src="https://marienraat.nl/assets/img/blog/hacking-qr-codes/qr.gif" alt="Animated QR code that shows a running horse"></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Horse_in_Motion">The running horse might
          remind you of some other movie...</a></p>

          <h2 id="qr-codes">How does QR work?</h2>

          <p>Now that we know the concept, lets get started. First we need to know how QR codes
          actually work.</p>

          <p>QR codes encode data by making some blocks dark and other light. The QR scanner can
          then read which are dark and which are light and reconstruct the original data. QR codes
          can have 40 different sizes, from <em>version 1</em> (very small, 17x17) to <em>version
          40</em> (very big, 177x177). QR codes are made of black and white 'modules' and
          each module has one of the following 4 functions:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Help the scanner recognise and orient the QR code</li>
            <li>Give information about the QR code size, type and other internal QR stuff</li>
            <li>Encode the actual data that the QR code represents</li>
            <li>Encode error correction info about the QR code</li>
          </ol>

          <h2 id="drawing">Creating a template</h2>

          <p>Our plan is to allow the user to choose the colour of any module that has function 3. So
          the first step is to let the user know which pixels they can control and which pixels they
          can't control for the QR code size they chose. For now lets try to create an image on
          which the modules with function 3 are coloured white and all other modules are coloured
          grey.</p>

          <p>For this we can colour all the modules and error data. To get this right you really need
          to dive into how QR codes work. We need to think about the data encoding, interleaving,
          extra eyes, error words and more. We'll also need to take into account that we'll
          need to reserve first few characters of our data for the start of our URL. Luckily there
          is a great source on QR codes on the
          internet, <a href="https://www.thonky.com/qr-code-tutorial/introduction">the QR code
          tutorial from Thonky.com</a>. Putting the work in, we get something like this, for version
          30.</p>

          <p><img src="https://marienraat.nl/assets/img/blog/hacking-qr-codes/qr-template.png" alt="A template for a QR design"></p><h2 id="reading">Reading a design</h2>

          <p>Now let's work on the other side of the puzzle, when we have a design that a user
          has drawn on our template, how do we convert it to a working QR code? QR codes have 4
          possible types of encoding: <em>numeric</em>, <em>alphanumeric</em>, <em>binary</em>
          and <em>kanji</em>. We need something that we can create valid URLs with, so numeric and
          kanji are out. Secondly, we need the random string at the end of our URL to
          be <em>normal</em> enough so that QR scanners will still recognise our code as an
          URL. The <em>binary</em> encoding will create characters that aren't ordinarily found
          in URLs ('\0' for example), which means lots of QR scanners won't let their
          users open our URL. Luckily the <em>alphanumeric</em> encoding has just enough characters
          to let us make valid URLs (although they'll have to be all caps).</p>

          <p><img src="https://marienraat.nl/assets/img/blog/hacking-qr-codes/qr-design.png" alt="A design for a QR code that contains the My-QR.art logo">

          <img src="https://marienraat.nl/assets/img/blog/hacking-qr-codes/qr-data-order.png" title="Made by Thonky, shared under the CC ANC 4.0" alt="An illustration from Thonky.com that shows how data is encoded in a QR code"></p><p>So with that figured out, lets read that design the user made. First we'll extract
          a bit string from all the data modules in the design. For small QR codes this is quite
          straight forward, the QR code is simply read from right to left, bottom to top and back
          again in double columns, see the illustration from Thonky above. However, when the QR code
          size passes 5, we'll have to take into account interleaving. Then the data words are
          scattered around the QR code, presumably to make the data pattern more random. So
          we'll have to reverse that interleaving procedure. Luckily how it works is explained
          by <a href="https://www.thonky.com/qr-code-tutorial/error-correction-coding">Thonky.com</a>. At
          last we get a bit string from our design, here we only show the first 80 character, the
          real bit string for this design is 13863 bits long.</p>
          <p><code>01100011010101001100101010001100011110111010100000000001110100111110011101001001</code></p>

          <h3 id="decoding">Decoding the bitstring</h3>
          <p>Now we'll need to decode the bits to an alphanumeric string. Here we group 11 bits
          together every time and then convert that into two alphanumeric characters
          using <a href="https://www.thonky.com/qr-code-tutorial/alphanumeric-table">this
          table</a>. We get the following data string (again truncated).</p>

          <p><code>KS$#LKAHRDF9H8XQI9AL HRD$OIWHSRE94QX95IFR*IK9HF/ 5NM+/AMIA99LB I5R II98ULR JRD/AR1 IRG8...</code></p>

          <p>We'll just replace the first 20 characters with our URL prefix and we get:</p>

          <p><code>HTTPS://MY-QR.ART/R/ HRD$OIWHSRE94QX95IFR*IK9HF/ 5NM+/AMIA99LB I5R II98ULR JRD/AR1 IRG8...</code></p>

          <h3 id="qr-code">Generating the QR code</h3>

          <p>Now we can use any QR library to create the QR code! The QR library will handle adding
          all the difficult error codes and other boring stuff for us.</p>

          <p><img src="https://marienraat.nl/assets/img/blog/hacking-qr-codes/failed-qr.png" alt="A random looking QR code"></p><p>But what is that? Why does it still look all random? The problem is masking. The QR
          code spec includes 5 different masks and the mask that makes the QR code look most random
          is chosen, which is almost certainly not our design. This is done to make the code easier
          to read for scanners. However, in my experience, QR codes scan just fine with more
          structured data. So we don't have to feel too bad about modifying our QR library to
          always use the same mask. Then after we apply the same mask to our design before
          processing it, we finally get the desired image.</p>

          <p><img src="https://marienraat.nl/assets/img/blog/hacking-qr-codes/my-qr.art-qr.png" alt="A QR code with the design in it"></p><h2 id="redirecting">Redirecting the request</h2>

          <p>Now to redirect the QR code to the right domain. This should be easy, put the QR URL in
          a database and link it to the redirect URL. When we receive a request, simply look up the
          corresponding URL in a database. However, if we want to use a modern web server, we'll
          have to jump through some hoops... Apache doesn't like most of our URLs, since they
          are technically malformed (ugh, spoil the fun much Apache?). So it throws an <em>Error
          400: Bad request</em>. We can't disable this error anywhere it seems. However, luckily
          there is a workaround, we can set a custom error page for our <em>Error 400</em>, so if we
          just set the redirect page as the error page for <em>Error 400</em>, we are home free!
          Luckily Apache is not so much of a spoilsport that it throws a Bad Request error while
          trying to handle a Bad Request...</p>

          <p>For the back-end I've been using Django, and it has another fun bug that shows up
          with these really weird URLs. It tries to decode the URL as an ISO-8859-1 string, but some
          of the characters passed by Apache aren't in ISO-8859-1. So we have to derive our own
          WSGI handler to workaround
          this, <a href="https://github.com/raatmarien/my-qr.art/blob/main/my_qr_art/custom_wsgi.py">see
          here</a>. But now it works, try to scan the QR we made, it redirects where we want it to
            redirect!</p>

          <p>One small caveat though, QR codes themselves are standardized and we create standard
          compliant QR codes with correct URLs in them, but QR scanners aren't standardized and some
          might not recognize our code as a URL and will see it as plain text instead.</p>

          <h2 id="a-web-app">Custom QR codes for everyone!</h2>

          <p>Just outputting and parsing images isn't very user friendly, so I made a nice web
          app at <a href="https://my-qr.art/">My-QR.art</a> using Django. It
          has <a href="https://my-qr.art/editor">a friendly editor</a> where you can draw, fill or
          upload black and white images to make your QR code. It also has some …</p></div></div></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Amazon.com Inc. has shuttered Prime Pantry, a grocery and household essentials delivery service that was one of the retailerâ€™s early forays into selling food online.</p>

<p>The program closed on Wednesday, an Amazon spokeswoman said, and thousands of products previously available under the Prime Pantry banner were folded into the companyâ€™s main retail site.</p>

<p>Launched in 2014, Prime Pantry featured a selection of shelf-stable food and snacks, as well as cleaning products, and was designed to get shoppers to stock up on the bulky, often expensive-to-ship products in orders that could fit into a single large box.</p>

<p>Initially the service was offered only to members of the Prime free shipping program, but Amazon added a US$5 a month subscription option in 2018. Those who were still paying the monthly fee were notified of the shutdown in December and received refunds, the spokeswoman said.</p>

<p>â€œAs part of our commitment to delivering the best possible customer experience, we have decided to transfer Amazon Pantry selection to the main Amazon.com store so customers can get everyday household products faster, without an extra subscription or purchase requirement,â€� the spokeswoman said in an email.</p>

<p>In addition to shelf-stable food offered on Amazonâ€™s main retail site, members of the $119-a-year Prime program in many cities can also order fresh food from Amazon Fresh and the companyâ€™s Whole Foods Market chain.</p>

				<p>Yeti will not use any of Facebook's products from today onwards.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Facebook controls some of the most used apps such as WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger, and of course, Facebook. They have shown time over time that they don't care about their users' privacy and are willing to do anything to maximize their stronghold and power.</p><p>It's clear that consumers and society always lose when one company becomes too big. That's why there are monopoly and anti-trust laws that try to prevent and regulate such cases.</p><p>Tech companies such as Facebook and Google have new business models and therefore have managed to evade those laws. Luckily, this is changing, as governments are introducing more laws that aim at breaking up and regulating these companies to protect consumers.</p><p>But we can't only rely on our governments to take action. Every single consumer's decisions also matter. If enough people stop using Facebook's products, their power will diminish.</p><p>This is easier said than done, because these products have network effects. That means that the value of the product to the user increases exponentially for every additional user. For example, you wouldn't use WhatsApp if none of your friends were on it. At the same time, it's much harder for you to switch to a different messaging app like Signal because you need to convince all your friends to join, too.</p><p>It's hard but not impossible.</p><p>From today onwards, we pledge that Yeti will not use any products by Facebook. As stated in <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/become-a-facebook-free-business/">Basecamp's blog post</a>, which inspired our decision, this means:</p><ol><li>We do not buy advertisement on Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, or WhatsApp.</li><li>We do not use Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, or WhatsApp to promote or represent our business or to communicate with our customers.</li><li>We do not assist Facebook in its data collection regime through use of Facebook social Like buttons or by offering Facebook logins.</li></ol><p>This was not an easy decision. For example, Instagram and Facebook are important platform for us to stay in touch with current and prospective consumers. It's clear that by taking this decision, we will lose customers and money. However, it is the right thing to do and this is something that's more important than financial success.</p><p>As a customer, you can be assured that none of the money you spend with us goes to Facebook.</p><p>Now, go and <a href="https://yeticheese.com/product/yeti-no-1">buy our cheese</a> so we can make up for the lost revenue 😝</p>

    <article>

        

        <section>
            <div><p>In this post I want to introduce the reader to five pressures that I have encountered over the past five years of building, leading, and maintaining Open Source Software (OSS) with community. This essay is primarily about being a leader in Open Source, but I believe <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Survive-Thrive-Church-Leader/dp/1854247611">it applies outside of technology</a> too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My aim is to foster understanding and empathy between contributors, community members, users, and maintainers. I would also like for maintainers and leaders in Open Source to feel a sense of solidarity in their shared burden.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is often said that Open Source Software is not sustainable, because it has no inherent business model, but I believe there are other pressures that leaders experience which when left unchecked may lead to "burn-out".</p>
<p>I'll briefly describe what I believe leadership means before introducing each of the pressures and how they may be experienced. It's my opinion that the examples apply beyond Open Source Software and the technology industry. I will then sum up the pressures and make a case for sustainable leadership.</p>
<p>As a disclaimer, I've generalised my experience and what I've shared here. I am not referring to any one person, even if you can identify with what I'm saying.</p>
<h2 id="whatisleadership">What is leadership?</h2>
<p>The Oxford English Dictionary defines leadership as a noun:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the action of leading a group of people or an organization.</p>
<p>Synonymns: guidance, direction, authority, control, management, superintendence, supervision; organization, government, orchestration, initiative, influence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the state or position of being a leader.</p>
<p>Synonymns: headship, directorship, direction, governorship, governance, administration, jurisdiction, captaincy, superintendency, control, ascendancy, rule, command, power, mastery, domination, dominion, premiership, sovereignty</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is clear from the sheer amount of synonymns for the term, that the word itself can have many meanings and nauances. I would also suggest that the our own experiences and culture may project specific expectations and connotations.</p>
<p>For some Open Source maintainers, leadership may start unintentionally. A developer may become inspired to build an idea into a project and by default is the director and administrator. All of the control rests with them and at this stage the project is likely to be classed as be a Proof of Concept (PoC), an experiment or a "side-project." Other people are unlikely to be involved, but that may change quickly. The maintainer is the de factor leader in their team of one.</p>
<p>Some projects remain in this state, but others may draw in users and contributors who in turn volunteer their time, ideas, and energy to advance the project. The maintainer must now set a direction, communicate it, and begin to decide how to govern the project. For me mirroring the style of other maintainers and leaders I knew helped significantly. In my experience these skills can be learned "on the job", but it's easy to get things wrong.</p>
<p>In most companies there are two tracks for a career - either as an individual contributor or as a people-manager. Individual Contributors tend to be builders of things and have very technical work. They may also lead a team or hold responsibility depending on their level of seniority. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Managing-Humans-Humorous-Software-Engineering/dp/1430243147">People managers have a very different set of skills</a> and deliver results for the business through delegation and by constantly communicating across teams.</p>
<p>In a corporation you are likely to have a very clearly defined role and hierarchy to fall into, but as an Open Source leader and maintainer your work will be a mixture of the two tracks.</p>
<p>This is an apt time to introduce the first pressure: unclear boundaries.</p>
<h2 id="1unclearboundaries">1. Unclear boundaries</h2>
<p>What is your role? What does it say on LinkedIn, and on your business cards? Does that differ from what you actually do on a day to day basis? Do you work 1 in 3 weekends? Are you on rotation for on-call duties? Do you have reports?</p>
<p>As a leader of a community and an Open Source project, there is no job description and there are no set hours. One of the synomymns for leadership is governance, and that can cover how you and the project operate. I started to define a model for governance with a "Contributing Guide" which explains the process for raising an issue or requesting a change.</p>
<p>People who come to the project now look to me and the other primary contributors to operate within that governance model and for that reason it is important to do so. Some may not be aware of the processes and some even chose to ignore them. I believe that leaders need to be flexible, but if they say one thing and to do another continually, then it sets a confusing example for others to follow.</p>
<p>When I began I enjoyed the interest in my projects from users and contributors from all around the world. People would contact me at all hours of the day and night and I wanted to reply to every notification and email within minutes, if I could. I quickly found that I wouldn't be able to keep that up.</p>
<p>Having no clear hours means that unless you are careful, that you are actually on-call 27/4, 365 days, even when you're on vacation.</p>
<p>If left unchecked then unclear boundaries can lead to an intermingling of the leader's self with the project and team. I believe that this is understandable given the investment and stake the leader has, but gaining validation and self-worth through the success or failure, growth rate or decline of something outside of their control is a recipe for burning out.</p>
<p>Rather than being able to celebrate past achivements, the leader may start to feel pressure to grow the project to compete with similar product offerings. Those products may be built by companies with well-staffed teams and 7-figure budget, so it is not unly unatainable, but unfair.</p>
<p>The pressure of unclear boundaries means that users and other contributors may bring unreasonable expectations to your door and you may feel obliged to do what is asked of you.</p>
<h2 id="2pay">2. Pay</h2>
<p>Whilst the curve for leadership positions within a corporation inflects up steeply, this is simply a different matter in Open Source and those involved in other types of public service.</p>
<p>In my opinion there is no clear business model for Open Source Software, which means there is also no reason for someone to pay me for maintaining or building that software. A friend recently explained this to me in terms of "value capture", which I found immensely useful.</p>
<p>OSS allows companies and other OSS projects to stand on the tall shoulders of those that came before, and to either enhance or to put a new spin on prior work. That means capturing and amplifying existing value for something new.</p>
<p>In the same way that I cannot and will not be able to afford to pay the Golang development team for their many years of efforts that I leverage in my work. It seems equally unlikely that an end-user company will be able to pay me for the value I have created for them, that they capture and amplified in their business.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is liberating to remove the unrealistic and unreasonable expectation that end-user companies should pay us for our work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given that maintaining and building features for OSS can take a significant amount of time, this leaves maintainers with only a few options. Such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work full-time for a company, and overtime for the OSS project in your evenings and weekends</li>
<li>Work part-time consulting through your own company, and part-time without pay for your OSS project</li>
<li>Find a co-founder, seek out investment, and build a commercial product from the project</li>
<li>Don't earn a salary at all, and work for full-time without pay on the OSS project</li>
<li>Close the OSS project, or pass the mantle on to someone else</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some exceptions where developers are recruited and paid to work on Open Source projects for a variety of reasons. This is much different than a maintainer being hired specifically to maintain and build the project they lead.</p>
<p>You will also note that I did not include <a href="https://github.com/users/alexellis/sponsorship">"sponsorship" as an option</a>, this is because in my experience sponsorship is a hard sell and difficult to do meaningfully. I currently view sponsorship as a top-up mechanism to part-time consulting, rather than as a means to an end.</p>
<p>Whichever option a maintainer picks, there will always be a significant amount of money left on the table. This is a pressure that can build over time, especially when compared to peers working for a company.</p>
<h2 id="3workingwithvolunteers">3. Working with volunteers</h2>
<p>Has anyone ever asked you to do them a favour?</p>
<p>It may be something as simple as getting a latte for a colleague on your coffee run, helping your neighbour move house, giving your wife a lift to work because her car is in at the mechanic's, reaching into your pocket to give change to someone on the street, going bowling for a work outing, or even setting up a new printer for a relative.</p>
<p>How did you feel about the ask? "It depends" you say. It depends on the relationship, how much it inconveniences you, and what you may get back in return. I know that if it's my turn to buy dinner, next time I meet my friend, he will be paying.</p>
<p>With the example of taking my wife to work, it's highly unlikely that I'd flake. I can't think of anything I'd rather do less than setting up a relative's printer and I would easily change my mind about the work bowling trip.</p>
<p>I believe that when leading an Open Source project or a community, that volunteers are essential to its success. As a maintainer, your pay is already below par and funding is unlikely to be bountiful. So relying on goodwill, favours, and external contributions become ever more important as the project grows. Not to mention that to grow and extend the impact of your project, you will need to delegate responsibility and duties to other people.</p>
<p>Other leaders will be quick to tell you to "just delegate". In my experience delegation is key to growing a community and for motivating others to act not only in their own interest, but for the common good.</p>
<p>If a maintainer starts a project on their own, then it may be hard …</p></div></section></article></div></div>

<p>Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is facing the new challenge of having to ingest very high volume of timeseries data <strong><em>and</em></strong> perform complex analysis in real time.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Doing one of the two is hard, the two at the same time is extremely challenging. In other words, you want to have your cake, eat it, own the bakery, and paying yourself massive dividends every year.</p>
<p>Quasardb was built on the vision where we can make the world more efficient if we instrument everything, at the highest possible resolution, and use that data to make decisions. This is applying the logic of a quantitative hedge fund (who happen to be another big vertical for us) to the industrial world.</p>
<p>The first part of the plan was to build the database engine capable of processing the new volume of data while delivering complex analytics.</p>
<p>In 2020, we have started phase two of our plan where we integrate the database in the industrial apparatus.</p>
<p>This blog post is about the lessons we’ve learned along the way.</p>
<h2>Timeseries in Industrial IoT</h2>
<h3>Monitoring</h3>
<p>When you build monitoring for your industrial application, you can get away with one point per second (and sometimes even less) per sensor. Even if you have hundreds of thousands of sensors, that's still less than a million points per second, often below a megabyte per second of new data.</p>
<p>Additionally, monitoring rarely requiress a high-resolution history, meaning that you can reduce the resolution to one point per minute (or even less), making it possible to fit a multi-year history in less than a gigabyte.</p>
<p>That's because if you're interested in "when a failure happened," you don't need to know at the microsecond.</p>
<h3>Predictive maintenance</h3>
<p>Monitoring is a must, but monitoring is reacting when you should be anticipating. What you want to do is to know when a problem will happen before it happens: that's predictive maintenance. To do that, you build models on finely grained data. Once your model is ready, you then inject all that raw data in real-time and process alerts.</p>
<p>How does it work? You're looking for something called "weak signals." A weak signal can be, for example, a specific spike of electric consumption, which in itself isn't a problem, but, after analyzing years of historical data, you know this spike (or series of spikes) is heavily correlated, with, for example, a turbine failure.</p>
<p>The higher the resolution, the better because the difference between a non-event and the prelude to a problem can be very subtle. It is as if you were trying to make sense of a green spot on a low-resolution picture. Is it a tree, an animal, a person?</p>
<h2>Another class of problem</h2>
<p>Old-school monitoring applications don't impose a particular challenge on databases unless you are at an enormous scale. When you have data with second-granularity, a case could be made that you maybe don't even need a timeseries database, except for convenience, efficiency, or because you're doing specific queries that TSDBs are very good at (such as ASOF joins).</p>
<p>However, serious predictive maintenance is another story. Sensors typically sample at 2-4 kHz, which means you have 2,000 to 4,000 times more data than before. Some customers are even beyond 20 kHz, that is 20,000 times more data than second-granularity!</p>
<p>Gigabytes become terabytes; terabytes become petabytes.</p>
<p>You could downsample. But will you make up what the green spot on the image is?</p>
<p>As an example, we'll focus on electrical waveform data to discuss the specific challenges of doing data science on the full raw stream of data.</p>
<h2>What do we mean by electrical waveform data?</h2>
<p>Electrical waveform data represents the variation of electricity amperage (I) and voltage (U) over time.</p>
<p>If you see electricity as a stream of water, amperage is the strength of the current, and voltage is the difference in height between two points.</p>
<p>The electricity you have at home is called two-wire single-phase electric power, with a third conductor called the ground to prevent electric shock. The current alternates, meaning the voltage varies over time at a fixed frequency (usually 50 Hz or 60 Hz). If you wanted to monitor an electric outlet at home, you would thus have two values at any point in time.</p>
<p>However, in industrial applications, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-phase_electric_power" rel="noopener" target="_blank">three-wire three-phase electric power</a> is the norm, mostly because it enables you to transmit the same amount of electrical power with less conductor material. This means that for every point, you don't have just two values (I and U), but six (I1, U1, I2, U2, I3, U3). Oops! Suddenly, three times more data!</p>
<h2>A problem of scale</h2>
<p>But, wait, there's more!</p>
<p>We have observed that data within machinery is often sampled between 1 kHz and 5 kHz; you can represent each point using fixed-point notation or floating-point notation data. The sensor's bit depth is usually around 16-bit, meaning a double-precision floating-point (64-bit) will have no loss of precision, and floating-point is often easier to work with for data scientists.</p>
<p>If you include a nanosecond precise timestamp, every sample is 6 floating-point values and 1 high-resolution timestamp. Because life is never simple, every sample comes with labels in strings embedding necessary metadata. No, you can't get rid of the labels, unless you really want the data science team to be unhappy!</p>
<p>Long stories short, you quickly end up with <strong>tens, if not hundreds, of megabytes of</strong> <strong>raw data</strong> <strong>per second</strong> to store in your database.</p>
<h2>How did our users solve the problem?</h2>
<p>Prior to using QuasarDB, customers would typically use one of the following approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give up and working on raw data and downsample it until it fits in the system.</li>
<li>Store the waveform data in blocks of x seconds in blob storage and resort to convoluted scripts to inject that data into data science tools. This can record the data at the required speed, but at the cost at very high querying complexity (and forget about those fancy <a href="https://doc.quasardb.net/master/queries/select.html" rel="noopener">ASOF joins</a>!). It can also create impedance problems with the data science tools that need to load more data than required.</li>
<li>Use a data warehousing solution such as Redshift, Big Query, or Snowflake. That works for a while until the data scientist team realizes that queries remain very slow even with an infinite amount of money, and the CFO shows up at the office with an explosive vest. That's because data warehousing solutions are <strong>not optimized</strong> for write-heavy scenarios. No free lunch! All these indexes are expensive to maintain.</li>
<li>Use Hadoop and… no just kidding.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you work in finance, the above may remind you of the dilemma of working with Level II Market Data.</p>
<h2>How we solve the problem</h2>
<p>We think the good solution enables ingestion at least one order of magnitude faster than the data arrives (to enable restoring from backups in a reasonable amount of time), while enabling transparent querying so that the data science team can pick and zoom on any part of the history at any time.</p>
<p>On top of that, you want storage to be cost efficient through compression.</p>
<p>To do that, we store raw waveforms as timeseries data inside QuasarDB. These waveform can be queried through a SQL-like language or retrieved at very high-speed using a low-level API, when needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How we typically model the waveform</h2>
<h3>Flexible representation</h3>
<p>The typical approach in data warehousing is to store all the data in a couple of large tables and pray the underlying implementation will sort it out. It almost works until you write hundreds of millions of points per second to a table, and the SSD starts to generate a black hole under the data pressure.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quasar </a>isn't a black hole.</p>
<p>The most efficient and convenient way to store waveforms in QuasarDB is to store each sensor as a separate timeseries. It's convenient because you can align waveforms to each other using ASOF joins or downsample them on the fly. You can also easily visualize them for any arbitrary time range without worrying about the underlying representation.</p>
<p>You may ask, but then, how can I query a group of sensors? We have a solution for that: table tagging.</p>
<p>Let's imagine we have two sensors for three-phase electrical data, in two separate tables, stored as such:</p>
<p><span>CREATE TABLE sensor1 (phase1 double, phase2 double, phase3 double)</span></p>
<p><span>CREATE TABLE sensor2 (phase1 double, phase2 double, phase3 double)</span></p>
<p>You can group these two tables by attaching a tag "machine_a" to both of them and then write the following query</p>
<p><span>SELECT * FROM FIND(tag=’machine_a’)</span></p>
<p>Which will be the equivalent of</p>
<p><span>SELECT * FROM sensor1, sensor2</span></p>
<p>Since tags can be added, changed, and removed instantly, this creates a very flexible meta-model and doesn't force too many decisions early in the project. Adding a sensor is just adding a table. A single table can have thousands of tags, and tags can be tagged to allow for recursive queries (more on this in the doc).</p>
<p>Ok, now, I can hear you say, "but how will I write to thousands of tables at the same time?!". Luckily, we also have a solution: our batch writer supports multi-table writes and optimizes the exchanges with the database. Using the batch writer, one of our customers commits to 250,000 tables every minute on a cluster made of only two <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AWS m5.8xlarge nodes</a>.</p>
<p>If you're interested in learning more about writing efficiently to Quasardb, <a href="https://blog.quasardb.net/achieving-maximum-write-speed-with-quasardb" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this blog post</a> may be of interest.</p>
<h3>Efficient encoding</h3>
<p>While QuasarDB delivers raw power, you can go even further by being smart about how you represent the data.</p>
<p>To achieve maximum performance, the first thing we do is leverage the <a href="https://doc.quasardb.net/master/queries/create_table.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">symbol tables</a> of QuasarDB to minimize the size of the strings at every row. A symbol table is a big dictionary that will associate an integer to a string value and is a great choice when strings' cardinality is low. Symbol tables are dynamic so you don't have to know every possible string representation in advance, and they can hold billions of symbols efficiently.</p>
<p>Symbol tables are more efficient for two reasons. First, encoding an integer is smaller than a string as soon as the string exceeds 8 characters. Even when that's not the case, our …</p></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>So, as a developer, you work on software projects, right? …Or are they <em>software products</em>?</p>

<p>As many others in the software industry, you might think those two concepts are synonyms; but they aren’t. In fact, whether the software being developed is considered a project or a product may have critical and non-trivial ramifications, in many aspects.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.romenrg.com/images/products_vs_projects.jpg" alt="Team meeting in which multiple colleagues discuss in a table, where several computres are opened. One man moves hands displaying confusion"></p>

<p>The <em>not-so-subtle</em> differences between software projects and software products actually have a huge impact on our behavior, both from a business as well as from an engineering perspective.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>For many years I’ve been trying to find the time to write about this key difference, to which many people in tech fail to give importance to. Finally, about a year ago, I gave a <a href="https://www2.slideshare.net/romenrg/agile-software-development-beyond-projects-ull">lecture</a> on this very topic: “software projects vs software products”, in the context of agile software development. And now that my 2020 article is due, I have decided to write about this important topic in more detail.</p>

<h2>Let’s start with some definitions</h2>

<p>If we want to get a clear definition of “project” and “<a href="https://www.pmi.org/about/learn-about-pmi/what-is-project-management">project management</a>”, the Project Management Institute (PMI) can probably be of some help. From their site we can extract two clear sentences that are relevant in this context:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>project</strong> is temporary in that it has a defined beginning and end in time, and therefore defined scope and resources.</li>
<li><strong>Project management</strong>, then, is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet the project requirements.</li>
</ul>


<p>Now, if we try to look for definitions of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)">product</a>” and “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_management">product management</a>”, we can probably summarize them as:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>product</strong> is an object or system made available for consumer use; it is anything that can be offered to a market to satisfy the desire or need of a customer.</li>
<li><strong>Product management</strong>, then, drives the business case for product development and has an active role throughout its development, test and launch; being also involved in product change and lifecycle decisions and planning.</li>
</ul>


<p>Can you tell the key differences already?</p>

<h2>Digging into the differences</h2>

<h3>Two key differences, from definitions</h3>

<p>From the definitions above, we can clearly see the first big difference: the temporary nature of a project. <strong>Projects are time-constrained efforts</strong>, supposed to have a defined beginning and end date. This clearly-defined temporary nature does not apply to products, which don’t have such predefined beginning and end in time, being subject to market demand instead.</p>

<p>Moreover, those clearly defined time boundaries for projects also bring the second clear distinction: fixed scope and resources (i.e. the project requirements). This doesn’t apply to products either. <strong>Products are evolving creatures by nature</strong>. While project management cares about meeting those predefined project requirements; product management cares about the business case for the product, constantly learning from users and having an active role in the product lifecycle, defining new features and/or re-prioritizing work, adapting to market needs.</p>

<h3>Detailed comparison</h3>

<p>When I was preparing my lecture, I found a very nice article by Sriram Narayan in Martin Fowler’s blog. In his article, Sriram added a very comprehensive <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/products-over-projects.html#WhatIsProduct-mode">table comparing project-mode and product-mode</a>.</p>

<p>For this article, I have created my own simplified table; focusing only on some key aspects I would like to compare for the two cases.</p>

<h2>Software development is mainly about building products</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.romenrg.com/blog/2015/09/28/why-asking-developers-for-time-estimates-in-software-projects-is-a-terrible-idea-and-how-to-bypass-it-with-scrum/#the-role-of-evil-contracts">Software development involves many unknowns</a>. Those unknowns make it extremely hard for us to have the certainties “projects” require upfront. At the beginning is when we know the least about the software what we are building.</p>

<h3>In the digital economy, software evolves constantly</h3>

<p>Think of the software you use in your daily life. Isn’t it always evolving? You receive constant updates, not only for bugfixing; but also to add new features, <a href="https://www.romenrg.com/blog/2013/01/02/improving-the-ui-to-achieve-a-better-ux-my-experience-in-stat4you/">improve the UX</a>, or even to remove pieces that are no longer relevant.</p>

<p>Does this fit into the definition of “project” we saw before? Do these applications have “a defined beginning and end in time”? And how about scope and resources, do they seem to have been fixed upfront?</p>

<p>Change and evolution are natural in products, but not in projects. Projects don’t welcome change. And software evolves constantly.</p>

<h3>Software products and outsourcing are not a good fit</h3>

<p>Traditionally, it has been common for non-software organizations to outsource software development initiatives. For instance, Government agencies typically outsource their “software development projects”, even though in most cases they should have been thinking in terms of software products instead.</p>

<p>Think of an e-gov application in which citizens can perform their bureaucratic obligations from home. Isn’t that a software product? It will have to evolve, as new laws are passed. And it is not supposed to have a predefined teardown day. Instead, we would probably expect it to be there for the long run. Over time, citizens (users) will discover bugs, which will have to be addressed; and we will likely complain about it and/or suggest improvements. There might also be scalability issues and/or outages that will have to be tackled.</p>

<p>Treating these software products as outsourced projects means that the owners will hire an external company to build it. Usually the cheapest. The project will have a fixed scope, and the parties will agree on a timeline and on a price. The external company will complete the project, according to those parameters and hand it over to the customer. Then, usually, the external company forgets about it. If changes are desired in the future, new projects will be defined and outsourced. Often to different companies.</p>

<p>In most cases, the company that is hired to build the software is not involved in the discovery process with potential users. They are not involved in the prioritization of features. They are just hired to do X, as quickly and cheaply as possible. And since they are not rewarded for software quality nor for asking questions, they will probably build it without maintenance in their minds. And they won’t question decisions nor worry about gathering data.</p>

<p>Now, think how different it would be if it was treated as a software product, with an in-house team building it and participating in all the process, from conception to evolution. The team would understand needs, motivations and strategic goals; they would be engaged. They would ask questions. Hypotheses could be defined together and data collection and learning would be in everybody’s mind since the beginning. Working in small increments would be easier. Writing maintainable code becomes crucial. Changes are welcome. And quality matters.</p>

<p>Being aware of the importance of software products in the digital economy means that, if your software is (or is becoming) the core of your business, then you keep software development in-house. Nowadays, every company is a software company. Think of Airbnb, Lyft or Netflix. These businesses could have opted to externalize software development, but they realized the software products they were building are the core of their business. They realized they were software companies.</p>

<h3>How about open source “projects”?</h3>

<p>It is common in the software industry to hear people refer to “open source projects”. In most cases, though, I would argue we should be talking about “open source products” instead.</p>

<p>I have been an open source software (OSS) user for many years, and I have also contributed to open source myself. One example of OSS to which I have contributed is <a href="http://jenkins.io/">Jenkins</a>. Jenkins is the leading open source automation server. It has been around for more than 15 years, with millions of installations worldwide. And it has evolved significantly, including the fork from Hudson, the recent UI changes, and the thousands of ever-evolving plugins, created by a thriving open source community. Based on this data and the previous definitions, should we consider Jenkins an “open source project” or, rather, an “open source product”?</p>

<p>I understand that, when somebody (like Kohsuke with Jenkins) starts to build an open source software, they might have a limited and well defined idea. And they may work on a “project” to make it happen. A project to build the first set of fixed features for their idea. But then, if it is successful, that initial project leads to a product that keeps evolving in unanticipated ways. Scope is no longer fixed, as the community starts to bring new ideas and prioritize their development; and there is no defined “end date”.</p>

<p>Successful open source “projects” are here to stay, for a long time. But their success will keep them evolving within …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><article><header></header><p>How do you send a password over the internet? You acquire a SSL certificate and let TLS do the job of securely transporting the password from client to server. Of course it’s not as cut-and-dry as I’m making it out to be, but the gist of it holds true and stood the test of time. This hasn’t always been this way though, and one incredibly popular storefront on the world wide web prefers to add a little extra to this day. I’ll be discussing Steam’s unique method of logging in their users, and go down a deep rabbit hole of fascinating implementation details.</p><h3 id="pointing-out-the-obvious">Pointing out the obvious</h3><p>I found a StackOverflow question from 2013 <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1582894/how-to-send-password-securely-over-http">asking how to securely send a password over HTTP</a>. The answers are pretty unanimous: get a SSL certificate. Here’s an experiment: set up your favorite traffic-capturing proxy, browse to a service you frequently use, log in with your account (or preferably a throwaway), and inspect the requests. You will most certainly find that your username and password are sent as-is in a HTTP request body. The only reason this works is because your connection to the server is encrypted using TLS.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/steam-rsa/so-real-host.png" alt="StackOverflow user asking what to do if a webhost doesn't support SSL certificates, told to move to a real webhost"><figcaption><p>Weird to think that this used to be an issue</p></figcaption></figure><p>The internet was a different place though in the early 2010s, let alone the many years prior. We now have services like <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a> which issue SSL certificates free of charge for a period of three months, with automatic renewals if desired. There really wasn’t much of a way around acquiring a SSL certificate for money, but usually with extended validity and support. You could certainly argue that there is a price to be paid for the security and privacy of your users, but that didn’t stop questions like the one I linked from appearing.</p><p>Now that we all agree that TLS is important, let’s switch it up. Let’s pretend we cannot send a password over HTTPS and have to somehow make it work with plain HTTP, while also providing users with some level of security. There’s the <code>Authorization</code> header which is standardized and widely accepted. However, in conjunction with the “Basic” HTTP Authentication scheme, it provides no security if used in plain HTTP.</p><p>There are tried and tested challenge-response algorithms, most notably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol">SRP</a> which is designed to do password-based authentication without ever actually sending the password, but you probably have to implement them yourself and a slight oversight could cause serious harm. You could also defer authentication to an external service. “Sign in with service XYZ” is commonly used, but comes with its own ramifications. All things considered, it’s not trivial to send secrets over an inheretly insecure connection.</p><p>So when me and a friend took Steam apart in search for traces of personally identifiable information, I was surprised to see that Steam’s login page doesn’t only rely on TLS to ensure that your password stays protected.</p><h3 id="crypto-cherry-on-top">Crypto cherry on top</h3><p>Again, grab your favorite traffic-capturing proxy and navigate to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/login">Steam’s login page</a>. Enter your username and password and you will (hopefully) be asked to enter a one-time token generated by your preferred two-factor authentication method. You can stop right there, because the magic I want to point out has already happened. You’ll find that pressing the login button launches a request against an odd endpoint: <code>/login/getrsakey</code>, followed by <code>/login/dologin</code>.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/steam-rsa/getrsa-call.png" alt="Requests to fetch script assets, acquire RSA key and perform login"><figcaption><p>All relevant assets and requests in succession</p></figcaption></figure><p>Inspect the request for <code>/login/getrsakey</code> and you’ll find a JSON-formatted response, containing fields with names that should look very familiar to anyone who’s briefly dealt with public key cryptography. You’re given a RSA public key, though the exact values might look a bit odd. It’s clear that <code>publickey_mod</code> and <code>publickey_exp</code> define the modulus and the exponent used in encryption, but the former is given in hexadecimal while the latter appears to be given in binary (I’ll get back on that later). There’s also a timestamp which has no immediately recognizable starting point. As to what the purpose of <code>token_gid</code> is, I have no clue yet.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span>
    <span>"success"</span><span>:</span><span>true</span><span>,</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The login page pulls some scripts on load. There is the main login handler contained in <code>login.js</code> which is completely unobfuscated, so anyone can just analyze it and find out what it does. The site also loads some additional dependencies, namely <code>jsbn.js</code> and <code>rsa.js</code>.</p><p>A quick search for the name mentioned in the first line of <code>jsbn.js</code> reveals that these two scripts are the work of <a href="http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/">Tom Wu</a> — a MIT and Stanford graduate who likes software engineering and computer cryptography. They released <code>jsbn.js</code> and <code>rsa.js</code> as pure JavaScript implementations of arbitrary precision integers and RSA encryption/decryption respectively. You’ll also find that these libraries have had their most recent updates in 2005 and 2013 which is a bit of information I’ll come back to later. For now, just keep it in mind.</p><h3 id="going-down-the-rsabbit-hole">Going down the r(s)abbit hole</h3><p>So now that we have all relevant assets, let’s dig around in <code>login.js</code>. The code is a bit of a mess with lots of callbacks and proxied function calls, but it turns out the parts of interest can be easily condensed. In essence, the script can be boiled down to a couple of steps, each step assuming that everything went fine in the previous step.</p><ol><li>The user enters their username and password and presses the login button.</li><li><code>DoLogin</code> is called, which checks if the login mask was filled out correctly and launches a request against <code>/login/getrsakey</code>.</li><li><code>OnRSAKeyResponse</code> is called. This checks if the response is well-formed.</li><li><code>GetAuthCode</code> is called. It runs some platform-specific code in case there are any 2FA measures active on the user’s account.</li><li><code>OnAuthCodeResponse</code> is called. This is where the password is encrypted using RSA and the request against <code>/login/dologin</code> is prepared and executed.</li><li><code>OnLoginResponse</code> is called. The user is logged in and redirected to the Steam storefront.</li></ol><p>The code in <code>OnAuthCodeResponse</code> shows why the requested public key is formatted the way that it is. Starting at line 387 in the source file, the modulus and exponent of the <code>/login/getrsakey</code> response are passed as-is to the RSA library. The user’s password is then encrypted with the given public key and added to the request against <code>/login/dologin</code> in the subsequent login step.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>var</span> <span>pubKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>RSA</span><span>.</span><span>getPublicKey</span><span>(</span><span>results</span><span>.</span><span>publickey_mod</span><span>,</span> <span>results</span><span>.</span><span>publickey_exp</span><span>);</span>

</code></pre></div><p>I copied the source files onto my local machine to explore the RSA library a little bit. Both the modulus and the exponent are passed to the function <code>RSAPublicKey</code> which behaves like a constructor in the “pre-class” JavaScript era. <code>RSAPublicKey</code> simply wraps both values into instances of <code>BigInteger</code> provided by the <code>jsbn.js</code> script. It was to my surprise that the exponent is actually not represented in binary but, just like the modulus, in hexadecimal. (Also, turns out <code>0x010001</code> is a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6098381/what-are-common-rsa-sign-exponent">very common encryption exponent</a> in RSA implementations.) So now it’s clear that the password encryption is based on 2048-bit RSA with an encryption exponent of 65537.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>let</span> <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>RSA</span><span>.</span><span>getPublicKey</span><span>(</span><span>"c85ba44d5a360856..."</span> <span>/* insert your own long modulus here */</span><span>,</span> <span>"010001"</span><span>);</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>.</span><span>encryptionExponent</span><span>.</span><span>toString</span><span>());</span> <span>// =&gt; "65537"

</span></code></pre></div><p>Moving on to the <code>timestamp</code> field. The <code>/login/getrsakey</code> response contains an <code>Expires</code> header. It references a date in the past, meaning that the response is absolutely not meant to be cached or persisted in any way. If you check back on <code>/login/getrsakey</code> over a longer period of time, you’ll notice that the public key changes ever so often and, as such, its timestamp value too. This means there’s only a limited time frame in which a certain Steam-issued RSA public key can be used to authenticate.</p><p>This becomes even more evident when examining the subsequent request against <code>/login/dologin</code>. Among many other things, it contains the username, encrypted password as well as the timestamp of the issued RSA public key. Trying to perform a login attempt while altering the timestamp fails as expected. But more importantly, it’s also not possible to reuse an older public key, even if the password is correctly encrypted.</p><p>I went one step further and <a href="https://gist.github.com/JoogsWasTaken/8a8e60859e1721255c57e9185eb6cb10">wrote a simple Python script to collect public keys</a> over the span of three days using a throwaway account. I let it run every five minutes using a cronjob. The goal was to check just how often Steam’s public keys change and to hopefully find out how the <code>timestamp</code> field behaves.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/steam-rsa/sqlite-pubkeys.png" alt="SQLite database containing public keys sourced from Steam"><figcaption><p>Lots and lots and lots of public keys</p></figcaption></figure><p>I found that the public key changes every 12 entries, meaning that it’s safe to assume that they rotate every hour. The encryption exponent stays the same — no surprises here. More intriguing however is the aforementioned <code>timestamp</code> field. For every 12 public keys, the value of the <code>timestamp</code> increases by a certain amount, namely 3600000000 and then some. And what’s more is that this number wraps around after some period of time as can be seen in the following image. Be warned, because all of what I’m about to say is highly speculative.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/steam-rsa/sqlite-wraparound.png" alt="Public key entries where the timestamp value wraps around in-between"><figcaption><p>Timestamp field wrapping around</p></figcaption></figure><p>I found that 3600000000 microseconds is equal to one hour, making me assume that the value of the <code>timestamp</code> field is, in fact, given in microseconds. However, I already hinted at the fact that the timestamp value doesn’t increase by one hour exactly with every new public key. In my own data, I observed that the difference between two successive timestamps is one hour plus 1 to 2.6 seconds, with most being in the order of about 1.05 to 1.25 seconds. But this raises another interesting possibility.</p><p>Let’s assume that a new public key is generated every hour plus one second. If I query the public key …</p></article></section></div>

<p>In July, I founded <a href="https://ritza.co/">Ritza</a> - a technical publishing company that offers
(very) technical content marketing, developer advocacy as a service, and
a bunch of related publishing services. What does that mean exactly? We
publish ebooks, documentation, and blog articles, usually with the goal
of helping developers or technical managers in some way. For example, we
did <a href="https://codewithrepl.it/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->https://codewithrepl.it<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> as a
companion website for <a href="https://repl.it/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Repl.it<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>. We offer this
content on a subscription basis.</p>
<p>The title is clickbait: I’ve been working on Ritza for quite a bit
longer than 6 months, but it only became ‘real’ in July this year as a
registered business which I was devoting 100% of my time to, and – from
what I’ve seen in Maker circles – writing about how you got your
initial revenue is the best way to 2x your revenue, so the title is also
an experiment in some ways.</p>
<p>I’ve gained a lot by reading about
<a href="https://www.coryzue.com/open/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->other<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/SahinKevin/status/1334142235051520000"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->people’s<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>
<a href="https://themakingof.carrd.co/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->transparent<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>
<a href="https://nomadlist.com/open"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->revenues<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>. That said, talking about
money is still weird for me, and I think it’s harder to be fully
transparent when offering services instead of a SaaS - there is more
customized pricing both in charging for work and paying contractors and
talking money is a sure way to get emotions up and make people feel like
they got a bad deal.</p>
<p>Here are some high level figures for the last 6 months to get it out of
the way.</p>
<h2 id="revenue">Revenue</h2>
<p>Ritza made between $6000 and $14000 revenue each month between July and
December, with a total revenue of around $58000 for the last two
quarters of 2020.</p>
<p>This was below my target of hitting $20000/month in 2020, but –
especially given circumstances – this was way better than my worst case
predictions. There was no clear overall trend, but a definite drop off
in November and December, with July and October being our best
performing months.</p>
<p>All of our contracts are month-to-month and one client went quiet in
October. While most of our revenue comes from recurring contracts, we
also did some one-off work in July through October, but none in November
or December.</p>
<p>Nearly all of our costs are from paying writers, editors, and designers.
We additionally spent money on office space that we don’t use (over
$500/month for coworking space that is tied to my ‘visa facilitation’,
which is a requirement for my visa in the Netherlands), and accounting
costs. We pay a few dollars a month for various online services, such as
GSuite and various domains, and we have credits on DigitalOcean and AWS
which take care of all of our hosting for now. We also recently picked
up a subscription to <a href="https://www.semrush.com/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->SemRush<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> - a tool
that I think is overpriced and slightly shady, but which has proven its use
in better understanding what people are searching for.</p>
<p>Overall, this revenue allows me to pay myself a ‘salary’ that pays rent
in Europe, with more cash than my previous job as Head of Technology for
a South African EdTech startup.</p>
<p>That said, my plan B after quitting my previous role was to find a full
time job remotely or in Europe. I shopped around a bit and did some
interviews for roles that were offering $150k-$200k/year + benefits so
in terms of opportunity cost I am still ‘losing’ for now and it remains
to be seen how far Ritza can scale with its current business model.</p>
<h2 id="experiments-and-content">Experiments and content</h2>
<p>Our bread-and-butter service is producing technical content: writing
<a href="https://codewithrepl.it/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->tutorials<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> and
<a href="https://datarevenue.com/en-blog"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->blog<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>
<a href="https://virtasant.com/blog/data-lake-vs-data-warehouse/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->content<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>.
While our mission is to unlock marketing budgets “for good” by making
this content available for free, we have also helped companies produce
and improve internal proprietary content that they then sell.</p>
<p>On the side, I have been playing around with the idea of building online
tools to help with producing and publishing content. None of these got
the attention they needed to get off the ground, but they remain on the
back burner as ideas I’d still like to work on. They included</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://vsgraphs.ritza.co/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->‘vs’ Graphs<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> -</strong> a tool
inspired by <a href="https://medium.com/applied-data-science/the-google-vs-trick-618c8fd5359f"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->this
article<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>.
I built this because I needed it - especially for writing articles
about ‘hot’ spaces like MLOps and DevOps, it’s easy to get
overwhelmed by the sheer number of tools, products, and services.
This visualisation makes it easy to explore a new area and find
the most popular products, as well as to find out how a specific
product ‘fits in’ (“Oh X plays in the same space as SageMaker”).
This is also useful to write ‘<a href="https://datarevenue.com/en-blog/data-dashboarding-streamlit-vs-dash-vs-shiny-vs-voila"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->x vs y vs
z<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>’
articles, which turn out to be very low hanging fruit in terms of
ranking well on Google. If you’ve ever tried to find out how two
products or services compare and found yourself frustrated at all
the low quality ‘alternativeTo-like’ pages you’ll know why these
articles are useful, and I ended up also building a <a href="http://versus.ritza.co/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->related
tool<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> to outline these articles
automatically. The fun part about this was that I built it in a
single train ride using only my iPad and repl.it, which felt like
a big step in the direction of being able to code as a nomad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://ratemycopy.ritza.co/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rate my Copy<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></strong> - Also while
researching products and services, I got annoyed at how cliched
most landing page copy is, and even more annoyed by how
uninformative it is. I scraped over 20000 landing pages for online
products and services and built a database of the most commonly
used cliches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://ritza.co/experiments/opinionated-tutorial-publisher.html"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Opinionated tutorial
Publisher<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></strong> -
while most of our clients have their own systems already in place
to host the content we produce, I was frustrated at how hard it
was to generate a lightweight, good looking page with writing,
code samples, and images. There’s a long way to go on the design
still, but some of the other pieces are in place.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I won’t link to all the content we produced in 2020, but some highlights
are</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.codewithrepl.it/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->CodeWithRepl.it<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> -</strong> a set
of tutorials, also in book form. This was very well received on
reddit and continues to rank well for a variety of search terms. I
am strongly against most kinds of tracking, but caved at the end
of the year and installed Plausible Analytics on it, which also
makes it easy to share publicly everything we track:
<a href="https://plausible.io/codewithrepl.it"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->https://plausible.io/codewithrepl.it<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>.
Traffic has died off a lot at the end of the year (based on some
server logs analytics I did), but rankings continue to improve and
I think the content is in pretty good shape now (we’ve done
several sets of updates since initially publishing it).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://datarevenue.com/en-blog"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->DataRevenue Blog<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></strong> -
This is the project I’ve personally learned the most from this
year, writing about everything from general machine learning
through BioTech (I didn’t even know what Metabolomics was in 2019,
so there was a steep learning curve to write some of the articles
about that).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="growing-a-team">Growing a team</h2>
<p>While we initially mainly worked ad-hoc with contractors on various
projects, towards the end of the year Ritza started feeling like a real
company with a core team. <a href="https://dev.to/eugenedorfling/technical-writing-internship-it-can-only-get-better-from-here-10ma"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Eugene
Dorfling<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>
joined in October for a full time internship and is continuing in 2021
as an Associate Developer Advocate. Several other freelancers have
regularly worked on projects throughout the year. I’m still trying to
figure out if the next full time hire should be a senior writer (to take
over some of the writing I am doing), or a managing editor (to help out
with client feedback and all the nitty-gritty but super important
aspects of getting from ‘first draft’ to ‘production’), but I’m leaning
more towards the latter.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-ritza">What IS Ritza?</h2>
<p>Friends and family still don’t really understand what Ritza is. I get a
lot of “uh, so you make IT manuals, right? Isn’t that just telling
people to turn stuff off and on again until it works?”</p>
<p>Ritza is probably closest to a ‘content marketing agency’ at this stage.
But I really dislike most content marketing agencies. Not to name and
shame, but there’s definitely decent demand for very low cost content
such as
<a href="https://contentfly.com/blog/tag/content-sample/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->https://contentfly.com/blog/tag/content-sample/<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>,
and I honestly can’t see how that adds any value to the world at all, so
I want to avoid being pulled in that direction or associated with
content like that.</p>
<p>My initial response to this was to try to move towards “Developer
Advocacy as a Service”, but it doesn’t really roll off the tongue, and
I’m not sure that “Developer Advocacy” is actually a job that will
survive the Tech Bubble I’m convinced we’re in.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the year, it became clear that Ritza is simply a
publishing company (or at least the very beginnings of one). We are
slowly becoming experts in the entire publishing pipeline, from sourcing
high quality writing, through editing, designing, publishing, and
distributing. While we have started out with a strong focus on technical
content, there’s no reason that that has to remain a core focus forever.
I’ve had pretty mediocre experiences with technical publishing companies
like PacktPub and I believe non-tech publishers that have existed for
decades or centuries are even more in need of a bit of modernization.</p>
<p>I previously helped my Dad publish his first book of (hilarious)
<a href="http://leanpub.com/doctor"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->memoirs as a Doctor in Africa<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> and
during the slower period between Christmas and New Year now I spent some
time tweaking the landing page, making a sample available, and doing
some marketing. So far, all I’ve done is burn $50 on Reddit ads that led
to zero sales, but I think with some experimentation with different
distribution channels there’s more potential. Stay tuned.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>The COVID pandemic made me think about how arcaic the current education system is. I should say, the current <em>delivery</em> of education. The core idea for a fairer education relies in a sort of <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>, but at the state level. Traditional teachers won’t be replaced by a classroom computer, but would see their role reshaped: from teachers to facilitators. For example, a 1-hour class might include a 40min video of the subject delivered by a top specialist followed by 20min of classroom activities and Q&amp;As.</p><p>The current delivery of educational subjects is in the hands of an army of teachers. The quality of teaching is highly variable, and the schools with the best ratings are usually the ones in rich neighborhoods. Good ratings on a school can alone make or break the real estate market, driving house prices and rents in the nearby radius. Public schools should provide a level playing field for everyone, but this is not the case, and never has been. Rich parents can afford higher rents while poorer families are driven in the outskirsts of a city, where lower rated schools usually are. Public housing in high-income areas have historically provided a solution for this, but the chance of being accepted in a specific public housing project are still highly randomized.</p><p>During the second wave of the COVID pandemic in the UK in January 2021, the schools were again shut down. Interestingly, the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/teach">BBC started broadcasting curriculum-mapped lessons</a> on primary and secondary school subjects, for free. If we were to push this concept to its very limit, imagine what a country like the UK could be able to offer to its pupils. The best of the best delivered to anyone. A physics lesson delivered by Prof. Brian Cox, a science lesson on evolutionary byology delivered by Richard Dawkins or Sir David Attenborough, an english class delivered by Stephen Fry. This is already happening in higher education and in the workplace anyways - learning and training has been remote for ages now. But this shouldn’t be the end of the classroom as the social aspect of school is as important as the educational one. Teachers could see their role reshaped towards being educators or classroom facilitators, answering pupils questions and coordinating classroom activities.</p><p>I’ve grown up in Europe, where education is generally considered quite good. My school experience up to College has been scarred by mediocrity, with some notable horrific experiences and a couple of teachers who became like mentors to me. I’m sure a lot of people can relate to my experience. Later in life and like many like me, I self-taught myself software engineering using YouTube, Coursera and online material. I’ve had the chance to follow the best courses from the best teachers at Stanford, MIT and so on. Being a drop-out from College I was even able to complete my degree by re-enlisting 10 years later and rather than going back to the classroom, I was studying the subject on Khan Academy and textbooks. The potential of a unified, highest-quality possible education delivery for everyone is immense. The solution is not necessarily remote learning, but the tools given by remote learning.</p><p>I wonder whether in the aftermath of the pandemic and the combination of widespread use of conferencing tools, unified delivery of learning might become a serious subject of discussion to build a fairer future for our children.</p></div></article></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/procrastination_work_no.png" alt="Q2 Time: how to work without a looming deadline"></p><p>You have work to do, but the deadline is in a couple of weeks or months. Or you have no deadline at all.</p><p>How do you do great work every day instead of the usual last-minute push before a deadline?<br>A vitally important question in the era of knowledge work.</p><h3>The mythical land of Q2, the important but not urgent</h3><p>This post is all about the Q2 of the Eisenhower matrix - the part that many procrastinators never get around to.</p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/eisenhower_Q2.png" alt="Eisenhower Matrix"></p><p>It's a shame because Q2 is where all the future-focused, strategic work lies: learning new skills, investing into new endeavors, working on new branches of a business,...</p><p><strong>Q2 is the quadrant of potential.</strong></p><p>Without spending time in Q2 frequently, we tread water in life, doing only the things that we've always done, or that we're forced into at the last minute. Just enough to get by, but not to go to bed with a sense of pride.</p><p>Let's change this.</p><p>We'll start with the first obstacle to working on non-urgent important tasks—the reactive habit of&nbsp;<em>checking</em>.</p><h2>Why checking things became a default habit</h2><p>If you have Internet access, you probably developed this simple habit:</p><p><em>When I get bored, I check ___________.</em></p><p>This is a problem.</p><p>Work often isn't engaging at the beginning of a session. It can seem onerous, never-ending, and boring (before you get into the problem-solving mode).</p><p>If you always have an easy way to get distracted, you'll take it. Often.</p><p>When you&nbsp;<em>check</em>&nbsp;a site or app, you get a bit of dopamine - a feel-good neurochemical.</p><p>This dopamine hit makes it addictive to check stuff. Just the possibility of something new, random, or unexpected is exciting, even if that new thing ends up being a work email.</p><p>Checking things is the cornerstone of&nbsp;<strong>a reactive work style:</strong></p><ul><li>You never do something unless it's in reply to someone else.</li><li>You wait for others to remind you multiple times to do something.</li><li>You refresh inboxes constantly and keep them open at all times.</li><li>When you find yourself bored, you immediately check something.</li></ul><p><strong>This way of working is devoid of initiative. It's an addiction to new information disguised as being "responsive."</strong></p><p>Nothing non-urgent ever gets done.</p><p>How can we get ourselves to do it?</p><h2>2 ways to do non-urgent work</h2><p>The first way is to make Q2 feel like Q1 - to make it urgent. There's a variety of ways to do it.</p><p>The second way is to choose to work on Q2 because you can.</p><h2>1. Make Q2 feel like Q1</h2><p>When we're on a deadline, we spring into action.</p><p>The consequences of not acting become clear: we'll get fired, fail a class, or ruin a relationship...</p><p>The fear of these scenarios is visceral. It drives us to finally get things done.</p><p>While reliance on this fear is not ideal, we can use it.</p><h3>Create consequences for your actions (or lack thereof)</h3><p>If you know that without a deadline, you don't work, create deadlines.</p><p>There are many ways of doing this:</p><ul><li><strong>Tell your coworker you'll do something.</strong><br>If you tell a coworker that you'll have done something by Tuesday, they will expect you to deliver. If you don't, you'll cause them to be disappointed or angry. That's a clear consequence.</li><li><strong>Promise publicly you'll do something.</strong><br>If you promise on social media or any other public forum that you'll do something by a certain time, you're putting your reputation at risk.</li><li><strong>Schedule an event you don't want to miss.</strong><br>If it's 3PM and you schedule a fancy dinner with your partner at 6PM, it becomes clear that you have only the next 3 hours to get things done (unless you want to miss the dinner). Having more events in your schedule highlights the space available for work. If there's little time for delays, you'll probably adapt and not delay.</li><li><strong>Sign up for&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.stickk.com/">Stickk</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.beeminder.com/">Beeminder.</a></strong><br>Both of these services allow you to make a financial bet against yourself. They also help you put your goals into a concrete format. Losing your own money if you don’t do something can be a powerful motivating force.</li></ul><p>Besides these ways of creating a deadline for yourself, you can also heighten your awareness of not working when you're meant to.</p><h3>Create a crystal clear sense of "Now I focus"</h3><p>When a deadline is looming over us, we feel this visceral feeling of "now I really need to work."</p><p>Suddenly, every available hour is an hour we can use to work. Having so much to do and so little time to do it makes us use every minute.</p><p>In other words, it becomes crystal clear to us that&nbsp;<strong>now is the time to focus.</strong></p><p>We can use other tools to get to that feeling.</p><h4>Work alongside others</h4><p>Our environment shapes our behavior in a profound way. Imagine you're working next to a coworker who's focusing intensely. They can also see your screen when they occasionally glance away from their work.</p><p>Would that inspire you to focus a bit more?</p><p>The research says yes.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/497818?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">One study</a>&nbsp;found that the presence of another person improves performance by 16-32%. Interestingly, the study notes: "low productivity workers are the most sensitive to the behavior of peers."</p><p>Now, if you can't use this in your physical environment and work with your coworker, or partner, you can use a service like&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.focusmate.com/">Focusmate.</a></p><p>It allows you to work with 50 minute sessions with others who want to focus on their work.</p><p>You can try the service for free and see if it helps you.</p><h4>Make a grand gesture</h4><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/tips/hotel.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="5 Star hotel"></p><p>A slightly more esoteric way of boosting your awareness of "now I work" is to make a grand gesture.</p><p>Cal Newport describes this strategy in Deep Work and uses the example of J K Rowling.</p><p>When Rowling was stuck writing The Goblet of Fire, she decided to check into a 5 star hotel.</p><p>A stay in a hotel like that is expensive. You can spend hundreds of dollars every day.</p><p>For Rowling, the whole purpose of staying in that hotel was to write. If she was paying thousands of pounds every week, it heightened her awareness time passing. She was paying for every minute, so she'd better produce something worth it.</p><p>Now, this grand gesture is not available to all of us, but another is:&nbsp;<strong>a trip.</strong></p><p>To help himself decide whether to start his online training program AltMBA, Seth Godin went into the desert for a few days with his friends.</p><p>He had one objective for himself: decide.</p><p>He thought about the project, wrote about it, and ultimately decided to commit and do it.</p><p>Could you take a trip somewhere as an opportunity to make a decision you’ve been putting off?</p><p>If you don't want to make yourself work using the above, the other choice is creating a routine in your life to take on non-urgent work without pressure.</p><h2>2. Choosing to work now</h2><h3>Make time for Q2 or it won't happen</h3><p>The anti-dote to reactive site and app checking is&nbsp;<strong>consciously blocking out big uninterrupted chunks of time.</strong></p><p>Our mind works best when we focus on 1 task for an extended period of time, without interruptions.</p><p>If you have email or social media open at all times, you'll get interrupted.</p><h3>Decide to set specific times aside</h3><p>When was the last time you had 2+ hours to work on non-urgent tasks? A time when you didn’t check any distractions and had no one interrupt you?</p><p>If you have to starch your memory extensively to find an answer, then it may be time for a change.</p><p>Uninterrupted time is crucial for productivity, particularly when it comes to dealing with complex or ambiguous tasks.</p><p>It’s also crucial to specify what you’re going to work on. Without a clear intention, the urgent work and unproductive habits will take over.</p><p>The simplest way to do this is to put a big block on the calendar and put what you need to do as the title. You can also add any links or notes to the description.</p><p>When in your week can you do this? When can you make time for futures oriented, important work?</p><h3>Choose to work because you can</h3><p>The last point may well be the most important one. Much of our time, we don’t choose to work. We’re forced to do so by our circumstances. That puts us in a defensive position.</p><p>But we can actively&nbsp;<em>choose</em>&nbsp;to do work. Choose to write that email. Choose to reach out to someone. Choose to start working on the next project. Go on offense.</p><p>Fear is the default motivator for many of us. If I don't do this, I will [insert unpleasant consequences here].</p><p>There are other ways, other internal narratives that we can use.</p><p>"I'm doing this because I have the time and I'm alert and able.""I'll do this because the sooner I do it, the better.""I'll get this done now because it would be awesome if it existed."</p><p>Instead of focusing on what happens if you&nbsp;<em>don't</em>&nbsp;do something, focus on what happens if you&nbsp;<em>do</em>.</p><p>Switch from the fear of consequences to desire for a specific awesome version of the future.</p><p><strong>When you do block out a 2 hour block of time and find yourself with nothing urgent to do, choose to work.</strong>&nbsp;Because you can. Because you want to create something awesome.

<p>Facebook has given an ultimatum for WhatsApp users to either share their data with Facebook or leave the service. And that date is February 8th.</p>
<p>One of the most appealing things about WhatsApp is it’s end to end encryption. Even though their are other chat apps, no one provides end to end encryption to chats by default other than WhatsApp and Signal. </p>
<p>Not even Telegram provide encryption by default, and you need to start a secret chat to enable end to end encryption.</p>
<p>One of the most important things in iOS 14 is the ability for users see what kind of data apps are collecting from their users. </p>

<p>So in light of all this I went through the top 10 social networking/chat apps to see how much data they are collecting in comparison to Signal, and explain why I won’t use Signal and what we can do instead.</p>
<h2>The top 10 social media/chat apps</h2>

<h2>Telegram</h2>
<p>Telegram is one of the better apps when we compare with the others in this group. They collect relatively small amount of data.</p>
<p>It is currently the number 1 in my region, Telegram is extremely popular in my region because it provides a great way to share pirated content. </p>
<p>There is no limit to the file size that you can upload on Telegram, and there is no limit for the number of users that a Telegram group can have.</p>
<p>This makes it an ideal place for people to share pirated copies of movies, games, songs in groups with hundreds of users.</p>

<p>I’m bit reluctant to use Telegram due to its poor user interface, and its connections to Russia.</p>
<p>To clarify what I meant by poor user interface, on the android device that I tried Telegram, I was unable to select multiple chats, and deleting a chat is a multi step process. It doesn’t have to be that complicated.</p>
<h2><strong>WhatsApp</strong> </h2>
<p>WhatsApp is currently the number 2 in my region, and when compared with Telegram, WhatsApp is collecting a decent amount of data to track you.</p>

<h2>Facebook and <strong>Messenger</strong> </h2>
<p>Facebook is a vacuumed of user data, they collect everything that they can get their hands on.</p>
<p>The Messenger app is also no different to the Facebook app. I’m not installing either of them, no matter how much Facebook mobile website tries to funnel me to installing their Messenger app.</p>

<h2>IMO</h2>
<p>IMO is also a chat app with a niche audience. Even though it’s not popular in the USA, IMO is quite popular in Southeast Asia as a platform to share adult content, like a live cam website.</p>
<p>But it too has chat capabilities just like any other chat app, and it too collects a decent amount of user data, even more than WhatsApp.</p>

<h2>Viber</h2>
<p>When it comes to my friends and relatives Viber is the second most popular chat app behind WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger.</p>
<p>Especially girls love using Viber because of the large variety of stickers, that they can select in the app.</p>
<p>Personally, I don’t like using viber, and find it too bloated. Yes, the stickers are nice, but what I need is a chat app, not a sticker app.</p>
<p>And it appears Viber is also collecting lot of data as well.</p>

<p><strong>I’m skipping Parent control app, because even though listed as a chat app it does not appear to look like a chat app.</strong></p>
<h2>Signal</h2>
<p>When it comes to chat apps, it’s unbelievable to see that Signal is basically not collecting any user data.</p>
<p>They also provide end to end encrypted chats by default.</p>
<p>The lack of collecting user data is a sign that they don’t need to sell user data as a way to make money. </p>
<p>Signal is currently depending on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://signal.org/donate" target="_blank">donations</a>, and even if they find other ways to monetize the service, as long as they are not collecting data, we can be sure that our data is not being used to monetize the service.</p>

<h2>BOTIM</h2>
<p>I have not used the BOTIM and I have no idea why it’s there in the charts ahead of other chat apps like WeChat and Line.</p>
<p>Maybe BOTIM has a niche audience that I don’t know about.</p>

<h2>Why <strong>I’</strong>n not/<strong>can’t</strong> use Signal</h2>
<p>I love to use Signal, I wish everyone can use Signal, and I wish I can use Signal, but I just can’t.</p>
<p>I have installed any tried using Signal couple of times, but whenever I install it it’s basically a ghost town. No one is using it and I can’t convince anyone else to join, because none of their friends on Signal either.</p>
<p>The network effect on WhatsApp is strong, and almost all of my non techie regular WhatsApp users will just accept the new TOS and will share their data with Facebook. They just want a chat app and that is what WhatsApp is providing.</p>
<p>Even if I install Signal, I will be the only one in my network using it. And no one will be willing to use Signal just to chat with me.</p>
<p>I will try to keep my personal messages away from WhatsApp as much as possible, but. I won’t be able to leave my WhatsApp groups. I will use iMessages whenever I’m chatting with someone with an Apple device.</p>
<h2>What we <strong>actually</strong> need</h2>
<p>What we actually need is not Signal, WhatsApp or Telegram. What we need is a protocol, just like email but for chat and apps that build on top of this protocol.</p>
<p>There are such protocols, but no major company is willing to use them for their chat apps.</p>
<p>If we have such protocol, then we will be able to switch apps with ease, without having to worry about the network effect or losing out chats just like we can do with our emails.</p>
<p>So please everyone try to invest on a protocol, not on an individual app.</p>

<p>Network segmenting firewall, DHCP, DNS with Unbound, domain blocking and much more</p>
<h2><span id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>
<div>
<p>In this guide we’re going to take a look at how we can use cheap and “low end” hardware to build an amazing OpenBSD router with firewalling capabilities, segmented local area networks, DNS with domain blocking, DHCP and more.</p>
<p>We will use a setup in which the router segments the local area network (LAN) into three separate networks, one for the grown-ups in the house, one for the children, and one for public facing servers, such as a private web server or mail server. We will also look at how we can use DNS to block out ads, porn, and other websites on the Internet. The OpenBSD router can also be used on small to mid-size offices.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="why-a-firewall"><span id="Why_a_firewall">Why a firewall?</span></h2>
<p>Almost no matter how you connect to the Internet from your home or office, you need a real firewall between you and the modem or router that your ISP has provided you with.</p>
<p>Very rarely do consumer-grade modems or routers get firmware updates and they are often vulnerable to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_router#Security">network attacks</a>&nbsp;that turns these devices into&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet">botnets</a>, such like the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirai_(malware)">Mirai malware</a>. Many consumer-grade modems and routers is to blame for some of the largest&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_denial_of_service_attack">distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks</a>.</p>
<p>A firewall between you and your ISP modem or router cannot protect your modem or router device against attacks, but it can protect your computers and devices on the inside of the network, and it can help you monitor and control the traffic that comes and goes to and from your local network.</p>
<p>Without a firewall between your local network and the ISP modem or router you could basically consider this an open door policy, like leaving the door to your house wide open, because you cannot trust the equipment from your ISP.</p>
<p>It is always a really good idea to put a real firewall between your local network and the Internet, and with OpenBSD you get an very solid solution.</p>
<h2 id="the-hardware"><span id="The_hardware">The hardware</span></h2>
<p>You don’t have to buy expensive hardware to get an effective router and firewall for your house or office. Even with cheap and “low end” hardware you can get a very solid solution.</p>
<p>I have build multiple solutions with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/Q1900DC-ITX/">ASRock Q1900DC-ITX</a>&nbsp;motherboard that comes with an Intel Quad-Core Celeron processor.</p>
<p><img src="https://hakk.gg/wp-content/themes/veen/assets/images/transparent.gif" data-lazy="true" data-src="https://www.unixsheikh.com/includes/img/asrock-q1900dc-itx.png" alt="ASRock Q1900DC-ITX motherboard"></p>
<p>I’ll admit, it’s a pretty “crappy” motherboard, but it gets the job done and I have several builds that have run very solid for many years on gigabit networks with full saturation and the firewall, DNS, etc. working “overtime” and the CPU hardly breaks a sweat.</p>
<p>The ASRock Q1900DC-ITX motherboard has the advantage that it comes with a DC-In Jack that is compatible with a 9~19V power adapter, making it very power saving. Unfortunatly the ASRock Q1900DC-ITX motherboard is no longer made, but I’m just using it as an example, I have used several other cheap boards as well.</p>
<p>I have also used the ASRock Q1900-ITX (it doesn’t come with the DC-In Jack) combined with a PicoPSU.</p>
<p><img src="https://hakk.gg/wp-content/themes/veen/assets/images/transparent.gif" data-lazy="true" data-src="https://www.unixsheikh.com/includes/img/picopsu.png" alt="PicoPSU power supply"></p>
<p>You can find different brands and versions of the PicoPSU, some are better quality than others. I have two different brands, the original and a cheaper knockoff, both performs very well and they save quite a bit of power contrary to running with a normal power supply.</p>
<p>Last, I am using a cheap Intel knockoff quad port NIC found on Ebay like this one:</p>
<p><img src="https://hakk.gg/wp-content/themes/veen/assets/images/transparent.gif" data-lazy="true" data-src="https://www.unixsheikh.com/includes/img/intel-quad-nic.png" alt="Intel Quad NIC"></p>
<p>I know it is better to use quality hardware, especially on a network that you care about, but this tutorial is about how you can get away with using fairly cheep hardware and still get an extremely useful product that will continue to serve you well for many years – at least that is my experience.</p>
<p>I recommend that you look for a low power mini ITX board with hardware&nbsp;<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/amd64.html">supported by OpenBSD</a>, such as an Intel Celeron or Intel i3 processor. These boards are typically cheap, less power hungry, and they don’t take up much space. I don’t recommend using the Intel Atom CPU if you have a gigabit network as they usually choke because they can’t handle the amount of traffic, but your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>You might also need a couple of cheap gigabit switches for the segmented local network, at least if you have more than one computer you want to connect to the same LAN 🙂</p>
<h2 id="why-openbsd"><span id="Why_OpenBSD">Why OpenBSD?</span></h2>
<p>In truth, you can get a similar setup with one of the other&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_BSD_operating_systems">BSD flavors</a>&nbsp;or one of the many different&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution">Linux distribution</a>, but&nbsp;<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>&nbsp;is specifically very well suited and designed for this kind of task. Not only does it come with all the needed software in the base install, but it also has significantly better security and tons of improved mitigations already build-in into the operating system. I&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unixsheikh.com/articles/openbsd-is-fantastic.html">highly recommend</a>&nbsp;OpenBSD over any other operating system for this kind of task.</p>
<p>This guide is not going to show you how to install OpenBSD. If you haven’t done that before I recommend you spin up some kind of virtual machine or see if you have some unused and supported hardware laying around you can play with. OpenBSD is one of the easiest and quickest operating systems to install. Don’t be afraid of the non-gui approach, once you have tried it you will really appreciate the simplicity. Use the default settings when in doubt.</p>
<p>Before you endeavor on this journey make sure to reference the OpenBSD documentation! Not only is everything very well documented, but you will most likely find all the answers you need right there. Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/faq/index.html">OpenBSD FAQ</a>&nbsp;and take a look at the different&nbsp;<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/">manual pages</a>&nbsp;for the software we’re going to use.</p>
<p>Another really useful place to find general information about OpenBSD is the&nbsp;<a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-misc">OpenBSD mailing list archives</a>. Also make sure to stay up to date with relevant information by subscribing to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/mail.html">Announcements and security advisories</a>&nbsp;mailing list.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, please consider&nbsp;<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/donations.html">supporting OpenBSD</a>! Even if you don’t use OpenBSD on a daily basis, but perhaps make use of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.openssh.com/">OpenSSH</a>&nbsp;on Linux, then you’re really using software from the OpenBSD project. Consider making a small, but steady donation to support the further development of all the great software the OpenBSD developers make!</p>
<h2 id="the-network"><span id="The_network">The network</span></h2>
<p>A router is basically a device that regulate network traffic between two or more separate networks. The router will ensure that network traffic intended for the local network doesn’t run out into the wild on the Internet, and traffic on the Internet, that is not intended for your local network, stays on the Internet.</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b><br>
A router is sometimes also referred to as a gateway, which generally is alright, but in truth a real gateway joins dissimilar systems, while a router joins similar networks. An example of a gateway would be a device that joins a PC network with a telecommunications network.</p>
<p>In this tutorial we’re building a router and we have 4 networks of the same type to work with. One is the Internet and the other three are the internally segmented local area networks (LANs). Some people prefer to work with virtual LANs, but in this tutorial we’re going to use the quad port NIC from the illustration above. You can achieve the same result by using multiple one port NICs if you prefer that, you just have to make sure that you have enough room and free PCI slots on the motherboard. You can also use the Ethernet port on the motherboard itself, but it depends on the driver and support for the device. I have had no problems using the Realtek PCI gigabit Ethernet controller that normally comes with many motherboards even though I recommend Intel over Realtek.</p>
<p>Of course you don’t have to segment the network into several parts if you don’t need that, and it will be very easy to change the settings from this guide, but I have decided to use this approach in order to show you how you can protect your children by segmenting their network into a separate LAN that not only gets ad and porn blocking using DNS blocking (all the segments gets that), but you can even whitelist the parts of the Internet you want them to have access to. The last part about whitelisting is difficult and generally not recommended unless your children requires only very limited access, but it is doable with some work, and the guide is going to show you one way you can do that.</p>
<p>This is an illustration of the network we’re going to setup:</p>
<pre><code>
                       Internet
                          |
                    xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
                    ISP Modem (WAN)
                      10.24.0.23
                          |
                       OpenBSD
                      10.24.0.50
                  (router/firewall)

192.168.1.1          192.168.2.1          192.168.3.1
LAN1 switch          LAN2 switch          LAN3 switch
     |                    |                    |
     -- 192.168.1.x       -- 192.168.2.x       -- 192.168.3.2
     |  Grown-up PC       |  Child PC1         |  Public web server

<p>The IP addresses that begins with 10.24.0 are whatever IP addresses your ISP router or modem gives you, it may be something very different. The IP addresses beginning with 192.168 are the IP addresses that we’re going to use in the guide for our local area network (LAN).</p>
<p>The guide does not deal with any kind of wireless connectivity. Wireless chip firmware is notoriously buggy and exploitable and I recommend you don’t use any kind of wireless connectivity, if you can do without. If you do require wireless connectivity I strongly recommend that you disable wireless access from the ISP modem or router completely (if possible), and then buy the best wireless router you can find and put it behind the firewall in an isolated segment instead. That way should your wireless device ever be compromised you can better control the outcome and limit the damage. You can further setup the wireless router such that any devices connected to it have their own IPs that pass directly through the wireless router, but at …</p></div></section></div>

<p>This is the fourth part of a four part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/12/04/collections-that-dothraki-horde-part-i-barbarian-couture/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/12/11/collections-that-dothraki-horde-part-ii-subsistence-on-the-hoof/">II</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/12/18/collections-that-dothraki-horde-part-iii-horse-fiddles/">III</a>) look at the Dothraki from George R. R. Martin’s <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> and HBO’s <em>Game of Thrones</em>.  We’re looking at, in particular, if Martin’s claim that the Dothraki are “an amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures” can be sustained in the face of even basic knowledge about historical Steppe and Great Plains nomadic peoples.</p>



<p>Last week, we <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/12/18/collections-that-dothraki-horde-part-iii-horse-fiddles/">concluded </a>that the vast majority of Dothraki culture, social organization, economic practices and family structure are effectively completely untethered from the historical realities of effectively any of the literally dozens of historical Great Plains Native Americans or Steppe nomads.  This week, we’re going to close out our look by discussing Dothraki warfare.  We’ll start with the visual – weapons and armor – and then move to the conceptual – strategy, operations and tactics.</p>

<p>Finally, as a reminder both of what we are investigating, <strong>the key statement we are really assessing here is <a href="https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/6040/">this one by George R.R. Martin</a>:</strong></p>



<blockquote><p>The Dothraki were actually fashioned as an amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures… Mongols and Huns, certainly, but also Alans, Sioux, Cheyenne, and various other Amerindian tribes… seasoned with a dash of pure fantasy.</p></blockquote>



<p>It is not the <em>existence</em> of a fantasy culture which draws our attention, but the explicit declaration that this fantasy culture is not merely inspired, but ‘fashioned as an amalgam’ of real cultures, which both existed in the past <em>and still exist today</em>, with only ‘a dash of pure fantasy.’  That line is important, to be clear, <strong>because it presents the fictional Dothraki as a statement on historical Native American and Eurasian nomads</strong> and – when combined with Martin’s statements that he relies on history to inform his work – that this statement is based in some sort of historical reality.</p>



<p>Which it isn’t.  But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.</p>



<h2>Where There’s a Whip…</h2>



<p>The Dothraki are described as having three main weapons: <strong>bows </strong>(<em>AGoT</em>, 86, 555, 558, 597, 669), <strong>whips </strong>(<em>AGoT</em>, 86, 194, 493, 555, 596, 669) and a <strong>curved sword called an <em>arakh</em></strong> (<em>AGoT</em> 85, 86, 327, 493, 555, 556, 559, 560, 596, 597, 669, 674); <strong>of these, the <em>arakh</em> is clearly the most prominent</strong> (I am sure I have missed a reference to a weapon here or there, but I hope the citations here give some sense of the relative weight each is given – the <em>arakh</em> is the most frequently mentioned by some distance).  When a Dothraki warrior enters <em>Vaes Dothrak</em>, each, “unbelted his <em>arakh</em> and handed it to a waiting slave, and any other weapons he carried as well” – after the <em>arakh</em>, the other weapons are seemingly afterthoughts (<em>AGoT</em>, 327).  The prominence of the <em>arakh</em> in the narrative is underscored by the fact that it is the only one of these weapons whose name we learn in Dothraki, or which is described in terms of its shape or special function (<em>AGoT</em>, 85), while the bows and whips remain just bows and whips (ironic, as it was Steppe <em>bows</em>, not Steppe swords, which were unusual).</p>



<p>We might dismiss this as simply an accident of Daenerys’ perspective – that, being Westerosi, she focuses on the weapon most meaningful to the Westerosi – but that’s clearly not true.  After all, the <strong>offering of an <em>arakh</em> is how Daenerys’ loyal followers demonstrate their fealty to her</strong>, in a ceremony that is clearly Dothraki, not Westerosi (<em>AGoT</em>, 674).  It is also, I should note,<a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Arakh"> the only weapon we see <em>non</em>-Dothraki using that is clearly identified as being foreign and typical of the Dothraki</a>.  It remains special through the eyes of multiple point-of-view characters, including military men.</p>



<p>(And, as an aside, now that we are this far in, it seems obvious but worth saying that the fact that Martin has no Dothraki viewpoint characters in his narrative is hardly a saving grace; it merely intensifies the ‘view of a savage culture from outside’ effect.  As we’ll see, this makes perfect sense given what seem to be the actual inspirations for his depiction.)</p>



<p><strong>The prominence of a curved iron (or steel) sword lets us rule out a Great Plains Native American inspiration for this kit right out</strong>; the sword was never a significant part of Plains Native American armament (the lack of tool-metal production in the Americas prior to European contact means that there was no indigenous sword-making tradition, although the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macuahuitl"><em>maquahuitl</em> </a>represents a clever sort of ‘sharpened club’ design).  Even after contact, it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that the expense of trading for a sword wouldn’t have been justified by its utility over a steel axe which might also double as a tool (on axes, see W. Lee, “The Military Revolution of Native North America: Firearms, Forts and Politics” in <em>Empires and Indigenes</em> (2011), 62-3).  <strong>So we must turn to the Eurasian Steppe</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>And immediately we run into problems</strong>, not that any of these weapons are <em>wrong</em> per se, but <strong>that their proportion and prominence is all mixed up and that there are other, far more important weapons missing.</strong></p>



<p><strong>For a Steppe nomad, by far, above and away, the most important weapon was the bow.</strong>  The Armenians literally called the Mongols “the nation of archers” (May, <em>Mongol Art of War</em>, 43).  Nomads spent the most time learning the bow (May, <em>op. cit.</em> 42-49) and it was the one indispensable weapon.  Indeed, so indispensable that nomads were generally required to have several; the <em>Liao Shi</em> records that Khitan nomad warriors were required to possess four bows and 400 arrows, while John de Plano Carpini reports that the Mongols all needed to have 2-3 bows and three larger quivers (May, <em>op. cit. </em>49-50).  <strong>The Steppe bow itself would also have looked unusual in both shape and construction</strong> to a Westerosi observer either strung or unstrung – they were composite bows, made with a wood core, a backing of horn and a rigid end-piece (called a <em>siyah</em> in Arabic) and were generally drawn with the use of a thumb-ring to reduce strain on the thumb (May, <em>op. cit.</em>, 50-1).  This unique construction allowed these bows to reach draw weights and launch energies equivalent to the far larger yew longbows of England and Wales and still be compact enough to use from horseback.</p>

<p>(I should note that the bow was <em>also</em> the paramount weapon for the Native American horse-borne nomads of the Great Plains, at least until it came into competition with firearms, though my understanding is that Native American bows were not as powerful as Steppe bows).</p>

You can see here the unique shape and multi-part construction of the Steppe bow (notice how the material on the tips, the belly and the spine of the bow are all different) which allows it so much power in such a small frame.<br>Also, notice the very nice and colorful traditional Mongolian clothing – not leather and rough furs!</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>But even after the bow, the sword is not first.  Or even close to first.</strong>  Or, indeed, <em>even on the list</em>!  The Khitan regulations I mentioned included four bows, two spears (one ‘long’ and one ‘short’), a club, an axe and a halberd, but no sword.  John de Plano Carpini describes the full kit as two or three bows with quivers, an axe, ropes, and swords <em>only for the wealthy</em> (May. <em>op. cit.</em>, 50).  Speaking more broadly, May notes that spears (used as lances from horseback) seem universal in accounts of the Mongols, but “accounts are contradictory regarding whether these [swords] were universally used” (May, <em>op. cit.</em>, 52).  While May supposes that the <em>ughurgh-a</em>, the Mongolian lasso, might have been used in combat – and it may well have – we have no definitive evidence of it.  If it was ever a weapon, it doesn’t seem to have been an important one.</p>



<p><strong>In short, while the Dothraki’s weapons are an <em>arakh</em>-sword, a whip, and a bow in that order, the Mongol’s chief weapons were his bow, followed by his backup bow, followed by his <em>other </em>backup bow, followed by his spear, and then his axe and only then followed by a sword, should he have one, which he might well not</strong>.  The reason for preferring an axe or a spear for the humble nomad should not be too surprising – iron in quantity could be hard to get on the Steppe.  Spears and axes are not only weapons, but also useful hunting and survival tools; swords are generally weapons only.  <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/18/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-mining/">Nomads generally cannot do their own metal working</a>, so swords would have to be imported.  Moreover, even in a melee, the first recourse would be to a spear, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/05/08/collections-the-battle-of-helms-deep-part-ii-total-warg/">whose reach on horseback was a huge advantage</a>,<strong> making a sword an expensive imported foreign luxury <em>backup</em> weapon with no additional utility</strong>.  Nevertheless, it’s clear that Steppe nomads, once successful and moving into agrarian areas, liked to acquire swords – swords are effective weapons! – but the sword was about the furthest thing from the core of Mongol culture the way the <em>arakh</em> is practically the <em>symbol</em> of Dothraki culture.</p>

<p><strong>The other issue, of course, is the <em>arakh</em> itself.</strong>  Martin describes the weapons as “long razor-sharp blades, half sword and half scythe” (<em>AGoT</em>, 85) and goes back to that scythe analogy (e.g. <em>ASoS</em>, 245).  It seems generally asserted that what Martin means by this is something close to a scimitar (I have to confess, I haven’t found anywhere that Martin says …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div id="datatxt80164510read"><div data-den="denmark"><div><p>The United States on Thursday announced that it will modify the selection process for H-1B visa, giving priority to salary and skills instead of the current lottery procedures. 
</p><p>
 The final rule to be published in the federal register on January 8, officials said, is aimed to protect the economic interests of US workers and better ensure the most highly skilled foreign workers benefit from the temporary employment programme. 
</p><p>
     The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China. 
</p><p> Modifying the H-1B cap selection process will incentivise employers to offer higher salaries, and/or petition for higher-skilled positions, and establish a more certain path for businesses to achieve personnel needs and remain globally competitive, said </p><keyword keytype="Company" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="US-Citizenship-and-Immigration-Services" actualkeyword="US Citizenship and Immigration Services">US Citizenship and Immigration Services</keyword><p>. 
</p><p>
     The final rule will be effective 60 days after its publication in the Federal Register. The next H-1B visa filing season is slated to start on April 1. 
</p><p>
 "The H-1B temporary visa programme has been exploited and abused by employers primarily seeking to fill entry-level positions and reduce overall business costs," said </p><keyword keytype="Company" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="USCIS" actualkeyword="USCIS">USCIS</keyword><p> Deputy Director for Policy Joseph Edlow. 
</p><p><span>Advertisement</span></p><figure><div></div></figure><hr><p> "The current H-1B random selection process makes it difficult for businesses to plan their hiring, fails to leverage the programme to compete for the best and brightest international workforce, and has predominantly resulted in the annual influx of foreign labor placed in low-wage positions at the expense of US workers," he said. 
</p><p>
 This effort will only affect H-1B registrations (or petitions, if the registration process is suspended) submitted by prospective petitioners seeking to file H-1B cap-subject petitions. 
</p><p>
     It will be implemented for both the H-1B regular cap and the H-1B advanced degree exemption, but it will not change the order of selection between the two as established by the H-1B registration final rule, USCIS said. 
</p><p> The </p><keyword keytype="Company" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="Department-of-Homeland-Security" keynameseo="department-of-homeland-security" actualkeyword="department of homeland security">Department of Homeland Security</keyword><p> had previously published a notice of proposed rulemaking on November 2, 2020. It carefully considered the public comments received before deciding to publish the proposed regulations as a final rule, USCIS said. 
</p><p>
     According to the final rule, a version of which was released by Department of Homeland Security, Instead, a registration system that faithfully implements the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) while prioritising registrations based on wage level within each cap will incentivize H-1B employers to offer higher wages, or to petition for positions requiring higher skills and higher-skilled aliens that are commensurate with higher wage levels, to increase the likelihood of selection and eligibility to file an H-1B cap-subject petition. 
</p><p>
 Moreover, it will maximize H-1B cap allocations, so that they more likely will go to the best and brightest workers; and it will disincentivise abuse of the H-1B programme to fill relatively lower-paid, lower-skilled positions, which is a significant problem under the present selection system, it said. 
</p><p> "While administering a random lottery system is reasonable, it is inconsiderate of Congress's statutory purposes for the H-1B program and its administration," said the final rule. 
</p><p>
 The changes in this final rule will apply to all registrations, including those for the advanced degree exemption, submitted on or after the effective date of the final rule. 
</p><p>
     As per Congressional-mandated cap, USCIS in one year can issue a maximum of 65,000 H-1B visas. It can also issue another 20,000 H-1B visas to those foreign students who have completed higher studies from a US university in STEM subjects. 
</p><p> During the public notice period, the department said, several commenters expressed support for the rule and the need to stop visa fraud, abuse, and flooding of petitions by certain staffing or consulting companies. 
</p><p>
     One commenter said the proposed rule would disincentivize companies from abusing the H-1B programme and harming US workers. Other commenters said the proposed rule would decrease potential visa abuse by employers and make sure all workers were paid according to their skillset as employers no longer would be able to lower labor expenses by hiring foreign workers. 
</p><p>
 Another said that the proposed rule would have a positive impact on US employees and college educated US citizens who take out loans for their education by making it harder for technology companies to discriminate against US citizens; US workers are being laid off in large numbers because corporations are outsourcing for profits; and the proposed rule is necessary because Indian corporations are acquiring US jobs, it said.

<p>Welcome to the new world of engineering management! You’ve entered a brave new world that will be significantly different than your life as an individual contributor. Here are some tips I’ve learned over time.</p>



<p>You have one goal: <strong>maximize your team’s productive work</strong>.</p>



<p>That’s it. Do that and you will succeed. Do anything else and you fail. Life is simple.</p>



<p>Let’s break that down into a few key ideas.</p>



<h2>Maximize Your Team Member’s Potential</h2>



<p>First, let’s assess the type of engineers you may have on your team.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Solid</strong> = Can solve well defined problems.</li><li><strong>Bad</strong> = Can’t solve well defined problems.</li><li><strong>Junior</strong> = Bad engineers but have the excuse of being very early in their career or being put into a new situation.</li><li><strong>Leaders</strong> = Can determine the problems that need to be solved and help others get the necessary work done.</li></ul>



<p>How should you manage the different types of engineers?</p>



<p><strong>Engineering Leaders</strong>. If you are a new manager, you are likely the only Leader in your team. If you are lucky enough to have team members that are Leaders, your life will be easy. Just keep giving them tough problems and stay out of their way.</p>



<p><strong>Solid Engineers</strong>. These engineers will hopefully make up most of your team. They can tackle well defined problems, so to maximize their current utility, work on giving them the minimum definition they need and then get out of their way. To maximize their long term success, you want to try and turn Solid Engineers into Leaders. One way to do this is to keep giving them tougher problems with less definition and let them grow into Leaders.</p>



<p><strong>Bad Engineers. </strong>Hopefully you don’t inherit any Bad Engineers. If you do, you need to quickly assess whether it is worth the management effort to get them to Solid Engineers, or get them off your team (either by firing or a transfer to another team).</p>



<p><strong>Junior Engineers. </strong>As a new manager, you are likely to have several Junior Engineers. I’ve found that everyone is happiest if both the Junior Engineer and yourself acknowledge that Junior Engineers do not produce useful work today. Instead, both the Junior Engineer and yourself should focus your efforts on turning them into a Solid Engineer as soon as possible. As a manager, you can accelerate their growth by (1) giving them training tasks, i.e. tasks that may not be the most relevant to your team’s productivity today, but help them grow as an individual and (2) giving them extra 1 on 1 attention. While this extra effort will consume significant time now, you can have a Solid Engineer within a few months. Plus, this extra effort is nothing compared to the effort you would later need to spend to move someone from a Bad Engineer to Solid Engineer.</p>



<h2>Maximize Your Team Output</h2>



<p>Now that we have covered the basics of maximizing individual team member’s performance, let’s move on to some tips for maximizing your whole team’s output.</p>



<h3>Your Output</h3>



<p>First, you need to plan that your personal coding output will basically be zero. You may occasionally do some coding, but you need to remember that you are judged on your team’s output now, not just your own. So any coding project you do needs to be weighed against the opportunity cost of you spending that same amount of time improving your team members. I’ve found that this likely means you will only end up coding (1) early prototypes, (2) refactorings, or (3) nice to have projects. Instead, you need to switch to thinking about your team’s output.</p>



<h3>Meetings</h3>



<p>As a new manager, your life can easily be consumed by meetings. You will now be in charge of 1:1s and team meetings, and also get invited to lots of cross team meetings. My biggest regret as an early manager is saying yes to every meeting. I personally am fine with delegating work, but my weakness was that I still wanted to know everything that was going on. Before you know it, you will spend all day running from meeting to meeting. This is bad for three reasons: (1) you don’t have time to think, (2) you can’t adapt to emergencies and (3) your team members will become too shy to schedule 1:1s with you since they assume you are doing something important.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So fight the good fight and minimize the number of meetings. I advocate the following meeting philosophy:</p>



<ul><li>All meetings should have a predefined agenda, even 1:1s.</li><li>Have the minimum number of people in the meeting (ie prefer 1:1s or small groups)</li><li>Minimize the number of meetings that are just status updates. Most of these can likely be replaced by email, Slack, or a document.</li><li>Group meetings into blocks. I’ve had success with the following type of meeting schedule:<ul><li>Monday AM: Sprint starts / big team meetings.</li><li>Monday PM: 1:1s.</li><li>Tuesday: No recurring meetings.</li><li>Wednesday: Cross team meetings.</li><li>Thursday: No recurring meetings.</li><li>Friday AM: Sprint check ins / sprint end meetings.</li><li>Friday PM: 1:1s.</li></ul></li></ul>



<h3>Documents</h3>



<p>A well written document is one of your two new best friends. The power of a well written document is that it (1) forces you to clarify your thoughts, (2) provides a clear documentation trail and (3) prevents you from repeating yourself. There is nothing worse than having a meeting with a lot of people that leads to some very important decisions, but then no one can seem to remember what those decisions are. Write, write, and write some more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Do Productive Work</h2>



<p>At this point your team should be doing lots of work. But how do you guarantee that this work is productive? Let me introduce you to your second new best friend: <a href="https://www.whatmatters.com/get-started/">Objectives and Key Results</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main principles of OKRs are:</p>



<ul><li>Objectives should be clearly defined aspirational goals</li><li>Key results are specific quantitative measures</li><li>Each objective should be supported by 3-5 key results</li><li>Ideally key results can be measured on a 0-100% scale</li><li>To make key results push the boundaries of your team, it is recommended that<ul><li>A key result is considered achieved if &gt;=70% is achieved</li><li>Key results are not tied to pay</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>Many companies use a mix of yearly and quarterly OKRs. I personally find the quarter OKRs most useful as a management tool. The yearly OKRs are more useful for upper management to set clear company wide goals, but I’ve found that setting yearly team goals are not very useful unless they directly tie into a company OKR. Instead, I would focus on writing solid quarterly team OKRs.</p>



<p>For OKRs to truly work, you need to get buy in from the whole team. In order to get buy in, you should:</p>



<ol><li>Do the necessary prep work to deeply understand the company priorities and OKRs.</li><li>Involve your team members in developing the team OKRs.</li><li>Set up a central dashboard to track your progress on OKRs.</li><li>Make that dashboard a central part of your meetings. Kick off team meetings by looking at the dashboard and calling out progress.</li><li>Have a retrospective at the end of the recording period to understand why your team succeeded or failed to achieve OKRs.</li><li>Rinse and repeat. Your first several quarters of OKRs likely won’t go well. But please don’t give up until you have tried for at least 4 quarters in a row.</li></ol>



<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>Good luck, hope these tips help!</p>

Given its safety, </span><span>w</span><span>e call for immediate widespread increased vitamin D intakes</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>Vitamin D modulates thousands of genes and many aspects of immune function, both innate and adaptive. The scientific evidence</span><span>1</span><span>&nbsp;shows that:</span></p><p><span>Vitamin D is well known to be essential, but most people do not get enough. Two common definitions of inadequacy are deficiency &lt; 20ng/ml (50nmol/L), the target of most governmental organizations, and insufficiency &lt; 30ng/ml (75nmol/L), the target of several medical societies &amp; experts.</span><span>2</span><span>&nbsp;Too many people have levels below these targets. </span><span>Rates of vitamin D deficiency &lt;20ng/ml exceed 33% of the population in most of the world, and most estimates of insufficiency &lt;30ng/ml are well over 50% (but much higher in many countries).</span><span>3</span><span>&nbsp;Rates are even higher in winter, and several groups have notably worse deficiency: the overweight, those with dark skin (especially far from the equator), and care home residents. These same groups face increased COVID-19 risk.</span></p><p><span>It has been shown that 3875 IU (97mcg) daily is required for 97.5% of people to reach 20ng/ml, and 6200 IU (155mcg) for 30ng/ml,</span><span>4</span><span>&nbsp;intakes far above all national guidelines. Unfortunately, the report that set the US RDA included an admitted statistical error in which required intake was calculated to be ~10x too low.</span><span>4</span><span>&nbsp;Numerous calls in the academic literature to raise official recommended intakes had not yet resulted in increases by the time SARS-CoV-2 arrived. Now, many papers indicate that vitamin D affects COVID-19 more strongly than most other health conditions, with increased risk at levels &lt; 30ng/ml (75nmol/L) and severely greater risk &lt; 20ng/ml (50nmol/L).</span><span>1</span></p><p><span>Evidence to date </span><span>suggests </span><span>the possibility that the COVID-19 pandemic sustains itself in large part &nbsp;through infection of those with low vitamin D, and that deaths are concentrated largely in those with deficiency. The mere possibility that this is so should compel urgent gathering of more vitamin D data. </span><span>Even without more data</span><span>, </span><span>the </span><span>preponderance </span><span>of evidence indicates that </span><span>increased vitamin D would help reduce infections, hospitalizations, ICU admissions, &amp; deaths</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>Decades of safety data show that vitamin D has very low risk: </span><span>Toxicity would be extremely rare with the recommendations here. The risk of insufficient levels far outweighs any risk from levels that seem to provide most of the protection against COVID-19, and this is notably different from drugs. Vitamin D is much safer than steroids, such as dexamethasone, the most widely accepted treatment to have also demonstrated a large COVID-19 benefit. Vitamin D’s safety is more like that of face masks. </span><span>There is no need to wait for further clinical trials to increase use of something so safe, </span><span>especially when remedying high rates of deficiency/insufficiency should already be a priority</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>Therefore, we call on all governments, doctors, and healthcare workers worldwide to immediately recommend and implement efforts appropriate to their adult populations to increase vitamin D, at least until the end of the pandemic. Specifically to:</span></p><p><span>Many factors are known to predispose individuals to higher risk from exposure to SARS-CoV-2, such as age, being male, comorbidities, etc., but </span><span>inadequate</span><span>&nbsp;v</span><span>itamin D is by far the most easily and quickly </span><span>modifiable</span><span>&nbsp;risk factor with abundant evidence to support a large effect</span><span>. Vitamin D is inexpensive and has negligible risk compared to the considerable risk of COVID-19.</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>&nbsp;The following include 4000 IU within their tolerable intakes in official guidelines: NAM (US, Canada), SACN (UK), EFSA (Europe), Endocrine Society (international), Nordic countries, The Netherlands, Australia &amp; New Zealand, UAE, and the American Geriatrics Soc. (USA, elderly). No major agency specifies a lower tolerable intake limit. The US NAM said 4000 IU “is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects to almost all individuals.” See also [</span><span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32180081/">Giustina et al ‘20</a></span><span>].</span></p><p><span>The signatories below endorse this letter.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div role="main"><div><article><p>Modern processors are quite complex, with many parts having the potential to become a bottleneck. It is relatively easy to reason about the performance of short pieces of code, especially if memory effects are kept to a minimum. Both static analysis tools like LLVM MCA and microbenchmarks can provide a lot of information in such cases. However, the behaviour of the whole program is not just the sum of those small parts. As the code becomes larger and more complex other effects start appearing. One of such potential problems are excessive instruction cache misses.</p><p>Every program has different properties, and those large-scale effects will affect it differently. However, if its job is to execute complex logic on a small amount of data, the instruction cache is likely to become a problem at some point. The actual impact may vary significantly from codebase to codebase, which is why I won’t show any numbers in this article. Let’s consider this just a collection of ideas, but it is not easy to tell how much any of them will help for a given application.</p><p>First, let’s have a quick look at the processor front end. Below is a simplified diagram of how it is arranged in Skylake, the numbers between units are the maxima per cycle.</p><p><img loading="lazy" width="630" height="860" src="https://paweldziepak.dev/static/icache-front-end.min.2e73578fff.svg" alt="CPU front end"></p><p>Each cycle the processor fetches up to 16 bytes from the instruction cache using information from the Branch Prediction Unit to predict the control flow. The pre-decode unit determines instruction lengths and puts up to five of them in the Instruction Queue. From the Instruction Queue, up to 5 instructions (with macro-fusion) are brought each cycle to the decoders. There is one complex decoder that can handle instructions that translate to up to 4 µops and 3 simple decoders that can handle only single-µop instructions. In total, all decoders are limited to producing no more than 5 µops each cycle. Instructions that require more than 4 µops go through Microcode Sequence ROM, which emits 4 µops per cycle, and while it is active, the decoders are disabled. There is also Decoded ICache (<abbr title="Decoded Stream Buffer">DSB</abbr>) which caches decoded µops. It can emit up to 6 µops each cycle. All µops, regardless of their source, end up in the Instruction Decode Queue (IDQ). The Loop Stream Detector (LSD) detects small loops and keeps them in the queue, so that no fetched, decodes or reads from the DSB are needed during the duration of the loop. IDQ is the last part of the front end, and the queued µops continue to the back end.</p><p>From the instruction cache point of view, the front end has two weaknesses. Firstly, instructions are processed in-order which can severely limit the processor ability to hide latencies of cache misses. HyperThreading can make sure that this part of the processor still does some useful work, but it is also the source of the second problem – all resources, including the L1 instruction cache and µop cache are shared between the hardware threads.</p><p>Modern processors provide various metrics that help monitor their behaviour. However, the task of extracting the relevant data requires a proper approach if it is to be done efficiently. Top-down analysis is invaluable with helping to understand microarchitectural phenomena in large codebases. The idea is to monitor program behaviour with the <abbr title="Performance Monitoring Unit">PMU</abbr> counters and identify the bottleneck starting with the major functional parts of the CPU and then digging deeper narrowing down on the exact source of the problem. It can be done in an automated way by tools like VTune or toplev.</p><pre><code>FE    Frontend_Bound:                                      39.48 +-  0.00 % Slots

</code></pre><p>Above is an example of a toplev result. We can see that the instruction cache misses were the dominating bottleneck. Unsurprisingly instruction TLB misses also show up. On the front end bandwidth side of things, toplev points to the legacy decode pipeline. That makes perfect sense if the instructions are supplied from DSB or LSD, then there are no instruction fetches, and no cache misses.</p><p>Sometimes, the final summary may not provide sufficient information if there are changes in the code behaviour during the test. When that’s the case, a graph is likely to be a much more helpful way of presenting the results.</p><p><img loading="lazy" width="950" height="950" src="https://paweldziepak.dev/static/icache-toplev.min.2b465fdb6f.svg" alt="toplev"></p><p>Tools like toplev are great for initial identification of the problem, but once that’s done what we need is a right way for comparing different solutions. Ultimately, the most important metric is the actual performance of the program in a real-life workload. toplev still can be helpful as it shows the balance between different performance-limiting factors. What also can be useful is <code>perf stat</code> which can show the performance counter statistics. The event most relevant for us is <code>L1-icache-load-misses</code>, though there are more model-specific registers that may be of interest.</p><p>Now, that we know how to diagnose excessive instruction cache misses, let’s see what can be done to deal with this problem.</p><h2 id="avoiding-work">Avoiding work</h2><p>If the number of executed instructions is the problem, the most obvious solution is to try to reduce that number. Obviously, that’s much easier said than done, but there are some common patterns for dealing with this issue. One example would be prepared statements in databases. The general idea is that if a client knows it will send requests that have some commonality, it can tell the database engine early that the requests are going to match specific templates. This information allows the server to do as much work as possible during the preparation stage, thus reducing the amount of logic that needs to be executed for each individual request.</p><p>Extracting common patterns doesn’t have to be explicit. A server or any other kind of an application which actions depend on the user input could attempt to look for repeating patterns and cache some common parts. This is a very vague idea and most likely won’t be easily implementable in a lot of applications, but in some cases may be quite a natural solution. It also shows the main problem with the “just do less” approach – it is very application specific. On the plus, side, if this can be done, it is likely to help with the overall performance, not just the instruction cache misses.</p><p>Another potential problem is making sure that the preparation phase can really do something to help during the execution phase. If that means pre-computing some values, then it’s simple. However, if the only thing that preparation gives us is the knowledge which code paths are going to be exercised and which branches taken during the execution, it is going to be harder to take benefit from it. One option is to have some specialised code for the most common paths, C++ templates may come in handy here. If it is not easy to determine what may be the most common paths, then a just-in-time compiler may be used to generate code in the preparation stage.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><h2 id="batching-work">Batching work</h2><p>So far, we have been trying to reduce the number of executed instructions, by taking advantage of some earlier knowledge to avoiding repeating the same work. In other words, we have introduced two stages:</p><ul><li>preparation, which is performed rarely and, consequently, less performance critical</li><li>execution, which is done many times and is expected to dominate overall performance</li></ul><p>The way this can help with the instruction cache misses is that the execution stage, being smaller, is more likely to fit in the instruction cache. Whether this brings any measurable benefits depends highly on the type of the application and how much logic can be moved from execution to preparation stages.</p><p>We have already split our processing pipeline into preparation and execution stage. If the execution stage can fit in the instruction cache, we are done. However, often, that’s not the case. What we can do to improve the situation more is to split the execution into more stages. This time the goal is not to reuse work as it was with the preparation, but to group entities that need to have the same code executed for them. In other words, if the processing pipeline consists of steps A, B and C the idea is to separate them, add a queue in front of each of those stages, and then cycle through those stages each time handling multiple elements from the queue. Connections between the stages don’t have to be one-to-one, any directed graph is fine.</p><p><img loading="lazy" width="756" height="331" src="https://paweldziepak.dev/static/icache-seda.min.7259b25adc.svg" alt="SEDA diagram"></p><p>In the diagram above, there is one stage that feeds tasks to one of two stages. This could be, for example, a front-end of a database server. The first stage does some initial request processing and then, depending on whether it is a read or write, puts it in the appropriate queue. Each stage processes requests in batches, the first one warms up the instruction …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

It's like the distance a speeding car travels after the brakes are applied.</p>  <p>But Monday's <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-00955-x">study in the journal Nature Climate Change</a> calculates that a bit differently and now figures the carbon pollution already put in the air will push global temperatures to about 2.3 degrees Celsius (4.1 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since pre-industrial times.</p>  <p>Previous estimates, including those accepted by international science panels, were about a degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) less than that amount of committed warming.</p>  <p>International climate agreements set goals of limiting warming to 2 C&nbsp;(3.6 F) since pre-industrial times, with the more ambitious goal of limiting it to 1.5 C&nbsp;(2.7 F) added in Paris in 2015. The world has already warmed about 1.1 C&nbsp;(2 F).</p>  <p>"You've got some ... global warming inertia that's going to cause the climate system to keep warming, and that's essentially what we're calculating," said study co-author Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&amp;M University. "Think about the climate system like the Titanic. It's hard to turn the ship when you see the icebergs."</p>  <p>Dessler and colleagues at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab and Nanjing University in China calculated committed warming to take into account that the world has warmed at different rates in different places and that places that haven't warmed as fast are destined to catch up.</p>    <p>Places such as the Southern Ocean, surrounding Antarctica are a bit cooler, and that difference creates low-lying clouds that reflect more sun away from earth, keeping these places cooler. But this situation can't keep going indefinitely because physics dictates that cooler locations will warm up more and when they do, the clouds will dwindle and more heating will occur, Dessler said.</p>  <p>Previous studies were based on the cooler spots staying that way, but Dessler and colleagues say that's not likely.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5693652.1597940952!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/greenland-record-melt.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5693652.1597940952!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/greenland-record-melt.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5693652.1597940952!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/greenland-record-melt.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5693652.1597940952!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/greenland-record-melt.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5693652.1597940952!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/greenland-record-melt.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5693652.1597940952!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/greenland-record-melt.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>In this Aug. 16, 2019 file photo, icebergs float away as the sun rises near Kulusuk, Greenland.

Breakthrough Institute climate scientist Zeke Hausfather said the new work fits better with climate models than observational data.</p>  <p>Just because the world is bound to get more warming than international goals, that doesn't mean all is lost in the fight against global warming, said Dessler, who cautioned against what he called "climate doomers."</p>  <p>If the world gets to net zero carbon emissions soon, 2 degrees of global warming could be delayed enough so that it won't happen for centuries, giving society time to adapt or even come up with technological fixes, he said.</p>  <p>"If we don't, we're going to blow through (climate goals) in a few decades," Dessler said. "It's really the rate of warming that makes climate change so terrible. If we got a few degrees over 100,000 years, that would not be that big a deal. We can deal with that. But a few degrees over 100 years is really bad."</p></span></p></div></div>]]>
