January 4, 2021 | https://supernotes.app/blog/posts/embed-your-knowledge/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://supernotes.app/blog/posts/embed-your-knowledge/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><h2>Updates</h2><h3>Tuesday, 22nd December 2020</h3></p><div><div><p>Today we are releasing <a href="https://supernotes.app/changelog">Supernotes 1.7</a>, which introduces embeddable note-cards to Supernotes. Like tweets, our note-cards can be embedded anywhere on the web, from Notion documents to your personal blog. But unlike tweets, our note-cards have extended markdown support and no character limit (although we recommend keeping below 1200), giving you a lot greater flexibility. </p>
<p>It's super easy to create an embeddable note-card, just create a share code and copy the embed from within the share dropdown. Here's a quick walkthrough below:</p>
<p><img alt="How to create an embeddable share code on Supenrotes" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e0375139aef29ba1fbb28cc7b584b3958be6f2e3/c9b64/faf17916af9b689168b6a5392b6241e1/embedcodetutorial.gif"></p><h5>Open the share dropdown and then click "Create new code". Make sure 'Publicly Viewable' is turned on and then 'Generate Code'. Finally hit the 'Embed' button to copy the embed code.</h5>
<p>Here are our favourite use cases for embeddable note-cards:</p>
<h2>Reusable Checklists</h2>
<p>Embed interactive checklists; for example read the card below and check the list as you go along. You can refresh the page to return to the card to it's original state. Or if you are the author of the card, log in to Supernotes to make permanent changes!</p>

<h2>Highlight Code Snippets</h2>
<p>Make use of Supernotes' code syntax highlighting feature, and quickly share blocks of code with friends. Like this introduction to <code>if</code> statements on Python below:</p>

<h2>Interactive Study Cards</h2>
<p>Create interactive elements such as using spoilers to hide important information –&nbsp;a great revision technique. Here's a brief card on one of our favourite thinkers from the 20th century. Let's see if you can guess the hidden elements correctly!</p>

<p>Overall 2020 been a great year for us, and Connor and I are very proud of how far Supernotes has come - especially with our awesome community. Keep up to date with our development journey over on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/acnebs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">@acnebs</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/tobiaswhetton" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">@tobiaswhetton</a>). And please share your favourite uses of embeddable note-cards with us –&nbsp;we'd love to see them! </p></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>
<b>On inventions, improvements and stagnation in the software world.</b>
</p>

<p><i>Early 2021</i></p>

<blockquote>
But 1983 - and the whole decade - came and went without the "new thing".
<br>
<i>-- Alan C. Kay in The Early History of Smalltalk</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
I freely admit it: I'm likely to be the first person to triumphantly 
yell "Exactly!" at any statement claiming that computers were
<a href="https://www.datagubbe.se/ltmag">better before</a>, and that everything is pretty much
<a href="https://www.datagubbe.se/decusab">crap today</a>. Frankly, I'm kind 
of a backwards person: at some point I started enjoying computers more 
because of their rich and interesting history, rather than the magical 
air of futuristic high-tech that first drew me to them.
</p>

<p>
Consequently, I thought I'd agree with a blog post titled 
<a href="https://alarmingdevelopment.org/?p=1475">"The Great Software Stagnation"</a> - written by Jonathan Edwards, 
a former research fellow at MIT, no less!
</p>

<p>
Alas, I did not.
</p>

<p>
For those too lazy to click on links, Edwards roughly states that before 
1996, lots of amazing "software technology" appeared, such as C++, 
Windows, Unix and WWW. Then the Internet boom happened and "programmers 
could get rich quick", which effectively stopped "progress" in the field 
and replaced it with "incremental improvements" that aren't 
"fundamentally new".
</p>

<p>
The problem with this reasoning, in my opinion, is twofold: Firstly, 
1996 is far too late a date to use as a cutoff. Secondly, almost 
anything in any field at any time can, upon close examination, be 
described as derivative of something that appeared earlier. (The 
wonderfully lifelike, masterfully stylistic and cleverly shaded 
paintings in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chauvet_Cave">Chauvet Cave</a> comes to mind as an example 
within art.) This historical backtracking is especially 
applicable to sufficiently complex technology - <i>but that doesn't
necessarily mean something isn't inventive in its own right</i>.
</p>

<h3>Inventions and improvements</h3>

<p>
Who invented the automobile, for example? Without doubt it's a truly 
revolutionary creation, yet it's also mostly a joining together of 
already existing concepts. Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot constructed his steam 
powered "Fardier à vapeur" in 1769, but Ferdinand Verbiest is credited 
with thinking up the concept a hundred years earlier. Of course, Cugnot 
couldn't have built his vehicle without the invention and gradual 
refinement of steam power, with which experiments are recorded as early 
as during biblical times. And, besides - isn't a car really just an 
incremental improvement on the horse and carriage?
</p>

<p>
It wouldn't be controversial to say that the iPhone is a post-1996 
invention with considerable impact on a number of industries. On the 
software side of things, it introduced a new operating system with a new 
paradigm for interacting with a computational device. Of course, neither 
smartphones nor capacitive touchscreens were new in 2007 and Apple 
wasn't even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_Prada">first with combining the two</a>. Thus, arguably, the iPhone was simply 
an incremental improvement on decades-old mobile phones -
and yet it was, of course, something  completely new. Anyone not
classifying it as a "radical  breakthrough" is surely rather alone in
that assessment.
</p>

<p>
Truly atomic and easily identifiable inventions are few, far between and 
often date back a very long time. They're also often discoveries as much 
as they are inventions. Some breakthroughs are old ideas that finally 
become reality thanks to other inventions. I'm pretty sure 
self-driving cars have been a childhood dream for many since at the very least 
Knight Rider in 1982 - and da Vinci's (non-working) concepts for flying 
machines from the late 1400:s have become iconic.
</p>

<h3>It's probably been done before</h3>

<p>
Edwards lists a number of pre-1996 technologies that, in the context of 
his text, can only be interpreted as what he considers to be major 
inventions or breakthroughs. On this point, I agree. I'm not writing 
this to discredit these inventions, or to belittle their inventors - I 
spend almost every day standing on the shoulders of these giants.
</p>

<p>
Most of what's mentioned in the list can however still be traced back to 
something similar that predates it. Lisp, for example, is a curiously 
elegant high level language considering it was invented in the 1950:s. 
The truth is of course that Lisp, despite featuring a lot of novel 
concepts, didn't appear in a vacuum. Its elegance derives heavily from 
mathematical notation and, later, lambda calculus. Other key concepts 
can be found in an earlier language called IPL (Garbage collection however,
is as far as I know, all Lisp).
</p>

<p>
The same can be said about Unix, which builds heavily on concepts in 
Multics, which in turn builds on earlier timesharing systems. Windows 
1.0 was pretty much crap compared to its chronological predecessor, 
Apple's Lisa OS. The story of the Lisa itself is no secret, either: 
Steve Jobs went to Xerox PARC in 1979, took a good look at the Alto and 
Smalltalk, and liked what he saw.
</p>

<p>
Xerox are often blamed for not understanding what they had and giving 
away their killer concept to Jobs, but that's not entirely true. They 
launched the Star in 1981, two years before the Lisa. It was the first 
commercial machine with a desktop metaphor. This was derived from the Smalltalk 
GUI, which was inspired by Douglas Engelbart's NLS (as featured in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos">The Mother of All Demos</a>),
which was inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad">Sketchpad</a>. Smalltalk as a language 
builds in part on Simula, which introduced a lot of the concepts of 
modern object oriented programming. C++ is heavily influenced by Simula and,
of course, C.
</p>

<h3>Actual origins</h3>

<p>
This is where we can start identifying some kind of chronological 
tipping point. Simula, Lisp, Sketchpad and Engelbart's NLS - together 
with Algol, Fortran, Basic, artificial intelligence, 
multitasking/timesharing, networking, full screen text editors, 
relational databases and hypertext - all appear in a seemingly golden 
era between roughly 1955 and 1969.
</p>

<p>
This was the infancy of the digital general purpose computer. The ENIAC, 
being the first (although - of course - drawing heavily on earlier 
machines and research), was constructed in 1945. A decade later, the use 
of such machines had spread to comparably wider circles, which not only 
tickled the imaginations of some very fine visionary minds but also in a 
more hands-on sense called for simpler and quicker software development 
practices.
</p>

<h3>Post-1996 examples</h3>

<p>
The Internet boom irrefutably happened some time during the middle of 
the 1990s, so I agree that its effects began to clearly 
materialize in 1996. It's true that most of the makings of current 
software technology were already in place by then, but they too build on 
earlier inventions and improvements.
</p>

<p>
From his list of "new" things, Edwards omits CSS, 
XML (both from 1996), XMLHttpRequest (introduced in 2000) and JSON 
(conceived sometime shortly thereafter). This quartet forms the basis of 
the modern web and enabled things like single page applications. Of 
course one could quite correctly argue that these are simply incremental 
improvements upon earlier concepts, but that's also true of the web 
itself: Engelbart demonstrated clickable links in 1968, laying the foundation
for several following hypertext systems.
</p>

<p>
JavaScript hardly 
appeared out of thin air, either. It was influenced by a plethora of 
other languages and the concept of embedded scripting was already widely 
spread. Microsoft's VBA, for example, appeared two years earlier.
</p>

<p>
The combination of HTML, JavaScript and the DOM can be seen as a continuation
of PostScript, a Turing complete document formatting and presentation language.
</p>

<h3>Cashing in</h3>

<p>
The notion of programming as a get rich quick scheme was surely helped by 
the dotcom bubble, but seemingly unlikely 
overnight success in computing predates the Internet boom by more than a 
decade. I suggest that it's linked to the home computer revolution rather than 
the Eternal September. Bill Gates (no introduction needed), Ken Williams 
(Sierra On-Line), John Carmack (Doom) and Gary Kildall (CP/M) are all
examples of this, but there are many more success stories from this time.
The computer game Lemmings, for example, was released in 1991 and has since
sold a whopping 20 million copies.
</p>

<p>
I also think Edwards inadvertently stumbles into the trap of survivor 
bias. Just like with early home computer programmers, most web developers 
didn't - and still don't - get rich. For every success story there's also
a massive amount of failures - some of them so spectacular they've become
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boo.com">legends in 
their own right</a>.
</p>

<h3>Trickle down inventions</h3>

<p>
Claiming that we're still using a 50 year old OS with 30 year old text 
editors to write code in 25 year old languages can be tempting - but as 
I hope I've demonstrated above, the roots of almost all of those can be 
traced even further back and Edwards' choice of baseline technologies
can just as easily be dismissed as mere incremental improvements.
</p>

<p>
The fact that a contemporary programmer can get work done on a 30 or 
even 50 year old system doesn't mean they necessarily want to: there has 
been significant progress since then, albeit in - yes - increments.
</p>

<p>
Editor-wise, a programmer of today sent back to the early 1990:s would 
probably miss things like multi-language support and integration with
version control and linters. Even simple things like columnar marking, syntax 
highlighting and multiple document interfaces weren't standard editor 
features in 1990 - though the concepts were surely invented earlier. 
Python was released in 1991, but our time travelling coder is likely to 
be rather disappointed: list comprehension, while itself nothing new, 
wasn't introduced in the language until nine years later, in 2000.
</p>

<p>
In fact, most programmers probably didn't even use a multitasking 
operating system in 1990: Some improvements trickle down slower than 
others, in part because of hardware limitations, in part because of the 
curious whims of the software market. From a vantage point at MIT, it might 
seem as if little has changed during the …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remote work is on the rise, the economy is on a decline and businesses are re-structuring themselves around what many consider the new normal. Increasingly more organisations are opening themselves up to the possibility of working remotely beyond just the temporary measure in the fight against COVID-19. Many begin to see remote work as not only a necessary consequence, but rather as a new opportunity to diversify their workforce, increase employee productivity and cut some cost. The biggest cost saving obviously comes from office space, and not just in terms of raw square footage but also in location. When previously companies had to boast huge HQs in expensive areas, now they can spread themselves thinner across more affordable cities. Another big cost saving can come from employee salaries. A more distributed workforce and more work from home opportunities will inevitably mean a bigger talent pool competing for the same open positions, effectively giving employers a bigger choice.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to existing employees' salaries the direction taken by big tech companies couldn't be of starker contrast. Companies like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/21/zuckerberg-50percent-of-facebook-employees-could-be-working-remotely.html">Facebook or Twitter</a> have made it clear that employees who choose to relocate to more affordable cities can expect big cuts to their existing salary whereas companies like <a href="https://redditblog.com/2020/10/27/evolving-reddits-workforce/">Reddit announced that they won't reduce the salary of any of their 600 US workers</a> regardless of where they live.</p>
<p>These recent announcements have revived a <a href="https://www.helpscout.com/blog/remote-employee-compensation/">long standing debate</a> around the topic of <a href="https://www.nityesh.com/equal-pay-for-equal-work-at-a-remote-company/">equal pay for equal work</a>. Before COVID-19 <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/02/28/why-we-pay-local-rates/">GitLab has already sparked a lot of controversy</a> around the concept of "cost of living" adjusted salaries. At GitLab two engineers who perform the exact same work could get vastly differently compensated based on where they live. It doesn't require a lot of imagination to understand that such policies can alienate a lot of good people and further contribute to the perception of an ever growing inequality gap. Personally I find cost of living adjusted salaries very problematic as they deflect from the real market forces which come into play. Those should be a decent minimum living wage and the forces of demand &amp; supply. If someone is a professional in a niche market, a rare specialist in a scientific field or an exceptionally sought after engineer then cost of living should have no say in determining their pay. Those so called knowledge workers are often higher in demand than there is supply. A good indicator for the scarcity of one's profession is when their employer recruits talent from all across the world and advertises unique perks such as relocation bonuses, dental care or exceptional holiday packages. These benefits would not exist if there wasn't a fierce competition for a particular skill.</p>
<p>Regardless of the real economics at play, it still comes down to a good old negotiation where each person has to stand up for their own beliefs and reach an agreement on their pay. If you find yourself in a situation where your current salary might be at risk due to recent relocation then hopefully the following write-up can help you to negotiate equal pay for equal work. It is a curated list of relevant points to formulate a strong argument why one should receive the same or perhaps an even better pay for the same work carried out from a remote position.</p>
<h2 id="same-duties-same-pay">Same duties, same pay</h2>
<p>If you're reading this blog post then you're most likely not being paid for your time or place of work. You are being paid for your knowledge, your skills, your duties, the challenges which come with your work and most importantly the responsibilities of your role. Your professionalism and your personal commitment which you bring to your every day job will not diminish when you move into a new place. Whether you work remotely or not, you will still contemplate over that tough work problem in your spare time. You will still lose sleep over that big presentation the next day. You will still stay up late to meet an important deadline by the end of the month. You do it because you take pride in your work. You do it because of a sense of personal accountability to your team. It is those qualities which have earned you the trust of your manager over the years. It is those qualities which earned you a pay rise long ago. Changing postcodes doesn't take away your accomplishments from the past. Changing postcodes shouldn't take away the things which you have already earned before.</p>
<h2 id="same-value-same-pay">Same value, same pay</h2>
<p>The value of your contributions hasn't been compromised by moving house. Customers still pay the same price for the products which you have helped to build. Sales figures didn't drop when you went remote. Why should your employer reduce your pay when they are not passing that cost saving onto their customers by cutting their own price? Based on the same principle why your employer won't reduce their prices when downsizing office, you also shouldn't accept a lower salary after moving place. The concept is the same and you shouldn't accept one principle for them, but another for yourself. As you continue to deliver the same value and quality as before, you equally deserve the same compensation in return.</p>
<h2 id="your-savings-their-savings">Your savings, their savings</h2>
<p>Let's be clear, when you transitioned from office to home it's not like you're the only one who benefited from a lower cost of living as a result. Whatever savings you might have made on your rent, your employer does now too. Every person in an office requires an extra desk. Every additional person requires a fraction more of bathroom space. More people mean bigger kitchens, bigger break out areas, more meeting rooms, larger hallways, bigger stairways and more facilities to comply with fire safety regulations. There is more pressure on lifts to avoid bottle necks during peak times. There is more building maintenance work to be done and more frequent cleaning intervals required. A bigger workforce automatically means more individual needs. Extra bicycle storage rooms, canteens, car parks, private offices, outdoor spaces, a bigger selection of refreshments and a larger variety of office perks are just a few to name. Unless your employer is prepared to share their own operational saving directly with you, why should you share your personal operational saving with them? Fundamentally their savings are theirs, and your savings are yours.</p>
<h2 id="their-profit-your-profit">Their profit, your profit</h2>
<p>Have you ever received a pay rise when your employer re-structured themselves to benefit from lower tax? Have you ever received a pay rise when your employer opened up a new factory in a less regulated place? Have you ever received a pay rise when your employer outsourced a call centre into a country without minimum wage? Probably not, because it was your employer and not you who took the risk. Guess what, when you are courageous enough to relocate to a different country, city or state, then any financial gains from your move are also only yours to claim. This shouldn't be a huge surprise as nothing comes without its own significant risk. Economic security, social safety nets, unemployment benefits, retirement support, access to public health services, cost of qualitative education or medical treatment are often some of the compromises which have to be taken into account. Simple things such as free playgrounds for children, access to public recreational grounds, well maintained parks, a good public transport system funded by tax or basic luxuries such as political stability or the ability to safely park a new car on a public road are many other cost calculations not to be dismissed. Of course this is not always the case, but those considerations are for you to make. Nobody else, particularly not your employer, who has a financial interest of dismissing or downplaying those issues should be making those calculations on your behalf. This is such a basic principle that it's almost offensive to suggest the opposite. Your employer should not decide what sort of lifestyle you deserve.</p>
<h2 id="higher-cost-higher-pay">Higher cost, higher pay</h2>
<p>Contrary to common belief, working from home is not cheap. First of all, working permanently from home requires an entire additional room. If your family lived in a three bedroom house before, now you need four.
Thanks to COVID-19 most will agree that working from a sofa is neither practical, nor sustainable or realistic by any means. A proper office desk and a good ergonomic chair are a necessity at the least. Those requirements alone make a legitimate home office significantly more expensive than many would like to admit. Throw in a couple of monitors, a qualitative web cam, microphone, printer, shredder, peripheral devices, a whiteboard, noise cancelling headphones, a mesh router and a backup laptop (assuming you'll get a work laptop provided) then the true cost of a home office begins to reach eye watering levels.</p>
<p>Some employers will try to provide you those supplies, but any seasoned remote worker will tell you to decline such an offer. After all you're still equipping your own personal home. You shouldn't have to pick from a selection of office desks which don't match your walls. You shouldn't have to settle on a chair which doesn't appeal to your eye. You shouldn't have to accept a black bezelled screen when all your other equipment is in space grey. Most importantly though, you want to treat those things as your own. You don't want to change your monitors when you change your job. You don't want to have to go through your employer to make a warranty claim. You don't want to ask for permission to replace a worn out chair. Instead you want to get a pay rise which allows you to set up your home office in the most productive way. If your employer is smart enough then they will not want to manage all of that inventory (which they never get to see) either.</p>
<p>Speaking of inventory, the true cost of working from home does not stop there yet. When working remotely nothing disrupts productivity more than a low bandwidth internet connection. One cannot …</p></div></div>

      <h2>The first two hours of Kakoune in two minutes</h2>

<p>Learning a new editor can be a daunting task, especially when
coming over from a non-modal editor. I personally started with
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>, and it took me weeks to be
productive when I started using <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>. The modal paradigm
is a powerful tool, but picking it up is generally not a painless experience.</p>

<p>When I discovered <a href="https://kakoune.org/">Kakoune</a> a few years ago, it felt
like the jump from Vim to it was even bigger than the one I’d made when
transitioning over from Emacs to Vim. Despite the two being fairly close on
paper, one still needs to unlearn all the muscle memory patiently cultivated
over the years and grow it back up from scratch. If we ignore the fact that
in those days the only (comparatively sparse) documentation was centralised
in the README file of the project, which might have contributed to why the
jump made itself felt so strongly, new comers still have to primarily
focus their efforts towards learning the “modal language”, or flavour,
of Kakoune.</p>

<p>In order to save them some time, whether they’re disembarking off the Emacs
(non-modal) or Vim (modal) boats, I’ve documented in the following article
some common configuration options. They won’t fit anyone’s workflow exactly
right, I trust the user to tweak the settings how they see fit. They will
however allow turning the two hours it would have taken me to figure out
what lines to write down in my user configuration to get a boilerplate setup
going into two minutes — the time it takes to read this introduction and
save the final

onto one’s system.</p>

<h2 id="the-configuration-file">The configuration file</h2>

<p>You’ll find below an inlined, commented configuration file to steal from. You
can also
<a href="https://lenormf.github.io/community-articles/assets/download/two_hours_two_minutes/kakrc">download</a>
it directly, and save it as <code>~/.config/kak/kakrc</code> (or
<code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/kak/kakrc</code>).</p>

# Shortcut to quickly exit the editor

</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="explanations">Explanations</h2>

<p>These explanations expand on the purpose of the lines in the above file,
the salient parts in them, and hopefully give you a bird-eye view of the
various configuration instructions you might recognise in the
<a href="https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=kakrc"><code>kakrc</code></a>
configurations of more advanced users.</p>

<p>The details are intentionally glossed over and might seem fuzzy, feel free
to refer to the list of recommended further readings at the end of this
article if you’re curious.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Set the colour scheme
colorscheme kaleidoscope-dark
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The Kaleidoscope colour scheme (also known as theme) is a high-contrast,
colour blind friendly palette of colours that should suit the largest subset
of users, at first. You can go for the dark variant (<code>kaleidoscope-dark</code>)
or the light one (<code>kaleidoscope-light</code>).</p>

<p>If you don’t care either way, comment this line and the default theme will
do just fine.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Width of a tab
set-option global tabstop 4
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Options are scoped, which means that they can hold different values depending
on the context in which they’re being used. For general configuration
purposes, use the <code>global</code> scope.</p>

<p>The <code>tabstop</code> option holds the amount of space characters that tabulation
characters (stored in a file opened with Kakoune) will be rendered as.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Indent with 4 spaces
set-option global indentwidth 4
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This option impacts the behaviour of a couple of primitives (a primitive
is a “key”, more details about keys/primitives below) that indent or
de-indent a line, in normal mode.</p>

<p>In non-modal editors, hitting keys results in the letter associated with them
being inserted into the buffer (the “file”) as-is. In modal editors,
this behaviour applies only to the “insert mode”, which can be entered
by hitting <code>i</code> in normal mode — which is the default mode when starting
Kakoune.</p>

<p>The <code>indentwidth</code> option dictates how many space characters are inserted
or removed when using (respectively) the normal mode primitive <code>&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;</code>.</p>

<p>Note that when editing a file that is recognised by the editor, manual
indentation of lines should not be necessary, as that side-effect will be
handled automatically upon hitting the return key.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Always keep one line and three columns displayed around the cursor
set-option global scrolloff 1,3
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When scrolling around a large file, the cursor tends to stick to the borders
of the window if more content needs to be displayed. You can have the window
show more context (i.e. lines and characters) when that happens with the
<code>scrolloff</code> option.</p>

<p>The first integer (<code>1</code> above) in the comma separated pair is the amount of
lines to show above/below the cursor when it hits the top/bottom of the
window, and more lines remain to be displayed in the file.</p>

<p>Similarly, the second integer (<code>3</code> above) is the amount of characters
displayed on the left/right when the cursor hits the left/right hand
window border.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Display the status bar on top
set-option global ui_options ncurses_status_on_top=true
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Kakoune follows a server/client architecture, and the behaviour of the user
interface (run by the client) can be tweaked via <code>ui_options</code>. It accepts
a list of equal-sign separated key/value pairs, and the above instructs
the NCurses client (default) to display the status bar on top.</p>

<p>Feel free to comment this line if the default behaviour (status bar on the
bottom) suits you.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Display line numbers
add-highlighter global/ number-lines -hlcursor
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Highlighters are decorators for the window or the text it contains. Similarly
to options (c.f. above), they are scoped, but we only care about their
<code>global</code> value. You might have noticed however that the above line uses
<code>global/</code>, and you might be tempted to remove it on account of it being
redundant — don’t, the character is significant.</p>

<p>The <code>number-lines</code> highlighter displays a file’s line numbers on the left
hand side of the screen. The <code>-hlcursor</code> flag allows highlighting the number
of the line that the cursor lies on.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Highlight trailing whitespace
add-highlighter global/ regex \h+$ 0:Error
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This line adds a <code>regex</code> highlighter which decorates trailing whitespace
with the built-in <code>Error</code> face. The number refers to the index of the match
within the regex. For instance, <code>0</code> refers to the text matched by the regex
(but not to the entire line).</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Softwrap long lines
add-highlighter global/ wrap -word -indent
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>wrap</code> highlighter applies “soft wrapping” (e.g. the lines appear
broken up, but no newline characters are inserted into the file itself)
to lines that cannot be fully displayed within the window. The flags passed
to it keep words whole, and the indentation of the lines newly created will
have the same indentation level as their stem.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Clipboard management mappings
map -docstring "yank the selection into the clipboard" global user y "&lt;a-|&gt; xsel -i&lt;ret&gt;"
map -docstring "paste the clipboard" global user p "&lt;a-!&gt; xsel&lt;ret&gt;"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Mappings (also known as “key bindings”, or more simply “bindings”)
allow customising the side effect upon hitting a key. Here is a breakdown
of the two lines above:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>map</code>: declare a new mapping</li>
  <li><code>-docstring "…"</code>: document what the side effect of the mapping is —
this is optional, but is quite helpful when the mapping is set in the
<code>user</code> mode (c.f. below)</li>
  <li><code>global</code>: mappings are scoped, just like options and highlighters</li>
  <li><code>user</code>: similar to the insert mode, the user mode is entered by hitting
a key (for instance, <code>,</code>) from normal mode (c.f. below for more information)</li>
  <li><code>&lt;key&gt; "…"</code>: upon hitting <code>key</code>, execute the given list of primitives</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, quite a few concepts have been packed into merely two
instructions.</p>

<p>In terms of functionality, these two mappings copy the current selection
to the clipboard and paste whatever is in it. They’re triggered by hitting
the comma <code>,</code> key followed by respectively <code>y</code> and <code>p</code>.</p>

<p>Read on if you’re not familiar with modal edition, or want to compare
the declaration of mappings in Kakoune with other modal editors.</p>

<p><strong>The user mode</strong><br>
Mappings allow overriding the behaviour of a given key, but since they all
have a specific purpose (c.f. primitives below) by default, one would have
to forego whatever functionality the key being overridden provided with,
in order to instantiate a custom mapping.</p>

<p>The user mode is entered from normal mode upon hitting the comma <code>,</code> key,
and allows “user mappings” to be declared within it. It’s a way to address
the above problem: you don’t have to override default keys/primitives,
you can just place them one keystroke away (“behind” the comma <code>,</code> key)
and be free to pick any key you see fit.</p>

<p><strong>Primitives</strong><br>
The difference between “key” and “primitive” is one of semantic, and both can
commonly be used interchangeably.</p>

<p>Keys are referred to as the letter (or symbol, for example the return key)
that is printed on them, on a QWERTY keyboard.</p>

<p>Primitives are triggered by single keys or a combination of them, and can
be invoked from a prompt (interactively) or script (programmatically). They
are referred to using a custom notation that allows combining letters and
modifiers (c.f. below).</p>

<p>When placing those cryptic definitions back into the context of the clipboard
management mappings above, we get:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>&lt;a-|&gt;</code>: holding the alt and pipe <code>|</code> keys together to invoke the <code>&lt;a-|&gt;</code>
primitive, which pipes the current selection into a given shell command</li>
  <li><code>&lt;a-!&gt;</code>: holding the alt and <code>!</code> keys together to invoke the <code>&lt;a-!&gt;</code>
primitive, which inserts the output of a given shell command into the file</li>
  <li><code>&lt;ret&gt;</code>: the return key, to …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><article>
  
  <div><p>In iOS 14.3, Apple added their new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/">app privacy details</a> to App Store listings. App privacy details, which are sometimes compared to the nutritional labels on foodstuff, are details about the data an app collects and the purposes and use of such data. What can we learn by analysing this data?</p>

<p>From the 14<sup>th</sup> of December 2020, all new apps and app updates have to provide information on the data the app collects. This is used to power the app privacy details labelling. On Twitter, videos scrolling through the privacy listing for Facebook circulated immediately after the 14.3 release.</p>

<p>This system is somewhat flawed, because app developers can, at least in theory, lie about the data they collect. Some apps that profess to collect no data, actually turn out to collect a bunch if you read their privacy policy. However, the punishment for being caught lying, removal from the App Store, is a strong deterrent and it’s safe to assume most developers will have been truthful in their accounts.</p>

<p>An interesting side-effect of this, is that Apple has now made available the same data that can be found in terse and hard to parse privacy policies as simple and structured data that can be parsed and analysed. In this post I will do just that i.e. collect and analyse the privacy details for thousands of the most popular apps on the App Store.</p>

<h2 id="collecting-the-data">Collecting the Data</h2>

<p>If you just want to read the juicy details feel free to skip to the <a href="#analysis">analysis</a>.</p>

<p>Apple makes the privacy labelling data available for each app on the App Store via an API used by the App Store apps. By reverse engineering the App Store apps I’ve figured out how to make the API divulge this data on a per app basis.</p>

<p>This only gets me the privacy data for a single app, but I want to analyse popular apps. A good source of popular apps are the charts the App Store provides on a per app category basis. An example of this is “Top Free” apps in “Education”. These listings contain up to 200 apps per category and price point(i.e. free or paid).</p>

<p>On the UK store, which is the store I’ve used for all this analysis, there are 24 categories. Each of which have top charts with up to 200 paid and 200 free apps. This means the theoretical total number of apps is 9600. However, because some apps occupy chart positions in multiple categories and because the charts also contain app bundles the actual number is lower.</p>

<p>The full list of categories is:</p>

<h2 id="structure-of-the-data">Structure of the Data</h2>

<p>If you don’t care about the exact details and structure of the data feel free to skip to the <a href="#analysis">analysis</a>.</p>

<p>The structure of the data returned by the App Store API is</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>

<p>The <code>&lt;privacy-details&gt;</code> section of this document is the important bit. It’s an array where each item has the following structure.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>

<p><code>DATA_NOT_COLLECTED</code> is used as a marker in which case <code>dataCategories</code> and <code>purposes</code> are both empty and this is the only element in the <code>privacyDetails</code> array.</p>

<p><code>DATA_USED_TO_TRACK_YOU</code> contains details on data used to track you across websites and apps owned by other companies, Apple’s description is <em>The following data may be used to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies:</em>.

<p><code>DATA_LINKED_TO_YOU</code> and <code>DATA_NOT_LINKED_TO_YOU</code> both contain data types with purposes specific granularity. This means that <code>dataCategories</code> will be empty and the different data types are in <code>purposes</code>. Apple’s description for <code>DATA_LINKED_TO_YOU</code> and <code>DATA_NOT_LINKED_TO_YOU</code> are <em>The following data, which may be collected and linked to your identity, may be used for the following purposes:</em> and <em>The following data, which may be collected but is not linked to your identity, may be used for the following purposes:</em> respectively.</p>

<p>Let’s do some analysis of this data</p>

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>

<p>The data set I’ve collected contains 9082 combinations of apps and a position in a given category chart. In total there are 9040 unique apps in this data set.</p>

<p>Most charts contain 200 or nearly 200 apps, however <strong>Graphics &amp; Design(Paid)</strong>, <strong>Developer Tools(Paid)</strong>, and <strong>Magazines &amp; Newspapers(Paid)</strong> all have fewer than 90 apps so I’m dropping them from further analysis.</p>

<p>Because the privacy details have only been required for new apps and updates since mid December, not all apps contain information about privacy details. After removing those apps 3164 apps remain in the data set. Breaking this down by chart, several charts have less than 25 apps so I am dropping them from further analysis too. This leaves 3027 apps in the data set.</p>

<p>In total the following charts have been dropped:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Education(Paid)</li>
  <li>Navigation(Paid)</li>
  <li>Sports(Paid)</li>
  <li>Business(Paid)</li>
  <li>Food &amp; Drink(Paid)</li>
  <li>Shopping(Paid)</li>
  <li>Medical(Paid)</li>
  <li>Magazines &amp; Newspapers(Paid)</li>
</ul>

<p>For the analysis there are a few different data points that are interesting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Apps that collect data this is linked to the user and how many such data types they collect.<sup>*</sup></li>
  <li>Apps that collect no data.</li>
  <li>Third Party tracking, i.e. tracking users across apps and websites owned by other companies and the how many(max 32) such data types they collect.</li>
</ul>

<p>* Data that is linked to the user for the purpose of supporting app functionality, that is the <code>APP_FUNCTIONALITY</code> purpose, is legitimate and will be exclude from the following analysis. This leaves 160 data types spread across 5 purposes.</p>

<p>I am excluding data that is collected but not linked to the user, in part to keep down the length of the analysis and in part because it’s the least interesting. I’ll probably do a follow up post on it later.</p>

<p>The questions I’ll be looking at for this analysis are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="#free-vs-paid">Do free apps collect more data?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#worst-charts">Which are the worst charts?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#worst-apps">Which apps in the whole data set are the worst?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#oxymorons">Which apps lie subtly about the nature of data they collect?</a></li>
</ol>

<p>But first let’s have a quick look at the data set.</p>

<p><em>Note: The images in this post can be clicked to show larger versions</em></p>

<p><a href="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/data-collected-histogram-plot.svg"><img src="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/data-collected-histogram-plot.svg?1609805186" alt="Histogram plot of data types collected. The apps that collect zero such data types dominate"></a></p>

<p>As we can see here, most apps collect no data outside of that which supports the app’s functionality. To get a better view of the apps that do collect data, let’s remove the majority of apps that don’t.</p>

<p><a href="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/data-collected-histogram-non-zero-plot.svg"><img src="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/data-collected-histogram-non-zero-plot.svg?1609805186" alt="Histogram plot of data types collected with zero values removed."></a></p>

<p>Still the amount of data collected is fairly low, but there’s a curious set of outliers somewhere around 120 data types collected. All of those outliers have something in common, see if you can figure it out before I reveal the answer later in the post.</p>

<p>How about third party tracking?</p>

<p><a href="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/ttp-histogram-plot.svg"><img src="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/ttp-histogram-plot.svg?1609805186" alt="Histogram plot of third party tracking data types collected. The apps that collect zero such data types dominate"></a></p>

<p>Again most apps don’t collect any data types for third party tracking. Let’s repeat the process from above by removing those that do no tracking.</p>

<p><a href="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/ttp-histogram-non-zero-plot.svg"><img src="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/ttp-histogram-non-zero-plot.svg?1609805186" alt="Histogram plot of third party tracking data types collected with zero values removed."></a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div ?="">
        <p>China Miéville’s novel <em>Embassytown</em> describes a world in which an alien species, the Ariekei, becomes enthralled by a human’s ability to speak their language. What starts out as novelty gives way to obsession, and they become addicted to his voice, their lives falling to pieces, wandering the streets like zombies, tearing the world apart in search of more “god-drug”. Their obsession has nothing to do with the person behind it, but rather the thing he can provide.</p>

<p>Lately, I’ve amused myself by operating through the lens that the world is run by ideas, rather than people. We tend to discuss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics">mimetic effects</a> in relation to mass <em>consumption</em> – its distributive effects – but less-frequently discussed is how mimetics affect creators themselves.</p>

<p>I like thinking of people as vessels, which provides a refreshing counterbalance to the well-trodden <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory">“great man theory”</a>. Rather than viewing people as agents of change, I think of them as intermediaries, voice boxes for some persistent idea-virus that’s seized upon them and is speaking through their corporeal form. You might think of this as <em>“great prophet theory”</em>.</p>

<p>Ideas ride us into battle like warhorses. We can witness, participate in, and even lead these battles, but their true meaning eludes us. We don’t really know where ideas come from, nor how to control them.</p>

<h2 id="birthing-new-ideas">Birthing new ideas</h2>

<p>Consider the obsessiveness with which creators birth new ideas into the world, which we’ve clinically termed <em>“intrinsic motivation”</em>, but don’t really seem to understand beyond that. We can observe that it is happening, but we don’t know what actually <em>causes</em> someone to drive themselves nearly to death just so they can give an idea a beating heart and a chance at survival in the world. <em>“Because I had to”</em> or <em>“Because I couldn’t stop thinking about it”</em> are symptoms, not causes.</p>

<p><img src="https://nadiaeghbal.com/assets/img/ideas/goodyear.png" alt="goodyear">
<em>One of my favorite recent examples. <a href="https://twitter.com/rivatez/status/1115627936411815937">Via Twitter</a></em></p>

<p>Once ideas find an audience, they’re hard to eradicate. Many a surprised creator has found that they’ve lost control over an idea, watching helplessly as it’s shaped and reinterpreted in ways they didn’t intend.</p>

<p>It is enormously difficult for a successful creator to escape their own idea, because ideas need hosts to survive. Their audience owns them now: creators become like the god-drug to the Ariekei, delivering their goods to a babbling crowd that frantically demands more, more.  The creator must battle their own idea in order to survive, taming it back into submission, or risk being subsumed by its demands.</p>

<p>For whatever reason, I often think about Lil Wayne’s rock album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebirth_(Lil_Wayne_album)"><em>Rebirth</em></a> here, perhaps because the title is so wistfully aspirational. Lil Wayne tried in vain to “rebirth” himself, but he was widely panned by an audience that wanted him to produce rap, not rock. Because of his prior success, Lil Wayne became a vessel for a certain type of sound that we craved more of. He became “that person” for “that idea”.</p>

<h2 id="the-constraints-of-reputation">The constraints of reputation</h2>

<p>Even after an idea becomes sufficiently popular to survive in the world without a host, it’s still difficult for creators to escape them, because ideas bond to their hosts in the form of <em>reputation</em>, like a virus that lives in one’s body forever. Reputation is the aggregation of ideas that have swarmed your body. Reputation is a list of your chronic afflictions.</p>

<p>It’s strange to think that personal reputation is becoming simultaneously more and less valuable today. Reputation is the currency that powers our social systems – a symbol of your unique value – but at the same time, it’s easier than ever to find substitutes for a particular sound, style, aesthetic, or way of thinking. I think it’s a sign that ideas are winning over people, or perhaps just making their tyranny better known to us, an ominous signal flare shot into the sky.</p>

<p>The way in which we listen to music, for example, has changed. We don’t listen to entire albums as much as we used to. We don’t know as much about artists as we used to. Instead, we combine and recombine until we find precisely the sound we’re looking for, pumping god-drug into our veins, without really caring who’s behind it. Like an artist on an autogenerated Spotify playlist, my “thing” is interchangeable with a lot of other people’s “things” that would give my audience the same fix.</p>

<p>Returning to the Lil Wayne example, if Lil Wayne ever put his foot down and decided to stop making rap, we’d find another artist just like him, someone else who satisfies our desires. Lil Wayne commands an audience when it comes to rap. But his reputation is a devil’s contract: continue to make the same thing, and you’ll be rewarded, but don’t stray too far from the original concept.</p>

<p>Similarly, when an exceptional artist meets an untimely death, we don’t necessarily mourn them because of who they are. After all, we only really know their identity through the lens of the thing they produced for us. We mourn them because their product is scarce, and we can no longer get our fix. When someone says, e.g. <em>“Nobody ever played guitar like Jimi Hendrix”</em>, they’re saying that they crave a sound that feels hard to find elsewhere, not that they miss Jimi Hendrix himself.</p>

<p>Reputation has local value – it’s what distinguishes you within your world – but global demand for most people’s output is fairly elastic. In order to give people what they want, reputation is commoditized, bundled and traded on a global market. Spotify Discover Weekly satisfies the consumer by commodifying the creator. Today, internet creators can build up large audiences without ever becoming truly famous; they may command substantial local power, but their global value is very narrow.</p>

<h2 id="regaining-control">Regaining control</h2>

<p>How do creators preserve optionality? How do they maintain separation between themselves and their ideas, and avoid being consumed by demand?</p>

<p>One approach is to resist definition entirely, which seems like the obvious answer, but is hard to actually pull off well, because it requires engaging in constant battle against the many ideas that will inevitably swarm you. Still, some people find this to be a fun challenge in itself, requiring quite a bit of stealth to swim among the dark ocean depths without being detected.</p>

<p>The more I’ve kept an eye out for this approach, the more examples I’ve noticed among public figures. They’re the ones who always seem to keep coming up with interesting ideas, the generative thinkers that everyone likes to marvel at, but who manage to say a lot and a little at the same time. Kanye West is the canonical example that comes to mind: it’s hard to pin down what exactly he does, or what he thinks about, and yet the things he does seem uniquely “Kanyesque”.</p>

<p>The second approach is to compartmentalize, which is more tedious to manage, but probably easier for most to pull off. We tend to assume that people use pseudonyms or alts for privacy reasons. But alts aren’t always about hiding who you are, but rather keeping your ideas separate from some root identity (ex. one’s legal name), so that you can still remember who you are when the ideas aren’t riding you. [1]</p>

<p>Sex worker Stoya <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/opinion/sunday/can-we-learn-about-privacy-from-porn-stars.html">once likened her choice</a> of an alt to “deciding on a user name for any Internet service or website”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My stage name is less about withholding parts of myself or maintaining privacy than it is a symbol of the idea that I am more than just my job or any other isolated slice of my identity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My favorite example of this: a friend, who’s a mother of two, recently reflected that her daughter started calling her by her first name, because she wanted to know who she was beyond being her mom. The terms “mom” and “dad” are alts that protect the self, who exists <em>a priori</em> to being a parent.</p>

<p><img src="https://nadiaeghbal.com/assets/img/ideas/multiple-bios.png" alt="multiple bios">
<em>Compartmentalizing: multiple bios for multiple selves. <a href="https://lee94josh.com/About-Me">Via Josh’s website</a></em></p>

<p>Finally, to some extent, I find something sort of satisfying about accepting that ideas have a life of their own. Wielded carefully, they can shield, rather than drain, the creator. For example, actors and directors sometimes talk about making a big box-office hit, so they can do their artsy side project without feeling pressure to pander to an audience. If everyone manages a portfolio of ideas, some will be cash cows, some are risky bets, and others will be just for fun.</p>

<p>Ideas are fascinators that sparkle and dangle in front of the creator, distracting an eager audience from the person behind the curtain. Submitting to the tyranny of ideas gives us the freedom to explore who we are apart from our public reputations. If ideas are living entities that exist separately from our selves, what remains of us?</p>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<p>[1] I am skeptical that alts don’t creep into your root identity anyway, but at least you can switch between modes in a more explicit way.</p>

<p>Unemployment, hunger, institutional breakdown, and the destruction of social bonds are not symptoms of a virus. They are the indirect violence of class warfare. The pandemic is a convenient scapegoat for the largest upward wealth transfer in modern human history. Under the pretext of a public health policy, elites have successfully waged a counterrevolution that will result in the erosion of working conditions and quality of life for generations to come.&nbsp;</p>

In 1968 <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/1968-flu-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1-4 million</a> people died in the H2N3 influenza pandemic, during which businesses and schools <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/05/16/why-life-went-on-as-normal-during-the-killer-pandemic-of-1969/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stayed open</a> and large events were held.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indefinite closures have never before been used as a disease control method on a global scale.

Many <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-the-coronavirus-as-deadly-as-they-say-11585088464" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">epidemiologists</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/opinion/coronavirus-pandemic-social-distancing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doctors</a> questioned these doomsday projections and pointed out that there was <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/17/a-fiasco-in-the-making-as-the-coronavirus-pandemic-takes-hold-we-are-making-decisions-without-reliable-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not sufficient data</a> to justify lockdowns.

<p>In March unprecedented policies were rationalized through shocking <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/italian-doctor-an-experience-i-would-compare-to-a-world-war" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stories</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J60fQr0GWo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">videos</a> from northern Italy. The region’s crowded ICUs were presented as a warning for the rest of Europe and the US. Unknown to many was the fact that Lombardy had been severely impacted by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/business/lombardy-italy-coronavirus-doctors.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ongoing privatization efforts</a> and a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/557042/hospitals-in-italy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shrinking hospital system</a> regularly overwhelmed by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971219303285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">influenza</a>. This omission by mainstream media played a key role in developing the mythology that economic shutdown could magically eradicate a virus. In reality lockdowns have accelerated a cycle of austerity and created a self-fulfilling prophecy of perpetual crisis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chronic <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nursing-home-deaths-coronavirus-understaffing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">understaffing</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/29/nyregion/nursing-home-workers-pandemic-jobs.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lockdown-induced layoffs</a> in nursing homes severely exacerbated covid’s death toll. 40% of US covid deaths are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2020/06/16/nursing-homes-account-for-over-40-of-us-coronavirus-deaths/?sh=54afb581300b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">linked to nursing homes</a>. 1 in 6 covid deaths in Vermont were <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/12/02/vermont-nursing-home-covid-genesis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from a single facility</a>.

Unprotected, underserved, and alone, the elderly are also afflicted by the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/30/us/nursing-homes-isolation-virus.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slow killer</a>” of loneliness. Isolation increases risk of <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/loneliness-and-isolation-raise-risk-for-stroke-and-heart-disease-study-suggests" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease, stroke</a>, and <a href="https://www.alzinfo.org/articles/feeling-lonely-increases-alzheimers-risk-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alzheimer’s</a>.

<p>Financial insecurity will exacerbate these health risks for the elderly. Economic shutdown has <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d1fce3e7-428b-4b8a-ab6a-119a38fa1e7d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weakened</a> global pension funds and they may not recover.

<p>Outcomes of lockdown are equally grim for children. Even if K-12 schools reopen in January 2021, the average student will have lost <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/students-falling-behind/2020/12/06/88d7157a-3665-11eb-8d38-6aea1adb3839_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7 months of instruction</a>. Because literacy and education levels are a main <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2713445/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">predictor of longevity</a>, these learning losses represent years of life stolen from students. Moreover, cases of severe abuse and mental-health related ER visits <a href="https://apnews.com/article/anxiety-mental-health-boston-coronavirus-pandemic-massachusetts-004adb5ee0ef17ff4b5e2e294e36ff3d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are surging for children</a>. They will also experience <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/25/opinion/sunday/covid-quarantine-children-immune-systems.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weakened immune systems</a> due to lack of exposure to seasonal viruses and natural pathogens.</p>



<p>For people with chronic health conditions or those in need of urgent medical treatment, the short- and long-term consequences of lockdown are disastrous. In the United States, cancer screenings fell by <a href="https://www.radiologybusiness.com/topics/healthcare-economics/cancer-screenings-epic-ehr-covid-19-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">86-94%</a> in the spring. Many hospitals <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/47-hospitals-closed-filed-for-bankruptcy-this-year.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had to close</a> due to lack of revenue from routine surgeries and procedures. Hospitals are expected to lose a total of <a href="https://www.aha.org/news/headline/2020-06-30-aha-report-hospital-financial-losses-covid-19-expected-top-323-billion#:~:text=An%20AHA%20report%20released%20today,least%20%24323%20billion%20in%202020." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$323 billion</a> this year. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/10/853524764/amid-pandemic-hospitals-lay-off-1-4m-workers-in-april" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.4 million hospital staff</a> were laid off in April while private health insurance companies <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/health/covid-insurance-profits.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doubled their earnings</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the absence of meaningful investments in healthcare infrastructure, the covid mitigation strategies being pushed by federal, state, and local governments are neither credible nor effective. Elected officials routinely amplify raw case numbers in order to stoke fear and blame individuals for viral spread. As a result, we are currently “saving lives” by killing people. This is not an unforced error or a good policy idea implemented poorly. It is an economic agenda disguised as a health protocol.</p>



<h5>The New Caste System&nbsp;</h5>



<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom sends his children to <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2020/10/30/newsom-sends-his-children-back-to-school-classrooms-in-california-1332811" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in-person private school</a> while mandating virtual education for California public schools. He announced a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/06/california-covid-lockdown-us-new-cases-hospitalisations-deaths-stay-at-home-order" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second statewide lockdown</a> just a few weeks after attending an indoor, unmasked <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/18/newsom-lobbyist-dinner-party-437892" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dinner with lobbyists</a> at a Michelin three star restaurant where meals can cost up to <a href="https://sf.eater.com/2020/9/3/21421335/french-laundry-yountville-thomas-keller-indoor-dining-rich-people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$850 per person</a>. Newsom is just one of many <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/23/nyregion/cuomo-thanksgiving-mother.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">politicians</a>, elites, and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/mask-mischief-11595625179" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bureaucrats</a> who break the rules. A static social order is being solidified. In our new caste system the wealthy have political and social <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-03/u-k-to-exempt-high-value-business-travelers-from-quarantine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">privileges</a> because they are considered clean and disease-free, while the more low-income someone is, the more they are treated as contaminated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The goal of lockdown enthusiasts in the “work from home” caste is to shift risk away from themselves and onto essential workers and the poor. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20201023-coronavirus-how-will-the-pandemic-change-the-way-we-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Only 40%</a> of the workforce can afford to stay home. <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2020/aug/looming-crisis-health-coverage-2020-biennial#:~:text=In%20the%20first%20half%20of%202020%2C%2043.4%20percent%20of%20U.S.,uninsured%20rate%20was%2012.5%20percent." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">43% of US adults</a> do not have adequate health insurance, and only 31% of low-paid workers have <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/03/12/as-coronavirus-spreads-which-u-s-workers-have-paid-sick-leave-and-which-dont/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paid sick leave</a> compared to 92% of high-paid workers. “Stay home” is the self-congratulatory mantra of professionals who believe that their virtuous behavior prevents them from contracting covid. In fact, income is the <a href="https://prospect.org/coronavirus/covid-19-class-war-death-rates-income/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">main determinant</a> of covid mortality.</p>



<p>Lockdown fanatics have helped manufacture consent for a brutal reorganization of labor that will plunge millions of people into serfdom. The work-from-home lifestyle is only possible through the labor of logistics workers who transport, sort, and deliver goods. Currently about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/12/04/business/us-economy-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 million jobs</a> that existed in February have not been replaced. Many workers have been forced to take on part-time, no-contract work, a labor model that is <a href="https://qz.com/1556194/the-gig-economy-is-quietly-undermining-a-century-of-worker-protections/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rolling back</a> decades of hard-fought protections.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under the Obama/Biden administration, 94% of new jobs created were gig work, and in 2017 <a href="https://www.ilo.org/washington/WCMS_642303/lang--en/index.htm#:~:text=The%20Bureau%20of%20Labor%20Statistics,to%2043%20percent%20in%202020." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">34% of the workforce</a> was employed through the gig economy. Shutdowns are accelerating this trend, with food delivery apps <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/30/nyregion/bike-delivery-workers-covid-pandemic.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">growing their profits</a> as workers struggle to get by. Subscription platforms like OnlyFans saw a <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Coronavirus-took-their-jobs-away-OnlyFans-let-15175650.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surge in accounts</a> at the beginning of lockdown. In March the company saw a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/style/camsoda-onlyfans-streaming-sex-coronavirus.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">75% increase in users and 60,000 new creators</a>.

<p>Internationally, workplace closures and supply chain disruptions will result in the loss of <a href="http://ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_743036/lang--en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">305 million</a> jobs. <a href="https://www.ilo.org/global/topics/employment-promotion/informal-economy/publications/WCMS_743534/lang--en/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.6 billion</a> informal economy workers are at risk of losing their livelihoods. This devastation will be compounded by famine and the increased <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/health/coronavirus-tuberculosis-aids-malaria.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spread of untreated diseases</a> like <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/06/200624103257.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tuberculosis</a>. In July closed food markets were linked to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-ap-top-news-understanding-the-outbreak-hunger-international-news-5cbee9693c52728a3808f4e7b4965cbd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10,000 child deaths a month</a>. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/business/coronavirus-destroying-food.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Food is being discarded</a> and crops are rotting in the fields while the number of people facing acute hunger this year has doubled to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/world/africa/coronavirus-hunger-crisis.html">265 </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/world/africa/coronavirus-hunger-crisis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">million</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the start of the covid crisis, vocal segments of the American left argued that economic shutdown was a way to resist <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2020/03/donald-trump-wall-street-coronavirus-profits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">billionaires</a> and <a href="https://www.dsausa.org/democratic-left/we-need-a-global-democratic-socialist-response-to-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">capitalism</a>. This demonstrated a deep misunderstanding of the way <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0411/5-investors-that-are-both-rich-and-smart.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">financiers can profit</a> from economic contraction. Many on the left chose to ignore the Biblical scale of the destruction that economic stoppages would cause, arguing that the covid crisis was an <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2020/03/quarantine-coronavirus-economy-left-organizing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opportunity</a>. Today the left continues to advance the illusion that <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2020/11/joe-biden-coronavirus-pandemic-relief" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meaningful relief</a> is possible, while workers’ pensions are plundered, children’s futures disappear, and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/07/economy/global-poverty-rate-coronavirus/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">150 …</a></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__next"><div><div><div><div><div><div><h2>Hanlon's Razor</h2><p>Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>Hanlon's razor asks for reflection in situations where we perceive behavior  to be intentionally malicious. A useful exercise is to rethink the scenario  by replacing the malicious intent with reasons such as stupidity, stress or  just plain old misunderstanding.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>Your five-year old probably isn't making a mess to make your life miserable  but rather because they're a toddler.</p></li><li><p>A social networking website probably didn't flag your content out of malice  but rather due to a faulty algorithm.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Occam's Razor</h2><p>When comparing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>Occam's razor originally stated that entities should not be multiplied unnecessarily. In other words, don't complicate things when you don't need to. By shaving off unnecessary additions, the resulting explanation tends  to be less ambiguous, easier to verify, and just plain simpler. Occam's  Razor is often mentioned when selecting a simple solution over a complex  one. Note that this is a slightly stronger form than the principle  intended--reality can be complex and there are cases where the simple  solution is not correct.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>A sore throat during during the winter is probably the result of a cold even though the symptoms match a rare terminal disease on WebMD.</p></li><li><p>The pyramids being built by humans has far less assumptions than the pyramids being built by aliens.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>First Principles Reasoning</h2><p>Break complex problems into foundational elements and use these elements to build your reasoning.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>A first principle is a foundational assumption or proposition that cannot be derived from other assumption or propositions. By attempting to break down problems into first principles and re-constructing solutions using these building blocks, you're less likely to be biased by prior assumptions. This in turn can lead to more innovative solutions.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>A child repeatedly asking "why?" to answers for an initial question is intuitively thinking in first principles.</p></li><li><p>A company building a cheaper product than competitors by investigating ways of using the raw materials firsthand instead of just following existing conventions.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Proximate and Root Causes</h2><p>Discovering the root cause of an event involves looking deeper than the immediate causes for that event.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>A proximate cause is the event most closely associated with or immediately responsible for an observed result. This may differ from the root cause. Getting to a root cause often requires a deep dive into the situation using approaches like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_questioning">Socratic questioning</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys">5 Whys</a></p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>Post-mortem reports for critical failures generally outline proximate causes and how they stem from the root cause. For instance a website was down due servers running out of disk space which was in turn a result of a bug which in turn was a result of poor testing and so on.</p></li><li><p>A child repeatedly asking "why?" to answers for an initial question is trying to get to the root cause.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Social Proof</h2><p>We tend to copy the behavior of others, especially during times of uncertainty.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>Social proof is a term used to describe our tendency to follow the behavior of others. This tendency is amplified if we are uncertain about the situation. Social proof generally guides us into making fewer mistakesâ€”if many folks are doing something, itâ€™s usually the correct thing to do. However, this â€œauto-pilotâ€� behavior can be easily exploited to manipulate our decision making process. For instance, to lead us towards a decision that serves someone else's interests or is incorrect.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>Laugh tracks in TV shows and hired clappers in a theater performance can trick us into perceiving the content to be funnier or higher quality than it actually is.</p></li><li><p>Testimonials increase our likelihood of buying a product, especially when they indicate popularity. Terms like â€œbest sellingâ€� or â€œrecommended by 9 out of 10 professionalsâ€� are marketing applications of social proof.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Survivorship Bias</h2><p>We tend to focus on things that survived and overlook things that didn't. This can lead to overly optimistic beliefs.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>Survivorship bias occurs when we develop a skewed view of a situation by concentrating on the people or things that survived. Things that didn't survive lack visibility and are overlooked. A common result of survivorship bias is overly optimistic beliefs. By focusing primarily on the success stories, we fail to fully understand why the "failures" did not survive, often just assuming that it's due to a lack of qualities found in the survivors. Looking for counter examples when deriving patterns from success stories can be a useful exercise in combating survivorship bias.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>sWe often attribute the success of famous entrepreneurs solely to their behavior and overlook things like luck and timing. By ignoring the failed companies that followed similar approaches, we might be overly optimistic about the likelihood of our own entrepreneurial success.</p></li><li><p>It's easy to perceive music from the past as being higher quality than contemporary works. Music from the past, however, has gone through a selection process where higher quality works have survived. With contemporary music, we hear the mediocre along with the good.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Reciprocity</h2><p>We tend to feel obligated to repay positive actions towards us (e.g. favors, gifts) even if they are unwanted.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>Reciprocity refers to a social norm in which we feel a sense of obligation when receiving positive actions towards us. For instance, receiving a favor or gift can trigger feelings of indebtedness to repay the act in someway. While reciprocity allows one to build relationships and exchanges, it can be exploited to gain someone's compliance to a request. This is because feelings of obligation can be felt even when receiving a positive action we do not want.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>Before attempting to sell something, a salesperson may give you a small gift (e.g. a pen or a free sample). Even if this gift is unwanted, receiving it can still trigger a need to repay the gift, usually in the form of purchasing whatever is being sold.</p></li><li><p>A common compliance technique is to start by making a large request that's likely to be rejected followed by a second, smaller request. The second request, which is the intended request, is more likely to be accepted as it's seen as a favor.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Hindsight Bias</h2><p>The feeling that we could have predicted an event after it occurs (i.e. we "knew it all along").</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>Hindsight bias is the feeling we get when we perceive an event as being predictable, even though there's little evidence to suggest we could have predicted it. Once the event has occurred, it's easy to work backwards and find explanations. While hindsight bias can result in increased confidence and performance, too much can lead to overconfidence and an inability to learn from experience. For instance, by assuming that we could have done better than others after knowing the results of their actions, we lost an opportunity to understand why those actions were made.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>In court, judgement of a defendant can be clouded by hindsight bias. The jury, knowing the outcome of the defendant's actions, might feel as if they could have predicted the outcome.</p></li><li><p>We may feel that people in the past were less intelligent or innovative than those of the present without acknowledging that they did not access to present day information. Related: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historian%27s_fallacy">Historian's fallacy</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronological_snobbery">chronological snobbery</a>.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Confirmation Bias</h2><p>We have a tendency to perceive things in a way that re-enforces or aligns with our preexisting beliefs.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>Confirmation bias is a cognitive bias that causes us to see things in a way that confirms our preexisting beliefs. Because it involves selectively collecting and recalling information, the end result is a biased view point. In addition, confirmation bias may also cause us to ignore information that doesn't support our views. Closely related is the feeling of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance">cognitive dissonance</a> which refers to the discomfort we feel when holding contradictory beliefs.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>In social media, we're often shown content that we're more likely to agree with. This amplifies confirmation bias--we only see things consistent with our beliefs resulting a sort of "echo chamber". For more on this, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble">filter bubbles</a>.</p></li><li><p>Belief in farfetched conspiracy theories can often be a result of confirmation bias. If one tries hard enough, they can find things that seem to support the theory while ignoring the evidence that refutes it.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Scarcity</h2><p>We tend to place higher value on things that are rare and lower value on things that are abundant.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>Scarcity refers to our tendency to place value on things according to how rare they are. It's often used as a mental shortcut to assess the value of something based on how easy or difficult is it to acquire. Scarcity doesn't just apply to objects--it can also be applied to things like time and information. For instance, we might place high value on spending some time with a busy individual or getting access to confidential information. Since scarcity can increase our desire for something, it's often artificially created to sell something. A good strategy to combat this desire is to remember that scarcity only increases our desire to obtain something and doesn't affect the actual value we'll extract from it.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>Sales techniques likes setting deadlines on promotions or indicating that limited quantities are available are designed to drive up scarcity driven desire for the item being sold.</p></li><li><p>When information is censored, we not only feel a stronger desire to know about it and but also tend to be more favorable to it.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Pareto Principle</h2><p>For many scenarios, 80% of the effects stem from 20% of the causes. This is often referred to as the 80/20 rule.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>In 1896, economist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilfredo_Pareto">Vilfredo Pareto</a> found that 20% of the population in Italy owned 80% of the land.

      <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Two years ago, I did something that I’d never done in my career before- I left a job
(at <a href="https://nuro.ai/">Nuro</a>) only a few months after starting it. In this post, I want to explain
what happened and what I learned from the experience.</p>

<h2 id="what-happened">What happened</h2>

<h4 id="the-job-switch">The job switch</h4>

<p>Back in the spring of 2019, I decided to leave <a href="https://www.stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, where I’d
been a software engineer for about a year and a half. The full details are best left
to a separate post, but at a high level I just wasn’t very happy with my personal situation; the
work I was doing in compute infrastructure had the unfortunate combination of being both
overly stressful and underappreciated. At the same time, I felt like my career prospects
were limited because the upper rungs of Stripe’s engineering individual contributor (IC) ladder put
a lot of emphasis on cross-team coordination and other, managerial-like activities that I didn’t
enjoy and felt I wasn’t very good at.</p>

<p>Given how hot the job market was at the time and the number of other, seemingly more interesting
opportunities available, I figured that I had nothing to lose by interviewing elsewhere.</p>

<p>After a few weekends of furiously-paced <a href="https://yolken.net/blog/master-coding-interviews">Leetcoding</a>, I was ready.
Unlike my previous job searches, there wasn’t any particular company that I was aspiring
to get into; instead, I just went through my <a href="https://yolken.net/blog/six-years-of-emails">backlog of recruiting emails</a>
and wrote back to a bunch that looked interesting. Among the messages I responded to was one
about <a href="https://nuro.ai/">Nuro</a>, an autonomous vehicle startup that was attempting to do driverless
grocery delivery.</p>

<p>Over the following weeks, I went through the full recruitment slog, starting with lots of
recruiter phone calls, then following up with technical phone screens for a subset of
those, then doing onsite interviews for a subset of those. In the end, I got offers from seven
places, including Nuro.</p>

<p>During the process, I didn’t fall in love with any of the options. But, there
was something that made me feel more optimistic about Nuro than the other choices. Being a
hardware-oriented, robotics company, it was just really different from all of my previous employers,
and, after years of feeling stuck in my career, maybe different was good.</p>

<p>The company was super secretive about its technology; I wasn’t allowed to tour the office, for
instance, because they had hardware prototypes lying around that only employees were allowed to
see. I also wasn’t invited to ride along in their test cars, which would have been both fun and
informative. The external signs were good, though- they had raised a billion dollars from Softbank
and others, and the employee reviews on <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/">Glassdoor</a> were gushing.</p>

<p>Aside from being in a somewhat different space than my previous employers, another potential
downside was the commute. Stripe and my three jobs before that were all within a 15 minute walk
of my apartment in San Francisco. Nuro’s office was 40 miles away in Mountain View, which was
more than an hour each way by train. But, I had done longer commutes earlier in my career and figured
that I could handle it.</p>

<p>In the end, I went with my impulses and signed the offer. I had my last day at Stripe, took a short
vacation, and then showed up at the Nuro office, brimming with optimism, for my first day two weeks
later.</p>

<h4 id="realizing-my-mistake">Realizing my mistake</h4>

<p>Unfortunately, that optimism lasted for a grand total of 2 days. By Wednesday of my first week,
as I was riding the train home, I realized that I had made a mistake. My colleagues were
friendly and smart, and the company was doing interesting things, but the job just felt like a
lifestyle downgrade to me.</p>

<p>At Stripe and each of my jobs before that, I had had a short commute to a beautiful office, and
got to experience the instant gratification associated with developing purely software-based
products. Now, I was stuck taking a crowded train to a dark office littered with hardware parts,
working on a product that would take many years to reach mass-market adoption due to pesky little
things like manufacturing and road safety.</p>

<p>I had left Stripe seeking an upgrade, but instead I got a downgrade. And, while minor improvements
were possible, it seemed unlikely that things would completely change for the better in the near
term.</p>

<h4 id="getting-back-on-track">Getting back on track</h4>

<p>At this point, I had three choices:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Quit immediately</li>
  <li>Start exploring new opportunities but don’t quit until something better is lined up</li>
  <li>Stick it out for at least a year</li>
</ol>

<p>My first instinct was to take option 1 and just go back to Stripe. When I reached out to my HR
contact, though, I found out that I’d have to go through team matching again and also get a new
offer; even though I’d left on good terms less than a month before, I couldn’t just revert back to
my previous position and pay. This was disappointing, but after giving it a little more thought,
I figured it was for the best because I had left Stripe for specific reasons; going back
to my old job wouldn’t fix those or make me feel better about them.</p>

<p>Another variant of option 1 would be to quit and take one of the other offers I had gotten
during my search. But, I had already rejected those for what I thought were good reasons,
so this didn’t feel like the best way out.</p>

<p>Option 3 was the one that would look the least bad from a resume perspective, and this seems to be
what a lot of people in tech do when they don’t like a job. But, life is short, I was really feeling
unhappy with the choice I had made, and I figured it wasn’t really fair to my colleagues at Nuro to
stick in a job that my heart wasn’t in.</p>

<p>So, in the end, I decided that option 2 was the best fit for me. I continued at Nuro and did my best
to get up-to-speed and to contribute to my team’s work, but at the same time jumped right back
into the job market. In addition to keeping things open with Stripe, I
<a href="https://yolken.net/blog/triplebyte-review">tried Triplebyte</a>, responded to more recruiter emails, and also
reached out to some former colleagues about the companies they were now at.</p>

<p>I then went through the whole recruitment process with a new set of companies. This time,
though, I was a lot pickier about where I interviewed (nothing in hardware or with long commutes!);
after a few weeks, I had four new choices including an updated offer from Stripe. After
a good amount of due diligence, significantly more than I had done in my previous search, I
decided to go to <a href="https://segment.com/">Segment</a>.</p>

<p>When I put in my notice at Nuro, people were surprised that I was leaving so soon, but ultimately
were understanding. I left, took a short vacation, and then started at Segment. Thankfully,
the new job was a much better fit for me, and I’m much happier now!</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h2>

<h4 id="do-your-due-diligence">Do your due diligence</h4>

<p>Switching jobs is a big deal, and it shouldn’t be done impulsively. Ideally, your due
diligence before signing a new offer should include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Meeting with the team you’ll be working with in a low-stress, non-interview setting</li>
  <li>Touring the office and understanding what your specific workspace will be like</li>
  <li>Trying out the commute for a few days (if it’s significantly different than your current one)</li>
  <li>Trying out any new languages/technologies that you’ll be using on the job</li>
  <li>Getting hands-on demos of the company’s products (if they’re not freely accessible to consumers
  already)</li>
  <li>Seeing a summary of the company’s income and expenses over time (if not public)</li>
</ol>

<p>Learning about these things doesn’t guarantee that you’ll be happy in your new job, but it
at least reduces the risk of any unexpected surprises after you start.</p>

<h4 id="its-ok-to-quit-after-a-few-weeks-just-dont-make-it-a-pattern">It’s ok to quit after a few weeks (just don’t make it a pattern)</h4>

<p>When I started my second job search, I was worried that the short
tenure in the job I was trying to leave would be a turn-off to perspective employers. In reality,
however, it wasn’t a big deal- people asked about it, but seemed satisfied with my 20 second
summary and then moved on to other things.</p>

<p>The sense I get is that you’re allowed to quit a new job once in your career without any
repercussions. If you do it multiple times, however, then recruiters and hiring managers might
have second thoughts about interviewing you without strong internal references or some other signal
that you’ll be a good employee.</p>

<h4 id="switch-teams-before-quitting">Switch teams before quitting</h4>

<p>As I noted in a <a href="https://yolken.net/blog/leaving-a-job">previous post</a>, switching teams is a lot easier than
switching jobs. I didn’t do this before I left Stripe because there weren’t any other teams that I
was super enthusiastic about at the time. But, in retrospect, I probably should have given this a
try before quitting.</p>

<p>Even if the new team hadn’t been a perfect fit, it would have at least bought some time and given
me some additional experience that could help in future work. This is what I did at Google
and Airbnb, and in both cases the “second team” was what really opened up new opportunities for me.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p>A previous <a href="https://adalytics.io/blog/tens-of-thousands-of-news-articles-are-labeled-as-unsafe-for-advertisers">Adalytics</a> post discussed how tens of thousands of articles on the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>Forbes</em>, and <em>CNBC</em> websites appear to be marked as ‘unsafe’ by brand safety ad tech vendors. The post documented that those brand safety values appear to be utilized in ad auctions and ad server requests, meaning they could potentially be affecting news publishers’ ad revenues.&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier this year, journalists at a hedge-fund owned California newspaper <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/news/2020/10/19/mcclatchy-tie-pay-to-clicks.html">declared</a> they were fighting an effort to tie performance reviews based on the “the popularity of their stories as measured by clicks.” Most major news publishers retain a long-standing separation between the revenue and editorial departments of their organizations. However, the mere possibility that ad revenue could in some rare instances bias managerial decisions warrants a further investigation into the factors that may influence the monetary value of a journalist’s content.

This analysis focuses on how content from individual journalists and contributors at The <em>New York Times</em> (NYT), <em>Wall Street Journal</em> (WSJ), <em>CNBC</em>, and <em>Forbes</em> are categorized as safe or unsafe by ad tech vendors. Notably, a number of war correspondents and Pulitzer Prize winners have more than two thirds of their news articles marked as ‘unsafe’ for certain digital ads to display on. Nicholas <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Kristof">Kristof</a>, a double Pulitzer Prize winner who frequently advocates for human rights, has over 300 of his NYT articles (60.5%) labeled as brand unsafe. </p><p>A <a href="https://adalytics.io/blog/tens-of-thousands-of-news-articles-are-labeled-as-unsafe-for-advertisers">previous</a> exploratory analysis of 22,722 recent New York Times articles revealed that 30.3% appeared to be labeled as unsafe by Οracle Grapeshοt. In this analysis, a more comprehensive dataset of 332,710 nytimes.com articles from 2015 to 2020 was assembled. For each of these articles that used Javascript code from Grapeshοt, a given page was considered to be ‘safe’ if it contained the term ‘gv_safe’ (based on information released in Grapeshοt’s documentation), and ‘unsafe’ if it included any labels such as ‘gv_crime’, ‘gv_adult’ or other unsafe categories. A large number (but not all) articles contained clearly labeled ‘author’ meta tags and ‘section’ meta tags that could be used to group articles.</p><p>The table below indicates which New York Times journalists and contributors had the largest proportion of their content labeled as ‘unsafe’. </p><p>Ali <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ali-winston">Winston</a>, an investigative reporter who  “covers the New York City Police Department” and covered issues of criminal justice and surveillance across the United States, had more than 96% of his articles labeled as unsafe. Numerous foreign correspondents who cover warzones, such as Thomas <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/thomas-gibbons-neff">Gibbons-Neff</a> and Rukmini <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/rukmini-callimachi">Callimachi</a> (four time Pulitzer Prize finalist), had more than 90% of their articles labeled as ‘unsafe’. Double Pulitzer Prize winner and human rights activist Nicholas <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Kristof">Kristof</a> had 305 out of his 504 (60.5%) articles labeled as ‘unsafe’.</p><p><i>Table of observed Οracle Grapeshοt brand safety values from <a href="https://nytimes.com/">nytimes.com</a>, grouped by journalist or author.</i></p><p>Additionally, it’s clear that certain sections of the New York Times are disproportionately likely to be labeled as ‘unsafe’. For example, 79.3% articles in the "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/obituaries">Obituaries</a>" section and 53.2% articles in the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/world">World</a>” section are labeled as unsafe. This is likely due to the fact that journalists often have to use keywords related to "death" when covering such topics, which may automatically trigger a negative classification.</p><p><i>Table of observed Οracle Grapeshοt brand safety values from <a href="https://nytimes.com/">nytimes.com</a>, grouped by section.</i></p><p>As discussed in the previous <a href="https://adalytics.io/blog/tens-of-thousands-of-news-articles-are-labeled-as-unsafe-for-advertisers">analysis</a>, the Wall Street Journal (as well as other News Corp owned web properties) appear to be using brand safety technology provided by Οracle’s Mοat division and Cοmscοre. The two vendors provide labels which appear to be incorporated into network requests to ad auctions and header bidding services.</p><p>Based on an analysis of 30,033 wsj.com pages, it appears that a number of journalists have more than 90% of their work labeled as ‘unsafe’ by either Mοat or Cοmscοre. Zusha <a href="https://www.wsj.com/news/author/zusha-elinson">Elison</a>, who covers various gun and police related topics, had 92% of his articles labeled as “moat_unsafe” often due to “gv_arms” or “gv_death_injury”. Ben <a href="https://www.wsj.com/news/author/ben-chapman">Chapman</a>, who “covers criminal justice for The Wall Street Journal in New York”, had at least 104 of his articles marked as "moat_unsafe".</p><p>Katherine <a href="https://www.wsj.com/news/author/katherine-clarke">Clarke</a>, who covers residential real estate, appears to have 74 out of 132 articles (56%) labeled as “brandsafe: unsafe” by Comscore.</p><p><i>Table illustrating how many articles by each WSJ journalist were labeled as "unsafe" by either Mοat or Cοmscοre</i></p><p>There are a number of notable journalists, columnists, and writers who focus primarily on covering various advertising or digital marketing related topics. It appears that these writers are not exempt from having their content classified as “unsafe” by various vendors.</p><p>Megan <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/megan-graham/">Graham</a>, a reporter who covers advertising and marketing for CNBC and previously worked at Ad Age, had 23 out of her cnbc.com 219 articles (11%) marked as “moat_unsafe”. 15 were unsafe due to “gv_death_injury”, 7 were marked as unsafe due to “gv_arms”, and 3 were marked as unsafe due to “gv_tobacco”. The cnbc.com website also appears to use semantic <a href="https://adtechdaily.com/2018/06/21/admantx-launches-its-new-hyper-granular-contextual-taxonomy-for-more-precise-contextual-targeting-in-the-gdpr-era/">contextual intelligence</a> technology from Admantx, a company that was <a href="https://integralads.com/news/integral-ad-science-acquires-admantx/">acquired</a> by Integral Ad Sciences (IAS) in 2019. The Admantx technology does not appear to have binary classifications for “safe” or “unsafe”, but rather, seems to allow individual advertisers to avoid showing their ads on webpages that contain individual keywords. This hypothesis is supported by the presence of what appear to be individual brands’ keyword lists in various Javascript network calls. </p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/81MYYg9VNJb3Dn0IgzFKip0n_Klq2cgY1uOaLrpTRilIF-jJehcKjDJ5Rj3qVl_mKdU1BZVlXY6yFJ_hR4EhjHWloojQSNqi8_eObPXERggchiZgg0hLhnUV4yvFtLEalnJoI4zx" alt="Screenshot of Chrome Developer Tools showing IAS Admantx response values for an article on cnbc.com by Megan Graham"></p><p>The presence of a string ending in “_Neg” or “_Negative” may indicate that a given brand is blocking their digital ads from rendering on a given webpage due to the presence of certain keywords in that context (i.e. “Fidelity_Negative” may indicate that Fidelity wants to avoid having their ads show on that specific webpage). In Megan Graham’s case, 132 of her 219 cnbc.com articles contain the label "Barclays_Negative2" in the admantx.com network response. For example, 202 out 219 of her cnbc.com articles contain the Admantx label 'ErnstYoung_Neg', which may indicate that the British professional services firm Ernst &amp; Young want to avoid placing their ads on 92% of Graham’s articles because they consider them to be brand “unsafe”. Some of the keyword lists include interesting names, such as “IBM_JeffreyEpstein”, which appeared on 154 of Graham’s articles, or “FlexShares_Coronavirus” which appeared on 130 of her webpages.</p><p><i>Table illustrating which IAS Admantx category and keyword labels appear most frequently across CNBC reporter Megan Graham’s 219 articles. Some of these labels may correspond to brand specific keyword blocklists, which prevent a given brand’s digital ads from rendering on a given webpage. For example, the presence of “ErnstYoung_Neg” may indicate that the professional services firm Ernst &amp; Young is blocking their ads from showing on 202 of Megan Graham’s CNBC articles due to presence of certain keywords on those pages.</i></p><p>Sheila <a href="https://www.reuters.com/journalists/sheila-dang">Dang</a>, an advertising-focused Reuters reporter, had 7 out of 193 of her articles labeled as "moat_unsafe". Her February <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-football-nfl-superbowl-advertising-idUSKBN1ZX2JO">article</a> about how "<em>Doritos take top spot in Super Bowl Ads</em>" was categorized as "gv_arms" - this likely corresponds to a Oracle Data Cloud "avoidance category" <a href="https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/corporate/acquisitions/grapeshot-methodology.pdf">which</a> "avoids webpage textual content
around guns and weapons". Another <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cbs-results/cbs-beats-wall-street-estimates-for-quarterly-revenue-idUSKBN1KN2SQ">article</a> from August, 2018 about how "<em>CBS beats Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue</em>", was labeled as "moat_unsafe" due "gv_crime". This is likely a reference to an avoidance category <a href="https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/corporate/acquisitions/grapeshot-methodology.pdf">about</a> "sex and violent" crime segments.</p><p>Similarly to Megan Graham, many of Dang's articles also contain Admantx labels which may correspond to brand specific keyword exclusion lists. It appears that a large French luxury goods conglomerate may be blocking their ads from 75.1% of Dang's <em>reuters.com</em> articles. Several large software and banking corporations also appear to take issue with some keywords that appear on 60% of Dang's news pieces.</p><p><i id="reuters-shiela-dang-brandsafety-airtable">Table of IAS Admantx and Oracle Moat brand safety labels for 193 <a href="https://reuters.com/">reuters.com</a> articles by Shiela <a href="https://www.reuters.com/journalists/sheila-dang">Dang</a>.

      <p>Coming up with ideas for your startup’s blog can be mentally taxing. While an <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/seo-audit/">SEO audit</a> can help you find opportunities in Google results, it can leave your blog topics feeling a little bit flat.</p>

<p>One strategy is to publish a mix of SEO-driven content with more creative, shareable posts that help you build organic backlinks and social proof. If you want to make sure you <a href="https://draft.dev/learn/posts/ideas">always have some ideas in the hopper</a>, you need to put a healthy backlog of creative blog post ideas into <a href="https://draft.dev/learn/posts/publishing-calendar">your publishing calendar</a></p>


      


      
<p>Over the past decade, I’ve written a lot of blog posts and I’ve seen many of these ideas work for myself or clients. While not every idea in this list is going to be a good fit for your startup, these might help spark your creativity.</p>

<h2 id="50-startup-blog-post-ideas">50+ Startup Blog Post Ideas</h2>

<h3 id="1-product-awareness">1. Product Awareness</h3>
<p>These ideas are great if your startup is still in the launch and product-market fit phase. Once you start building a collection of posts explaining your product, you can send these to prospective customers to help make your case.</p>

<p>Later on, as your product gains traction, these posts will offer Google searchers authoritative information that guides them into your funnel. If you’re going to start blogging, covering these topics should be at the top of your list.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Highlight a little-known feature of your product.</li>
  <li>Highlight various use cases for your product.</li>
  <li>Write a “how to” guide for using/buying/setuping up your product.</li>
  <li>Create a customer case study.</li>
  <li>“10 ways to solve problem X” (One of which includes your product).</li>
  <li>Mythbusting a problem your product solves.</li>
  <li>Compare your product to your competition.</li>
  <li>Do a screencast or record a video using your product.</li>
  <li>Share an excerpt from an ebook, white paper, webinar, etc. with a call to action to download it.</li>
  <li>Respond to frequently asked questions about your product.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-interviews-and-surveys">2. Interviews and Surveys</h3>
<p>Another interesting way to generate content without quite as much writing work is to compile data from customers, partners, and prospects. I have published many interview posts and compiled the advice from an interview series into a comprehensive guide.</p>

<p>This strategy can net you dozens of blog posts with just a few hours of work, and your interviewees might even share it with their audience.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Interview customers who are using your product.</li>
  <li>Interview industry specialists.</li>
  <li>Interview someone who used to work for a competitor.</li>
  <li>Interview a professor, recent graduate, or someone who just retired from your industry.</li>
  <li>Interview speakers or sponsors at a conference.</li>
  <li>Ask a question or conduct a poll on <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> and share the results.</li>
  <li>Do a survey with Survey Monkey (or <a href="https://draft.dev/learn/tools/surveys">one of these other tools</a>) among your community members.</li>
  <li>Get experts to offer a tip and do a round-up of their recommendations.</li>
  <li>Feature guest posts from industry experts.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-roundups">3. Roundups</h3>
<p>Lists of tools, tips, and ideas (like this one) are among the most widely-shared and easily read content on the internet. Readers can skim the piece quickly and use the roundup as a jumping-off point for solving their problems, and <a href="https://www.grizzle.io/listicles/">they tend to rank well in Google</a>.</p>

<p>Here are a few ideas for generating lists that might do well on your blog:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Compile a list of popular sites in your industry (be sure to notify them and encourage them to share).</li>
  <li>Compile the most popular social media posts in your industry this month/year/week.</li>
  <li>Create a list of benefits for doing something.</li>
  <li>Create a list of things to avoid.</li>
  <li>Find tips in other content, create a list of those tips, and give links to those articles as the sources.</li>
  <li>Share a list of conference takeaways.</li>
  <li>Collect the top motivational YouTube videos, ebooks, webinars, or infographics for your audience.</li>
  <li>Collect Tweets from a webinar or conference hashtag, and offer your own takeaways in the blog post.</li>
  <li>Create a list of trends to watch.</li>
  <li>Make a list of products that complement yours well.</li>
  <li>Collect a list of social media accounts people in your industry should follow.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-thought-leadership">4. Thought Leadership</h3>
<p>Positioning your startup’s founders as important leaders in the space is a good way to build your brand and showcase your expertise. Some founders do this naturally, and others work with a ghostwriter. Either way, people in your leadership team should make a point to do some thought leadership content as you get your blog started.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Take a stand on a controversial issue.</li>
  <li>Make a prediction related to your industry.</li>
  <li>Industry trends commentary.</li>
  <li>Side-by-side comparison of complementary company/service.</li>
  <li>Review a book your customers should read.</li>
  <li>Point out common mistakes in your industry and offer solutions on how to fix or avoid them.</li>
  <li>Relate your content to a current event or a celebrity (eg: “5 Lessons from Lady Gaga” or “What the Election Teaches Us About…”).</li>
  <li>Take the contrarian position on someone else’s article that you disagree with.</li>
  <li>Share your slides from a recent presentation.</li>
  <li>Respond to industry research with your own perspective. Offer a fresh angle to spark conversation.</li>
  <li>Do an in-depth case study about one company, or offer a few examples of how other companies do something successfully.</li>
  <li>Offer industry takeaways about breaking news.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="5-team-company-and-culture-focus">5. Team, Company, and Culture Focus</h3>
<p>Finally, if you’re looking to build more content that attracts talent or showcases your team, here are a few ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Highlight your culture, mission, or values.</li>
  <li>Write about “What we’re not”.</li>
  <li>Create a music video for your company.</li>
  <li>Interview each member of your team about their career and experience.</li>
  <li>Post photos from a recent event/conference.</li>
  <li>Post screenshots from a virtual event.</li>
  <li>Videos/photos of employees behind the scenes.</li>
  <li>If someone gets promoted, talk about how/why they were successful.</li>
  <li>Post about the current season or holiday.</li>
  <li>Sum up the year that was.</li>
</ul>

Some people thrive in a high rise tower in the central business district. Mine is a Main Street town of the kind that peaked about a century ago. But there’s another more obscure environment that’s harder to define because it’s more about cultural imperatives rather than physical structures or location.</p><p>A reader reached out to me with a query. He and his wife and three daughters are in search of “a slower, more nature and community bound life, but without leaving behind people who read books, et cetera. I'm forever looking for where Henry Miller's Big Sur is today, or Provincetown, or even the Upper West Side of 1960, or the San Francisco of the early 90s. We have some money, but we don't want to be around people who are money driven.”</p><p>First, note that the desired location isn’t specifically urban or rural. There’s a huge spread between Manhattan and the rugged California coast at Big Sur. Provincetown and San Francisco are in-between versions of Main Street towns at different scales. And I don’t detect an inherent exclusion of a quality suburb in the statement either. The quest is about the intangibles that a place might provide.</p><p>I have to acknowledge the tension inherent in the quote. There’s a yearning for high culture, meaningful engagement with neighbors, and an attractive landscape. These things tend to cost extra and can be scarce. But there’s also a rejection of crass materialism.</p><p>Wouldn’t it be great to live in exactly the right place at the right time when everything was still super authentic and affordable, but simultaneously unique and undiscovered? The whole thing is problematic and, let’s be honest, a bit tone deaf in terms of class and such. I understand the impulse. I will admit to sharing this same desire myself. So how to square these romantic notions with external reality without being a complete ass about it? I’ll start by poking holes in the nostalgia.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606454661608_35196"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606454661608_33388"><div><p>I got a flashback to my best friend Joann circa 1985. She was accepted to a prestigious art school in Manhattan and I helped her get settled into her first rented room. It was in pre-gentrification Times Square in what had once been a dentist office complete with linoleum floors, synthetic wood paneling, orange fiberglass chairs, and fluorescent lights. It felt like a public bus. There was no air conditioning in the sweltering heat of a New York summer. The makeshift kitchenette was equipped with an electric hot plate and an elderly microwave. Technically it wasn't a legal residence, but neither the authorities nor the landlord seemed to care. Code enforcement came years later - with Disney.</p><p>She rented her room from a married couple who painted and made documentary films about their artist friends in the city. Joann paid reduced rent in exchange for babysitting the couple's three year old son. Her bedroom was exactly the size of her mattress since the partition walls had been installed for maximum efficiency. The bedroom door opened outward toward the corridor and she would just fall in on the bed and hang her possessions on hooks like a boat. This was the version of urban loft living that never made it to the pages of Architectural Digest.</p><p>They all lived there because it was relatively cheap and the location allowed them to be close to the people and activities they cared about. They had an extraordinarily high tolerance for alcoholic schizophrenic neighbors. The accommodations were meant to be functional. They didn't strive to transform the place into anything beyond what it was. The apartment was filled with their art and film making equipment and the many visitors they collaborated with. The city was their living room, kitchen, and back garden.</p><p>While Joann was living there the couple bought a modest second home in rural Pennsylvania for about the cost of a nice car. Their goal was simple - provide a place to balance city life and enjoy the countryside with their kid without spending a lot of money. The house was absolutely nothing special and they made no effort to renovate the property beyond basic mechanical repairs. It wasn't in a bougie town with nice restaurants or themed boutiques. They hadn’t searched for a subdivision in a good school district. It was just a random spot in a farm field near nothing in particular.</p><p>What mattered most to them was the freedom that came with low overhead. Their city friends would migrate out with them for summer and winter holidays and they created their own cuisine, art, and conversation. And they read lots of books. They just weren't interested in much beyond the inner world they were busy creating themselves. They didn’t need to purchase culture from a fashionable postal code. They made their own. I learned a lot from that family and their example.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606454661608_14048"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606454661608_14342"><div><p>Some years later I had a friend who worked at the <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/pkhouse/" target="_blank">Pollock-Krasner House and Study Center</a> on the far tip of Long Island which is now administered by Stony Brook University. In 1945 modern artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Pollock" target="_blank">Jackson Pollock</a> and his wife, fellow artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Krasner" target="_blank">Lee Krasner</a>, bought the little house on an acre and a half with water views for $5,000. That’s the current inflation adjusted equivalent of $73,000 today. Their patron <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggy_Guggenheim" target="_blank">Peggy Guggenheim</a> provided the $2,000 down payment. Back then the average family earned $2,595 a year so a home could be bought with two years pay.</p><p>This was at a time when the Hamptons were still sleepy country villages and the national economy was only just emerging from wartime rationing. Their neighbors were farmers and fishermen, not financiers or movie stars. They had access to what was sold at the local general store, but not much else. And they were three hours from the city. Pollock struggled with his internal demons until his death in a drunken car wreck along with his mistress in 1956. The life of an artist isn’t always picturesque up close.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606454661608_45411"><div>

He was on his third wife when he settled in at Big Sur and that marriage ended in divorce as well. Once his two children were grown he was an older man living in a small cottage in the forest alone much of the time. Miller helped establish the mystique of Big Sur, but the wealth that followed made his lifestyle difficult for others to replicate on a normal budget.</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606454661608_59524"><div>

<p>In the United States, there is something of an intense debate over how the word&nbsp;<em>gyro</em>&nbsp;is supposed to be pronounced. Many people pronounce it /ˈdʒaɪɹoʊ/ (or, to use fauxnetics, “JAI-roh’). Many other people, however, insist that it is supposed to be pronounced /ˈjiː.ɹoʊ/ (that is, “YEE-roh” in fauxnetics). This debate even made it into the recent Disney Pixar animated film&nbsp;<em>Soul</em>, which includes a flashback scene in which a mischievous unborn soul named “Twenty-Two” is portrayed as arguing with the spirit of the ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes (lived c. 287 – c. 212 BCE) over the correct pronunciation of the word.</p>



<p>If I were an ordinary pedant, I would simply tell you that the pronunciation /ˈjiː.ɹoʊ/ is correct and that the people who say /ˈdʒaɪɹoʊ/ are wrong. I, however, am no ordinary pedant. On the contrary, I am the most obnoxious and loathsome kind of pedant: a pedant who has spent years studying the Greek language at the university level and who knows far too much about it for my own good.</p>



<p>Therefore, I feel the need to point out that<em>&nbsp;neither&nbsp;</em>of the pronunciations given above is reflective of the actual pronunciation of the word in Modern Greek, since the nominative singular form of the word in Greek is actually γύρος (<em>gýros</em>), with an /s/ sound on the end, and the nominative plural form is actually γύροι (<em>gýroi</em>). Moreover, I feel the need to explain exactly&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;the way the word is spelled in English is so different from how it is pronounced in Greek and to explain precisely how the debate over the pronunciation of the word arose.</p>



<p><strong>A little background</strong></p>



<p>In order to understand the roots of the present controversy over how the word&nbsp;<em>gyro</em>&nbsp;should be pronounced, we need to understand why Greek words are often transliterated in ways that don’t reflect how they are actually pronounced.</p>



<p>In order to understand this, we need to go all the way back to Classical Attic Greek, the dialect of the Greek language that was spoken in the region of Attike, which includes the city of Athens, in the fifth and fourth centuries BCE, since, as strange as it may sound, the modern system of transliterating Greek words into English is based primarily on equivalences between Greek letters as they were pronounced in the Classical Attic dialect and Roman letters as they were pronounced in Classical Latin over two thousand years ago.</p>



<p>In Classical Attic Greek, γυρός was not the name of a particular kind of sandwich, but rather simply an adjective meaning “round.” Here’s the breakdown of how the word would have been pronounced in Athens in the fifth century BCE:</p>



<ul><li>In Classical Attic Greek, the letter ⟨γ⟩ was usually pronounced as the voiced velar plosive /g/ like the letter ⟨g⟩ in the English word&nbsp;<em>got</em>.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The letter ⟨υ⟩ was usually pronounced as the close front rounded vowel sound /y/ like the letter ⟨ü⟩ in the German word&nbsp;<em>über</em>.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The letter ⟨ρ⟩ was pronounced as the voiced alveolar trill /r/ like the letter ⟨r⟩ in Modern Spanish or Italian.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The letter ⟨o⟩ was pronounced as a short close-mid back rounded vowel /o/ similar to the sound made by the letter ⟨o⟩ in the English word&nbsp;<em>tote</em>.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The letter ⟨σ⟩, which is conventionally written ⟨ς⟩ when it occurs at the end of a word, was pronounced as the voiceless alveolar sibilant /s/ like the letter ⟨s⟩ in the English word&nbsp;<em>this</em>.</li></ul>



<p>Thus, in Classical Attic Greek, the word γυρός was pronounced /ɡyː.rós/.</p>



<p>During the Hellenistic Period (lasted c. 323 – c. 30 BCE), a new dialect of the Greek language known as “Koine” developed. Koine Greek was based primarily on Classical Attic Greek, but it was also influenced to some extent by other ancient Greek dialects. It became widely spoken throughout the entire eastern Mediterranean.</p>



<p>In Koine, the adjective γυρός was nominalized to become the second-declension masculine noun γῦρος, which means “circle,” “ring,” or “rotation.” Through this nominalization, the accent shifted from an acute accent on the ultima (i.e., the last syllable) to a circumflex accent on the penult (i.e., the second to last syllable), resulting in the noun form being pronounced /ɡŷː.ros/.</p>

<p><em>ABOVE: Diagram </em><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Circle-withsegments.svg"><em>from Wikimedia Commons</em></a><em> of a circle. The word γῦρος or γύρος in Greek literally means “circle” or “rotation.”</em></p>



<p><strong>Sound shifts in Koine and Medieval Greek</strong></p>



<p>At some point between the second century BCE and the third century CE, the consonant sounds represented by the letter ⟨γ⟩ shifted. From roughly this period onwards, ⟨γ⟩ became pronounced as a voiced velar fricative /ɣ/ before the vowels ⟨α⟩, ⟨ο⟩, and ⟨ω⟩. Meanwhile, it became pronounced as a voiced palatal fricative /ʝ/ before the front vowels ⟨ε⟩, ⟨η⟩, ⟨ι⟩, and ⟨υ⟩. This is a sound very similar to, but slightly different from, the voiced palatal approximant, which is generally represented in English by the consonantal ⟨y⟩.</p>



<p>Other changes in the pronunciation of the Greek language took place during the Middle Ages. By the Middle Byzantine Period, it seems that uneducated people in the countryside of Greece had begun to pronounce the letter ⟨υ⟩ as the close front unrounded vowel /i/, which is the sound made by the letter ⟨i⟩ in the English word&nbsp;<em>machine</em>. This shift occurred as part of a well-attested process known as “iotacism,” which resulted in the letters ⟨ι⟩, ⟨η⟩, and ⟨υ⟩, which had originally represented three different sounds in Classical Attic Greek, coming to all eventually represent the same sound in Standard Modern Greek.</p>



<p>This shift in the popular rural pronunciation seems to have greatly perturbed the educated elites at the time. In around the eleventh century CE, the Greek writer Michael the Grammarian wrote a satirical poem in which a speaker complains about the way uneducated people in the countryside were pronouncing the letter upsilon. He declares:</p>



<blockquote><p>“Ἐμοὶ πατρίς, βέλτιστε, τραχὺ χωρίον,<br>ὅπου περ ἀνδρῶν καὶ βοῶν ἶσαι φρένες,<br>οἳ το κρύον λέγουσιν ἀφρόνως κρίον,<br>καὶ τὸ ξύλον λέγουσιν ἀγροίκως ξίλον.”</p></blockquote>



<p>This means (in my own translation):</p>



<blockquote><p>“My fatherland, oh dearest one, is a coarse village,<br>where the minds of men and cows are just the same.<br>They foolishly say ‘κρίον’ instead of ‘κρύον’<br>and they boorishly say ‘ξίλον’ instead of ‘ξύλον.’”</p></blockquote>



<p>Over time, the pronunciation that Michael derided as coarse and uncivilized seems to have won out; in Standard Modern Greek, the letters ⟨υ⟩ and ⟨ι⟩ are both pronounced /i/. Thus, in Standard Modern Greek, the word γύρος is pronounced /ˈʝiros/.</p>

<p><em>ABOVE: Scene of everyday agricultural workers from an eleventh-century Greek manuscript of the gospels. It’s very likely that such laborers would have pronounced ⟨υ⟩ as /i/, while the scribe who copied the manuscript probably pronounced it /y/.</em></p>



<p><strong>Origin of the gyros sandwich</strong></p>



<p>Now that I’ve explained the origin of the Greek word γύρος and the history of its pronunciation, I should probably explain where the sandwich of this name originates from and how the name came to be applied to the sandwich.</p>



<p>Today in modern Greece, a cook who is preparing a gyros begins by roasting the meat vertically on a skewer and slicing pieces of meat away when they are done cooking. In Greece and Kypros, gyroi are normally made using pork, but a cook may sometimes choose to use chicken, beef, or lamb meat instead. Once the meat has been removed from the skewer, the cook usually serves it wrapped in pita bread as a sandwich. Often, it is served with tzatziki sauce, onions, and tomatoes.</p>



<p>The modern gyros didn’t arise all at once; many innovations had to be made before the gyros as we know it today could be invented. The first of these innovations was the invention of the idea of cooking meat on spits. This idea is extremely ancient; we know that people in the Aegean Islands were already roasting meat on horizontal spits at least over 3,600 years ago, and they were probably doing it long before that as well. Archaeologists excavating the Bronze Age site of Akrotiri on the Greek island of Thera unearthed stone firedogs dating to the seventeenth century BCE or earlier with notches clearly designed to hold skewers for roasting meats.</p>



<p>The<em>&nbsp;Iliad</em>, an ancient Greek epic poem that was most likely composed in around the early seventh century BCE, describes Chryses, the Trojan priest of the god Apollon, roasting meat on horizontal wooden skewers in book one, lines 458–466. The Athenian comic playwright Aristophanes (lived c. 446 – c. 386 BCE) references similar cooking practices in his plays&nbsp;<em>Acharnians</em>&nbsp;(line 1007),&nbsp;<em>The Clouds</em>&nbsp;(line 178),&nbsp;<em>The Wasps</em>&nbsp;(line 354), and&nbsp;<em>The Birds</em>&nbsp;(lines 388 and 672). Today, meats grilled on horizontal spits are known in Greece as&nbsp;<em>souvlakia</em>; they are distinct from, but similar, to gyroi.</p>

<p>The various other ingredients that are used in gyroi today also had to be introduced to Greece. Some of these ingredients were introduced to the Greek diet relatively early. Notably, pita bread—or at least a very similar kind of flatbread—is known to have existed in ancient Greece. The Greek Egyptian writer Athenaios of Naukratis, who wrote sometime in around the late second or early third century CE, quotes a description of the cooking process for a kind of flatbread known as&nbsp;<em>apanthrakis</em>&nbsp;in his book&nbsp;<em>Wise Men at Dinner</em>&nbsp;3.110b. The description reads as follows, as translated by S. Douglas Olson:</p>



<blockquote><p>“The&nbsp;<em>apanthrakis</em>&nbsp;is more delicate than wafer bread. This type too is probably produced on top of coals, like what Attic authors refer to as an&nbsp;<em>enkryphia</em>. The inhabitants of Alexandria offer it to Kronos and put it out in his temple for anyone who wants some to eat.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Similarly, onions, which are often served on gyroi today, were fairly common in ancient Greek cuisine and they are often mentioned as an ingredient in surviving ancient Greek recipes.</p>

<p>The onset of the worldwide autism epidemic has seemed a bizarre and unknowable phenomenon, existing through a wide range of symptoms and debilitating conditions. The underlying causes, however, are deceptively simple.</p>
<p>Long held birthing practices in hospitals have been abandoned in lieu of more “progressive” policies, and though seemingly innocuous, the results have been <span>disastrous</span>.</p>
<p>The human error involved in the onset of autism is very simple. Doctors have stopped spanking babies’ bottoms at birth, accused of abuse or trauma-inducing practices. Circumcision has also been on a widespread decline. Venupuncture at birth or shortly soon after is unheard as well for the same reasons. <span>All</span>&nbsp;of these have contributed to the massive spike in autism, for <span>ONE</span>&nbsp;very important underlying reason:</p>
<p>Without the PAIN stimulus, the baby is stuck in a biologically immature, semi-wake state leftover from the womb. The PAIN stimulus at birth is what compels the 1) baby’s CRY, which innervates the auditory pathway, the postnatal neuronal maturation process and begins&nbsp;the process of spatially encoding the environment (this tonotopy becomes the basis for the ocular system as well as finger joint/grasping abilities). It is also responsible for 2) the jump start of the reflexive processes to synapse at the brainstem for quick reaction speed, as well as internal endogenous processes such as the gastrocolic reflex (this is why autistic children are chronically constipated, fussy eaters). And, 3) the initiation of the <span>Ascending Reticular Activating System</span>, the body’s <span>wake up</span>&nbsp;call, which the auditory system is tasked with initially triggering after leaving the womb.</p>
<p>These three main underlying “missing factors” define the causal mechanisms of the autism epidemic.</p>
<p><span>1. Postnatal Auditory Development</span><br>
The most important thing to understand is that the auditory pathway is the <span>first</span>&nbsp;step of sensory organization and <span>begins</span>&nbsp;the brain’s understanding of its external environment. Every <span>other</span>&nbsp;sensory encoding system begins with the auditory system. Why? Because sound is the <span>only</span>&nbsp;sense we can actually initially physically “interfere” with and <span>interpret</span> the results. Meaning we can put out a stimulus <span>ourselves</span>, that interacts with and <span>interferes</span>&nbsp;with existent noise and environmental conditions. Our brains then decipher and interpret&nbsp;the results to spatially encode the environment so as to be able to interact with it.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.acousticintegrity.com/acousticintegrity/Hugo_Zuccarelli.html">Hugo Zuccarelli</a>&nbsp;first established this in 1980 with his discovery of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holophonics">holophonics</a>&nbsp;as well as his proposal that the human ear and auditory system work as an <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometry">interferometer</a></span>. The ramifications of his discovery, however, were lost on the medical community.</p>
<p>In animals like bats this auditory feedback system is very large, as they have adapted to acquiring food from their environments strictly by use of sound, e.g. sonar. In primates this system is smaller, because we only use the auditory pathway primarily until we fine-tune our finger motor skills, <i>and</i>&nbsp;our visuospatial system kicks in.&nbsp;Once&nbsp;human vision orients itself <span>based</span>&nbsp;on the auditory encoding of the environment, the biological Law of Precedence takes effect and strict emphasis on the auditory system is abandoned.</p>
<p>This is why babies <span>coo</span>. They are pinging their environments and learning to orient and fine-tune their ability to recognize and interact with physical stimuli, and focus their eyes.&nbsp;Their finger grasping and understanding of the positioning of their own joints, fingers, and body positioning becomes more honed and fine-tuned as they coo and grasp.</p>
<p>Autistic babies have also been observed to fail the “tilting test”, e.g. they fall over without catching themselves like normal babies.&nbsp;This is because the vestibular system is innervated at the same time as the auditory pathway as they both make up the vestibulocochlear nerve. Without this primal innervation, the saccule and utricle never become sensitive to linear acceleration and head-tilting.</p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;</span><span>Nociception/”PAIN”</span><br>
The mechanoreceptors associated with physical insult to the human body initiate internal reflexive “smooth muscle” processes such as peristalsis, sphincter relaxation, and proper pulmonary function. The <span>lack</span>&nbsp;of this stimulus results in many of the known conditions and symptoms of autism.</p>
<p>Glutamate and Substance P/NK<span>1</span>&nbsp;binding work together to trigger proper intestinal smooth muscle contraction and control. This results in peristalsis, sphincter relaxation, even vomiting.&nbsp;This is why without the required “stimulus” autistic babies are chronically constipated, and extremely fickle eaters.</p>
<p>Acetylcholine and nitric oxide production work together to coordinate proper pulmonary function for clearing airways of pathogens. This is why&nbsp;doctors and medical personnel have begun to take notice of the differences in sound that autistic babies make versus normal babies. ASD babies are known to make cries that are higher pitched and with smaller intervals between, because they are not drawing breath properly. Mothers have also reported being confused by the sounds their babies make, not knowing or being able to interpret what’s wrong so they can properly care for them.</p>
<p>These normal bodily processes are all initially triggered by “noxious stimuli”, e.g. PAIN.</p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;</span><span>Ascending Reticular Activating System</span><br>
“Residual muscle tension” which keeps us still during sleep, needs to be cut as fast as possible, otherwise it’s like living in a slow waking state and we simply cannot survive on our own. Bottom line, the human body and mind need to be able to react&nbsp;<em>reflexively</em> to the external environment.</p>
<p>Our body’s waking system, the <span>ascending reticular activating system</span>, is stimulated directly by sound and touch. “Neurons of the reticular formation, particularly those of the ascending reticular activating system, play a crucial role in maintaining behavioral&nbsp;<a title="Arousal" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arousal">arousal</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Consciousness" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness">consciousness</a>.”&nbsp;In 1949 Dr. Magoun recorded potentials within the medial portion of the brain stem and discovered that auditory stimuli directly fired portions of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticular_formation">reticular activating system</a>.</p>
<p><span>Robotics</span><br>
This has profound&nbsp;implications for robotics, as without this baseline understanding of sensory integration, scientists have been stuck attempting to create robots that walk/move with zero predictable precision. Without the auditory integration and understanding of their environment, robots are stuck “learning” their environment over and over again every time they take a step as visual processing systems are a <span>secondary</span>&nbsp;source of information-gathering. They cannot be fine-tuned and honed without an auditory platform upon which to be based off of.</p>
<p>Smart cars will now be able to be programmed to be much more “aware” of their surroundings, and be able to navigate much&nbsp;more accurately.</p>
<p><span>Conclusion</span><br>
All of this is easily explained by the simple logic that it makes no biological sense&nbsp;for a baby to start any of these processes until it’s outside the womb. It’s not supposed to be moving around grasping for things, gastrointestinal processes are not needed until the baby is ready to start processing food itself, and of course a baby in the womb cannot safely use its own airways.</p>
<p>To make sense of this it would serve to go back and examine <span>very closely</span>&nbsp;how an entire generation of medical professionals was <i>shamed</i> into giving up practices long-held as routine and necessary since before recorded human history.</p>
<p>But there’s more to the scenario, another disturbingly false pocket of data being propagated worldwide with ruinous results,&nbsp;a false sense of communal sharing of information among young families that preaches the “evils” of vaccinations. We’ve just seen firsthand the dangers of this, epidemics in western states, reports of single individuals unknowing of their condition, passing on antiquated diseases to dozens of people.&nbsp; But there’s a heinous concurrence at work here, because&nbsp;the <span>hidden</span>&nbsp;horror is to realize that all it can take is a <i>single</i> vaccination to <span>CURE the autism condition</span>. Venupuncture provides the same level of stimulus as a spank at birth, and can serve to finally fully integrate a child’s senses correctly. The process isn’t immediate, and it <i>may</i>&nbsp;take a bit of reinforcement, but it’s there.</p>
<p>There’s a special kind of destructive irony to the fact vaccinations are being presented as the <i>cause</i>&nbsp;of autism. Which of course serves to make parents of autistic children even less likely to vaccinate.</p>
<p>This is also&nbsp;why&nbsp;there are reports of medical professionals and school teachers wondering why some children were ever diagnosed in the first place, it’s because&nbsp;that child ended up experiencing some type of injury and subsequently completed the auditory/reflexive circuit on their own. Everyone <span>else</span>&nbsp;is imbuing their child with a <i>powerful</i> learning disability. In fact I would not hesitate to say that the autistic condition is a hellish reality, to be trapped in a perceptual prison, a primitive, <a href="https://drhyman.com/blog/2010/05/12/functionalapproach/">psychedelic drug trip</a> with no escape. They can’t make sense of what they see or hear, they know only confusion, fear, and oblong shapes that fill their visual field with threatening gestures, emitting loud echoing noises that blanket their landscape with unknowable, imperceptible monsters.</p>
<p>Because of the curvature of our eyes, we are born with an inverted view. Light and visual info coming into the eye gets refracted upside down onto the retina, over time the brain learns to correctly orient the image. It’s clear autistic children have major problems with their vision and ocular systems. Some may presumably never learn to invert the image their retinas project, or only partially, many presumably experience a warped view of reality.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder autistic children experience chronic levels of stress, inflammation and anxiety; their lives are living nightmares. <br></p><p> <a href="https://www.manwhore.org/drills-based-training-with-mw/">

<p>The last year has been particularly annoying for nocoiners—those of us who don’t hold crypto and view bitcoin as a Ponzi, like a Ponzi, or <a href="http://www.tr0lly.com/bitcoin/bitcoin-is-not-a-literal-ponzi-scheme/">something more complex</a>.</p>



<p>We have had to endure Tether minting tethers with abandon ($17 billion worth in 2020 alone) and bitcoiners obnoxiously cheering bitcoin’s new all-time highs, the latest being <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-hits-30k-for-1st-time-ever">$33,000</a>. Considering bitcoin began 2020 at around $7,500, that is a long way up. (<a href="https://amycastor.com/2020/11/21/are-pixie-fairies-behind-bitcoins-latest-bubble/">Things went full crazy in March</a>.) But we believe 2021 will be a year of comedy gold when this giant hill of dung all comes tumbling down.  </p>



<p>I’ve spoken with several notable bitcoin skeptics, gathered their thoughts, and compiled a list of new year predictions. They shared their prophecies on Tether (a stablecoin issuer that has so far minted $21 billion in dubiously backed assets to pump the crypto markets), new regulations and the future of bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here is what they had to say:</p>



<h2><strong>Nicholas Weaver: T’will be the year the music stops</strong></h2>



<p>“This is the year the music stops,” Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, told me.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="5212" data-permalink="https://amycastor.com/nicholas-weaver-2/" data-orig-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg" data-orig-size="400,400" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="nicholas-weaver-2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg?w=400" src="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg?w=400" alt="" width="257" height="257" srcset="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg?w=257 257w, https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg?w=150 150w, https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg?w=300 300w, https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 257px) 100vw, 257px"></a></figure></div>



<p>Weaver has been following bitcoin since 2011. His work is largely funded by the National Science Foundation. He believes the bitcoin ecosystem is running low on cash. (This is the fate of all Ponzi schemes. Ultimately, they run out of new investors and when that happens, the scheme collapses.) In the case of bitcoin, he believes real dollars in the system are rapidly being replaced by fake ones in the form of tethers.</p>



<p>“Tether has been squeezing every dollar out of the system, and there aren’t enough suckers,” he said, meaning there aren’t enough folks waiting in line to buy bitcoin at its ever increasing prices. “When the dollar stock goes to zero, the system will collapse completely because you get a mining death spiral.”</p>



<p>Miners reap 900 newly minted bitcoin per day in the form of block rewards. If they can’t sell those for enough fiat money to pay their monstrous power bills, it makes no sense for them to stay in business. And since their job is to secure the bitcoin network, bitcoin will become vulnerable to repeated attacks.</p>



<p>Also, governments are finally waking up, said Weaver, alluding to new global efforts to clamp down on money laundering, capital outflows, and the financing of terrorism via cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He foresees Tether getting the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/29/nyregion/liberty-reserve-operators-accused-of-money-laundering.html">Liberty Reserve treatment</a> any day now. He also thinks China will decide “screw it, bitcoin is evading capital controls as a primary purpose, let’s cut off the subsidized electricity.” </p>



<p>Without cheap electricity, bitcoin miners—most of whom are in China—may find it difficult to stay afloat.&nbsp;Already bitcoin miners in Inner Mongolia <a href="https://decrypt.co/39718/bitcoin-miners-in-china-lose-access-to-cheap-electricity">no longer receive electricity at subsidized rates</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Jorge Stolfi: I can’t make price predictions</strong></h2>



<p>A computer science professor in Brazil, Jorge Stolfi wants to avoid making predictions on bitcoin’s price. He’s been following bitcoin since 2013—and has seen it through two prior bubbles—so he knows too well that anything can happen. </p>



<div><figure><a href="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/stolfi.jpeg"><img data-attachment-id="5227" data-permalink="https://amycastor.com/stolfi/" data-orig-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/stolfi.jpeg" data-orig-size="300,168" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="stolfi" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/stolfi.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/stolfi.jpeg?w=300" src="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/stolfi.jpeg?w=300" alt="" srcset="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/stolfi.jpeg 300w, https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/stolfi.jpeg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></figure></div>



<p>“I really don’t know how far the insanity can go. The crypto market is 100% irrational, sustained entirely by ignorance and misinformation,” he said. “How can anyone make predictions about that?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stolfi is a denizen of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/">r/Buttcoin</a>, a subreddit that makes fun of bitcoin, where he painstakingly explains the finer points of crypto nonsense to the unenlightened. In 2016, he submitted a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-cboebzx-2018-040/srcboebzx2018040-4064523-169183.pdf">letter</a> to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission warning against the risks of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund and comparing bitcoin to a Ponzi scheme. (The SEC has shot down every bitcoin ETF proposal to date on the basis that bitcoin’s price is too easy to manipulate.)</p>



<p>“And since price determines everything else in the crypto space, I can’t make predictions on pretty much everything else,” Stolfi continued. “For example, If the price were to crash below $10,000, I bet that we would have a lot of comedy gold coming from MicroStrategy.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the last several months, the enterprise software company, has funneled $1.2 billion of its funds into bitcoin. As a result, Michael Saylor, the company’s CEO, now spends most of his time on Twitter shilling bitcoin.&nbsp;In September, Saylor <a href="https://twitter.com/michael_saylor/status/1307029562321231873">compared</a> bitcoin to “a swarm of cyber hornets serving the goddess of wisdom, feeding on the fire of truth, exponentially growing ever smarter, faster, and stronger behind a wall of encrypted energy.”</p>



<p>Stolfi also thinks that we will probably forget about several coins that were big in the past, like Bitcoin SV (BSV) and IOTA, maybe even bitcoin cash (BCH). “And we will also forget about blockchain technology.”</p>



<h2><strong>Frances Coppola: Crypto exchanges will become like licensed banks&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Over the last week, Frances Coppola has been battling an army of bitcoin trolls and sock puppets on Twitter after suggesting that <a href="https://twitter.com/Frances_Coppola/status/1345395222243586050">bitcoin is not scarce</a> in any meaningful sense.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Scarcity is a key part of the myth bitcoiners perpetuate to make people think bitcoin is valuable in the same way gold is and to create a sense of buying urgency—quick, grab some before it’s all gone!—so naturally, bitcoiners responded by dog piling on her. She isn’t happy about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I hope bitcoin crashes and burns because I am so bloody furious, but I think it will be a while yet before it does—maybe about June,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coppola is a UK-based freelance writer, who spent 17 years in the banking industry. She wrote the book, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Case-Peoples-Quantitative-Easing/dp/1509531300">The Case For People’s Quantitative Easing</a>,” and has 58,000 Twitter followers.</p>



<p>The cause of bitcoin’s upcoming crash, she believes, will be an epic battle between the Wild West of crypto and regulators, a topic she covered in a recent <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-financial-system-fight-it">Coindesk article.</a></p>



<p>If the regulators win, crypto exchanges will become like licensed banks and have to comply with things like the Dodd-Frank Act, a sweeping law that reined in mortgage practices and derivatives trading after the 2008 financial crash, she said. On the other hand, if the regulators lose, she believes their next move will be to protect retail investors.</p>



<p>“We’d see drastic restrictions on what interactions banks can have with crypto, perhaps a total ban on retail-deposit-takers having crypto exchanges and stablecoins as clients,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We might also see something akin to a Glass-Steagall Act for crypto exchanges and stablecoins, so that retail deposits are fully segregated by law from trading activity.” By that, she means exchanges won’t be able to lend retail deposits to margin traders or use them to fund speculative positions in crypto derivatives.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>David Gerard: Bitcoiners will get their big boy wish</strong></h2>

<p>After years of begging for bitcoin to be taken seriously as a form of money, bitcoiners will be getting exactly what they asked for, said David Gerard, a bitcoin skeptic and author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Libra-Shrugged-Facebook-Tried-Money-ebook/dp/B08KK9SZP6">“Libra Shrugged,”</a> a book on Facebook’s attempt to take over the money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This year will see more regulation of crypto, as coiners discover to their dismay just how incredibly regulated real-world finance is, he said. “Just wait until someone sits them down and explains regulatory real-time compliance feeds.”</p>



<p>What does Gerard think about Tether? “I could predict the guillotine will finally fall on Tether, but I predicted that for December 2017, and these guys are just amazing in their ability to dodge the blade just one more day,” he said.</p>



<p>Since 2018, the New York Attorney General has been investigating Tether and its sister company, crypto exchange Bitfinex, for fraud. Over the summer, the New York Supreme Court ruled that the companies need to hand over their financial records to show once and for all just how much money really is underlying the tethers they keep printing. The NYAG <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=2AsYgvjJAsSdalpfkInbHA==">said</a> Bitfinex/Tether have agreed to do so by Jan. 15.</p>



<p>Gerard also foresees that there will continue to be no use cases for crypto that absolutely anything else does better. “Everything the <a href="http://buttcoinfoundation.org/">Buttcoin Foundation</a> was talking about in 2011 is still dumb and broken,” he said.</p>

<p>Elon Musk says he is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/01/elon-musk-highly-confident-spacex-will-land-humans-on-mars-by-2026.html">“highly confident”</a> that his company SpaceX will be sending humans to Mars in six years. Naturally, Musk wants to set up a self-sustaining city on the red planet. And, come to think of it, the city will need its own crypto, something like Dogecoin or <a href="https://www.marscoin.org/">Marscoin</a>. Otherwise, how else will its citizens pay for things?</p>



<p>Pseudonymous crypto blogger Trolly McTrollface has this prophecy for 2021: “Elon Musk creates its own cryptocurrency, and adds it to the<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&amp;src=cashtag_click"> $TSLA</a> balance sheet. It ends the year in the top 10 crypto list by market cap.”</p>

<p>Nouriel Roubini, an economics professor at New York University, doesn’t mince words when it comes to crypto predictions. He simply told me: “The Bitcoin bubble will burst in 2021. Triggers will be reg/law enforcement action.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is good reason to take him seriously. Roubini famously warned of the 2008 financial crisis, a prophecy that earned him the moniker “Dr. Doom.”&nbsp;He is also <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2013/09/dr-doom-s-bubble-burst-nouriel-roubini-s-hot-tub-gets-heave-ho">known for his parties</a>, which leads a few of us nocoiners to believe that bitcoiners’ are fundamentally driven by bitterness over the fact that we have better soirées.</p>

            <p><strong><em>Update 4th Jan 2021: If you don't need Python 3.9, installing azure-cli natively can be done&nbsp;by using this homebrew formula:&nbsp;<a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/azure-cli">https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/azure-cli</a>. Note: there's an open issue with upgrading:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/16417">https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/16417</a>.</em></strong></p>

<p>Anyone else having trouble installing Azure CLI natively on Apple Silicon? You may remember some <a href="https://www.thectgrid.com/blog/apple-silicon-right-tool-remote-work-economy/">rough edges being mentioned in our previous post</a>.&nbsp;If like me you're a big user of Azure's cloud services and you've got your hands on a new M1 MacBook Pro or MacBook Air, then you might have noticed that installing some software isn't as straight forward as it used to be. In this post I'll take you through the steps I took to install Azure CLI natively on your Apple Silicon Mac.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-macos">Official install docs</a></p>

<p><em>Note: this post is likely to become old pretty quickly given the pace at which things are being fixed for M1.</em></p>

<h2>Install HomeBrew</h2>

<p>As of the last few days, homebrew now supports Apple Silicon Mac natively which means no more <a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Installation#alternative-installs">manual steps</a> on the M1, just go to the <a href="https://brew.sh/">homebrew homepage</a> and install as normal. It should install into <code>/opt/homebrew/</code>, you can test it by running <code>$ brew</code> in the terminal.</p>

<h2>Install wget</h2>

<p>This step is the simplest in this whole process, savour it:</p>

<pre><span>brew install&nbsp;wget</span></pre>

<h2>Install Python 3</h2>

<p>Install Python 3 with this command:</p>

<pre><span>brew install python3</span></pre>

<p>It will download and build targetting Apple Silicon ARM. We now need to check you can access python3 via the Terminal and that the right version is being loaded (MacOS comes with older versions of both Python2 and Python3):</p>

<pre><span>type&nbsp;-a&nbsp;python3
python3 is /usr/bin/python3</span></pre>

<p>If a path going via your homebrew folder isn't at the top of the list, e.g. <code>python3 is /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.9/bin/python3.9</code> , you can simply create an alias for it in your <code>~/.zshrc</code> file.</p>

<p>Open <code>~/.zshrc</code> with either nano or vim:</p>

<pre><span>nano ~/.zshrc</span></pre>

<p>and add these lines:</p>

<pre><span>alias&nbsp;python3='/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.9/bin/python3.9'
alias&nbsp;pip3='/opt/homebrew/bin/pip3'</span></pre>

<p>Save (<code>Control + O</code>) and exit (<code>Control + X</code>), and run this for the changes to take effect:</p>

<pre><span>source&nbsp;~/.zshrc</span></pre>

<p>Now check that your homebrew version of python3 is at the top of your <code>type -a</code> list:</p>

<pre><span>type&nbsp;-a&nbsp;python3
python3 is an alias&nbsp;for&nbsp;/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.9/bin/python3.9
python3 is /usr/bin/python3</span></pre>

<p>You can run the same test for <code>pip3</code>. If the homebrew version is at the top of the <code>type -a pip3</code> list then you're good to go!</p>

<h2>Wall of Compilation Errors: pip3 install azure-cli</h2>

<p>Normally it would be enough to run:</p>

<pre><span>pip3 install azure-cli</span></pre>

<p>and this would've been the end of the post had it not been for the wall of compilation errors I received as pip attempted to compile the dependencies for azure-cli. The following packages needed manual intervention:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>cffi</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>cryptography</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>bcrypt</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>PyNaCl</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>After spending some hours troubleshooting these errors I was close to throwing in the towel, calling it a day on native brew/python and moving over to rosetta2. And then a breakthrough...</p>

<h3>Build cffi</h3>

<p>Building and installing the <code>cryptography</code> package requires <code>cffi</code> to be installed, and OpenSSL lib include files to be in your PATH. Both of these need manual attention:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>cffi doesn't build via pip</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>OpenSSL isn't in the path</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>To build and install cffi follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Install libffi</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<pre><span>brew install pkg-config libffi</span></pre>

<ol start="2">
	<li>
	<p>Take note of the path to this libffi.pc file:</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<pre><span>find&nbsp;/opt/homebrew/ |&nbsp;grep&nbsp;"Cellar.*libffi.pc"
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/libffi/3.3/lib/pkgconfig/libffi.pc</span></pre>

<ol start="3">
	<li>
	<p>Grab the sources from <a href="https://pypi.org/project/cffi/">https://pypi.org/project/cffi/</a>:</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<pre><span>wget&nbsp;https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/66/6a/98e023b3d11537a5521902ac6b50db470c826c682be6a8c661549cb7717a/cffi-1.14.4.tar.gz
​
tar&nbsp;-xzvf&nbsp;cffi-1.14.4.tar.gz
cd&nbsp;cffi-1.14.4</span></pre>

<ol start="4">
	<li>
	<p>Edit setup.py and add the path for libffi.pc that you noted down in step 2 to <code>include_dirs</code>:</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><span><code>setup.py</code></span></p>

<pre><span>import&nbsp;sys,&nbsp;os
import&nbsp;subprocess
import&nbsp;errno
​
# on Windows we give up and always import setuptools early to fix things for us
if&nbsp;sys.platform&nbsp;==&nbsp;"win32":
&nbsp; &nbsp;import&nbsp;setuptools
​
​
sources&nbsp;= ['c/_cffi_backend.c']
libraries&nbsp;= ['ffi']
include_dirs&nbsp;= ['/usr/include/ffi',
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'/usr/include/libffi',
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'/opt/homebrew//Cellar/libffi/3.3/lib/pkgconfig/']
​
...</span></pre>

<ol start="5">
	<li>
	<p>Build</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<pre><span>python3 setup.py install</span></pre>

<p>cffi is done! Now to the next dependency ...</p>

<h3>Build cryptography</h3>

<p>azure-cli requires an older version (&lt;3.0.0) of cryptography, which in turn needs the OpenSSL library. First grab OpenSSL via brew:</p>

<pre><span>brew install&nbsp;openssl</span></pre>

<p>Grab the lib path:</p>

<pre><span>find&nbsp;/opt/homebrew |&nbsp;grep&nbsp;"Cellar.*openssl.*/lib$"
​
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/openssl@1.1/1.1.1i/lib</span></pre>

<p>Now install version 2.9.2 and reference the OpenSSL lib and include folders from above:</p>

<pre><span>pip3 install&nbsp;cryptography==2.9.2&nbsp;--global-option=build_ext&nbsp;--global-option="-L/opt/homebrew/Cellar/openssl@1.1/1.1.1i/lib"&nbsp;--global-option="-I/opt/homebrew/Cellar/openssl@1.1/1.1.1i/include"</span></pre>

<p>Only two more dependencies to go.</p>

<h3>Build bcrypt and PyNaCl</h3>

<p>Both bcrypt and PyNaCl have the same steps:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Download sources</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Manual install</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>bcrypt</h4>

<p>Go to <a href="https://pypi.org/project/bcrypt/">https://pypi.org/project/bcrypt/</a> and download sources, unpack, and run setup.py:</p>

<pre><span>wget&nbsp;https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/d8/ba/21c475ead997ee21502d30f76fd93ad8d5858d19a3fad7cd153de698c4dd/bcrypt-3.2.0.tar.gz
​
tar&nbsp;-xzvf&nbsp;bcrypt-3.2.0.tar.gz
cd&nbsp;bcrypt-3.2.0
python3 setup.py install</span></pre>

<h4>PyNaCl</h4>

<p>Go to <a href="https://pypi.org/project/PyNaCl/">https://pypi.org/project/PyNaCl/</a>, get sources and do the same:</p>

<pre><span>wget&nbsp;https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/cf/5a/25aeb636baeceab15c8e57e66b8aa930c011ec1c035f284170cacb05025e/PyNaCl-1.4.0.tar.gz
​
tar&nbsp;-xzvf&nbsp;PyNaCl-1.4.0.tar.gz
cd&nbsp;PyNaCl-1.4.0
python3 setup.py install</span></pre>

<h3>Install azure-cli</h3>

<p>Finally, you should have everything you need to install azure-cli via pip. Go ahead and try it:</p>

<pre><span>pip3 install azure-cli</span></pre>

  <time datetime="2021-01-03T13:30:00+00:00">03 Jan 2021</time>
  <p>Swift in a sense is very much like C++, and when I say C++ I mean C++11 and beyond. One could also say that Swift is <em>cleaner</em> C++, or C++ without the backwards compatibility baggage from the 80s. To give an idea here’s a minimal <em>modern</em> C++ code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;iostream&gt;       // 1
</span><span>using</span> <span>namespace</span> <span>std</span><span>;</span>      <span>// 2</span>
<span>auto</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>      <span>// 3</span>
  <span>cout</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"Hello world!"</span><span>;</span> <span>// 4</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>               <span>// 5</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now lets break them down from Swift perspective.</p>


<p>Swift equivalent would be <code>import iostream</code>. Frameworks usually come with an umbrella header as a single file, so typically we need to add only one include statement per framework like in Swift. But unlike Swift, we need to add include statements for every file we want to use from our own code.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;framework&gt;      // external framework
#include "path/to/file.h" // local file
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span>using</span> <span>namespace</span> <span>std</span><span>;</span> <span>// 2</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unlike Swift, C++ has a proper support for namespaces. So if two types in different frameworks have same type name they can be resolved using their namespaces. For example <code>fwkA::JSON</code> and <code>fwkB::JSON</code>. To get a more Swift like behavior we can add <code>using</code> to indicate that the symbols do not need their namespace for every single usage.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>auto</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span> <span>// 3</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is the modern way of writing functions in C++. In classic fashion this function could also be written as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>cout</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"Hello world!"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span>cout</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"Hello world!"</span><span>;</span> <span>// 4</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Like Swift we can also override operators in C++. In this case the <code>iostream</code> library provides <code>cout</code> which is an object of type <code>ostream</code> that outputs to <em>standard output stream</em>. <code>iostream</code> also provides overrides for <code>operator &lt;&lt;</code> for many common types like for <code>string</code> that we’re using above. But it can also work for our custom types if we provide the <code>operator &lt;&lt;</code> for our type. The Swift equivalent to this would be the <code>CustomStringConvertible</code> protocol.</p>



<p>And finally since our function requires a return type <code>int</code> we have to end our function with a <code>return</code> statement.</p>

<p>With a basic introduction, now let us take a look at C++ in a bit more detail from Swift perspective.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#variables">Variables</a></li>
  <li><a href="#string">String</a></li>
  <li><a href="#array">Array</a></li>
  <li><a href="#dictionary">Dictionary</a></li>
  <li><a href="#optional">Optional</a></li>
  <li><a href="#function">Function</a></li>
  <li><a href="#closures">Closures</a></li>
  <li><a href="#classes">Classes</a></li>
  <li><a href="#error-handling">Error handling</a></li>
  <li><a href="#generics">Generics</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
var myVariable = 42
myVariable = 50 
let myConstant = 42
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
auto myVariable = 42;
myVariable = 50;
const auto myConstant = 42;
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>Just like in Swift types can be deduced by the compiler using <code>auto</code>, but if required we can always also provide the type information explicitly.</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
let myFloat: Float = 3.14
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
float myFloat = 3.14;
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>Unlike Swift, type conversions can also occur implicitly in C++. This needs to be carefully watched out for to avoid hard to find bugs. For other cases we need to explicitly convert data from a type to another. For example <code>int</code> to <code>string</code></p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
let label = "The width is "
let width = 94
let widthLabel = label + String(width)
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
auto label = "The width is ";
auto width = 94;
auto widthLabel = label + to_string(width);
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="string">String</h2>

<p>String interpolation in C++ isn’t as good as with Swift. But nonetheless we can construct <code>string</code> with either explicit string conversion, like we saw above</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
let apples = 3
let oranges = 5
let appleSummary = "I have \(apples) apples."
let fruitSummary = "I have \(apples + oranges) pieces of fruit."
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
auto apples = 3;
auto oranges = 5;
auto appleSummary = "I have " + to_string(apples) + " apples.";
auto fruitSummary = "I have " + to_string(apples + oranges) + " pieces of fruit.";
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>Or using <code>ostringstream</code> which works just like <code>cout</code> and makes use of <code>operator &lt;&lt;</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>auto</span> <span>apples</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>
<span>ostringstream</span> <span>ss</span><span>;</span>
<span>ss</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"I have "</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>apples</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>" apples."</span><span>;</span>
<span>auto</span> <span>str</span> <span>=</span> <span>ss</span><span>.</span><span>str</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which can then further be reduced to:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>auto</span> <span>str</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>ostringstream</span><span>()</span><span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>"I have "</span><span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>apples</span><span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>" apples."</span><span>).</span><span>str</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
let apples = 3
let oranges = 5
let appleSummary = "I have \(apples) apples."
let fruitSummary = "I have \(apples + oranges) pieces of fruit."
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
auto apples = 3;
auto oranges = 5;
auto appleSummary = (ostringstream()&lt;&lt; "I have "&lt;&lt;apples&lt;&lt;" apples.").str();
auto fruitSummary = (ostringstream()&lt;&lt;"I have "&lt;&lt;(apples + oranges)&lt;&lt;" pieces of fruit.").str();
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="array">Array</h2>

<p>Swift <code>Array</code> equivalent in C++ is <code>vector</code>. Here’s how you use it</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
var shoppingList = ["catfish", "water", "tulips"]
shoppingList[1] = "bottle of water"
shoppingList.append("blue paint")
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
auto shoppingList = vector&lt;string&gt;{"catfish", "water", "tulips"};
shoppingList[1] = "bottle of water";
shoppingList.push_back("blue paint");
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>And this is how you iterate a <code>vector</code></p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
for item in shoppingList {
  print(item)
}
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
for (auto &amp; item : shoppingList) {
  cout &lt;&lt; item &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>The <code>&amp;</code> here means that we wish to use <code>item</code> as a reference. If we were to use <code>auto item</code> it would always create a new copy.</p>

<h2 id="dictionary">Dictionary</h2>

<p>Swift <code>Dictionary</code> equivalent in C++ is <code>map</code>. Here’s how you use it</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
var occupations = [
  "Malcolm": "Captain",
  "Kaylee": "Mechanic",
]
occupations["Jayne"] = "Public Relations"
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
auto occupations = map&lt;string, string&gt; {
  {"Malcolm", "Captain"},
  {"Kaylee", "Mechanic"},
};
occupations["Jayne"] = "Public Relations";
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>And this is how you iterate over a <code>map</code></p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
for (key, value) in occupations {
  print("\(key) : \(value)")
}
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
for (auto&amp; [key, value]: occupations) {
  cout &lt;&lt; key &lt;&lt; " : " &lt;&lt; value &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="optional">Optional</h2>

<p>Swift developers love <code>Optional</code> types. Fortunately for us, C++ also got <code>optional</code> types starting c++17. Although not as fancy as with Swift, but the core idea is the same: A type that either has the value or not. Here’s an example:</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
func greeting(_ required: Bool) -&gt; String? {
  return required ? Optional("Hello") : nil;
}

func main() -&gt; Int {
  let s = greeting(false) ?? "Hi"
  print(s) // Hi

  if let str = greeting(true) {
    print(str) // Hello
  }

  return 0
}
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
auto greeting(bool required) -&gt; optional&lt;string&gt; {
  return required ? optional{"Hello"} : nullopt;
}

auto main() -&gt; int {
  auto s = greeting(false).value_or("Hi");
  cout &lt;&lt; s &lt;&lt; endl; // Hi

  if (auto str = greeting(true)) {
    cout &lt;&lt; *str &lt;&lt; endl; // Hello
  }

  return 0;
}
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>The <code>*str</code> can be thought of as force unwrapping in Swift, <code>str!</code>. And after <em>dereferencing</em> we can either use the <code>.</code> or the handy <code>-&gt;</code> operator to access the variable.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>str</span><span>).</span><span>size</span><span>();</span>
<span>str</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>size</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>C++ functions do not have argument labels</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
func greet(_ person: String, on day: String) -&gt; String {
    return "Hello \(person), today is \(day)."
}

greet("John", on: "Wednesday")
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
auto greetPersonOnDay(string person, string day) -&gt; string {
  return (ostringstream()&lt;&lt;"Hello "&lt;&lt;person&lt;&lt;", today is "&lt;&lt;day&lt;&lt;".").str();
}

greetPersonOnDay("John", "Wednesday")l
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>But if you really miss having named arguments there are many tricks of all shapes and sizes out there. The simplest is to use a <code>struct</code> for arguments</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Args</span> <span>{</span> <span>string</span> <span>person</span><span>,</span> <span>day</span><span>;</span> <span>};</span>
<span>auto</span> <span>greet</span><span>(</span><span>Args</span> <span>args</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>string</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>ostringstream</span><span>()</span><span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>"Hello "</span><span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>args</span><span>.</span><span>person</span><span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>", today is "</span><span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>args</span><span>.</span><span>day</span><span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>"."</span><span>).</span><span>str</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>greet</span><span>({.</span><span>person</span> <span>=</span> <span>"John"</span><span>,</span> <span>.</span><span>day</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Wednesday"</span><span>})</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="closures">Closures</h2>

<p>C++ has a good support for closures. Here’s an example:</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
func hasAnyMatches(list: [Int], condition: (Int) -&gt; Bool) -&gt; Bool {
  for item in list {
    if condition(item) {
      return true
    }
  }
  return false
}

func lessThanTen(number: Int) -&gt; Bool {
  return number &lt; 10
}

var numbers = [20, 19, 7, 12]
hasAnyMatches(list: numbers, condition: lessThanTen)
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
auto hasAnyMatches(vector&lt;int&gt; list, function&lt;bool(int)&gt; condition) -&gt; bool {
  for (auto item : list) {
    if (condition(item)) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}

auto lessThanTen(int number) -&gt; bool {
  return number &lt; 10;
}

auto numbers = vector&lt;int&gt; {20, 19, 7, 12};
hasAnyMatches(numbers, lessThanTen);
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>That said, C++ still doesn’t has all the fancy functional operations like <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code>, <code>...</code> that we get with Swift, but they’re coming soon with <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/ranges">C++20 ranges</a>. For now we can use <code>transform</code> as an equivalent to Swift <code>map</code></p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
numbers.map({ (number: Int) -&gt; Int in
  let result = 3 * number
  return result
})
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
transform(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), numbers.begin(), [](auto number) -&gt; auto {
  auto result = 3 * number;
  return result;
});
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>The C++ code here would actually mutate the <code>numbers</code>. If we want the truly Swift <code>map</code> equivalent we would have to create an empty <code>vector</code> and append data to it</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>auto</span> <span>mappedNumbers</span> <span>=</span> <span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{};</span>
<span>transform</span><span>(</span><span>numbers</span><span>.</span><span>begin</span><span>(),</span> <span>numbers</span><span>.</span><span>end</span><span>(),</span> <span>back_inserter</span><span>(</span><span>mappedNumbers</span><span>),</span> <span>[](</span><span>auto</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> 
  <span>return</span> <span>3</span> <span>*</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span> 
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="classes">Classes</h2>

<p>Unlike Swift in C++ there isn’t much difference between a <code>struct</code> and a <code>class</code> with the only difference being that a C++ struct has all members <code>public</code> by default whereas a <code>class</code> has all members as <code>private</code> by default. Whether the instance is mutable or not depends on how it is declared.</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
class Shape {

  func simpleDescription() -&gt; String {
    return "A shape with \(numberOfSides) sides."
  }

  var numberOfSides = 0
}

var shape = Shape()
shape.numberOfSides = 7
var shapeDescription = shape.simpleDescription()
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
class Shape {
public:
  auto simpleDescription() -&gt; string {
    return (ostringstream()&lt;&lt;"A shape with "&lt;&lt;numberOfSides&lt;&lt;" sides.").str();
  }

  int numberOfSides = 0;
};

auto shape = Shape();
shape.numberOfSides = 7;
auto shapeDescription = shape.simpleDescription();
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>Initializer (or constructor as they are called in C++) have a slightly different syntax</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
class Shape {

  init(name: String) {
    self.name = name
  }

  func simpleDescription() -&gt; String {
    return "A shape with \(numberOfSides) sides."
  }

  var numberOfSides = 0
  var name: String
}
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
class Shape {
public:
  Shape(string name)
    : name(name) {
  }

  auto simpleDescription() -&gt; string {
    return (ostringstream()&lt;&lt;"A shape with "&lt;&lt;numberOfSides&lt;&lt;" sides.").str();
  }

  int numberOfSides = 0;
  string name;
};
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>In C++ subclasses need to be more explicit than Swift.</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
class Square: Shape {

  init(sideLength: Double, name: String) {
    self.sideLength = sideLength
   …</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></article></main></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>After the JPEG standard was released in 1992, JPEG images became synonymous with digital photography and are used in almost every application which works with photo quality images. The reason the adoption of the standard was fast and nearly universal is that it makes use of multiple techniques simultaneously to reduce the compressed file size. One of those is an understanding of the limits of the human visual system and which information is important to preserve versus which is less important and can be removed.</p><h2 id="the-jpeg-coding-algorithm">The JPEG coding algorithm</h2><p>There are several steps needed to compress an image using the JPEG method (see image below). To begin, it is usually converted from RGB into the YCbCR colorspace. The reason this is necessary is to allow sub-sampling of the pixels. The human eye is more sensitive to changes in luminance than changes in chrominance. This allows the chroma channels to be downsampled while keeping the luma channel at full resolution. The image can lose 50% of its data with this step and the perceived degradation is quite minimal. The image is then divided into 8x8 MCUs or minimum coded units (the equivalent terminology for video codecs is Macro Blocks). These MCUs are square blocks of pixels which are compressed based on the similarity to each other. The pixels in each MCU are transformed from the spatial domain to the frequency domain with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Discrete Cosine Transform</a> (DCT). The operation allows for the easy removal of high frequency information (fine detail) to further compress the image. The more high frequency coefficients are removed, the smaller the file and the blurrier the image becomes. This effectively controls the “Q Value” or compression amount used by encoders.</p><figure><img srcset="https://optidash.ai/assets/images/blog/accelerating-jpeg-coding-with-multiple-threads/jpeg-coding.png, https://optidash.ai/assets/images/blog/accelerating-jpeg-coding-with-multiple-threads/jpeg-coding@2x.png 2x" alt="JPEG coding steps"><figcaption>JPEG coding steps</figcaption></figure><p>One of the many clever ideas incorporated into the standard is to use the similarity in DC value (essentially the brightness) between adjacent MCUs to further reduce the data size by compressing just the change from one to the next instead of encoding the entire value. This is depicted above in the “DPCM coding” block. This is a great idea, but it creates a small problem. By having each successive MCU’s DC value(s) depend on a delta from the previous, it means that if there is an error in the data, the MCUs from that point on down will all be wrong.</p><p>Making matters slightly worse is that the compressed symbols which encode the image data (shown above as “Huffman coding”) are Variable Length Codes (VLC). A single wrong bit can corrupt the data from that point forward. Back in the ‘old’ days when JPEG was invented, this was a very real concern because images were often transmitted over channels (e.g. acoustic modem) that may not have had robust error correction or stored on media (e.g. floppy disks) that were prone to errors. Knowing that the data may suffer from errors, a feature was added to the standard to mitigate the amount of the image that would be corrupted by bad data. The idea was to periodically reset the previous DC value to 0, forcing the next MCU to encode its entire value as a delta from 0. This means that any corrupted DC values will only affect pixels up to the next restart point.</p><p>This is implemented with Restart Markers. They are 2-byte markers placed in between the MCUs at regular intervals (e.g. every 100 MCUs). If a data corruption occurs, it’s easy to scan forward in the file to the next restart marker (JPEG markers are always on byte boundaries and preceded by 0xFF). Once the next restart marker is found, the image can be properly decoded from that point on since the number of MCUs between each restart marker is known.</p><h2 id="the-ever-evolving-use-of-digital-images">The ever evolving use of digital images</h2><p>Starting not long after the JPEG standard was released, computer networks and storage were getting more reliable and incorporated error detection and correction (e.g. TCP/IP). The solid state storage cards used in digital cameras were quite reliable and the restart markers were ‘forgotten’ for a while since they made the files slightly larger without giving much perceived benefit. During that period, computer software was mostly designed to run on a single processor using a single thread. The fact that a JPEG image needed to be decoded in a single pass due to its use of variable length codes and a string of successive delta values for the MCU didn’t cause any problems for software since it was designed to run as a single thread anyway.</p><p>In the last few years however, computers and our use of JPEG images have changed dramatically. Nearly every computing device has multiple CPUs and runs an operating system with multiple threads (even phones). The other change is that people are taking, editing and viewing billions of JPEG photos on their mobile phones. Each generation of phones produce larger and higher resolution images. For anyone working with tons of photos, the time to encode and decode them has become increasingly important because of the sheer volume and size of new images being generated.</p><figure><img srcset="https://optidash.ai/assets/images/blog/accelerating-jpeg-coding-with-multiple-threads/images-chart.png, https://optidash.ai/assets/images/blog/accelerating-jpeg-coding-with-multiple-threads/images-chart@2x.png 2x" alt="The sum of transfer size kilobytes of all external images requested by the page."><figcaption>The average transfer size of images requested by the web page. Data source: <a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-images#bytesImg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTTP Archive</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="repurposing-a-good-idea-into-an-even-better-idea">Repurposing a good idea into an even better idea</h2><p>Computers have been getting more powerful on a mostly continuous trajectory since the 1970s. A general term used to describe the continuous improvements in silicon processing called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Moore’s Law</a> was coined many years ago to commemorate Gordon Moore’s prediction that computers will double the number of transistors every 18 months. This has held mostly true for the transistor count, but the maximum speed of computers has basically hit a dead end due to the physical limitations of silicon and power+heat issues. Since individual processor speed hasn’t advanced much in the last few years, the emphasis has shifted to employing many processors to complete tasks faster by working in parallel. In today’s computing environment, it’s advantageous to be able to divide a task into sections and assign them to multiple CPUs. Not all tasks are possible to divide because each successive part may depend on the results from the previous. JPEG encoding and decoding are normally difficult to divide into pieces and run in parallel because of the way each successive MCU depends on the previous one and the use of variable length codes.</p><p>However… A convenient benefit of restart markers is that the VLC data is reset to a byte boundary (after the marker) and the MCU DC delta value is also reset. This means that both JPEG encoding and decoding could be divided into multiple threads with the use of restart markers. For encoding, the image could be divided into symmetrical strips and each strip could be encoded by a different processor. When each processor completes that task, the output of each can then be ‘glued’ together using restart markers. For decoding, the task can be spread across as many processors as there are restart markers. The only extra effort needed is to scan forward in the compressed data looking for the restart markers first since the size of the compressed data between each varies and there is no ‘directory’ in JPEG files showing where the restart markers are located.</p><h2 id="real-world-example">Real World Example</h2><p>With multi-threaded applications, the performance rarely scales 1:1 with the number of CPUs utilized (e.g. splitting a task into 12 threads on 12 CPU cores doesn’t mean it will run 12x faster). There is extra overhead in managing the threads and the memory is usually a single entity shared among the processors. Let’s run a test on the following image:</p><figure><img srcset="https://optidash.ai/assets/images/blog/accelerating-jpeg-coding-with-multiple-threads/jpeg-timings-image.jpg" alt="JPEG timings example image"><figcaption>Image credit: <a href="https://unsplash.com/@matthewhenry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew Henry</a> on Unsplash</figcaption></figure><p>Among other techniques, at Optidash we incorporate this idea of using restart markers to greatly accelerate both the decoding and encoding of images. The image above was run through one of our testing tools on a 2018 MacBook Pro 15” laptop with a 6-core Intel i7 processor. Here are the results:</p><div><table><thead><tr><td>Number of CPUs</td><td>Image decode time</td><td>Image encode time</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>53ms</td><td>264ms</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>25ms</td><td>104ms</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>18ms</td><td>61ms</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>As you can see in the table above, there is a measurable advantage to splitting JPEG coding into multiple parts and assigning them to different CPUs. Depending on the task, the speed rarely scales linearly when using more CPUs. In this case, the intense use of large areas of memory limits how much benefit multiple CPUs can improve the overall speed.</p><p>Here’s some pseudocode which demonstrates how a multi-threaded JPEG encoder might look:</p><pre><code>void ThreadedWriteJPEG(assorted JPEG parameters, int numThreads) {
    int slice;
    pthread_t tinfo;

    // set completion counter
    sliceRemaining = numThreads;

    // Start a thread for each slice
    for (slice = 0; slice &lt; numThreads; slice++) {
        pthread_t tinfo;

        // Use a ‘slice’ structure to hold info about each thread’s work
        // This includes a pointer to the start of that strip of pixels
        // and the number of lines to compress

        &lt;setup slice structure for each thread’s work&gt;

        pthread_create(&amp;tinfo, NULL, JPEGBuffer, &amp;slices[slice]);
    } // for each slice

    // wait for all worker threads to finish
    WaitForThreads(&amp;sliceRemaining);

    // merge slices into a single file and write it
    WriteJPEGBuffer(slices, numThreads);
}
</code></pre></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content">
            <p>A small business based out of South Dakota was able to turn an initial investment of $2,500 into over $500,000 a month in sales, all by leveraging the power of TikTok Influencers.</p>

<p>Craig Mount and Erika Peterson started their peanut butter company, Nerdy Nuts, out of their home in the summer of 2019. The idea stemmed from a feeling of uncertainty, when Petersonâ€™s go-to peanut butter plug shut down, thatâ€™s when Craig Mount purchased an Olde Tyme PN1 nut grinder for $870 on Ebay. The grinder was eventually forgotten about, until Peterson put it to use in the summer of 2019, and just like that, <a href="https://nerdynuts.com/">Nerdy Nuts</a> was born.</p>

<h2>Starting Small</h2>

<p>The couple started small, with two flavors, honey roasted and white chocolate. They would begin selling their new peanut butter at local farmers markets, and their booth would consistently bring in around $1,000 every Sunday, not bad for what they considered a â€œlow-stressâ€� side hustle.</p>

<p>Although their decision to start small was solely based off the fact that the couple was busy raising and child and working their day jobs, this turned out to be a massive factor that ultimately contributed to their success. Selling at the farmers market meant that they had a lot of face-to-face interactions with their customers, this allowed for them to hand out samples and gather real-time feedback on their product, â€œIt became an excellent testing ground â€“ and a perfect way for us to iterateâ€� said Mount. This real time feedback allowed for Nerdy Nuts to iterate at a rapid pace, something that wouldâ€™ve been more difficult if they decided to cast a wider net at the start.</p>

<h2>Branding &amp; Early Success</h2>

<p>After doing some market research, Mount decided that Nerdy Nuts should be branded as a flavorful and fun brand, considering that a majority of direct-to-consumer (D2C) peanut butter brands were more focused on advertising themselves as â€œhealthyâ€� or â€œketo-friendlyâ€�. </p>

<p>By deciding to go the â€œfunâ€� approach with their branding, Nerdy Nuts opened up the door to many more possibilities when it came to growth tactics and marketing, one example of this would be their US election candidate inspired flavors. In June of 2019, Nerdy Nuts decided to launch a specialty line of flavors based on the favorite foods of each US election candidate.</p>

<p><img src="https://d5ik1gor6xydq.cloudfront.net/blog/29/nerd_nuts_peanut_butter.jpg" alt="Nerdy Nuts used TikTok influencers to boost sales."></p><p>This tactic ultimately landed Nerdy Nuts their first taste of virality, when their story was picked up by Fox Business. Within 48 hours of their national talk show appearance, the company made $20,000 in sales. This early virality showed the small business that there was demand beyond the farmers markets that they were used to, so they transitioned their focus to becoming a D2C brand and ditched the farmers market/retail approach. This decision would not only give them a larger reach, but also be more cost-effective than running a storefront.</p>

<h2>TikTok Virality</h2>

<p>Months after their first taste of going viral, Nerdy Nuts was once again a viral sensation, but this time on TikTok. This was nothing compared to the virality they experienced with Fox News, it was even better, â€œthese influencers made the Fox News sales look like a jokeâ€� said Mount.</p>

<p>The growing company was experimenting with different marketing approaches when they decided to try out influencers on TikTok. Mount reached out to Ali Grace Morsell and Hailey Peters, both of which had around 500,000 followers on the platform at the time. He offered both influencers free product, â€œthey were just so flabbergasted that anyone would want to send them something for free.â€� <a href="https://thehustle.co/how-a-tiny-peanut-butter-company-grew-to-500k-per-month-in-sales/">said Mount</a>. Aside from offering them the product for free, Mount also promised the influencers a 10% cut of all sales.</p>

<p>I think itâ€™s safe to say that things went better than expected. The influencers posted about the product and racked up over a million views, which <a href="https://thehustle.co/how-a-tiny-peanut-butter-company-grew-to-500k-per-month-in-sales/">ultimately resulted in 5,947 sales</a>. The hashtag #nerdynuts currently has just under 2 million views alone, definitely a contributing factor to the $165.2k in sales during the month of July, not too shabby for a small peanut butter company out of South Dakota.</p>

<p><img src="https://d5ik1gor6xydq.cloudfront.net/blog/29/hashtag.jpg" alt="The Nerdy Nuts TikTok hashtag has over 2 million views."></p><p>Sales continued to increase until August of 2020, when the company topped over $500,000 in sales â€“ a 20x increase from just a few months prior.</p>

<h2>Breaking Down the Strategy</h2>

<p>Mount is well aware that not everyone can just recruit some influencers and expect to go viral on TikTok, heâ€™s seen other influencer collabs flop, so what made the Nerdy Nuts collab pop? Whether or not Mount is aware of it, there are some key decisions he made that allowed for the Nerdy Nuts collab to become a success.</p>

<h3>1. Choosing the Right Influencers</h3>

<p>The most obvious, yet crucial, aspect of running an influencer campaign is definitely <a href="https://collabstr.com/blog/Crucial-Steps-to-Identifying-The-Best-Instagram-Influencers-in-Your-Industry">choosing the right influencers</a> for the job. If you take a look at <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@happyhealthyhailey?source=h5_m">Hailey</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@aligracemorsell?source=h5_m">Aliâ€™s</a> TikTok pages, it wonâ€™t take much to realize that these are both middle-aged woman that have children and have food-focused pages, both ideal candidates for a brand like Nerdy Nuts.</p>

<p>By being very picky with the influencers you choose to represent your brand, not only are you getting in front of an audience that is actually interested in hearing about your product, but youâ€™re working with an influencer that would be highly likely to enjoy your product as well. Ali and Hailey both have a young family, so theyâ€™re most likely already cooking all the time, experimenting with new foods and packing their childrenâ€™s lunches. By choosing influencers that are highly relevant to your niche, you are ensuring you get someone that is just as passionate about your brand.</p>

<h3>2. Having a Good Product</h3>

<p>This one is not as obvious as the previous point, but it is still an important piece of the puzzle. We mentioned in our influencer marketing <a href="https://collabstr.com/blog/how-hismile-teeth-built-a-multi-million-dollar-brand-using-influencers">case study on HiSmile Teeth</a>, that the founders ensured they had a product that people actually wanted before sending it out to influencers. The bottom line is, if you have a product that nobody wants, then influencers are not going to want to promote it because at the end of the day they are consumers too.</p>

<p>By starting small and only selling at farmers markets, without knowing it, Nerdy Nuts was perfecting their product as much as possible to get it ready for the mass market. It was apparent that customers were loving the product, so by sending it out to influencers, the company was giving them a product that they most-likely would have enjoyed or even bought without the company asking.</p>

<p>While this point may not be directly correlated to the success of an influencer marketing campaign on TikTok, it most definitely plays an important role. Weâ€™ve seen cases of this before, <a href="https://collabstr.com/blog/The-Greatest-Example-of-Influencer-Marketing-On-Instagram-Fashion-Nova">such as with Fashion Nova</a>, where having a product that consumers genuinely loved ended up resulting in a viral feedback loop.</p>

<h3>3. Leave the Creativity to the Creators</h3>

<p>If you take a look at the content posted by Hailey and Ali as part of their original Nerdy Nuts campaign, you will notice that the content came off as very authentic and genuine, this is because the creativity was left to the creators.</p>

<p>When working with influencers on any platform, it is important to be aware of type of content they post and ensure that your vision aligns with theirs. The last thing you want to do is force an influencer to post a piece of content about your brand that comes off as disingenuous or scripted. Content coming from an influencer is not a TV or radio ad, so it shouldnâ€™t come off as one.</p>

<p>In order to the maximize your ROI, it is important to understand your boundaries when working with influencers.</p>

<p><b>Your responsibilities:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Sourcing and vetting the influencers.</li>
    <li>Getting the product to the influencer.</li>
    <li>Making influencer aware of campaign goals.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Influencer responsibilities:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Formulating the creative strategy and creating the content.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>If youâ€™re reading this thinking to yourself â€œdamn, I should try using TikTok influencersâ€� youâ€™re in luck, because just as Nerdy Nuts discovered for themselves, TikTok influencers are highly underrated and undervalued at the time of writing this article. Influencers are also a topic we discuss in our <a href="https://collabstr.com/blog/The-Ultimate-Guide-to-TikTok-for-Brands-in-2020">ultimate guide to TikTok for brands in 2020</a>, we think they're an essential part to anybodies marketing strategy.</p>

<p>While 500,000 followers on TikTok may not be as valuable as 500,000 followers on Instagram, reaching nearly 2 million people organically just by gifting your product to an influencer is unheard of on any other platform aside form TikTok. </p>

<p>Nerdy Nuts is a prime example of how small direct-to-consumer businesses can leverage the power of influencer marketing. If youâ€™re looking to source some influencers for your campaign, and youâ€™re not sure where to start, check out <a href="https://collabstr.com/">Collabstr.</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>Obsidian is described as “A second brain, for you, forever”. It is a desktop app (available for Windows, Mac and Linux) that acts as a knowledge base working on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files.</p>



<p>The app is developed by the hugely talented Licat (Shida Li) and Silver (Erika Xu) who also brought us the delightful&nbsp;<a href="https://dynalist.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dynalist</a>&nbsp;(an outliner note-taking tool similar to <a href="https://www.thefortunelabs.com/knowledge/logseq-the-note-taking-app/">Logseq</a>).</p>



<p>The app is offered as a free download, although sponsoring the devs is possible by upgrading your license through a one-time payment (USD 25+). By upgrading the license, we gain insider builds (early releases) and access to the exclusive dev channel on Discord.</p>



<h2>Why Obsidian?</h2>



<p>Your notes are saved locally on your machine in plain text markdown format, allowing you to easily transfer your notes to other apps or open them with Notepad, in essence, there is no vendor lock-in. You are in complete control of your notes and files and can use Google Drive, GitHub, Dropbox etc. to sync your notes between different machines.</p>



<p>Having control over my notes gives me peace of mind. I am free to do what I want with them, and even though with the Obsidian app I can use various functions (backlinks, graph view, etc.) I know that should the app disappear, the content is mine and will forever be mine.</p>



<p>The ease of using the app could not be more straightforward. Once downloaded and installed, you are greeted with a welcome screen similar to the one below:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="650" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-Welcome.png?resize=800%2C650&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-Welcome.png?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-Welcome.png?resize=300%2C244&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-Welcome.png?resize=768%2C624&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-Welcome.png?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-Welcome.png?resize=300%2C244&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-Welcome.png?resize=768%2C624&amp;ssl=1 768w" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-Welcome.png?resize=800%2C650&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>From here you can either create a new vault (notes repository) or open an existing vault. You can also open the “help vault” which includes several help files such as a formatting guide, and appearance customisation guides amongst other how-tos.</p>



<p>Once you have created / opened a vault, you can start taking notes at your heart’s content. You are free to choose to structure your notes the way you wish. You can have folders similar to traditional note-taking tools or go structure free and store all your notes in one main directory.</p>



<p>The beauty of creating links between your notes (with a simple [[“name”]] link) means that you should always be able to find what you are looking for and generate ideas (see <a href="https://www.thefortunelabs.com/personal-knowledge-management/">Personal Knowledge Management</a>) from your notes.</p>



<p>The app works in markdown format with the possibility of rendering the preview side by side, as shown below. You can also have more than one note open simultaneously by opening additional panes that can be infinitely split and resized. This is great if you want to cross-reference notes or create a work product from multiple notes.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="543" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-edit-and-preview.png?resize=1024%2C543&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-edit-and-preview.png?resize=1024%2C543&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-edit-and-preview.png?resize=300%2C159&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-edit-and-preview.png?resize=768%2C408&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-edit-and-preview.png?resize=1536%2C815&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-edit-and-preview.png?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-edit-and-preview.png?resize=1024%2C543&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-edit-and-preview.png?resize=300%2C159&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-edit-and-preview.png?resize=768%2C408&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-edit-and-preview.png?resize=1536%2C815&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-edit-and-preview.png?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-edit-and-preview.png?resize=1024%2C543&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>The markdown format may feel a little overwhelming at first, but things get easier after taking a few notes. The other benefit of having notes in markdown or rendered view is that it is easy to copy and paste the text into an online blogging platform or a Word document. For instance, I created this post in Obsidian and copied and pasted the text to WordPress and voila.</p>



<p>Having said the above, the lack of a What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) type interface is a little annoying in my point of view. Sometimes the markdown format is confusing to read, or if you are in preview mode, you need to go back to edit mode to tweak the text. The good news is that this is on the <a href="https://trello.com/b/Psqfqp7I/obsidian-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap</a>. Fingers crossed this comes soon.</p>



<p>In addition to the devs being hugely talented and ever-present to answer questions and chat on the Discord, the speed of development is phenomenal. Nearly every other week, we are presented with an update that includes new features and bug fixes.</p>



<h2>Features</h2>



<p>There are a significant amount of features available in Obsidian, so I thought to include below what I consider to be the main ones:</p>



<ul><li>Offline – <em>can access whether connected or not. Notes are stored offline and are yours</em></li><li>Backlinking – <em>easily see which pages link to the page</em></li><li>Random Note – <em>opens a random note which is useful for discovering old content</em></li><li>Daily Note – <em>create today’s note at the click of a button</em></li><li>Starred Notes – c<em>an star “favourite” notes for easy access</em></li><li>To-do list – <em>easily create to-do lists</em></li><li>Outline – <em>see the structure of your note and easily navigate to other sections by clicking</em></li><li>Search – <em>easily find what you are looking for</em></li><li>Graph View –&nbsp;v<em>isualise a page or your notes collection in a graph with many different filter / view options</em></li></ul>



<p>I have included below a brief video I did of the main features available in Obsidian.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Obsidian Introduction - A alternative Roam Research app for Notes / PKM / To Do / Journal" width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SJYHMCbqZbc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In addition to the above main features, there are a couple of additional features which warrant a separate mention. These are:</p>



<h2>Publish</h2>



<p>A useful feature of Obsidian is Obsidian Publish where you can take your notes and convert them into an online digital garden / blog. The simplicity of doing this through “no code” means that there is no prior technical knowledge required. You only need to sign up (USD 8 per month per site (early-bird price)), choose a name, select which notes to publish and there you have it – your own personal online space.</p>



<p>The outcome can look something like this <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/help/Index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">example</a>. Developments are in the pipeline to allow for custom domains and other tweaks to make it more personal and improve the experience.</p>



<h2>Plugins</h2>



<p>With the ability to install and use third-party plugins and such a large community of users, many plugins are available to choose from to customise the app to suit your needs. The plugins are easily installed in the app (simply click install on the plugins browser page within Obsidian) and allow you to do things like:</p>



<h3>Mind Map</h3>



<p>View your note as a mind map. For example, activating the mind map view on this article results in the following diagram:</p>







<p>I find this plugin great as although you can see the note’s outline using the Obsidian outline feature, this allows you to visualise it differently.</p>



<h3>Calendar</h3>



<p>Enables a Calendar View to visualise and navigate between daily notes and easily create a daily note for a past, or future date.</p>







<h2>Areas of Improvement / Wish List</h2>



<p>There are a few areas of improvement which I feel would elevate the app even further. These improvements include:</p>



<ul><li>A What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) type editor interface,</li><li>Mobile app to view / take notes on mobile,</li><li>Ability to see more information on notes in bulk (like date created, last modified, word count).</li></ul>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>With a few tweaks and the addition of a WYSIWYG interface, this app has the potential to become a top note taking app. Notes are stored locally, so are yours and forever yours. The features available in the app allow you to take notes, visualise your notes and generate ideas easily.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This tutorial is meant to help find clues as to who is calling you when you’re receiving calls from an unknown phone number (a number that is displayed on your phone’s screen, but you don’t recognize).</p><p>It’s quite short and simple, and I hope it helps, as it’s written with the intention of tracking whoever may be bothering or harassing you.</p><p>First I’d like to clear up the following meanings:</p><ul><li><strong>unknown phone number</strong> – a phone number that is displayed on my phone’s screen but I don’t have the caller’s information</li><li><strong>private phone number</strong> – a number that’s not displayed on my screen when someone is calling because the caller is withholding their number.</li></ul><p>I wanted to quickly clear this up because I suspect some interpret the term of <strong>unknown phone number</strong> as <strong>private phone number/call</strong>, and I don’t want to take up someone’s time with information that’s not useful to them.</p><h2 id="method-1-finding-the-facebook-account-associated-with-the-unknown-number">Method 1 – Finding the Facebook account associated with the unknown number</h2><p>With this method we’ll try to have Facebook show us the account associated with the phone number by trying to login with it and then clicking <code data-enlighter-language="raw">Forgot Password?</code>, which will lead us to the next page where Facebook shows us the associated account.</p><p>Please also keep in mind that I am not an expert in this area. Although I don’t think that investigating an unknown phone number in this manner is an offence in any way, I do think you should proceed at your own risk.</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind is that even though this method probably has a good chance of working, the number may not be associated with a Facebook account.</p><p>Also, since it will look like you’re trying to log in, Facebook will probably notify the user in some form. In my case I just got notified that I can enable one click login, for security reasons.</p><p><img width="593" height="532" src="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7.png.webp" data-src="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7.png.webp" data-srcset="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7.png.webp 593w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7-300x269.png.webp 300w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7-380x341.png.webp 380w" data-sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px" alt="word image 7" title="Look Up Unknown Phone Numbers using Facebook Reset Password or WhatsApp 12" srcset="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7.png.webp 593w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7-300x269.png.webp 300w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7-380x341.png.webp 380w"></p><p>I’m not certain of other cases, however.

Add the unknown number to your contact list</h3><p>I assume it doesn’t have a high success rate, but it’s pretty low effort and I think it’s worth a shot.</p><p>Just add the phone number to your contacts under whatever name you’d like, and then look up that contact in WhatsApp to check out if they have a profile pic.</p><p>That profile pic may be either a selfie or something that can help you identify if you know that person.</p><h3 id="2-reverse-image-search-the-profile-picture-video">2. Reverse Image Search the Profile Picture [Video]</h3><p>If you think the image is not very generic, and it’s likely they used it on other websites, such as social media, you can also perform a reverse image search using <a href="https://images.google.com/" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">https://images.google.com<span></span></a> and see if something comes up.</p><p>I know this is probably nothing new, but an additional thing you can do is limit the image search to a specific site.</p><p>For example if you search someone’s profile picture and get a good deal of results with all sorts of websites, and additional similar images that aren’t an exact match, you can limit the search to just one social media site, such as Twitter.</p><p>To do this you use the <code data-enlighter-language="raw">site:example.com</code> operator.</p><p>For example if we want to limit our reverse image search to Twitter, we’d search for the image first, and then replace the existing text in the Google search bar with <code data-enlighter-language="raw">site:twitter.com</code></p><h4 id="quick-demo-video-2">Quick Demo Video</h4><p>The steps are:</p><ol><li>Go to <a href="https://images.google.com/" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">https://images.google.com<span></span></a></li><li>Drag the image onto the search bar, or click the little camera icon and insert the URL to the image, or select <strong>Upload an image</strong> and then <strong>Choose File</strong> and then browse for the picture on your computer.</li><li>Next, Google will show us what matches were found.I’ll use this website’s social media profile pic as an example.<p>As you can see, Google sees our profile pic as being similar to many other images, and provides a list of many other websites associated with those images.</p><p><img width="665" height="683" src="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-12.png.webp" data-src="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-12.png.webp" data-srcset="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-12.png.webp 665w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-12-292x300.png.webp 292w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-12-380x390.png.webp 380w" data-sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px" alt="word image 12" title="Look Up Unknown Phone Numbers using Facebook Reset Password or WhatsApp 19" srcset="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-12.png.webp 665w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-12-292x300.png.webp 292w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-12-380x390.png.webp 380w"></p></li><li>Since we’re interested in mainly social media websites to have a good chance of identifying someone, we’ll filter the results by limiting the search only to Twitter, in this example.<p>You can, of course, try other social media websites popular in your region.</p><p>So in the search bar we’ll just remove the text, in this case <strong>digital alberta</strong>, and replace it with <code data-enlighter-language="raw">site:twitter.com</code>.</p><p>After the search is complete, we can see that even though it’s not the first result, we’ve still found the Twitter profile associated with the image.</p><p><img width="732" height="1270" src="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13.png.webp" data-src="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13.png.webp" data-srcset="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13.png.webp 732w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13-173x300.png.webp 173w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13-590x1024.png.webp 590w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13-380x659.png.webp 380w" data-sizes="(max-width: 732px) 100vw, 732px" alt="word image 13" title="Look Up Unknown Phone Numbers using Facebook Reset Password or WhatsApp 20" srcset="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13.png.webp 732w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13-173x300.png.webp 173w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13-590x1024.png.webp 590w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13-380x659.png.webp 380w"></p></li></ol><p>I hope these methods come in useful or give you some peace of mind in some cases when you’re having issues with numbers you don’t recognize.</p><h2 id="other-methods">Other Methods</h2><p>Here I’ll just list other methods that could work.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    
    <p>Every time I go back to Rust, I have to figure out how the module system works again. Here are some of my notes comparing it to Python’s module system.</p>

<p>These notes are for Rust 2018.</p>

<ul id="markdown-toc">
  <li><a href="#crates" id="markdown-toc-crates">Crates</a></li>
  <li><a href="#packages" id="markdown-toc-packages">Packages</a></li>
  <li><a href="#file-layout" id="markdown-toc-file-layout">File layout</a>    <ul>
      <li><a href="#crate-roots" id="markdown-toc-crate-roots">Crate roots</a></li>
      <li><a href="#module-lookups" id="markdown-toc-module-lookups">Module lookups</a></li>
      <li><a href="#nested-modules" id="markdown-toc-nested-modules">Nested modules</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="crates">Crates</h3>

<p>A <strong>crate</strong> is a build target in Rust. A crate can either be a library or a binary. It can be built with <code>cargo build</code>.</p>

<p>In Python, libraries are called “packages”. Binaries are an entirely heterogenous concept, typically installed by configuring <a href="https://packaging.python.org/specifications/entry-points/">entry points</a>. Such a binary doesn’t even need to be Python code (for example, it can be a shell script instead).</p>

<h3 id="packages">Packages</h3>

<p>A <strong>package</strong> in Rust consists of up to one library crate and any number of binary crates. (It’s required that there be at least one library or binary crate.)</p>

<p>In Python, a single “distribution package” (i.e. one that you can <code>pip install</code>) can contain multiple “import packages” (i.e. one that you can <code>import</code>), while Rust allows at most one import package per distribution package.</p>

<h3 id="file-layout">File layout</h3>

<h4 id="crate-roots">Crate roots</h4>

<p>Python places <code>__init__.py</code> at the root of a package to indicate that it’s importable as a package. Similarly, Rust conventionally puts <code>lib.rs</code> at the root of a crate as the library <strong>crate root</strong>. (Unlike Python, the name can be re-configured, but <code>lib.rs</code> is the default.)</p>

<p>In Python, <code>__main__.py</code> corresponds to the main entry point for the module when run with <code>python -m</code>. Rust conventionally puts <code>main.rs</code> as a binary crate root. (This can also be renamed, which is probably desirable if you have more than one binary.)</p>

<h4 id="module-lookups">Module lookups</h4>

<p>In Python, all modules are available by importing them via their filesystem path name. For example, <code>import foo.bar</code> first looks for a <code>foo/</code> directory on the <code>PYTHONPATH</code>. Then it looks for a <code>bar/</code> package or a <code>bar.py</code> module underneath the <code>foo/</code> directory.</p>

<p>In Rust, modules also correspond to their paths on the filesystem (by default; <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/modules.html#the-path-attribute">you can use the <code>path</code> attribute</a> to change this behavior). However, they are not immediately <code>use</code>-able just because the corresponding file is present! They must be declared with a <code>mod foo;</code> declaration in the crate root file (e.g. <code>lib.rs</code>).</p>

<h4 id="nested-modules">Nested modules</h4>

<p>In Python, a nested module <code>foo.bar</code> is implemented either by <code>foo/bar.py</code> or <code>foo/bar/__init__.py</code>. You can’t use both. If you want to have sub-modules of <code>foo.bar</code>, you’ll place additional modules or packages under <code>foo/bar/</code>.</p>

<p>A statement like <code>from foo.bar import qux</code> could either be importing a symbol declared in <code>foo/bar/__init__.py</code> or the module <code>foo/bar/qux.py</code>. Some developers choose to explicitly re-export the public interface of <code>bar</code> in <code>__init__.py</code> for clarity, and prefix sub-modules with underscores (e.g. <code>_qux.py</code> instead of <code>qux.py</code>).</p>

<p>In Rust, you use <code>foo/bar.rs</code> to declare members of the namespace <code>foo::bar</code>. If you also want to have sub-namespaces of bar (e.g. <code>foo::bar::qux</code>), then you additionally create the <code>bar/</code> directory alongside <code>bar.rs</code>. To access a sub-namespace <code>qux</code> inside <code>bar.rs</code>, the line <code>mod qux;</code> must be added to <code>bar.rs</code>. (This is similar to how we have to add <code>mod foo;</code> at the top-level <code>lib.rs</code>.)</p>

<p>To re-export the namespace and make it available to all users outside of <code>bar</code>, it should be changed to <code>pub mod qux;</code>.</p>

<p>The main take-away is that Rust requires the explicit re-exporting of nested modules using <code>mod</code> at each step of the hierarchy, while Python does not.</p>

            <p>
    Posted on January  3, 2021
    
</p>


<ul>
<li>I spent the year as a software engineer writing Haskell, and switched to remote work during the pandemic with everyone else.<br>
</li>
<li>Wrote a lot of code, and focused on Haskell as a language for software engineering.<br>
</li>
<li>Completed 3 courses from Georgia Tech on bayesian statistics, computer networking, and embedded compilers, as part of a masters program I’ll finish in 2021.<br>
</li>
<li>Wrote more Haskell code this year than probably all other years combined, and made it through 2020 feeling pretty good about things. I’ll mark that in the win column!</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m writing this post as a collection of my thoughts on the last year, and a reflection on the major things I’ve learned.<br>
The majority of my Haskell experience is in the form of writing code for web servers that talk to databases serve up APIs, although I am very interested in compilers and language research!</p>
<h2 id="outline">Outline</h2>
<ul>
<li>On The Practice Of Software Engineering</li>
<li>Haskell Observations</li>
<li>Musings On Type Level Programming</li>
<li>Build Systems</li>
<li>The Year In Readings</li>
<li>Summary</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="on-the-practice-of-software-engineering">On The Practice of Software Engineering</h2>
<p>Software engineering is about understanding the trade offs (performance, latency, domain modelling, et cetera), and implementing a solution that solves a problem with a solution space of development time, cost, and quality. Not every project you engage in will focus on code quality, but working at a company where some projects can focus on quality is a tremendous joy and enriching experience, and am very thankful to my teammates who made this possible!</p>
<p>One of the best exercises I had this year was going through my PRs and consolidating all the comments by theme, which taught me as much about my own code as what other people think about code in general.</p>
<p>An important perspective when writing code, is understanding how that software will exist through time, what demands will be placed on it, and how the fundamental assumptions will inevitably change. A big lesson for me this year is learning that a system can start out well, but through product mis-alignment, tight time constraints, and feature expansion, it can become an irreplaceable web of sadness littered through your code base too costly to remove!</p>
<p>On a psychological note, through trial and error I realized I only have so many “high performance” hours in a week where you can be sustainably productive without lowering the quality of the hours you work. Some corporations have even found workers are even more productive with 3 day weeks versus 5! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191105011855/http://nypost.com/2019/11/04/microsoft-japans-3-day-weekends-boost-productivity-by-40/">source</a> I’m not saying we should go that far, but when you’re home all the time coding in a pandemic, balance is key to staying fresh and effective!</p>
<h2 id="haskell-observations">Haskell Observations</h2>
<p>Contributing to ghc is HARD!<br>
It’s a complex and old code base, and although there is plenty of documentation, it takes a ton of work to be able to understand ghc well enough to contribute at the level needed to fix bugs and implement new features. That said, there is a ton of documentation work that still needs to be done, and is pretty beginner friendly work!</p>
<p>Use Template Haskell to generate code only as a last resort! The available alternatives, including deriving instances, have grown rich with options over the past few years, and these alternatives are less likely to eat up your compiler time or make cross-compilation an herculean task! Quasiquoters are a notable exception to this, as are inserting filenames/git commits at compile time, the key is to use it sparingly!</p>
<p><a href="https://haskell.pl-a.net/">Haskell Planetarium</a> as a link aggregation has enough content to be readable everyday, and along with <a href="https://haskellweekly.news/">Haskell Weekly</a> are my <code>goto</code> sources of Haskell related content.</p>
<p>Next, and pretty obviously, <strong>you can use Haskell to deliver value in business</strong>. This is already established, but watching different teams write similar web services at their direction showed me that there is a lot of variety within the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Based on my experience, answers the following questions will vary from project to project, and asking them will get you oriented in a new project pretty quickly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which prelude is being used?<br>
</li>
<li>How are effects handled?<br>
</li>
<li>How are API routes defined?<br>
</li>
<li>How do you interact with the database and manage a transaction session?<br>
</li>
<li>How do you write an sql query?<br>
</li>
<li>What’s the nature of the “expression problem” for internal data types?<br>
</li>
<li>What is the strategy for manipulating internal objects, i.e.&nbsp;lens/generic lens?<br>
</li>
<li>How are log messages generated?<br>
</li>
<li>What’s the testing strategy, is a fuzziness generator used?<br>
</li>
<li>How do you run the tests locally, given the architecture?</li>
</ul>
<p>By the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_problem">Expression Problem</a> I mean which typeclasses are needed to be derived or defined, like <code>ToJSON</code> or serialization. I’d like to add that the overwhelming majority of effects I’ve seen have been handled using <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl">mtl</a> and/or <code>IO</code>, but we appear to be close on extensible effects, and the work done on <a href="https://github.com/hasura/eff">eff</a> looks promising!</p>
<h2 id="musings-on-type-level-programming">Musings On Type Level Programming</h2>
<p>A theme for this year for me was exploring the intersection between type level programming and good software engineering practices. It’s one thing to know Haskell, it’s another to write beautiful code that’s as easy to understand as it is to maintain. As a prior, my stance on new, complex Haskell features is to “write junior code”. However, given a sufficiently experienced team familiar with type level programming, the trade-offs of the features themselves can be evaluated per se…</p>
<h3 id="haskell-type-level-solutions-worth-their-weight">Haskell Type Level Solutions Worth Their Weight</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/squeal-postgresql">squeal</a>, takes a while to learn, but with generated schemas helping write some code, a deep embedding tied to the schema is very maintainable. A key aspect of getting this solution to work is to have a repeatable way to generate the same schema that’s used in production. Ours is (<a href="https://github.com/mwotton/squealgen">squealgen</a>), which works great!<br>
</li>
<li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generic-lens">generic-lens</a>. For a long time, I avoided lenses, but with <code>DuplicateRecordFields</code> and <code>OverloadedLabels</code> <code>generic-lens</code> provides some great utilities beyond lens/prism for manipulating structures that I’ve come to rely on.<br>
</li>
<li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant">servant</a> great for defining routes for clients/servers, and even the streaming stuff can work!<br>
</li>
<li><a href="https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/deriving_via.html">DerivingVia</a>, very useful way to extend newtypes and generic deriving, and gives you a way to write a lot of maintainable code in a few short lines.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="haskell-type-level-programming-ideas-ive-unsuccessfully-tried-to-apply-but-am-holding-out-hope-for">Haskell Type Level programming ideas I’ve unsuccessfully tried to apply, but am holding out hope for…</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type level witnesses</strong>: although they did work for a specific problem, getting kind constraints to play nicely with associated libraries turned out harder than I imagined, and I’m not 100% convinced the added complexity if worth the effort.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>GADTs</strong>: Know the type for each individual data constructor? Sounds good! I just haven’t had a problem where this is exactly what I’ve needed.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Existensial Types</strong>: There is a bug that prevents generic deriving from “just working” reasonably in the last situation I tried them, and I’d rather just use an alternative approach, like a smart constructor, over writing my own generic instance. <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/10514">GHC bug report</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="build-systems">Build Systems</h2>
<p>I’m not sure what else to say here, other than build systems in Haskell leave something to be desired!<br>
Stack works, but doesn’t cache well, and there’s the dreaded <code>flat namespace error</code> and related errors that sometimes are most easily fixed by manually removing the offending library, or worst case removing your <code>.stack</code> directories.<br>
Alternatively, Nix is an efficient and robust build system, but is really complicated, and takes a non-trivial amount of time to learn and set up if you’re going to use that for your CI build system. I want to learn Nix and use it for personal projects, it’s just a question of priorities, and figuring out how to get it to work with <code>ghcid</code>.<br>
In 2021, I should really try <code>cabal</code> :)</p>
<h3 id="my-development-environment">My development environment</h3>
<p>The Haskell development environment has really improved over the last few years, and here’s the setup I eventually settled on:</p>
<ul>
<li>iTerm2 on MacOS, using <code>tmux</code> as a window/panel manager.<br>
</li>
<li><code>neovim</code> as my version of <code>vim</code> for writing code.<br>
</li>
<li><code>hasktags</code> to “jump to definition” with <code>vim</code> shortcuts. Not perfect with <code>OverladedLabels</code> within a large code base, but good enough!<br>
</li>
<li><code>hoogle</code> command line utility to search for polymorphic function types or package sources.<br>
</li>
<li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/">Hackage</a> online to browse docs. (press ‘s’ on a package page to open a search prompt).<br>
</li>
<li>A variety of tools using <code>fzf</code> for searching within and for files, and browsing git diffs and commits.<br>
</li>
<li><a href="https://hackage-search.serokell.io/">Serokell’s Regex Hackage Search</a> which just came out, but something I think could be very useful for arbitrary searches over Hackage!<br>
</li>
<li><code>ghcid</code> is pretty amazing, and I’m not sure how I wrote Haskell without it! It gives fast incremental recompilation, and can be configured to run a test suite or bash command on completion.</li>

<p>The haskell development environment is getting better all the time, and although I’ve set up Haskell Language Server a few times for small side projects, I haven’t taken the time to try it on a larger code base, despite the extremely helpful project devs!</p>
<p>My ideal tool, would be something that consolidates the different search interfaces (hackage, regex on hackage, local search, jump to definition, et cetera), to create a utility that jumps to definition or docs given what’s in scope for a given module or even project.</p>

<p>Here’s a sampling of the “essential” articles I came across in 2020.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/decade.html">Haskell for a New Decade</a> a good reading to start off the year!<br>
</li>
<li><a href="https://tech.channable.com/posts/2020-04-07-lessons-in-managing-haskell-memory.html">Lessons in Managing Haskell Memory</a> is a really interesting article about speeding up code execution time using “compact regions”. Memory management in strict, typed functional programming languages is a pretty wide open area, “compact regions” are a worthy approach!<br>

            <h5>The <code>h1</code> element is said to have the highest rank.</h5>
            <h6>The <code>h6</code> element has the lowest rank, and two elements with the same name have equal rank.</h6>

            <hgroup>
                
                <h2>The <code>hgroup</code> element represents the heading of a section, which consists of all the <code>h1</code>–<code>h6</code> element children of the <code>hgroup</code> element.</h2>
                <h3>The element is used to group a set of <code>h1</code>–<code>h6</code> elements when the heading has multiple levels, such as subheadings, alternative titles, or taglines.</h3>
                <h4>The rank of an <code>hgroup</code> element is the rank of the highest-ranked <code>h1</code>–<code>h6</code> element descendant of the <code>hgroup</code> element, if there are any such elements, or otherwise the same as for an <code>h1</code> element (the highest rank).</h4>
                <h5>Other <code>h1</code>–<code>h6</code> elements of heading content in the <code>hgroup</code> element indicate subheadings or subtitles or (secondary) alternative titles.</h5>
                <h6>The section on headings and sections defines how <code>hgroup</code> elements are assigned to individual sections.</h6>

            <!-- The p element -->
            <p>The <code>p</code> element represents a paragraph.</p>
            <p>While paragraphs are usually represented in visual media by blocks of text that are physically separated from adjacent blocks through blank lines, a style sheet or user agent would be equally justified in presenting paragraph breaks in a different manner, for instance using inline pilcrows.</p>

            </figure>

            <!-- The main element -->
            <p>The main element must not appear as a descendant of the section element. It cannot appear here so it has been moved to wrap all the content.</p>

            <!-- The div element -->
            <p>The <code>div</code> element has no special meaning at all. It represents its children. It can be used with the <code>class</code>, <code>lang</code>, and <code>title</code> attributes to mark up semantics common to a group of consecutive elements. It can also be used in a <code>dl</code> element, wrapping groups of <code>dt</code> and <code>dd</code> elements.</p>

        <h2 id="the-paradox">The paradox</h2>

<p>Stein’s paradox is among the most surprising results in statistics.  The basic
idea is easily stated, but it is difficult to understand how it could possibly
be true.  The premise is this: suppose that I have a Gaussian distribution with
a variance of unity and some mean which I don’t tell you.  I then draw a single
sample from this distribution, give it to you, and ask you to guess the mean.
What do you do?  Well, you don’t have a lot of information to go on here, so
you just guess that the mean is the number I gave you.  This is a good guess!
(We will make the notion of a “good guess” a little more precise later on.)</p>

<p>No big surprise there.  Now we play again, but this time, my distribution is a
<em>two</em>-dimensional Gaussian.  The covariance is the identity matrix (so this is
equivalent to sampling from two independent one-dimensional Gaussians).  But
again I have not told you the mean (which is now a two-dimensional vector).
Once more I draw a single sample from the distribution, hand it over to you,
and ask you to guess the mean.  You simply guess that the mean is the sample I
have given you.  Once more you have guessed well!</p>

<p>Now we do the same thing in three dimensions.  I draw a single sample, hand it
over to you, and ask you to guess the mean.  Just as before, you guess that the
mean is the sample I gave you.  But this is no longer a good guess!  Stein’s
paradox is that if we play this game in three dimensions or more, a better
guess is to say that the mean is this:</p>

\[\hat{\mu} = \textrm{ReLU} \left(1 - \frac{D - 2}{|\mathbf{x}|^2} \right)
\mathbf{x},\]

<p>where \(D\) is the dimensionality of the Gaussian, and \(\mathbf{x}\) is the
sample drawn from the distribution.  This is the so-called “James-Stein
estimator.”</p>

<p>Who would have thought!  What is going on here?</p>

<h2 id="what-makes-a-guess-good">What makes a guess good?</h2>

<p>Before we go on, we should clarify exactly what we mean by a “good guess.”  We
are trying to do what is called “parameter estimation” in statistics — based
on a sample from a distribution, we want to infer some underlying parameter (or
parameters) of the distribution.  (In this case the parameter we are interested
in is the mean.)  In order to quantify how good or bad our estimate is we
choose a function called a “loss function.”  There is some freedom in choosing
a loss function, but the mean squared error is a common choice and has a lot of
valuable properties.  Stein’s paradox assumes that we are using the mean
squared error.  So if we guess that the mean is \(\hat{\mu}\) and the true
value of the mean is \(\mu\), then the loss is</p>

\[\mathcal{L} = |\hat{\mu} - \mu|^2.\]

<p>Now, of course, we need some rule to go from the sample \(\mathbf{x}\) to the
estimate \(\hat{\mu}\).  This rule is just a function of some kind, say,
\(f(\mathbf{x})\).  This function has the special name of an “estimator.”  We
can choose whatever function we want here.  Our original guess was to just use
\(f(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{x}\).  But another choice here is to say
\(f(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{x} + 7\), or \(f(\mathbf{x}) = \sin(\mathbf{x}) /
\mathbf{x}^{71}\), or even just \(f(\mathbf{x}) = 31\).  It doesn’t take much
imagination to see that there are an infinite number of possible choices.  But
presumably some of these choices are better than others.  How do we know which
ones are good?</p>

<p>Statisticians use the concept of <em>risk</em> for this purpose.  Risk is simply the
expected value of your loss function.  One thing that can be a little confusing
is that the risk is a function of <em>both</em> your choice of estimator <em>and</em> the
true value of the parameter itself.  So in the original game where you’re
guessing the mean of a one-dimensional Gaussian, the risk will be a function of
whatever rule you decide to use and the actual, unknown value of the mean.</p>

<p>The fact that the risk is a function of the true value of the parameter makes
things a little tricky.  If you’re trying to decide between two estimators, you
might find that one estimator works better for certain values that the
parameter can take, and the other works better for others.  As a dumb example,
let’s go back to guessing the mean of a one-dimensional Gaussian.  Our original
estimator was \(\hat{\mu} = x\).  But another, perfectly valid, estimator is
\(\hat{\mu} = 7\).  In other words we ignore the sample entirely and say that
the mean is 7 no matter what.  Generally this doesn’t seem like a smart thing
to do.  But if the mean turns out to actually be pretty close to 7, on average
this will be the better guess!  Specifically, the risk of our initial estimator
is</p>

\[\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{R}_{x} &amp; = &amp; \mathbb{E} \left[ \left(x - \mu \right)^2 \right] \\
&amp; = &amp; \int (x - \mu)^2 e^{-(x-\mu)^2 / 2} \, dx \\
&amp; = &amp; 1.
\end{eqnarray}\]

<p>And the risk on our second, dumb estimator is</p>

\[\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{R}_{\textrm{dumb}} &amp; = &amp; \mathbb{E} \left[ \left(7 - \mu\right)^2 
\right] \\
&amp; = &amp; \int (7 - \mu)^2 e^{-(x - \mu)^2 / 2} \, dx \\
&amp; = &amp; (7 - \mu)^2.
\end{eqnarray}\]

<p>As long as the true mean, \(\mu\), happens to be between 6 and 8, the dumb
estimator of just saying 7 actually has lower risk!</p>

<p>Based on this example it might seem that we’re stuck.  Since we don’t know the
true value of the mean, we can’t generally say if one estimator is better than
another.  And indeed this is often the case.  But there are certain situations
where this is not true.  If we have two estimators and one of them has a lower
risk <em>for any possible value the parameter can take</em>, we can say that one is
definitively better than the other.  In statistical parlance, we say that the
worse estimator is “inadmissable.”</p>

<p>In more precise terms, Stein’s paradox states that in three dimensions or more,
the naive estimator (just guessing that the mean is \(\mathbf{x}\)) is
inadmissable because the risk of the James-Stein estimator is lower for any
possible mean I could choose.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-james-stein-estimator-doing">What is the James-Stein estimator doing?</h2>

<p>Before we can understand <em>why</em> the James-Stein estimator gives you a better
guess than the naive estimator \(\textbf{x}\), we should understand <em>what</em>
exactly it’s doing.  The idea is that we take the naive guess \(\textbf{x}\)
and then we scale it towards the origin by some amount.  The factor by which we
scale it is:</p>

\[\textrm{ReLU}\left(1 - \frac{D - 2}{| \textbf{x}|^2} \right).\]

<p>The ReLU function simply takes the maximum of its argument and zero, so this
scale factor will be either positive or zero.  Let’s suppose that it’s
positive.  In this case we scale it towards the origin more if the magnitude of
the sample is smaller and less if it is lower.  In the limit of \(|\textbf{x}|
\to \infty\) we don’t change it at all and our guess reduces to the naive
estimator \(\textbf{x}\).</p>

<p>In the other limit, if \(|\textbf{x}|\) is very small, then the ReLU function
will kick in and just set the scale factor to zero.  Hence anytime we get a
sufficiently small sample we throw it out and just guess that the mean is zero
instead.  And all else being equal we will shrink our estimate more in higher
dimensional spaces than in lower dimensional spaces.</p>

<p>So that is what the James-Stein estimator is doing.  Why does it work?  Before
we can answer that we need to take a quick detour.</p>

<h2 id="samples-in-high-dimensional-spaces">Samples in high dimensional spaces</h2>

<p>High dimensional spaces are counterintuitive.  One of the counteruintitive
properties of high dimensional distributions is this: a sample from a symmetric
high dimensional distirbution is highly likely to be further from the origin
than the mean.  Specifically, for an isotropic \(D\)-dimensional Gaussian, the
difference between the average distance to a sample and the distance to the
mean grows as \(\sim\)\(\sqrt{D}\).</p>

<p>It’s a little strange to put it this way, but isn’t so surprising with a little
bit of thought.  Even in two dimensions we can see that this is the case just
by drawing it:</p>

<p><img src="https://joe-antognini.github.io/assets/posts/steins-paradox/circle-origin.png"></p>

<p>The shaded area of the circle is less than half the area, so we are less likely
to choose a sample closer to the origin than the mean.  What perhaps makes this
counterintuitive is that in two dimensions a fairly large fraction of the
circle is still shaded.  But as the dimensionality increases, this fraction
decreases exponentially.  Once the dimensionality is even moderately large we
are highly unlikely to sample a point in this shaded region.</p>

<p>One caveat here is that this effect decreases the larger the mean is.  You can
imagine that as we move the circle further away from the origin, the shaded
fraction gets closer and closer to ½.  So long as the mean is sufficiently
large, the probability of sampling a point closer to the origin than the mean
can be close to ½ even in high dimensional spaces; it just requires a very
large mean.  We can start to see here the connection to the James-Stein
estimator, which also gets very close to the naive estimator \(\mathbf{x}\) as
the mean (and hence \(|\mathbf{x}|\)) gets very large.</p>

<p>What we are doing by shrinking the estimate towards the origin is correcting
for the tendency of the typical sample to be slightly further away from the
origin than the mean.  This correction allows us to reduce the overall risk of
the estimate. [<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">1</a></sup>]</p>

<h2 id="how-arbitrary-is-the-origin-really">How arbitrary is the origin, really?</h2>

<p>Stein’s paradox is particularly strange because there are actually two
counterintuitive things going on:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The origin is arbitrary, so why does moving your estimate towards the origin
help?</li>
  <li>Why does this not work in one or two dimensions?</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s take a look at the first of these.  A central principle in physics is
that of relativity — coordinate systems are arbitrary, so the laws of physics
must be valid in all of them.  Surely this is also true in statistics as well.
We can choose the origin to be wherever we like, so it cannot contain any
information.  But this sensible assertion is false.  Statistics is not physics.</p>

<p>If we truly had no information about the mean, what value would the sample
have?  If it could really be <em>anything</em> then presumably its value would …</p></article></section></div></div>

<p>This Christmas, a family member sent me a <span>URL</span> to a family Zoom call. However, they didn’t send me a direct link to Zoom. Instead, they sent me a<span></span> <span>“</span>tinyurl.com” link.</p>
<p>When I clicked on the link, my <span>URL</span> bar flashed an intermediate domain that was neither Zoom nor TinyURL. Later, I used cURL to see where this <span>URL</span> was really going.</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -v https://tinyurl.com/examplezoom
...
&gt; GET /examplezoom HTTP/2
&gt; Host: tinyurl.com
...
&lt; location: https://redirect.viglink.com?key=a7e37b5f6ff1de9cb410158b1013e54a&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us%2Fj%2F123456789&amp;prodOvrd=RAC</code></pre>
<p>
<em>(all <span>HTTP</span> responses abridged for clarity)</em>
</p>
<p>Sure enough, the redirect wasn’t clean at all. TinyURL was first sending me to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VigLink" target="_blank">VigLink</a><a href="#footnote-1WA7" id="ref-1WA7"><sup>1</sup></a>. VigLink is an advertising (tracking) company that specializes in affiliate marketing.</p>

<p>These cookies give them the ability<a href="#footnote-2WA7" id="ref-2WA7"><sup>2</sup></a> to track me across every other site that uses their advertising tech. Who knows what VigLink is doing with my data, but I personally wouldn’t trust an advertising company to keep my browsing history to themselves.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they didn’t give me a chance to opt-out of this tracking. I’m currently based in Europe and I would expect to see at least an interstitial asking for consent to be tracked. <a href="https://tinyurl.com/privacy.php" target="_blank">TinyURL’s privacy policy</a>, last updated in 2012, has no mention of either third party data-sharing nor the cookies they share from affiliates.</p>
<p>This isn’t a phenomenon limited to TinyURL. More common <span>URL</span> shorteners like t.co (Twitter) and bit.ly set cookies when you click on a link. While neither redirect you to an advertising company like TinyURL, Twitter’s primary business model is advertising, and <a href="https://bitly.com/pages/privacy" target="_blank">bit.ly’s privacy policy</a> says they share data with third parties to<span></span> <span>“</span>…provide advertising products and services…”</p>
<p>Don’t use <span>URL</span> shorteners. And if you click on a link from a <span>URL</span> shortener, I recommend using tools like the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/temporary-containers/" target="_blank">Temporary Containers Firefox extension</a> to limit the scope of ad tracking. Personally, I took the time to send Sovrn (VigLink’s parent company) a <a href="https://ylukem.com/files/_viglink-gdpr-email.png"><span>GDPR</span> request</a>, and made sure to give them my tracking cookie.

<p>Speed and safety without garbage collection, reference counting, or borrow checking!</p>

<p>
Vale's <b>hybrid-generational memory</b> is a new memory model that combines all the best parts of existing memory strategies: it's as easy as garbage collection, as deterministic as reference counting, and could even be as fast as borrow checking. <a href="#note0" data-noteid="0">0</a> <a href="#note1" data-noteid="1">1</a>
</p>
<p>
The <b>generational reference</b> is the keystone of the entire approach, the lynchpin that makes it all work. Keep reading to learn how it works!
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Note that hybrid-generational memory is <b>still in development</b>. We have some very promising early results, so we're sharing the idea to show you where Vale is headed. If you want to be part of this and bring hybrid-generational memory into the world, come <a href="https://vale.dev/contribute">join us</a> and help make it happen!
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h2 id="built-on-single-ownership">
 Built on Single Ownership</h2>
<p>
Recall that in Vale, an object is freed when its <b>owning reference</b> goes out of scope. An object always has exactly one owning reference pointing to it. <a href="#note2" data-noteid="2">2</a>
</p>
<p>
We can have as many <b>non-owning</b> references as we want.
</p>
<p>
Our goal here is to make it so when we dereference a non-owning reference, the program safely halts (or does something else <a href="#note3" data-noteid="3">3</a>) instead of triggering memory unsafety. <a href="#note4" data-noteid="4">4</a>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
To keep the language simple and the learning curve easy, we explicitly don't want to force a borrow checker on the user. However, we'd like an approach that has as little <a href="https://vale.dev/blog/hybrid-generational-memory#afterword-how-might-it-compare-to-rust">run-time overhead</a> as the borrow checker.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h2 id="generational-malloc-and-the-sacred-integer">
 Generational Malloc and the Sacred Integer</h2>
<p>
Generational references use <b>generational malloc</b>, which is like regular malloc, except at the top of every allocation is a <b>generation number</b>, which tracks how many objects have previously been at this memory location.
</p>
<p>
One could also think of it as describing "I am the <b>n</b>th inhabitant of this memory location".
</p>
<p>
Freeing an object will increment its generation number. Nobody else ever modifies it.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Later on, we use this number to see if a particular object is still alive, explained further below.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Generational malloc would normally be an adjustment to mimalloc or jemalloc, but we can simulate it with our own <span>genMalloc</span> and <span>genFree</span> functions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>genFree</span> increments the generation number, and instead of calling <span>free</span> <a href="#note5" data-noteid="5">5</a><a href="#note6" data-noteid="6">6</a>, remembers the allocation in a free-list. There's a free-list for every size class (16b, 24b, 32b, &lt;=48b, &lt;=64b, &lt;=128b, etc).
</li>
<li>
<span>genMalloc</span> pulls from a free-list if possible. If it's empty, it calls <span>malloc</span> and initializes the generation number to 1.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can find our experimental implementation in <a href="https://github.com/ValeLang/Vale/blob/master/Midas/src/builtins/genHeap.c">genHeap.c</a>.

 Vale has three release modes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Resilient mode, which is fast and memory safe; it will halt the program when we try to dereference a freed object.
</li>
<li>
Assist mode, for development, to detect potential problems even earlier.
</li>
<li>
Unsafe mode, which turns off all safety.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Resilient mode uses hybrid-generational memory.

 Generational Reference: More than just a pointer!</h2>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Vale's references are <b>generational references</b>. A generational reference has two things:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A pointer to the object.
</li>
<li>
A "target generation" integer.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
To create a reference to an object, we get its allocation's generation number, and include it in the reference.

<h3 id="dereferencing">
 Dereferencing</h3>

</section>
<section>
<p>
To dereference a generational reference, we do a "liveness check" to see whether the allocation's generation number <b>still matches</b> our reference's target generation. <a href="#note7" data-noteid="7">7</a>
</p>
<p>
This prevents use-after-free problems, and makes Vale completely memory safe.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
It's as if the reference is saying:
</p>
<p><b>"Hello! I'm looking for the 11th inhabitant of this house, are they still around?"</b>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
and the person who opens the door says:
</p>
<p><b>"No, sorry, I'm the 12th inhabitant of this house, the 11th inhabitant is no more."</b> <a href="#note8" data-noteid="8">8</a>
</p>

Generational references are only the first steps towards hybrid-generational memory, but we decided to run some early experiments to see how it compares to existing memory models.
</p>
<p>
For this experiment, we benchmarked <a href="#note9" data-noteid="9">9</a> <a href="#note10" data-noteid="10">10</a> three flavors of Vale:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Unsafe</b>, with no memory safety, the equivalent of C++ (minus caveats, see below!)
</li>
<li>
<b>RC</b>, where we use naive reference counting for all our objects.
</li>
<li>
<b>GM</b>, which uses generational references.

 Here, we benchmarked against other flavors of Vale, to isolate the differences between unsafe, reference-counting, and generational references.

Once we implement full hybrid-generational memory, we'll be benchmarking against C++ and Rust, stay tuned!

Try it out! In the Vale release, you can find a benchmark folder with scripts to run the benchmarks.

<b>Note these caveats!</b> To isolate the difference between generational references and the other approaches:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
In all flavors, we only allocate objects on the heap, except for primitives. Future versions will add stack allocations.
</li>
<li>
We used genHeap.c for all versions, though only GM ever touches the generation number, the other versions ignore it. Future versions will integrate generational malloc into jemalloc or mimalloc directly.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once we address these limitations, we can get more precise benchmarks against the other approaches.

 Why is this so fast?</h2>

<p>
Generational references are much easier for the CPU to handle than reference-counted references, because:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Generational references have no aliasing/dealiasing overhead, just on dereference.
</li>
<li>
Generational references cause less cache misses.
</li>
<li>
Liveness checks' branching is easier to predict than RC decrements' branching.
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="no-aliasing-costs">
 No Aliasing Costs</h3>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Reference counting is costly:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Whenever we "alias" (make a new reference to an object), we have to dereference the object to increment its counter.
</li>
<li>
Whenever we "dealias" (throw away a reference), we have to:
</li>
<ul>
<li>
Dereference the object to decrement its counter,
</li>
<li>
If the counter is zero, deallocate it.
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
For example:
</p>

    <div>
      
      <p><span><span>fn <span>launchShip</span><span>(<span><span><span>ships</span></span> <span>&amp;<span><span>Map</span>&lt;<span>int</span>, <span>&amp;<span>Spaceship</span></span>&gt;</span></span></span>, <span><span><span>id</span></span> <span>int</span></span>, <span><span><span>armada</span></span> <span>&amp;<span><span>List</span>&lt;<span>&amp;<span>Spaceship</span></span>&gt;</span></span></span>)</span> <span>{<br>  <span><span><span><span>ship</span></span></span> = <span><span>ships</span><span>.</span><span>get</span>(<span>id</span>)</span></span>;<br>    <p>  <span><span>armada</span><span>.</span><span>add</span>(<span>ship</span>)</span>;</p><p>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>}</p></span></span></span></p>
    </div>
  
<p>
As you can see, reference counting incurs a cost whenever we alias or dealias. <b>Generational references don't have that cost.</b> The above snippet would have zero overhead if it used generational references.
</p>

</section>

      </div>
  


    </div>
    <div>
      <div>
  
<section>
<p>
Instead, generational references incur a cost whenever we dereference an object:
</p>

    <div>
      
      <p><span><span>fn <span>getShipName</span><span>(<span><span><span>ships</span></span> <span>&amp;<span><span>Map</span>&lt;<span>int</span>, <span>&amp;<span>Spaceship</span></span>&gt;</span></span></span>, <span><span><span>id</span></span> <span>int</span></span>)</span> <span><span>str</span> </span><span>{<br>  <span><span><span><span>ship</span></span></span> = <span><span>ships</span><span>.</span><span>get</span>(<span>id</span>)</span></span>;<p>  <br>  <br>  <span>ret <span><span>ship</span><span>.</span><span>name</span></span>;</span><br>}</p></span></span></span></p>
    </div>
  

</section>
<section>
<p>
This is cheaper because <b>programs dereference less than they alias and dealias:</b> our sample program had 4.7 million counter adjustments, but only 1.3 million liveness checks. <a href="#note11" data-noteid="11">11</a> <a href="#note12" data-noteid="12">12</a>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h3 id="more-cache-friendly">
 More Cache Friendly</h3>
<p>
Reference counting is not very "cache friendly". Adding and subtracting integers is basically free on modern CPUs, but the real bottleneck in modern programs is how <i>far</i> those integers are: if it's been recently accessed, it's in the nearby cache, and only takes a few CPU cycles to fetch. Otherwise the CPU will "cache miss" and have to bring it in all the way from RAM, which could take <b>hundreds</b> of cycles. <a href="#note13" data-noteid="13">13</a>
</p>
<p>
In our reference-counted <span>launchShip</span> example, the <span>ship.__ref_count++</span> could take a few cycles if <span>ship</span> is already in the cache, or hundreds of cycles if it's not.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Generational references are more cache friendly:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
When a generational reference goes away, we don't need to reach into memory (unlike RC, where we have to decrement a counter).
</li>
<li>
We don't need to increment when aliasing (see previous section); we don't need to reach into memory to increment.
</li>
</ul>

								<p>Concept creep has to be one of my biggest pet peeves.</p>
<p>What’s concept creep? It’s pretty much what it sounds like. Concept creep occurs when a concept that originally meant something very specific later comes to encompass a much broader set of unrelated, or only loosely related, phenomena.</p>
<p>Psychology has been particularly plagued by concept creep. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1047840X.2016.1082418?journalCode=hpli20&amp;">According to Nick Haslam</a>, who is credited with coining the phrase:</p>
<p>Many of psychology’s concepts have undergone semantic shifts in recent years. These conceptual changes follow a consistent trend.&nbsp; Concepts that refer to the negative aspects of human experience and behavior have expanded their meanings so that they now encompass a much broader range of phenomena than before. This expansion takes “horizontal” and “vertical” forms: concepts extend outward to capture qualitatively new phenomena and downward to capture quantitatively less extreme phenomena…In each case, the concept’s boundary has stretched and its meaning has dilated.&nbsp;Although conceptual change is inevitable and often well motivated, concept creep runs the risk of pathologizing everyday experience and encouraging a sense of virtuous but impotent victimhood.</p>
<h2>Codependency, Narcissism, and Emotional Labor Are Very Specific Things</h2>
<p>Many concepts have fallen prey to this effect. One notable example is&nbsp;<a href="https://poly.land/2018/04/13/polyamory-helped-ditch-codependence-find-healthy-interdependence/">codependency,</a>&nbsp;which had a very specific meaning when it was first coined in substance abuse circles (the state of another person being co-addicted to substances by proxy, owing to their close relationship with an addict) but now is used by the general population to describe an entire array of behaviors that have nothing to do with the original concept and aren’t necessarily even pathological depending on the particular context (thinner than average boundaries, people pleasing, dependence in general, etc.).</p>
<p>A similar fate has befallen&nbsp;<em>narcissism.&nbsp;</em>There are actually pretty specific criteria for narcissistic traits, behavior, and of course the full blown personality disorder. However, it’s fashionable now for lay folks to label anyone that behaves like a jerk a “narcissist,” where many times the person in question is actually showing a pattern of behavior more consistent with other cluster B disorders (i.e., antisocial, borderline, histrionic). Or they’re just being kind of jerky and inconsiderate — but in a way that’s divorced from anything that’s really beyond the diagnostic pale. Because just because someone’s annoying or acting in a hurtful way, it doesn’t make them disordered.</p>
<p>It’s happening virtually everywhere you look. The Atlantic ran a piece recently on how <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/11/arlie-hochschild-housework-isnt-emotional-labor/576637/?fbclid=IwAR02EtM3N1RaZiq3fF48-uz32pWWoJ0iCxM-Tab6N7WPHV7-np4Vxl406zM">emotional labor has suffered concept creep</a>, an article which features an interview with the sociologist who originally coined the term.</p>
<h2>Not All Psychological or Emotional Invalidation Is Gaslighting.</h2>
<p>However, I would have to say that in my own work these days, I’m most frequently dealing with concept creep in regards to gaslighting.</p>
<p>The term <em>gaslighting</em> originally referred to a very specific form of psychological manipulation. Its origins stem from a play from the 1930s called&nbsp;<em>Gaslight</em>, in which a man tries to make his wife and other people think she’s insane by messing with small aspects of her environment and then telling her she’s wrong and possibly insane when she later points it out to him. In one instance, this literally involves <em>dimming gaslight</em>s in the house while he’s up to some shenanigans (he’s not a nice dude and also killed another lady and is rooting around looking for the dead woman’s jewels), thus the name.</p>
<p>So the term gaslighting informally came to describe an effort to manipulate someone’s perception of reality in a way that can make someone else feel crazy and doubt their own sanity. Where classically this process was dependent on a person messing with physical objects in one’s external environment, it’s also come to be understood that it’s possible to gaslight someone through less concrete methods: Lying, misdirection, denial, etc.</p>
<p>This is fine and a fairly minor extension of the original more literal use.</p>
<p>What <em>is</em> a problem, however, is that people have started to use it refer not just to this specific form of manipulation but instead to refer to <em>any</em> form of psychological invalidation.</p>
<p>One common misapplication I’ve seen many times in my travels is the following: In situations in which your partner disagrees with you about a subject that’s actually quite ambiguous and you get hurt by it, people are quite eager to jump in and say that the partner is gaslighting you. But that’s not what gaslighting is. Not every hurtful interpersonal conflict is (in fact, while gaslighting certainly happens, it’s relatively rare compared to other more common forms of maladaptive relating).</p>
<h2>Emotional Invalidation Versus Gaslighting</h2>
<p>However, it’s trendy so people are using the word&nbsp;<em>a lot —&nbsp;</em>whether they really&nbsp;<em>should&nbsp;</em>or not. Often what’s being mistakenly described as gaslighting these days is at best an honest disagreement over something ambiguous — or at worst, it’s an instance of emotional invalidation.</p>
<p>What’s emotional invalidation? It’s when someone else tells you that your emotions or thoughts aren’t valid. This can happen in a number of ways. Someone can simply ignore them and go about their merry way without considering them. Or they can outright judge you for them (“that’s a stupid way to feel”). They can even reject your own assessment of your emotional state by telling you, “Oh that’s not how you really feel.”</p>
<p>Is emotional invalidation hurtful? Absolutely.</p>
<p>Is emotional invalidation gaslighting? Nope, not really.</p>
<p>A better example of gaslighting would be if someone told you that they never had conversations with you that you know you did and tell you that you must be crazy or overworked if you think that actually happened. Or if they’re hiding things on you and telling you that you must be mistaken about those items getting lost (especially if they put them back in their original place later, causing you to doubt your sanity).</p>
<h2>But What Does It All Mean, Basil?</h2>
<p>Okay, so <a href="https://poly.land/2018/11/02/that-doesnt-need-to-be-a-word-is-an-incredibly-boring-stance/">language is evolving</a>. Whoop de freaking doo. That’s what language does, right? Maybe it’s annoying to prescriptivists (like a lot of other things), but what’s the big deal?</p>
<p>Well, concept creep has consequences.</p>
<p>In addition to Nick Haslam’s concerns above about pathologizing the everyday, I also find myself frustrated by the difficulty concept creep poses to communication. Where those terms once held some utility in talking with others, I find more often than not that when I’m attempting to problem-solve relationship issues with an individual that I absolutely cannot take any of that at face value. If they say that their partner is gaslighting them or they tell me that their ex was a narcissist, that ends up being <em>incredibly</em> low-yield information. Instead of learning anything important from those descriptors, I find myself expending considerable energy in followup questions, uncovering exactly what they think those words mean. What happened? What behaviors are we talking about?</p>
<p>Where several years ago, I was much more likely to have the individual describe the actual behavior at default, it’s more likely these days for people to start using labels instead as a shortcut. And ones they are often not applying correctly.</p>
<p>To be fair, there’s always going to be a place for that kind of followup in the helping professions. And people are generally unreliable narrators, incredibly biased and subjective sources of information, something you basically always have to keep in mind when you’re working with them and talking over complex social issues with them.</p>
<p>But concept creep really does seem to have gotten worse in recent years.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

  		<p>At around this time last year, I was being flooded with various articles on new year's resolutions and yearly summaries - as is typical in early January. I was trying to decide whether there is anything I hoped to change in my life. One of the big points on my 'roadmap to becoming a better human' google doc (everyone has one, right?) was being more aware of what happens with my time (what do I spend it on? am I sure I'm making <em>most</em> of it?). This sounded like an actionable new year's resolution, so I decided to give it a try. However, I tend to get a bit intense sometimes and so I kind of logged all my activities at 15-minute intervals for the whole year.</p>
<h4>You did what!?</h4>
<p>I logged my activities at 15-minute intervals for the whole year.</p>
<p>Here, check out this screenshot from my google sheet (btw, the spreadsheet title is just "Life"):</p>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/spreadsheet_banner.png" alt="A screenshot of a google sheet I used to track my data with different activities coloured differently" title="Life"></p>
<h3>Why would you do this!?</h3>
<p>I wanted to see what happens with my time. I knew I was spending quite a lot of it on social media, but I wasn't sure how much exactly. I also knew I was working quite a lot and wanted to quantify exactly how much (spoiler alert: not that much). I hoped that keeping track of what I do would help me to identify chunks of time that were being wasted and to turn them into <em>quality</em> time.</p>
<p>It was also a purely scientific curiosity - there were many less important questions that I was curious to find answers to: do I get less sleep while at uni? How much time do I spend with people vs on my own? What are the effects of drinking alcohol? and many others.</p>
<h3>Ok, sure, whatever. How much effort did this take?</h3>
<p>Not that much actually!</p>
<p>When I started, I was fully expecting to get bored with the whole thing and stop after maybe a month or so. Surprisingly, logging what I do turned out to be quite easy. As you might have noticed, I get quite excited about data so seeing my spreadsheet getting bigger and more colourful was enough of an incentive to keep me going. In the few instances, when I came close to stopping, a strong FOMD (fear of missing data) would always get me back on it.</p>
<h4>Technicalities</h4>
<p><a href="#data">I don't care, I want to see the data.</a></p>
<ul>
<li>I decided to log my activities in 15-minute intervals - I wanted to be able to catch shorter activities (especially procrastination) but didn't want it to be too crazy (though I might have lost the right to decide what is crazy when I started the whole project)</li>
<li>I was using google sheets to log my data. I liked them because are online by default allowing me to log my data both on my laptop and my phone, the drag-to-copy cell content function makes it easy to log longer activities and the conditional formatting makes the spreadsheet nice and colourful providing instant gratification. You can access my template <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XBUFCJGVL73kFvD0yO5e63fLfRuebemcqhnQoafXad4/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</li>
<li>I divided my activities into broad categories to make noting them down easier. Some categories were divided further into subcategories.
For me, the categories were:
<ul>
<li><strong>sleeping:</strong></li>
<li><strong>focused work</strong> - what I really understand as productivity:
<ul>
<li><strong>uni</strong> - university (until June) and PhD (since October)</li>
<li><strong>self-improvement</strong> - job applications, but also working on my personal projects (like writing code to analyse my data, or learning to draw)</li>
<li><strong>admin</strong> - answering emails, filling forms etc (btw filling my time tracking spreadsheet was in this category)</li>
<li><strong>organising</strong> - things like organising events for a society, conferences and other extracurricular things</li>
<li><strong>German</strong> - to track language learning</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>low-focus work</strong> - same subcategories as in focused work. Low-focus work included activities that were more mechanical and didn't require too much brain power. For example, admin or organising my notes would be low-focus, while reading papers or writing essays would be focused work.</li>
<li><strong>socialising</strong></li>
<li><strong>culture</strong> (with subcategories: <strong>books</strong>, <strong>films</strong>, <strong>documentaries</strong>, <strong>TV shows</strong>, and <strong>other</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>human function</strong> - the boring stuff I need to do to stay alive (showering, making food, eating and things like that. On trips also setting tents etc)</li>
<li><strong>other quality time</strong> - things that didn't really fit into the other categories. Subcategories: <strong>blogs</strong>, <strong>podcasts</strong>, <strong>news</strong>, <strong>games</strong>, <strong>YouTube</strong>, <strong>chilling</strong> (for the times when I needed to just lie down or stare at the wall), and <strong>other</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>travelling</strong> - time spent in buses/cars/planes etc</li>
<li><strong>exercising</strong> - deliberate exercise - running, cycling, exercise routines</li>
<li><strong>exercising (lower intensity)</strong> - mostly walking/slow cycling, but also stretching</li>
<li><strong>procrastinating</strong> - mostly social media</li>
<li><strong>idle</strong> - waiting in queues etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>The data</h2>
<p>Alright, so now that I hopefully managed to calm you down, let's use the data I have to answer a few questions:</p>
<h4>What did I do in 2020?</h4>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/year_props.png" alt="A calendar showing how much time in total I spent on different activities"></p>
<p>Turns out my top three activities of the year are sleeping (7h 45min on average per day and I'm very proud of this), working (6h 20 min on average per day) and socialising (3h 25 min on average per day). It is mostly what I would expect except that it always scares me how much time we actually spend unconscious. I can't decide whether 1h 20 min spent on human function (eating and showering etc) is a lot or not (a downside of a small sample size, I guess). On one hand, I could probably use that time to do more fun things but on the other hand maybe I should just chill.
The procrastination time (on average 10 mins per day) is definitely less than it actually is - I will talk more about it in the productivity section below.</p>
<p>Another cool feature of the way I was logging my data was that I could log more than one activity into a single time slot (walking and listening to a podcast is a classic). This means that the total time spent on all activities sums up to more than 365 days - you can see this as 'extra days' on the plot above. Turns out that this year, I had 395 surplus hours or 16.5 surplus days. I hope I didn't spend them on human function.</p>
<p>Some of the categories from the plot above were divided into more helpful subcategories:</p>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/High_intensity_work.png" alt="A calendar showing how much time I spent on different subcategories within focused work">
<img src="https://samplesize.one/img/Low_intensity_work.png" alt="A calendar showing how much time I spent on different subcategories within low-focus work"></p>
<p>By far, most of my work was towards uni and PhD - 51 days in total. After excluding the time from June to September, when I had holidays, this gives around 5hrs of work per day. While this includes weekends, this does not seem like a lot, especially that weekends are not really well respected at uni.</p>
<p>Finding out how little focused work I do, even on the days that feel productive, was one of the biggest surprises of analysing my data. It turns out that a typical working day (9-17) would usually only give around 5-6 hours of actual work, while the rest of time would dissolve on low-focus work, chatting to people, coffee breaks and other little distractions. While there were days when I would reach 8 hours of focused work (for focused uni work I had 32 such days this year), they required either spending the whole day (9-22) working or a <em>lot</em> of effort to stay focused. Both were quite tiring and unsustainable in the long run. I guess the lesson here is that when it comes to focused work, the 8-hour working day is an unattainable target and should not be used as a benchmark.</p>
<p>I also do a lot of admin - nearly half of all the time I spend on culture. This is fairly sad and a potential action point for the future.</p>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/culture.png" alt="A calendar showing how much time I spent on different subcategories within culture"></p>
<p>I spent a fair amount of time reading books - nearly 1.5h per day on average! I'm quite happy with this since this is a habit I consciously worked to develop this year. During this time, I have read 35 books (12,715 pages according to Goodreads<sup id="fnref1">
<a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a> </sup>
). If you want some recommendations, my top three would be: A Gentleman in Moscow, The Places in Between, and Little Fires Everywhere. On the other hand, I can't really find films or TV shows that I would really get into, so if you have any that you love, let me know! Also a bonus: the 'documentaries' are really just Louis Theroux and I don't regret a single minute.</p>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/Quality.png" alt="A calendar showing how much time I spent on different subcategories within quality time" title="Other quality time subcategories"></p>
<h4>How did the time spent on different activities change over the months?</h4>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/hrs_per_month_timeline.png" alt="A stacked plot showing how the average daily hours spent on different activities changed throughout the months"></p>
<p>As above, the hours sum to more than 24 because of logging two activities in a single time slot if I was doing them simultaneously.</p>
<p>You can quite clearly identify the 'hard lockdown' times - April+May and November. In both periods, there is a noticeable increase in working hours, reduction in socialising and increase in culture. In the spring I was finishing my Master's thesis and revising for my exams so I would expect the increase in productivity regardless of lockdown. However, seeing the same pattern in November (when we were discouraged from coming to office) seems to suggests that I am actually working more when working from home. This is probably due to both fewer distractions but also to the lack of alternatives. Normally, I would often stop working to meet friends. During the lockdown, when this is not an option, I often just continue working.</p>
<p>I would love to talk about all the other categories, but the post is getting quite lengthy so you can explore them here (another bonus: look for my binge of playing Zoo Planet):</p>

<h4>Hacking my monkey brain to increase productivity</h4>
<p>As I was analysing at my data throughout the year, I was quite disappointed in how little I worked and was looking for a way to increase it.
Inspired by <a href="https://putanumonit.com/2017/05/09/time-well-spent/">this post</a> I decided to gamify my productivity by giving myself points for activities I wanted to do more of.
I was hoping that they would act as sources of instantenous pleasure for my monkey brain (which wants fun <em>now</em> and doesn't really care about future me) to make it do things that might be less fun but beneficial in the long run.
Given that I already had data on my activities throughout the day, assigning points was pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>I would get:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 points per hour for the most productive activities (focused work towards uni &amp; self-improvement and exercising)</li>
<li>3 points for reading books</li>
<li>2 points for reading blogs, listening to podcasts, lower intensity work etc</li>
<li>0 points for things that are important but I do them anyway (socialising, sleep etc)</li>
<li>-4 points for procrastination</li>
</ul>
<p>And here are my points for this year:</p>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/points.png" alt="A calendar with days coloured according to the amounts of points I got on a given day"></p>
<p>and their distributions throughout the months:</p>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/points_per_month.png" alt="A plot of the distributions of points throughout the months"></p>
<p>Turns out my monkey brain is <text><strong>crazy</strong> </text> about points. The moment I started, every day became an exercise in optimisation. You can see that from April, …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>I am switching from Mac to Linux.</p>
<p>This is how the adventure started to find the best linux distro, with a seemless user experience and minimum maintenance.</p>
<p>In the past months I experimented with various distros:</p>
<ul>
<li>bare debian</li>
<li>Pop!_OS</li>
<li>Ubuntu</li>
<li>Elementary OS</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn’t even want to get my hands dirty with Arch. To each their own, right?</p>
<p>Read below to read my experience and to which distro I settled using.</p>
<h2>Experience recap</h2>
<h3>with bare debian</h3>
<p>Driver support for WiFi and Bluetooth were absent out of the box.</p>
<p>Still too much to adjust and tweak to get a decent user experience.</p>
<p>Not for me.</p>
<h3>with Pop!_OS</h3>
<p>Seemed like a fresh approach to the linux distro landscape, but I had major hiccups when it comes to display drivers.</p>
<p>Weird issues like blank screen after switching to HDMI external display. Troublesome boots when display was attached.</p>
<p>Weird glitches and graphical artifacts when resizing windows.</p>
<p>No issues with drivers.</p>
<p>I bet it works great on System76 machines though.</p>
<h3>with Ubuntu</h3>
<p>Glitches when working with external monitors.</p>
<p>Blank screen after booting connected via HDMI.</p>
<p>Weird behaviour when putting laptop in clamshell mode. Either not turning on, or shortly showing the login screen and then going to sleep.</p>
<p>No issues with drivers.</p>
<p>Recurrent issues with the confusing Software center versions not compatible with the applications on it.</p>
<p>Amazon EKS keeped popping up as a “promoted” application, without the possibility to remove it.</p>
<p>Bye Ubuntu.</p>
<h3>Elementary OS</h3>
<p>No issues with drivers.</p>
<p>No issues with external monitor. Wake and sleep with HDMI works like expected.</p>
<p>No blank screen when booting from external monitor.</p>
<p>Decent software center (with donations built in), also using snap was great.</p>
<p>Slight issues when disconnecting the external monitor and using the laptop, works after a few tries.</p>
<p>So far so good.</p>
<h2>Elementary OS is good enough for me</h2>
<p>The user experience is stunningly similar to what I was used to with a Mac.</p>
<p>Switching windows is intuitive.</p>
<p>If you forget a shortcut, just press <code>&lt;SUPER&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>With <code>snap</code> it almost feels like using <code>brew</code> and <code>brew cask</code>.</p>
<p>Using it in clamshell mode works like a charm.</p>
<p>The system even wakes up from sleep using a Bluetooh logitech keyboard with mouse (namely the Logitech k400 I think).</p>
<p><s>Still need to find a better Terminal emulator, because I’m not really fond of the one built-in. Perhaps time to try Alacritty?</s></p>
<p><a href="https://dottorblaster.it/2020/12/back-to-linux/">dottorblaster.it</a> suggested <a href="https://gnunn1.github.io/tilix-web/">Tilix</a>, and I can relate: it’s pretty awesome and provides a similar experience to iTerm.</p>
<p>This is how I am writing this very blog post.</p>
<p><img src="https://cri.dev/assets/images/posts/mac-linux/elementary-os-preview.png" alt="elementary os preview"></p>
<h2>Applications</h2>
<h3>Terminal</h3>
<p><a href="https://gnunn1.github.io/tilix-web/">Tilix</a> with ZSH (coming from iTerm and fish shell)</p>
<p><img src="https://cri.dev/assets/images/posts/mac-linux/tilix.png" alt="tilix"></p>
<h2>Browser</h2>
<p>Brave (coming from Firefox + Brave)</p>
<p><img src="https://cri.dev/assets/images/posts/mac-linux/brave.png" alt="brave"></p>
<h2>Editor</h2>
<p>VSCode + vim</p>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ideogram for emoji picking (that’s important nowadays)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>snap</code> + <code>apt</code> (perhaps flatpak in the future if I feel the need)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>NewsBoat</code> as RSS reader</p>
</li>
</ul>

<![CDATA[Modernizing the Law to Enable Electronic Wills]]>

        <p>This paper is endorsed by the <a href="https://willing.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Willing.com</a> Legal Advisory Board, whose members include Daniel L. Mosley, Robert H. Sitkoff, and John H. Langbein.</p>
<p><strong>A Note from Willing:</strong></p>
<p>Since launching in 2015, we heard from a lot of customers who struggled with the requirements for creating a will. They wanted to know: Can’t I just sign online, electronically? Can I store my will online with Willing?” In each case, the answer was no, unfortunately not — wills still live in the physical, pen-and-ink world, and their execution calls for the physical presence of witnesses and a notary.</p>
<p>We learned that the execution requirements were causing some people to procrastinate indefinitely when it came to making a will, or to make mistakes when signing that meant they hadn’t created a valid will when they thought they had. We wanted to come up with a solution. So, we worked with our Legal Advisory Board and other experts to examine the law in depth and think about how it could be updated to leverage technology while preserving its important functions. The result was this paper, which provided the foundation for our efforts to pass the Electronic Wills Act in a number of states.</p>
<p>As the legislation has moved along, we’ve heard both strong support and strong opposition. Naturally — and rightly — folks who practice in this area care a lot about getting it right. We also care a lot about getting it right, and to that end we welcome any and all input. We want nothing more than to have a constructive relationship with all interested parties, because we know it’ll make for better laws.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>To make a valid will, all American states require a person to comply with a set of formalities that trace back to a pair of statutes enacted by Parliament centuries before the invention of the light bulb. These formalities generally require a will to be in writing, signed by the testator, and witnessed by at least two people. There are good reasons for requiring formalities to make a will. Nevertheless, the traditional will formalities have not adapted to an evolving technological context in which nearly all transactions—including massive end-of-life transfers under pension plans, brokerage accounts, life insurance policies, and the like—can be made electronically. Accordingly, this paper argues in favor of legislation authorizing electronic wills made in compliance with a set of electronic formalities suited to the modern age. These reforms would improve access to will-making while facilitating the integration of wills with the many other methods of deathtime transfer that operate outside the law of wills.</p>
<h2>I. INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Technology is everywhere in modern American life. Using computers, smartphones and tablets, people can purchase almost any conceivable item and communicate instantaneously with others around the world. At the same time, businesses have used technology to become more efficient and profitable, and governments have employed technology to serve their citizens more quickly, conveniently and effectively.<sup><a id="fnref1" href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The law has made these advances possible by actively fostering the use of technology in commerce. Statutes such as the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (“E-SIGN”), which Congress enacted in 2000, and the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (“UETA”), which the Uniform Law Commission promulgated in 1999 and which has been enacted in nearly every state, have firmly established the principle that electronic documents and signatures should be given the same legal effect as paper and ink.<sup><a id="fnref2" href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> Modern commercial life would be impossible without these statutes—they make it possible for people to do their banking online, purchase a book on <a href="http://amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a> and order an Uber car to pick them up.</p>
<p>The law governing the execution of wills is a notable exception to the technological and legal progress that has improved people’s lives in recent decades.<sup><a id="fnref3" href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> In order to make a valid will, most American states require a person making a will (the “testator”) to satisfy three core “will formalities”: (1) <em>writing</em>—the will must be in the form of a writing;<sup><a id="fnref4" href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> (2) <em>signature</em>—the will must be signed by the testator; and (3)&nbsp;<em>attestation</em>—the will must be signed by at least two witnesses, who attest to the testator’s signature.<sup><a id="fnref5" href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup> These three core formalities predate the invention of the light bulb—across the country, they have remained largely unchanged for hundreds of years and, as we will see, are not generally thought to apply to electronic media.</p>
<p>At the same time, a system parallel to the law of wills allows individuals to pass property at death without going through probate court or complying with the will formalities. “Nonprobate” modes of transfer, such as inter vivos trusts, life insurance, and transfer-on-death bank, brokerage and pension accounts contain the majority of Americans’ wealth,<sup><a id="fnref6" href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup> but are governed by other bodies of law, and thus are not subject to the will formalities.<sup><a id="fnref7" href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup> Because these other bodies of law have embraced technology to a greater extent than the law of wills—and in fact are subject to both E-SIGN and UETA, which validate electronic documents and signatures—electronic media are already familiar, and even sanctioned, in the context of the most common deathtime transfers. <sup><a id="fnref8" href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Yet there are good reasons for the will formalities. As we discuss below, the formalities are intended to provide evidence of the testator’s intent, caution him as to the significance of making a will and protect him from fraud and duress. They have endured in part because “[w]hen the court is asked to implement the testator’s intention, he will inevitably be dead and unable to authenticate or clarify his declarations.”<sup><a id="fnref9" href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup> In the technological age, however, when many other significant transactions (including nonprobate wealth transfers) can be made electronically, the question arises whether the formalities should adapt to accommodate digital execution.</p>
<p>We believe that the process of making and validating a will can be effectively translated into an electronic format that preserves the functions of the original formalities. This would bring the advantages of technology to bear on end‑of‑life planning, allowing more people to provide for a thoughtful disposition of their property at death. Accordingly, this paper will argue for laws expressly permitting electronic wills by way of a digital writing, signature and attestation (and, where applicable, electronic notarization) using well-established technologies already recognized in commercial contexts, including in the nonprobate system. In making this argument, we both (a)&nbsp;acknowledge the value of the formalities and their present inseparability from many states’ law of wills; and (b)&nbsp;endorse the sound policy of Congress, and of nearly every American state, that electronic documents and signatures should be treated exactly the same as paper documents and ink signatures—and we urge the application of that policy to the law of wills.</p>
<p>In Part&nbsp;II below, we discuss the ways property can be transferred at death, including the uses and benefits of wills. We continue in Part&nbsp;III to survey the history and policy basis of the will formalities. In Part&nbsp;IV, we identify trends in statutory and case law that suggest that jurisdictions in America and abroad are already moving toward the policies we endorse in this paper. We also discuss the prominent role of technology in the nonprobate system. We conclude in Part&nbsp;V by explaining how the will formalities can be adapted to the modern age and noting the many benefits of modernization.</p>
<h2>MODES OF PROPERTY SUCCESSION</h2>
<p>There are two main ways that property is transferred at death: (a)&nbsp;through the “probate system”, which is governed by the law of wills (or in the absence of a will, by the laws of “intestacy” discussed below), and (b)&nbsp;the “nonprobate system”, which is not governed by the laws of wills <em>or</em> intestacy, but rather by the law governing the mode of transfer at issue. As we will see, the nonprobate system has assumed a far greater importance in the last 50&nbsp;years—today, Americans are able to pass (and in many cases, <em>do</em> pass) virtually all of their property outside the probate system, without being required to comply with the safeguards of the will formalities. This “nonprobate revolution” points toward the legal and practical basis for the modernization of the will formalities that we endorse in this paper.</p>
<h3>Wills and the Probate System</h3>
<p>Under American law, “[p]roperty owners have the nearly unrestricted right to dispose of their property as they please”,<sup><a id="fnref10" href="#fn10">[10]</a></sup> both during their lives and at their deaths. This policy of “freedom of disposition” is the “organizing principle of the American law of succession”,<sup><a id="fnref11" href="#fn11">[11]</a></sup> and has been recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court as a Constitutionally protected property right.<sup><a id="fnref12" href="#fn12">[12]</a></sup> As the American Law Institute has stated, “American law does not grant courts any general authority to question the wisdom, fairness, or reasonableness of the donor’s decisions about how to allocate his property. The main function of the law of wills is to <em>facilitate</em> rather than <em>regulate</em>.”<sup><a id="fnref13" href="#fn13">[13]</a></sup> As Harvard Law School Professor Robert H. Sitkoff has described it:</p>
<p>“The American law of succession embraces freedom of disposition, authorizing dead hand control, to an extent that is unique among modern legal systems. Within the American legal tradition, a property owner may exclude his or her blood relations and subject his or her dispositions to ongoing conditions&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The right of a property owner to dispose of his or her property on terms that he or she chooses has come to be recognized as a separate stick in the bundle of rights called property.”<sup><a id="fnref14" href="#fn14">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>A will is the traditional legal tool that allows an individual to exercise his freedom of disposition. By making a will, a person can choose what happens to his property following his death—in other words, a will says <em>who</em> …</p></div></div>

source code on laptops. Development happens strictly on workstations inside
their private networks, with some using their text editor’s support for
remote file editing and others running editors on those machines via SSH.</p><p>Adapting to this situation has indirectly led me into a bit of a rabbit
hole, forcing me to acknowledge my core values, better understand the
relation between progress and human flourishing, and ponder about the
question: why technology?</p><p><em>(Chapters are mostly self-contained.)</em></p><h3 id="the-computing-experience">The computing experience</h3><p>One of the oldest pieces of software still in use was recently described as</p><blockquote><p>A sort of hybrid between Windows Notepad, a monolithic-kernel operating
system, and the International Space Station.</p></blockquote><p>Of course, they were talking about Emacs. And yes, it is kinda true.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/tron.jpg"></figure><p>I’ve been using Emacs for a while and had opportunities to use it to work
on projects in remote machines. There are a few quirks, but after changing
a setting here and there, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html%5Fnode/tramp/Quick-Start-Guide.html">Tramp</a> is mostly usable. Tramp makes it possible
to transparently treat remote directories, files, commands, and more, <em>as if
they were local</em>. Opening a remote buffer via <code>M-x find-file /ssh:user@remote-host:/some/project</code> and having tools like Magit and Eshell
work out of the box feels like magic.</p><p>I'm not aware of similar functionality in Vim, but VSCode users recently
got
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview">something pretty close</a>.</p><p>Emacs runs either as a standalone graphical application (GUI) or in a
terminal emulator (TUI). In terms of features, GUI Emacs can be seen as a
superset of TUI Emacs. Among many other things, it makes it possible to
display:</p><ul><li>images, PDFs, rendered web pages (even YouTube!)</li><li>graphical popups (with code documentation, linting tips, compilation
errors, completion candidates, etc.)</li><li>heterogeneous fonts (distinct sizes, families, emphases, etc.)</li></ul><p>TUI Emacs has the terminal emulator (and also commonly tmux) limiting
and conflicting with the clipboard, keybindings, colors, and more. None of
these limitations are present in GUI Emacs.</p><p>For these and other reasons I use GUI Emacs and Tramp to work on remote
projects instead of TUI Emacs via SSH. Some do the opposite, and that’s
fine too! Even with the limitations shown above, TUI Emacs is very
powerful, and its performance in an SSH session is still superior to Tramp.</p><p>Even so, one might think displaying images in Emacs is not a big deal. Just
<code>open image.png</code> and get an actual image viewer application to render it,
right? Things get interesting in a remote Tramp buffer: <code>M-x find-file image.png</code> will display the <em>remote</em> image right there in your <em>local</em> Emacs
instance. Or in case you’re in a remote <em>dired</em> buffer, pressing <code>RET</code> on an
image file will do the same. It’s a non-disruptive workflow that allows one
to remain in the comfort of Emacs.</p><p>dired is a built-in file manager.</p><p>If you’re not an Emacs user, chances are the previous sentence doesn’t carry
much weight. <em>What’s good about staying inside Emacs</em>?</p><p>It is safe to assume that most of your <em>development</em>, or more broadly, your
<em>computing environment</em> is represented below:</p><ul><li>operating system (macOS, GNU/Linux distribution, Windows, etc.)</li><li>window manager (the one provided by your OS, i3, Openbox, XMonad, etc.)</li><li>terminal emulator (iTerm2, xterm, rxvt, alacritty, etc.)</li><li>shell (bash, zsh, fish, etc.)</li><li>terminal multiplexer (tmux, GNU Screen, etc.)</li><li>text editor or IDE (Vim, VSCode, Xcode, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.)</li><li>email, web browsing, multimedia, and communications</li></ul><p>Each item above is a discrete computer program. They’re extensible in
disconnected ways, and to varying degrees. They’re <em>islands</em>. Most of the
time integrating them is an uphill battle, and commonly just plain
impractical. Having used a computing environment centered around TUI Vim
and tmux for a decade, I know the pain of trying to make the shell, the
terminal, and every command line application running in it have the same
look, feel, and behavior of being inside Vim. It is impossible.</p><p>The emergence of the web browser as a software platform is in part an answer
to this disconnectedness.</p><p>In contrast, Emacs unifies and equalizes the computing experience as much
as one desires, so that it happens—and is extended—in a single,
cohesive environment.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/alt_tab_small.jpg" alt="Figure 3: My computing environment."><figcaption><p>Figure 3: My computing environment.</p></figcaption></figure><p>People commonly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/jjxatm/whats%5Fyour%5Fjob%5Fwhats%5Fyour%5Fdaily%5Femacs%5Fworkflow/">use Emacs</a> to process their email inbox, communicate in
chat, navigate the web, write code, and prose. At their core, these
activities are one and the same: text-editing. Being able to perform them
using the same keybindings and functionality for movement, search, text
manipulation, completion, undo-redo, copy-paste, is already a big deal, but
it’s not all: their integration into a single environment unlocks pleasant
and efficient workflows that would be much less convenient elsewhere.</p><p>Creating a to-do item for something your partner just asked you (while you
were concentrated on a task) that will show up automatically on your agenda
tomorrow? Just a few keystrokes and you’re back to the task. Converting
some text notes you quickly scribbled down into a beautiful PDF via LaTeX,
uploading it to S3, and referencing the URL in a reworded existing git
commit message? If you’re an experienced Emacs user, chances are you can
<em>visualize</em> effortlessly and efficiently executing these actions without ever
leaving Emacs.</p><p>This interconnectedness is part of the value of computing environments like
the one provided by Emacs. The whole becomes greater than the sum of its
parts.</p><p>Programmability gives it a further dimension of value: parts can be
combined as you see fit, in arbitrary and possibly unforeseen ways.</p><p>Now, back to the <em>displaying an image from a remote host</em> use case. For that,
I can think of some alternatives:</p><ul><li><code>scp</code> the image file between hosts and <code>open</code> it locally</li><li>Mount the remote filesystem and <code>open</code> it locally</li><li><code>ssh</code> into the remote host from a modern terminal emulator capable of
rendering images and use a program like <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/icat.html">icat</a></li></ul><p>In Emacs, you just press enter.</p><h3 id="opening-a-file">Opening a file</h3><p>At work I contribute to a moderately-sized monorepo at 70 thousand files,
8-digit lines of code and hundreds of PRs merged every day. One day I
opened a remote buffer at that repository and ran <code>M-x find-file</code>.</p><p><code>find-file</code> is an interactive function that shows a narrowed list
of files in the current directory, prompts the user to filter and scroll
through candidates, and for a file to open.</p><p>Emacs froze for <em>5 seconds</em> before showing me the <code>find-file</code> prompt. Which
isn’t great, because when writing software, opening files is actually
something one needs to do all the time.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/find_file_linux.png"></figure><p>Luckily, Emacs is “the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time
display editor”, and comes with profiling capabilities: <code>M-x profiler-start</code>
starts a profile and <code>M-x profiler-report</code> displays a call tree showing how
much CPU cycles are spent in each function call after starting the profile.
Starting a profile and running <code>M-x find-file</code> showed that all time was being
spent in a function called <code>ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code>, which was being
called by <code>file-name-at-point-functions</code>, an <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html%5Fnode/emacs/Hooks.html#:~:text=A%20few%20hooks%20are%20abnormal,are%20used%20in%20some%20way.">abnormal hook</a> run when <code>find-file</code>
is called.</p><p>If you're familiar with Vim you can think of Emacs <i>hooks</i> as
Vim <i>autocommands</i>, only with much better ergonomics.</p><p>I checked the documentation for <code>ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code> with <code>M-x describe-function ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code> and it didn’t seem
to be something essential, so I removed the hook by running <code>M-x eval-expression</code>, writing the form below, and pressing <code>RET</code>.</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">(<span>remove-hook</span> <span>'file-name-at-point-functions</span> <span>'ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</span>)
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>This solved the immediate problem of Emacs blocking for 5 seconds every
time I ran <code>find-file</code>, with no noticeable drawbacks.</p><div><p>As I write this I attempt to reproduce the issue by re-adding
<code>ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code>
to
<code>file-name-at-point-functions</code>.
I can't reproduce it anymore. The initial issue might have been</p><ul><li>caused by having manually mutated the Emacs environment via ad-hoc code
evaluation (drifting from the state defined in configuration)</li><li>caused by settings or packages that aren't in my configuration anymore</li><li>fixed by settings or packages that were recently added to my
configuration</li><li>fixed by some recent package upgrade</li></ul><p>Or some combination of the above. I have no idea exactly what.
Which is to say: maintaining Emacs configurations is complicated.</p></div><h3 id="searching-files">Searching files</h3><p>I could now navigate around and open files. The next thing I tried in this
remote git repository was searching through project files. The great
<em>projectile</em> package provides the <code>projectile-find-file</code> function for that,
but I had previously given up making projectile perform well with remote
buffers; given how things are currently implemented it seems to be
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=projectile+tramp">impractical</a>. So I installed the <em>find-file-in-project</em> package for use on
remote projects exclusively: <code>M-x package-install find-file-in-project</code>.</p><p>Most Emacs commands are accessible via key combinations, with defaults
that can be customized to be anything you want. I'll stick to referencing
command names themselves instead of their default keybindings.</p><p>Both <code>projectile-find-file</code> and <code>find-file-in-project</code> (aliased as <code>ffip</code>):</p><ul><li>show a narrowed list of all project files in the minibuffer</li><li>prompt the user to filter and scroll through candidates</li><li>open a file when <code>RET</code> is pressed on a candidate.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/projectile_find_file_linux.png"></figure><p>To disable projectile on remote buffers I had the following form in my
configuration.</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">(<span>defadvice</span> <span>projectile-project-root</span> (<span>around</span> <span>ignore-remote</span> <span>first</span> <span>activate</span>)
  (<span>unless</span> (<span>file-remote-p</span> <span>default-directory</span> <span>'no-identification</span>) <span>ad-do-it</span>))
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>Which causes the <code>projectile-project-root</code> function to not run its usual
implementation on remote buffers, but instead return <code>nil</code> unconditionally.
<code>projectile-project-root</code> is used as a way to either get the project root
for a given buffer (remote or not), or as a boolean predicate to test if
the buffer is in a project (e.g., a git repository directory). Having it
return <code>nil</code> on remote buffers effectively disables projectile on remote
buffers.</p><p>Emacs</p></div></div>

It's natural to wrap a function in another function.</p><pre><code><span>(</span>my-function <span>(</span>my-function <span>"first"</span> <span>"second"</span><span>)</span> <span>"third"</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Since all functions including built in functions are called the same way, it's easy to swap any function out with another, including built-ins.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>=</span> <span>42</span> <span>42</span><span>)</span> <span>"True"</span> <span>"False"</span><span>)</span><br><span>(</span>my-if <span>(</span><span>=</span> <span>42</span> <span>42</span><span>)</span> <span>"True"</span> <span>"False"</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>The parens replace a lot of the curly brace notation in other languages.</p><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>myFunction</span><span>(</span><span>arg1<span>,</span> arg2</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>if</span> <span>(</span>arg1<span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>return</span> arg1<span>;</span><br>  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>return</span> arg2<span>;</span><br>  <span>}</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span> my-function<br>  <span>[</span>arg1 arg2<span>]</span><br>  <span>(</span><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>not</span> <span>(</span>blank? arg1<span>)</span><span>)</span><br>     arg1<br>     arg2<span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Go has support for asynchronous "go channels" due to special syntax baked into the language. Clojure added the same features and syntax as a third party library. In Javascript you have to wait for syntax to be adopted or use a transpiler but in Clojure it could by implemented by anyone as a library.</p><pre><code>messages <span>:=</span> <span>make</span><span>(</span><span>chan</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span><br><span>go</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> messages <span>&lt;-</span> <span>"ping"</span> <span>}</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>msg <span>:=</span> <span>&lt;-</span>messages<br>fmt<span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span>msg<span>)</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span>def c <span>(</span><span>chan</span> <span>10</span><span>)</span><br><span>(</span><span>go</span> <span>(</span><span>&gt;</span><span>!</span> c <span>"hello"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><br><span>(</span><span>println</span> <span>(</span><span>&lt;</span><span>!</span><span>!</span> c<span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Clojure is really good at extracting data from maps and sequences. It is a really good for "data programs", that are mostly calling an API, transforming a sequence, and calling another API.</p><h2>Positional Destructuring</h2><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span> large-list '<span>(</span><span>1</span> <span>2</span> <span>3</span> <span>4</span> <span>5</span> <span>6</span> <span>7</span> <span>8</span> <span>9</span> <span>10</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><br><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span><span>[</span><span>a</span> <span>b</span> <span>c</span><span>]</span> large-list<span>]</span><br>  <span>(</span><span>str</span> <span>a</span> <span>b</span> <span>c</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre><h2>Destructuring with named optional parameters and defaults</h2><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span> configure <span>[</span><span>val</span> options<span>]</span><br><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span><span>{</span><span>:keys</span> <span>[</span>debug verbose<span>]</span><br>       <span>:or</span> <span>{</span>debug <span>false</span><span>,</span> verbose <span>false</span><span>}</span><span>}</span> options<span>]</span><br><span>(</span><span>str</span> <span>"val="</span> <span>val</span> <span>" debug="</span>debug <span>" verbose="</span>verbose<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><p><span>(</span>configure <span>"foo!"</span> <span>{</span><span>:debug</span> <span>true</span><span>}</span><span>)</span></p></code></pre><p>Having a fast feedback loop is crucial to be productive. When I first started programming I would write some code, compile, then manually test my changes, maybe with a debugger. Then I discovered TDD with an auto test runner, which gave me a faster feedback loop, since I could be reasonably confident my program worked without having to recompile for every change. The fastest feedback loop I've discovered so far is the Clojure REPL with editor integration. With Emacs and CIDER I can execute code in my editor as I write it. Having a fast feedback loop for exploratory coding before writing tests helps me be a lot more productive and write higher quality code. Other languages also have REPLs but I feel Clojure is uniquely well suited to this workflow because of its immutable functional nature.</p><p>Testing is simpler when most things are maps and pure functions. This is an example from the "Gilded Rose Kata".</p><pre><code>    <span>@Test</span> <span>public</span> <span>void</span><br>        <span>BackstagePassQualityControl</span> qualityControl <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>BackstagePassQualityControl</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><p>    <span>shouldNeverIncreaseQualityToMoreThanFifty</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br><span>Item</span> backstagePass <span>=</span> <span>anItem</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>                <span>.</span><span>withName</span><span>(</span>BACKSTAGE_PASS_ITEM_NAME<span>)</span><br>                <span>.</span><span>build</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>        backstagePass<span>.</span><span>setSellIn</span><span>(</span>FIVE_DAYS<span>)</span><span>;</span><br>        backstagePass<span>.</span><span>setQuality</span><span>(</span><span>50</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p><p>        qualityControl<span>.</span><span>updateQualityFor</span><span>(</span>backstagePass<span>)</span><span>;</span></p><p>        <span>assertThat</span><span>(</span>backstagePass<span>.</span><span>getQuality</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>is</span><span>(</span><span>50</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>    <span>}</span></p></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span> max-quality-pass<br>  <span>{</span><span>:quality</span> <span>50</span><br>   <span>:sell-in</span> <span>5</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><p> <span>(</span>deftest test-backstage-pass-peak<br>  <span>(</span>testing <span>"Quality never goes over 50"</span><br>    <span>(</span>is <span>(</span><span>=</span> <span>50</span> <span>(</span><span>:quality</span> <span>(</span>i/update-item max-quality-pass<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></p></code></pre><p>Clojure has good interop with the worlds most popular languages. You can tap into the Java ecosystem for foundational libraries like the AWS SDK or database clients. Clojurescript has an excellent wrapper around React called Reagent. You can write your entire stack in Clojure, meaning a single person can be extremely productive. The interop story isn't perfect though: although it works technically, the difference between the programming models does have some friction. This can usually be solved by writing a wrapper.</p><pre><code><span>(</span>System/getProperty <span>"java.vm.version"</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Now that Moore's Law is ending, we can't rely on speed increases of a single core anymore. We need to write code that can take advantage of multiple cores and that can correctly run in parallel. I don't feel good about using some languages like Python or Javascript that are single inherently single threaded. Languages like Java or C++, which weren't designed with concurrency in mind are hard to use correctly. Clojure's data structures are thread safe by default and it has numerous concurrency primitives. The language design de-emphasis the us of state and emphasizes the use of values instead.</p><p>I initially disliked clojure coming from my semi strongly typed Java and C++. If you use types you have to consider their downsides and the cost of the coupling introduced by type information flowing through your program. After using Clojure, I find things like the "builder pattern" contrived. There is usually only a few types of true "data" and the rest of the program are subsets and combinations of the data, which don't always deserve an explicit name or type. I feel using languages that encourage classes encourages you to make abstractions too early, and making the wrong abstraction is much worse than repetition. A lot of the "bugs" you catch at compile time are often self inflicted bookeeping mistakes due to the increased complexity. I think testing is a much stronger form of software validation and will catch the errors that types would have.</p><p>The design choices and tradeoffs in Clojure were made deliberately. There are much fewer sharp edges and historical accidents in Clojure than any other language I've used. Clojure is opinionated on the way you write software but if you buy into that opinion, using pure functions and immutable data structures, the experience is very streamlined.</p><p>I remember having to learn the difference between comparing primitives and objects in Java. Code like this feels unintuitive.</p><h2>Equality</h2><pre><code><span>Integer</span> a <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Integer</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>Integer</span> b <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Integer</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><p><span>if</span> <span>(</span>a <span>==</span> b<span>)</span><span>{</span><br>  <span>System</span><span>.</span>out<span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"True"</span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>System</span><span>.</span>out<span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"False"</span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p><p><span>if</span> <span>(</span>a<span>.</span><span>equals</span><span>(</span>b<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>{</span><br>  <span>System</span><span>.</span>out<span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"True"</span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>System</span><span>.</span>out<span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"False"</span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>Comparing object equality is almost never what I want to do and I don't think it's a good default behavior.</p><pre><code><br><span>(</span><span>{</span>foo<span>:</span> <span>"bar"</span><span>}</span> <span>===</span> <span>{</span>foo<span>:</span> <span>"bar"</span><span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>This does what I expect, and I don't need to know the difference between <code>=</code>, <code>equals</code>, <code>==</code>, <code>===</code>, <code>deepEqual</code>, and <code>deepStrictEqual</code>.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>:foo</span> <span>"bar"</span><span>}</span> <span>{</span><span>:foo</span> <span>"bar"</span><span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>There is only <code>=</code> for structural equality and no assignment operator. The only <code>false</code> value is <code>nil</code> and everything else is <code>true</code>.</p><h2>Polymorphism without classes</h2><p>Clojure is described as having "polymorphism a la carte", which means it has the benefits of inheritance and interface without being forced to use it and without many of the downsides.</p><p>In Java, we could do something like this to represent a shape that can be extended in other areas of the program.</p><pre><code><span>abstract</span> <span>class</span> <span>Shape</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>public</span> <span>double</span> <span>area</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>        <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span><br>    <span>}</span><br><span>}</span><p><span>class</span> <span>Rectangle</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Shape</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>protected</span> <span>int</span> width<span>,</span> height<span>;</span></p><p>    <span>public</span> <span>Rectangle</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> width<span>,</span> <span>int</span> height<span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>        <span>this</span><span>.</span>width <span>=</span> width<span>;</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>height <span>=</span> height<span>;</span><br>    <span>}</span></p><p>    <span>public</span> <span>double</span> <span>area</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>        <span>return</span> width <span>*</span> height<span>;</span><br>    <span>}</span><br><span>}</span></p><p><span>class</span> <span>Triangle</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Shape</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>protected</span> <span>int</span> a<span>,</span> b<span>,</span> c<span>;</span></p><p>    <span>public</span> <span>Triangle</span><span>(</span><span>in…</span></p></code></pre></div></section></main></div></div>

To ensure, I inspect my server traffic with tcpdump. <img src="https://ahmetozer.org/uploads/2021/uping-error.jpg" alt="route"><br> The packets are arrived into the server and responded without any error.<br> So I also tested in different Source IP which is announced in UK (in real, Ip is physically located in Marmaris). It does not have any issue, it means port 53 is not closed for everyone in my server.</p><h2 id="where-is-my-packet">Where is My Packet?</h2><p>We see the packet in tcpdump, so my packets drop at between server to the client which is an incoming path for client.<br> Let’s look at it.<br> <img src="https://ahmetozer.org/uploads/2021/2021-01-02-2.jpg" alt="route"></p><p>It seems like has a problem. In normal, the packet will be arriving 18th hop but in this time it does not arrive.

To be precise, it’s around 80%.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.inc.com/marla-tabaka/why-set-yourself-up-for-failure-ditch-new-years-resolution-do-this-instead.html#:~:text=Seriously%2C%20you%20are%20rare%20indeed,is%20in%20the%20tradition%20itself.">[1]</a></p><p>Why do people still repeat something that mostly doesn’t work?</p><p>Because people love the concept of a fresh start.</p><p>From a certain date,&nbsp;<em>I’ll change my life, I’ll lose weight, start a business, I’ll be perfect</em>.</p><p>Can you hear the hope in this? Even if we’re unsatisfied with the current state of things, we can see our future brighter. Even if we’re fat and currently eating the 5th donut, we can feel somehow good about ourselves because we’re planning to stop doing this after a certain date.</p><p>The problem with resolutions is that we overestimate our abilities and time available in the future. We think that in the future we'll have much more time than right now. We make this mistake because we think about our future plans only in vague and unclear terms, but we’ll be probably just as busy as we are now.</p><p>We also think that our willpower will be much stronger than now. We think we won’t give up this time. It will be different.</p><p>This lets us get away with being lazy now and not trying. We basically throw all the effort on our future selves. However, when the date arrives and it’s time to change, most of us can’t do it.</p><p>Even if the previous paragraphs might sound discouraging, we still think that New Year’s resolutions can work. Drawing a thick line behind your past is helpful in changing yourself.</p><p>However, you need to think about New Year’s resolutions differently.</p><h2>How to make New Year’s resolutions work</h2><h3>1. Don’t say what the hell</h3><p><a href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/blog/how-to-start-working-after-you-procrastinated-the-whole-day">As we’ve covered here</a>, when people screw up something (like their diet) they say&nbsp;<em>what the hell</em>&nbsp;and binge eat everything.</p><p>This is the common reason why New Year’s resolutions fail. Once people fail at doing their new chosen behavior, they start thinking that it doesn’t matter now, and stop trying (or resume their bad habits again).</p><p>For example, people create a complicated “perfect” morning routine: Wake up at 6 am, do yoga for 15 minutes, write in a diary, take a cold shower... A few days in, they don’t wake up on time and they say:&nbsp;<em>I failed to wake up on time, my routine can’t be perfect anymore,</em>&nbsp;and they don’t do anything else. But it doesn’t have to be that way.</p><p>Let’s say you decide you finally want to start publishing your blog posts and you commit to writing for 30 minutes every day. You’re two weeks in and you forgot to write yesterday. Most people will be really mad about not writing yesterday and many will say:&nbsp;<em>I screwed up, I didn’t follow the plan</em>, and then they don’t write that day or the next day, and then stop writing altogether.</p><p><strong>However, you don’t need to be perfect. That wasn’t the goal. The goal was to publish on your blog. You can still do that. Missing one day doesn’t mean anything in the long run.</strong></p><p>If you fail, forgive yourself and instead of saying&nbsp;<em>what the hell</em>, resume right now or the next day.</p><p>At this point in time, you might also not feel like you want to get after the original goal anymore. In this case, examine why you wanted to achieve the goal in the first place. Weak or impersonal reasons often lead to abandoning it rather quickly.</p><p>That’s why you should only choose to change the most painful things or pursue the things you want the most. Reasons like I heard it’s good for my career, my family wants me to do it, or it’s good to know multiple languages won’t cut it. Your reasons for changing should be strong and personal.</p><p>When you have strong reasons for why you wanted to change, you realize that doing anything at all is better than doing nothing. You understand that you don’t have to say&nbsp;<em>what the hell</em>&nbsp;because the goal wasn’t to be perfect, but better.</p><h3>2. Know that difficult times will come</h3><p><a href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/blog/how-to-change-yourself">As we’ve covered in How to change yourself</a>, the first wave of inspiration and motivation runs out eventually. This is when the real progress happens.</p><p>In the beginning, when everything is going great, we start wearing rose tinted glasses that make us overestimate our ability to control and change ourselves.</p><p>We think that we know it all.</p><p>The bad news is that after the first thrill runs out (usually takes a week or two), it gets more difficult. This is also when most people fail.</p><p>When it gets more difficult, that’s when you need to use your discipline to stick through with the behavior.</p><p>We tell you this not to discourage you, but to help you stay realistic. When you know that there will be some hard days, you won’t be surprised. Many people quit because they think everything will go smoothly and then they hit an obstacle and bail.</p><p>The good news is, if you stick with your new behavior for 3-4 weeks, it will become significantly easier later on.</p><p>Expect that you’ll need to use your willpower to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/blog/3-tricks-to-start-working-despite-not-feeling-like-it">act despite not feeling motivated.</a></p><h3>3. Mindset shift: Start thinking about helping your future self</h3><p>When the difficult times come, we often get into a mindset of despising the endeavors we’ve decided to pursue. We feel like we&nbsp;<em>have to</em>&nbsp;do them and we don’t want to. We would rather do something easy like watching Netflix, playing video games, or checking social media.</p><p>You already know that you should remind yourself why you wanted to make a change in the first place. However, sometimes even this doesn’t help. Certain activities that are beneficial for you in the long term don’t feel great in the moment.</p><p>There is a simple mindset shift that can make hard things easier to do:&nbsp;<strong>You’re helping your future self.</strong></p><p>When you start thinking about helping your future self, instead of thinking about just suffering now with no payoff, everything gets easier.</p><p>Think about it in this way: Whenever you procrastinate, you make things harder for your future self. There isn’t a way to escape responsibilities forever. On the other hand, if you start working consistently, you make it easier for your future self. Additionally, your future self will eventually become your present self. It’s still you after all.</p><p>Everything you are or have is the result of the choices your past self made for you.</p><p>Eating healthy so you’re not fat?&nbsp;<em>Thank your past self for that.</em></p><p>Learned a valuable skill and can get a job easily?&nbsp;<em>Thanks, past me, I can buy nice things.</em></p><p>Finished a task ahead of deadline?&nbsp;<em>Great, I can now enjoy free time.</em></p><p>Next time, you feel like you don’t feel like working, remind yourself that every task you do successfully will help your future self. And when you get to that point in the future, you'll feel proud of the choices you made.</p><h3>4. Become accountable to someone</h3><p>One of the easiest ways to stick with a behavior is by becoming accountable to someone else.</p><p>We think we can hold ourselves accountable, but that often fails in reality. We’re great at coming up with rationalizations for why we ate that cake, skipped that workout, or checked social media in the middle of our workday.</p><p>I didn’t do it because ____________. We can always come up with good reasons for why we didn’t do something. We do this to protect our conscience because we don’t like to face the truth.</p><p>When you become accountable to someone else, however, rationalizations become way more difficult. The other person can easily tell whether you’re bullsh*ting or not.</p><p>Here are some ways to use accountability to your advantage.</p><h4>1. Take on a new habit with a friend</h4><p>One frequent use of this is the "gym buddy system." It can be hard to get ourselves to do a hard activity like working out, and commit to it.</p><p>However, if we make a pact with a friend to show up every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday after work and do a workout, we add a bit of extra pressure that helps us actually show up. We don't want to disappoint our friend, do we?</p><p>Do you have a friend who wants to do something you also want to do? Working out, journalling, studying...?</p><p>Make an agreement, set a time, and hold each other accountable!</p><h4>2. Make a bet</h4><p>Another way to motivate yourself can be making a bet.</p><p>You can also do this with friends or you can use a service like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stickk.com/">StickK</a>or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.beeminder.com/">Beeminder.com</a>.</p><p>Both services allow you to place a financial bet - if I don't do X, I will lose X money.</p><p>Beeminder gets data from a variety of sources - you can set a goal of writing a certain number of words every day or running X miles and connect it to Google docs or Strava, and if you don't honor your commitment, you'll lose money.</p><p>Sometimes pressure is productive. Want to heighten the stakes? Make a bet.</p><h4>3.

<p><em>Dec 31, 2020</em></p>
<p>Got a web app responding too slowly because of a database query?
The query plan is what you'd want to look at.
Let's look at the execution plan that Postgres shows you when you
use the EXPLAIN statement and see how to interpret that.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/using-explain.html">Postgres documentation on using EXPLAIN</a>
is excellent, but I thought writing a concise version will serve as a note to my future self.
To start off, let's run with a simple schema of three tables: (a) Users,
(b) Articles, and (c) Orders.</p>
<pre><code>users:
 id |      email
----+------------------
  1 | jon@example.com
  2 | Jane@example.com
</code></pre>

<pre><code>articles:
 id |    name
----+-------------
  1 | Playstation
  2 | Xbox
</code></pre>

<pre><code>orders:
 id | user_id | article_id | qty
----+---------+------------+-----
  1 |       1 |          1 |   2
  2 |       1 |          2 |   1
  3 |       2 |          1 |   4
  4 |       2 |          2 |   3
</code></pre>

<p>Suppose we want to query the <code>users</code> table by the email address, the plan that
postgres generates is:</p>
<pre><code>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users WHERE email='jon@example.com';
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Index Scan using users_email_index on users  (cost=0.15..8.17 rows=1 width=222)
   Index Cond: ((email)::text = 'jon@example.com'::text)
</code></pre>

<p>Since we have an index on the email column, postgres has decided to use that
to search the users table. If we didn't have that index, it would do a sequential
scan over the entire table:</p>
<pre><code>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users WHERE email='jon@example.com';
----------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on users  (cost=0.00..14.00 rows=2 width=222)
   Filter: ((email)::text = 'jon@example.com'::text)
</code></pre>

<p>To get all the orders of a user, the query plan is:</p>
<pre><code> EXPLAIN SELECT *
    FROM orders
    INNER JOIN users
        ON orders.user_id=users.id
    WHERE users.email='jon@example.com';
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nested Loop  (cost=0.30..40.57 rows=6 width=238)
   -&gt;  Index Scan using users_email_index on users  (cost=0.15..8.17 rows=1 width=222)
         Index Cond: ((email)::text = 'jon@example.com'::text)
   -&gt;  Index Scan using orders_userid_index on orders  (cost=0.15..32.31 rows=9 width=16)
         Index Cond: (user_id = users.id)
</code></pre>

<p>What's going on here? First, postgres is using the index on the email column
to search the users table for users for email jon@example.com.
For each matching row (we expect a single matching row in this example),
an index scan is performed over the orders table get all orders for that user id.
Translated to pseudocode:</p>
<pre><code>for user in users.filter(email='jon@example.com'): # uses the email index
    for order in orders.filter(user_id=user.id): # uses the userid index
        yield (user, order)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, let's try joining all the three tables to get the full details of all the orders of a user:</p>
<pre><code>EXPLAIN SELECT *
    FROM orders
    INNER JOIN users
        ON orders.user_id=users.id
    INNER JOIN articles
        ON orders.article_id=articles.id
    WHERE users.email='jon@example.com';
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nested Loop  (cost=0.45..41.71 rows=6 width=460)
   -&gt;  Nested Loop  (cost=0.30..40.57 rows=6 width=238)
         -&gt;  Index Scan using users_email_index on users  (cost=0.15..8.17 rows=1 width=222)
               Index Cond: ((email)::text = 'jon@example.com'::text)
         -&gt;  Index Scan using orders_userid_index on orders  (cost=0.15..32.31 rows=9 width=16)
               Index Cond: (user_id = users.id)
   -&gt;  Index Scan using articles_pkey on articles  (cost=0.15..0.19 rows=1 width=222)
         Index Cond: (id = orders.article_id)
</code></pre>

<p>This is similar to joining the two tables, but we have another loop to join the third table.
In pseudocode, this is what's going on:</p>
<pre><code>for user in users.filter(email='jon@example.com'): # uses the email index
    for order in orders.filter(user_id=user.id): # uses the userid index
        for article in articles.filter(id=order.article_id): # uses article_id primary key
            yield (user, order, article)
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of an index scan, you might come across a bitmap heap scan like this:</p>
<pre><code> EXPLAIN SELECT *
    FROM orders
    INNER JOIN users
        ON orders.user_id=users.id
    WHERE users.email='jon@example.com';
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nested Loop  (cost=4.37..23.02 rows=6 width=238)
   -&gt;  Index Scan using users_email_index on users  (cost=0.15..8.17 rows=1 width=222)
         Index Cond: ((email)::text = 'jon@example.com'::text)
   -&gt;  Bitmap Heap Scan on orders  (cost=4.22..14.76 rows=9 width=16)
         Recheck Cond: (user_id = users.id)
         -&gt;  Bitmap Index Scan on orders_userid_index  (cost=0.00..4.22 rows=9 width=0)
               Index Cond: (user_id = users.id)
</code></pre>

<p>In a plain index scan, postgres fetches a row pointer from the index and immediately
fetches that row from the table. But with a bitmap index scan, all the tuple pointers
that match the filtering condition are gathered and an in-memory bitmap data structure
is created. From this, the actual tuples in the table are visited in physical location order.
This improves locality of accesses to the table and matters a lot for spinning rust HDDs but
can also help with SSDs too. What's that "recheck condition"? If the bitmap gets large,
postgres converts it to a lossy bitmap that stores only physical pages instead of individual
tuples. So when the tuples are read from the physical pages, postgres has to recheck which
tuples in that page match the filtering condition. Bitmap scans also do well when there
are multiple filtering conditions using ORs and ANDs since the bitmap data structure supports
these operations efficiently.</p>
<p>Postgres collects statistics about the content of the tables. If it expects very few rows
to match the filtering condition, an index scan is preferred. If many rows are expected to
satisfy the filtering condition, a bitmap scan is preferred. If a substantial portion of the table
is likely to be fetched, the sequential scan wins. One of the authors of Postgres, Tom Lane, has
an email thread on <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/12553.1135634231@sss.pgh.pa.us">this topic</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/49024533">three types of joins</a> you're likely to come across in a
query plan are: (a) Nested loop join, (b) Hash join, and (c) Merge join. For example, here is a hash join:</p>
<pre><code> EXPLAIN SELECT *
    FROM orders
    INNER JOIN users
        ON orders.user_id=users.id
    WHERE users.email='jon@example.com';
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hash Join  (cost=14.03..47.45 rows=12 width=238)
   Hash Cond: (orders.user_id = users.id)
   -&gt;  Seq Scan on orders  (cost=0.00..28.50 rows=1850 width=16)
   -&gt;  Hash  (cost=14.00..14.00 rows=2 width=222)
         -&gt;  Seq Scan on users  (cost=0.00..14.00 rows=2 width=222)
               Filter: ((email)::text = 'jon@example.com'::text)
</code></pre>

<p>The hash join can be used only when the join condition is the equality operator.
Postgres constructs an in-memory hash table of the filtered users and scans the
orders table and retains those tuples which have a matching user id in the
constructed hash table.</p>
<p>The nested loop is the preferred option when at least one side of the join has very
few matching tuples. Hash join is used when both sides of the join have a large number of tuples.
Merge join is preferred when both sides of the join are large but can be sorted on the joining
condition using an index.</p>

              <p>I often see people believe in their solution and think theirs are better than the others'. They defend their cases without having an exact reason. These situations often create long and meaningless discussions that go nowhere. Often they result in conflicts and people being offended by others' behavior.</p><p>Some people take action and implement their idea. Act fast, fail fast, and learn quicker. But this doesn't work when two or more people discuss how to implement a change or use new hyped technology. When people only talk a bit and implement a new hype, it often ends up with resentment. When we act and embrace failing that fast, we cannot keep someone accountable.</p><p>On the other hand, some people try to get everyone's confirmation to implement something that affects a large group. This strategy doesn't work either. Because it's impossible to get everyone on the same page, each person has a different opinion. When we try convincing everyone, we cannot implement anything at all. We just talk, and decisions come later than we need.</p><p>That's why we need to balance both taking action and asking people to present their opinion on a topic. This balance is achievable with an excellent process. I helped build this balanced process in an organization where we aimed to solve another problem - the lack of feedback. We introduced a process called <strong>Request For Comments (RFC). </strong>It is a common feedback mechanism in the software world presented by the Internet Society (ISOC) and used currently in the Rust language.</p><p>The RFC process uses a document written by someone about their proposal on a topic. It has <strong>a specific timeframe</strong> and <strong>everyone can give feedback</strong> on it. The RFC and feedbacks are posted <strong>publicly</strong>. Everyone can join the discussion. The goal is to include as many people as possible to access more points of view and spread the knowledge simultaneously. The good thing is that people focus on the proposed idea and give their feedback based on facts instead of only beliefs. On the other hand, it has a way bigger effect.</p><p>While the initial goal of the RFC is collecting feedback, I think it achieves a way more significant benefit by only <strong>writing the document itself</strong>. Writing shapes thoughts. Everyone has an opinion on any topic. But people who write their ideas form them into great content that is based on the facts.</p><p>Writing helps to clear the mind. When we write on any topic, we separate our proposal from ourselves. It's still part of us. But since we plan to present it to the public and leave it there forever, we start being careful. And most of the time, we are not starting with blank white paper.</p><p>The RFC processes use either a template or follow one standard style in documents. The aim is to help the authors to explain their plan in a structured way and, at the same time, make giving feedback easier. Each section of the document has its own goal, which helps separate the intent from the idea in a certain way.</p><p>We used <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/educ303x/wiki-old/uploads/Main/SRI_NABC.doc">the NABC model from Stanford</a>. The model starts with defining the <em><strong>N</strong></em>eed, followed by <em><strong>A</strong></em>pproach, <em><strong>B</strong></em>enefits, and lastly, <em><strong>C</strong></em>ompetitors. Separating the Need from the Approach is very smart. While writing the need, the authors have to understand it very well. The approach and benefits sections are pretty straightforward, where authors define their strategy and list down the advantages. Since most people focus on them when they talk about ideas, it's also easy to write. Then the competition section comes. It is the part the authors have to consider competitors of their proposal. Thinking about an alternative solution instead of their suggestion requires people to focus on the problem instead of blindly loving and defending their solutions. With these four parts, the NABC is a pretty good model. But it's not the only one.</p><p>Everyone has different needs. Therefore the formats might differ. Our manager at work also came up with a way more straightforward structure with only four questions to answer. It was only for our team, while the engineering department had the RFC process for a wider audience.</p><p>The RFCs have another effect on the organization. The process seeks a <strong>consent-based </strong>environment,<strong> not a consensus-based </strong>one. If some people care about a topic a lot and come up with a written document that explains many things in detail, everyone can (and should) trust them. The authors shouldn't wait for everyone's confirmation of their proposal. When they get enough feedback, they should be able to continue further with or abandon the idea. It's their decision. Since they prepared the doc and collected many comments on it, they can have a better judgment.</p><p>The process brings <strong>accountability</strong>, as well. Whoever writes the proposal should be kept accountable. When people know that they will be accountable, they tend to approach more carefully and consider different aspects seriously. Holding someone accountable doesn't mean that there will be a blame in case of failure. It only means that they have to follow up on their proposals, make sure it results in some way, and answer questions on the way. Also, most of the time, the RFC process is separated from the implementation process. While the author is accountable for the RFC itself, the implementation can be done by different people, and the RFC author might not be involved in it at all.</p><p>These hidden gems of writing the idea in a structured way and asking people for comments afterward prevents many endless debates. The culture changes with it as well. Instead of endless debates, we create discussions and solutions based on facts. The process prevents people from talking and doing nothing. Even though the RFC process might not be perfect itself, writing is enough to halt the endless and meaningless discussions. It also helps build trust in the community. So, if you are new to the RFC system, start with writing down your proposal. I'm pretty sure that the result will be way better than expected.</p><hr><p>Check out the comments on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25622149">HackerNews</a>.</p><hr><p><em>Cover Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@30daysreplay">30daysreplay Marketingberatung</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a></em></p>

You’ll no longer be limited to four colors of each shape!</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1608210356524_75334"><div><p>Whether you want to do some simple brainstorming with just a few boxes, or create complex technical diagrams with dozens of different shapes, colors, and arrows, the new document palettes offer the flexibility you need!</p><p>Lastly, <em>Diagrams 2.0</em> will be ready for the next generation of the Mac ecosystem. In addition to a shiny new app icon and an overhauled UI specifically tailored for macOS Big Sur, it will include support for the Apple M1 chip.</p><p>This update is free for all existing users, and we can’t wait to share more details with you! Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/diagramsapp" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://diagrams.app/newsletter">subscribe to our newsletter</a> to be notified as soon as the update goes live <em>early next year</em>.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1608213579082_8666"><div><h2>Beta Program</h2><p>But wait, there’s one more thing! We’re starting a new beta program to get your feedback and improve <em>Diagrams</em>. The beta program will be limited to a closed tester group, but we’re happy to provide as many seats as possible. If you’re interested in testing new features during development, feel free to join the beta now!</p></div></div></div>]]>

I am a survivor of the Cambodian holocaust. That's who I am.”</p><p>“I believe what the old monk taught me. And everything he said came true, only in reverse. My family was unhappy, my village was unhappy, and so was the country. And now I look back on it all and think about the connections, and wonder whether I myself was partly to blame.”</p><p>“And when I saw their false pride, I felt I finally understood what war is about. Men fight for glory or ideals, but the result is not glorious or idealistic. The main result, besides the suffering, is that civilization is set back many years.”</p><p>“If I didn’t worry about the Khmer Rouge, it was because I didn’t believe they could be any worse than the Lon Nol regime… It surprises me now, but most of us pretended that life was almost normal. We made ourselves believe that Phnom Penh was a little island of peace and it was going to stay that way.”</p><p>“We had not been in favor of the revolution. We had not been against it. We didn’t even care about politics much. But now that the revolution had come, we had been bulldozed by it, reduced to the same level as the other exiles around us. And there was no new society building. Just the rubble of the old one.”</p><p>“To avoid our own deaths people like me were doing things we knew were wrong. And as we scrambled to protect ourselves, or sought to gain favor with the new powers, the old relationships were torn apart.”</p><p>“What made it worse, what made it more appalling was that somehow it was ordinary. You put one foot in front of the other and you kept on walking. You heard the cries of the weak but you didn’t pay much attention, because you were concentrating on yourself and your own survival. We had all seen death before.”</p><p>“How fast man changes! How fast he sheds his outer humanity and becomes the animal inside! … Children left their parents to die, wives abandoned their husbands and the stronger kept on moving. The Khmer Rouge had taken away everything that held our culture together, and the result was this: a parade of the selfish and the dying, Society was falling apart.”</p><p>“They knew that a small lie can be caught and that a big lie is easier to get away with.”</p><p>“There were no laws under the Khmer Rouge except the law of silence. There were no courts except Angka Leu. Maybe the prisoners hadn’t worked hard enough. Or they stole food. Or a chhlop, a spy, overheard them making remarks about Angka. People disappeared. That is all we knew. And I knew that someday I would be one of them.”</p><h4><a href="https://amzn.to/2KSRnZu">Confessions: An Innocent Life in Communist China</a></h4><p><em>Kang Zhengguo, translated by Susan Wilf</em></p><p>“‘Behavior’ meant putting on a deliberate show of allegiance to the authorities. When the teachers and school leadership evaluated your ‘behavior,’ they were referring to your politics, and you had to play the game right if you wanted a rating of ‘well behaved.’ Behavior ratings were as important as tests and grades since they affected one’s class rank, admission to select groups, and future prospects in general.”</p><p>“As I was browsing the big-character posters on the street on a winter day in 1966, it dawned on me that people everywhere were jumping onto the Cultural Revolution bandwagon to try to better their own lots, and I sensed their pent-up rage spilling out like water roiling over a dam… After paying lip service to Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, which conveniently proclaimed the right to rebel, the aggrieved parties blamed all their problems indiscriminately on the bourgeois reactionary line. Now that leaders had been pronounced fair game, nobody was afraid to lash out at them anymore.”</p><p>“Instead of telling me why I was being detained or charging me with a specific crime and asking me to confess, he told me to make my deposition first. As if the reason for my arrest were a riddle to which only he knew the answer, he had turned the interrogation into a guessing game.”</p><p>“It was my first experience with such poverty, and I was learning some new lessons about human nature. Apparently, people could coexist only if everyone was equally destitute, and a stroke of good luck could be a nuisance in disguise.”</p><p>“Broaching the forbidden was tantamount to “advocating” or “appreciating” it; that was the prevailing logic.”</p><p>“Even if I had been duped, I had no reason to regret having performed a good deed.”</p><h4><a href="https://amzn.to/3aZ95Fu">Blood Red Sunset: A Memoir of the Chinese Cultural Revolution</a></h4><p><em>Ma Bo, translated by Howard Goldblatt</em></p><p>“It was my background. My mother sealed my fate the day she became a writer. People from literary families were among society’s foulest outcasts… Revolutionary soldiers hate cultured people, writers especially, so they had no use for me.”</p><p>“‘Ma Bo, the masses have complained about your behavior during these denunciation meetings… Just because you weren’t permanently labeled doesn’t mean there isn’t a label with your name on it. Labels are in the hands of the masses, who can stick them on you anytime they want!’”</p><p>“But getting angry wouldn’t do any good… I was a counterrevolutionary mirror that reflected people’s true souls. When they looked into it they discovered they weren’t as attractive as they’d thought. That made them unhappy, so they blamed the mirror.”</p><p>“Experience told me that Jin Gang’s sympathy for me was tied to his own interests. If I were drowning, he would be the last person to come to my rescue. But I also knew that if I made my way back to the shore, his outstretched hand would be there for me.”</p><p>“Skeins of tangled emotion spilled …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Over the past few years, I’ve noticed certain skills in people I admire, from Paul Graham, Vitalik Buterin, to Ender Wiggin.</p>

<p>Most normal people like me don’t realise these are skills. This makes the skills powerful - not everyone can see them, and very few people have mastered them.</p>

<p>However, I aim to change that. What follows below are 10 skills sourced from admirable people that I want to develop this decade.</p>

<p>Powerful life skills make powerful people.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-take-compounding-seriously">Learn to take compounding seriously</h2>

<p>It’s not just your wealth that compounds, but life experience and knowledge, too.</p>

<p>So, learn the most basic, most useful skills first. The longer you wait to learn skills like these, the less time there is for compounding magic. That’s what this entire list is about: powerful skills to learn and use for the rest of your life.</p>

<p>And even though you’ve heard about compounding, this item is first on the list, because <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/taking-ideas-seriously.html">taking ideas seriously is hard</a>.</p>

<p>A good way to figure out what compounds is <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/year-in-review-2019.html#compounding-is-powerful-building-intuition-for-compounding-even-more-so">to figure out what’s a platform</a>.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-develop-taste">Learn to develop taste</h2>

<p>Despite prevalent beliefs, taste isn’t subjective.</p>

<p>While it may seem like it on the outside, when you say “I just love this painting” or “I just love this coffee machine” - all it means is that the defining characteristics are illegible to you. And noticing this is the first step.</p>

<p>Let’s take a specific example. Say you’re designing a high quality clay pot - and you’ve never done this before.</p>

<p>What’s a good way to develop taste for quality here?</p>

<p>If you’ve heard this claypot parable, you know the answer: start by making lots of crap pots.</p>

<blockquote>
  <div><p>The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality. His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the “quantity” group: fifty pound of pots rated an “A,” forty pounds a “B,” and so on. Those being graded on “quality,” however, needed to produce only one pot—albeit a perfect one—to get an “A.”</p><p>

Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the “quantity” group was busily churning out piles of work—and learning from their mistakes—the “quality” group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay. - <a href="https://amzn.to/3o9o17A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Art and Fear</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup></p></div>
</blockquote>

<p>Let others tell you what you’ve made is crap. Learn why. Notice when they tell you something is great. Figure out why.</p>

<p>This transfers to writing as well: Popular advice to get better is to write a lot of junk, do it a 100 times, and pay particular attention to what is received well. Here’s <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/taste.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another example - developing taste for design</a>.</p>

<p>In effect, you bootstrap good taste by first learning what others consider good. Then, <a href="#learn-to-see-systems">you see the system behind it</a>. Then you break the rules and still manage to awe.</p>

<p>Then you’ve developed taste.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-sequence-things-well">Learn to sequence things well</h2>

<p>Waking up when others are asleep and getting lots done is a super power. It’s born out of a system of <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/sequencing-things-in-the-right-order.html">learning to sequence things well</a>.</p>

<p>It means choosing the right time for that Netflix binge.</p>

<p>It means being prepared before the meeting, not scrambling to get things done after.</p>

<p>It means reading the coursebook before the lecture, not after.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-see-what-others-see">Learn to see what others see</h2>

<p>How well can you understand other people? Can you sense their desires, their concerns, and what events lead to those desires and concerns?</p>

<p>If you can do this, you can understand them. But not before.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him. I think it’s impossible to really understand somebody, what they want, what they believe, and not love them the way they love themselves. - <a href="https://amzn.to/2KKe8Px" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ender’s Game</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s worth going this far because understanding is powerful. It helps you empathise. It helps you negotiate. It helps you figure out why you don’t have product-market fit. It helps you learn quickly: you can switch through personas and see what will and won’t work.</p>

<p>How do you do learn to see? I know no better way than to practice. Try it a 100 times. <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/subscribe">Come back next year</a>, and maybe I’ll have a better way once I’ve done it a 100 times.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-make-and-execute-decisions-quickly">Learn to make and execute decisions quickly</h2>

<p>Most people have a bias towards analysis-paralysis versus getting shit done.</p>

<p>When decisions are reversible - and they mostly are - speed is a super power. Cultivating a habit of making decisions quickly, and then executing them is better than just thinking about it.</p>

<p>Training this skill begins as easily as deciding what to eat on a huge menu. It’s a small step, but over time, <a href="#learn-to-take-compounding-seriously">even the smallest steps compound</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Hesitation is always easy, rarely useful” - Prof. Quirrel alterego, <a href="http://www.hpmor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HPMOR</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s an <a href="https://firstround.com/review/speed-as-a-habit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">example in the context of business</a>. And a <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1345140364995227648" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet from Sam Altman</a>.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-spot-a-convex-or-concave-world">Learn to spot a convex or concave world</h2>

<p>In the world of viral infections, a 50% lockdown is worse than a 0% and a 100% lockdown, both. The virus isn’t contained, and businesses have to shut down, too.</p>

<p>In the world of immigration policies, letting some specific people in is better than letting no one or everyone in. The middle ground is better than the extremes.</p>

<p>When the best of both worlds is great, you’re in a concave disposition.</p>

<p>When the best of both worlds is worse than either, you’re in a convex disposition.</p>

<p>The world is sometimes concave, and sometimes convex. Knowing your topology can help you make better decisions.</p>

<p>I first noted this when <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/08/concave.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vitalik Buterin explained it</a>. Read it for more concrete examples.</p>

<!-- ## Learn to do obvious things -->

<h2 id="learn-to-tell-stories">Learn to tell stories</h2>

<p>People donate more to charity when they know a single victim’s story, versus statistics of a thousand deaths. It’s called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifiable_victim_effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Identifiable Victim Effect</a>, but it’s the power of stories over facts. The right framing gets you further than all the facts combined.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ideas &amp; facts contextualised by stories are more powerful than either alone.</p>

<p><i></i><b>The Skill of Storytelling</b><br>
There’s lots to unpack here, and this is the first skill I’ve been working on for the past few months. Watch out for a long blogpost in 2 weeks!</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-dive-into-the-source-code-when-documentation-isnt-enough">Learn to dive into the source code when documentation isn’t enough</h2>

<p>Sometimes, there’s no precedent for what you want to do. Or the people who did it before didn’t write a manual.</p>

<p>In cases like these, figuring things out for yourself is powerful. Research papers and obscure books aren’t just for scientists. They’re freely available on the internet* for all of humanity to use. Learn to use it. Learn about resources like <a href="https://sci-hub.do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SciHub</a>, <a href="https://libgen.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LibGen</a>, and hiring researchers. You’re allowed to hire people (specially graduate students!) to satisfy your research concerns.</p>

<p>… and when you’re done, <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html#writing-code">preserve context for future you</a>.</p>

<p>It’s a lot like trying to use an API that has no documentation. Would’ve been easy if there was documentation, but there isn’t. So you got to do it the hard way: read the source code and figure out what you need to make things work.</p>

<p>It’s also like <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/A-framework-for-First-Principles-Thinking.html">figuring out what you need to build rockets yourself</a> when existing ones are too expensive.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/37sHjeisS9uJufi4u/scholarship-how-to-do-it-efficiently" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More resources here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-be-specific">Learn to be specific</h2>

<p>Every time I gave an example above, I was training my specificity muscles.</p>

<p>Most of the time, most people don’t know what they’re talking about. Not being specific is a sign of that. The more abstract the word, the harder it is to pin down a meaning.</p>

<p>For example, “negative ramifications” doesn’t tell you what exactly happened, while “the sonic boom from the new supersonic jet destroyed windows in a 100m radius” is a lot more specific.</p>

<p>Learn to be specific, and learn to spot when others aren’t. <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NgtYDP3ZtLJaM248W/sotw-be-specific" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here’s how</a>.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-see-systems">Learn to see systems</h2>

<p>There’s two kinds of people.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bob, who will see this list, find some skills very interesting, and then go about honing those skills</li>
  <li>Alice, who will see this list, and wonder how I came up with these
<!-- - The Inspiration-Junkie, who will lurk and move on to the next inspiring post without changing anything -->
</li>
</ul>

<p>Alice would then try to understand the system that generated these ideas. Then, she’ll adopt the system, and come up with skills possibly more relevant to herself.</p>

<p>Having the option to do both is powerful. Since Bob is the default, <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/How-to-see-Systems-in-everyday-life.html">learn to be like Alice</a>. Choose <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/understanding-systems.html">systems when things are important</a> to you. Choose hacks when you need a quickfix.</p>

        <h2 id="what-does-varlink-provide">What does varlink provide?</h2>

<p>Everybody understands it. Varlink uses a simple human and machine readable <a href="https://varlink.org/#interface">text file</a> to
describe an interface with all its data types, method calls and errors. The text file, in its simplicity,
does not require any specific knowledge to join a discussion about design, development, and
maintenance of an API.</p>

<p>It documents itself, in the sources and on the wire. Varlink interfaces describe themselves readable to
humans and reliably consumable by machines. Varlink services are introspectable at runtime. Varlink
interfaces provide their documentation along with the interface description.</p>

<p>Everything is readable. Varlink uses plain text messages, has no magic numbers, no unnamed values, is
easily debuggable with things like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strace">strace</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat">netcat</a>,
<a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a>.</p>

<p>Varlink itself is simpler than the service that uses it. Varlink uses direct connections, has no
central message handling component, it is easily debugged, secured, isolated, tested.</p>

<h2 id="which-transports-can-be-used-to-speak-varlink">Which transports can be used to speak varlink?</h2>

<p>Varlink can be implemented on any connection-oriented transport.The most common example are streaming
sockets, but it can also be implemented on kernel special files like device nodes or encapsulated in
other protocols, like HTTP, GSS-API or SASL.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-monitor-changes-or-subscribe-to-signals">How can I monitor changes or subscribe to signals?</h2>

<p>Varlink connections can be turned into monitor connections, they are soft-negotiated between the
client and the service. The client asks the server to possibly reply with more than one reply, the
server replies and indicates that it might have more replies and the client should wait for them.</p>

<p>To avoid race conditions between the reading of the current state and subscribing to updates, a
typical varlink monitor method call first returns the current state and then sends changes in
subsequent replies to the same request on the same connection.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-there-no-sequence-numbers-in-calls-and-replies">Why are there no sequence numbers in calls and replies?</h2>

<p>Varlink operates on connections, all messages are strictly in order on the same connection and always
received in the order they are sent. Connections support message pipelining, but not multiplexing.
Complex interfaces can use multiple connections at the same time.</p>



<p>The varlink message <a href="https://varlink.org/Method-Call">header</a> can be extended by vendors if needed. Added keys should use
the reverse-domain notation including the vendor’s name. The concept is similar to the X-prefix used for
HTTP headers, but neither they nor naked keywords should be added by vendors, since they may clash with
other vendors or future varlink protocol specifications.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-records-separated-by-a-nul-character-and-do-not-specify-a-length">Why are records separated by a NUL character and do not specify a length?</h2>

<p>The simplest possible transport of varlink messages is a raw streaming socket, which forwards JSON
records separated by a NUL character. Conceptually the NUL character belongs to the transport not to
the varlink message. If varlink messages are encapsulated in HTTP, HTTP will specify the record length
and not use a NUL byte.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-there-no-unsigned-integers-and-why-are-there-no-integer-sizes-specified">Why are there no unsigned integers, and why are there no integer sizes specified?</h2>

<p>Like JSON, varlink is intentionally underspecified in this regard. The implementation should use
integers large enough to carry the signed integer value, and return an error if it cannot handle the
received number.</p>

<h2 id="the-varlink-type-system-specifies-features-which-do-not-directly-map-to-json-how-are-they-serialized">The varlink type system specifies features which do not directly map to JSON, how are they serialized?</h2>

<p><a href="https://varlink.org/Interface-Definition#type">Enums</a> are serialized as a JSON name/value pair, with the enum value as a
string. <a href="https://varlink.org/Interface-Definition#type">Maps</a> are serialized as JSON objects, every map element is
represented as a name/value pair.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-transmit-file-descriptors">Can I transmit file descriptors?</h2>

<p>Varlink intentionally does not support features or side-effects specific to transports. Encapsulating
varlink messages in other protocols, passing them over proxies is a requirement of varlink.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-reference-a-file">How can I reference a file?</h2>

<p>Varlink should be remotable, therefore you should not point a remote service to a file, which is local
to the client. Just send the content and an identifier/name of the file.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-transfer-larger-amounts-or-foreign-data">How can I transfer larger amounts or foreign data?</h2>

<p>You can either send the data as a string, or use the “upgraded” connection feature, where you opt-out
of the varlink protocol after calling a method with the <code>upgrade</code> <a href="https://varlink.org/Method-Call">header</a> field set
to <code>true</code>. After sending this message the connection is yours for sending whatever you want. To
speak the varlink protocol to the service again, you need to open a new connection. Upgraded varlink
connections are similar to the websocket concept.</p>

<h2 id="when-is-a-oneway-request-useful">When is a <code>oneway</code> request useful?</h2>

<p>Setting <code>oneway</code> in a <a href="https://varlink.org/Method-Call">method call</a> means that the service will not send a reply. This
might be useful when many messages are sent as part of one transaction, and only one single reply is
needed to confirm the transaction. It might also be useful for non-critical data like a debugging
interface, to minimize round-trip handling.</p>

<p>The most important reason to add this feature right from the start is, that it could not be added to
the protocol at a later time, because all implementations need to support it right away to correctly
handle the strict message ordering requirement.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-there-no-error-numbers-or-human-readable-messages-in-errors">Why are there no error numbers or human readable messages in errors?</h2>

<p>Varlink errors are interface-specific and identified by a string. If required, Interfaces could add a
<code>message</code> field to the error parameters which contain human readable text. The primary focus of
varlink errors is machine consumption, in most cases a carefully chosen descriptive CamelCase error
sufficiently describes the error to humans.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-find-the-service-which-implements-a-local-interface">How do I find the service which implements a local interface?</h2>

<p>On systems with the <code>org.varlink.resolver</code> interface reachable on a defined varlink URI, the
client can call the <code>method org.varlink.resolver.Resolve(interface: string) -&gt; (address: string)</code>.</p>

<h2 id="how-are-varlink-services-accessed-from-a-remote-machine">How are varlink services accessed from a remote machine?</h2>

<p>The varlink command line tool, as well as some varlink language bindings offer the possibility to
connect to a service via a <code>bridge</code>.</p>


<ul>
  <li>Python:
<a href="https://varlink.org/python/#varlink.Client.new_with_bridge">varlink.Client.new_with_bridge()</a></li>
  <li>Rust:
<a href="https://docs.rs/varlink/4.0.0/varlink/struct.Connection.html#method.with_bridge">Connection::with_bridge()</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The bridge command normally is <code>ssh &lt;host&gt; varlink bridge</code>, calling <code>varlink bridge</code> on the
remote host. The <code>varlink bridge</code> command parses all method calls on stdin, queries the
<code>org.varlink.resolver</code> on the remote system for the interface address, connects to this address
and forwards all method calls matching the interface name to the local service on the remote machine.
It reads the replies and passes them back to stdout. Instead of <code>ssh</code> any other connection command
 could be used. Instead of <code>varlink bridge</code> any other utility, which offers an equal
 functionality, could be used.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-get-the-version-number-of-an-interface">How can I get the version number of an interface?</h2>

<p>Varlink interfaces do not have a version number, they only have a feature set described in detail by
the interface definition, which is part of the wire protocol.</p>

<p>If your interface has users, you should not break the interface, only extend it, never remove or
incompatibly change things which might be already in use. Clients can fully introspect a service and
figure out which features the interface supports; this is more expressive than any simple numbering
scheme. If you break the API or remove stuff, just release it with a new name, commonly done by adding
a number to the interface name, like <code>org.example.interface2</code>.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-extend-an-interface-in-a-backwards-compatible-way">How do I extend an interface in a backwards compatible way?</h2>

<p>Varlink does not use positional parameters or fixed-size objects in its interface definition or on the
 wire, all parameters are identified by their name and can be extended later.</p>

<p>Things like this are not needed:</p>
<pre><code>typedef struct {
       /* … */
       /*
        * Reserved space to allow possible future extensions without
        * breaking the ABI. You should not touch these, because the
        * names of these variables may change.
        */
       uint32_t reserved_int1;
       uint32_t reserved_int2;
       uint32_t reserved_int3;
       uint32_t reserved_int4;
} my_service_struct_foo;
</code></pre>

<p>Extending existing structures should be done via optional fields (nullable type, maybe). The result of
the methods, when passed parameters without the optional fields should be the same as in older
versions. Method parameters can be extended the same way. The expected behavior for omitted
fields/parameters should be documented. Removing fields, types, errors or methods are not backward
compatible and should be avoided.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-socket-activation-work">How does socket activation work?</h2>

<p>Varlink language bindings commonly implement the systemd socket activation protocol. The environment
of the started service will be augmented with the variables LISTEN_FDS, LISTEN_NAMES, LISTEN_PID.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/sd_listen_fds.html">Read more</a></p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-implement-exit-on-idle-for-my-service">How do I implement exit-on-idle for my service?</h2>

<p>Services can be started on-demand with socket activation. When there is no background task running and
no clients connected to the service, the service can decide to close the listening socket and exit. A
new connection from a client will activate the service again. Because varlink is strictly
point-to-point, there is no buffering involved and the service activator will queue all incoming
messages, exit-on-idle can be implemented in a race-free manner.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-restrict-the-access-to-my-service">How can I restrict the access to my service?</h2>

<p>The most commonly used method is to rely on the permissions of a UNIX socket in the file system.
Services which need a more fine-grained access control can check the connection credentials of a unix
socket and decide per call if they want to act on behalf of the client.
If varlink would be wrapped in GSS-API, e.g. kerberos tickets could be used for more fine grained
access control.</p>

<p>In this chapter we will introduce simple but useful basic widgets and explain the
widgets which we introduced earlier in more detail. All these widgets are really easy
to use. We have constructor functions with names which starts with "new" like
newButton(), we can add these widgets to containers, and connect them directly to
signals or map them to GActions. You should also study the C API documentation of
these simple widgets to learn about all the other functionality that is also
available, like provided functions, available signals or widget properties.  Remember
that GTK widgets build a class hierarchy so functionality may be provided by parent
classes.  For example the GtkCheckButton is a subclass of GtkToggleButton and both
are of course widgets, so you may have to consult all that API documentation to find
functions or properties that you may desire. Also consider using the devhelp tool to
navigate the C API docs. For the more advanced and complicated widgets like
GtkTreeView, GtkListView and GtkDrawingArea we will give only minimal examples in
this chapter to give you a basic feeling what they are and how they can be used.
GtkTreeView and GtkListView are powerfull widgets to display larger textual and other
data sets. And the GtkDrawingArea is a widget where we can draw arbitrary two
dimensional graphics by using drawing functions of the cairo graphics library. We can
use the GtkDrawingArea for pure display purpose, or we can combine it with user input
activities to create advanced CAD tools. One more advanced GTK widget is the
GtkGLArea which can be used to display three-dimensional OpenGL graphics.  But as
creating graphics with OpenGL is a wide area for which many whole books have been
written, we will not try to cover that topic in this book.</p>
<p>The GTK widgets can be grouped into container widgets which arrange other widgets
like GtkBox or GtkGrid, into mostly passive widgets for displaying data like the
GtkLabel, and into the active widgets which accept user input like GtkEntry. For an
overview you may visit the widget gallery page:</p>

<div>
<h3 id="_label">Label</h3>
<p>The GtkLabel is a simple widget that can display some text. The text can have
multiple lines when desired, can wrap automatically and can support style attributes
like italic or boldface. The label widget is mostly used to label other widgets or to
display some textual messages to the user.  GtkButtons use a label widgets to display
its text.  For the actual text display the pango library is used, which supports many
advanced text renderings like right to left text and many attributes like
strike-though, underline, overline (since pango v 1.46) and many more.  GtkLabels
like all GTK widgets support utf8 unicode text which allows display of glyphs of
exotic languages as well as a large range of symbols.</p>
<p>The GtkLabel is one of the simplest GTK widgets and the C API documentation should be
easy to understand and can be used in Nim straight forward:</p>

<div>
<h4 id="_properties">Properties</h4>
<p>GTK uses the concept of properties to set or modify the internal state of GTK widgets
or other entities.  For most properties GTK offers setter and getter functions which
we use when available, so we have not to deal with properties that often. But in some
cases it is necessary, so we will introduce the basics at this point already. GTK
properties have textual names like "wrap" or "gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme" and
a typed state like boolean true/false, integer states or states of other types. In C
code most often the function g_object_set() is used to set one or multiple
properties. That function uses multiple untyped arguments. As it is not type safe it
is not provided by gobject-introspection and is not available in most high level GTK
bindings including Nim. Instead we use g_object_set_property() called just
setProperty() to set single properties in Nim.  Unfortunately that procedure needs a
GValue as third parameter which makes it use a bit complicated.</p>
<p>The following example program defines a helper procedure called toBoolVal() to create
a GValue with matching type and content from a Nim bool value. We use the resulting
GValue to set the wrap property of our label and the
"gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme" property of our whole application. Both
properties expects a boolean GValue.</p>

<p>In our toBoolVal() proc we have to create a GType variable first. For this we can use
the typeFromName() proc to which we have to pass the correct GTK type name, or with
recent gintro versions we could use getType() procs like gBooleanGetType() directly.
Guessing the right name is not always easy — for string types we would have to use
gStringGetType() or typeFromName("gchararray"). With that GType we can first init() a
GValue variable and then set its value. GValues are used a lot in gtkListView and
GtkThreeView widgets, we will learn more about GTypes the GValue variables later when
we explain these widgets.  In the above example program we use the function
setProperty() two times. First we set the property
"gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme" for our whole application to true. To do that we
query the default settings with a call of getDefaultSettings() and then set that
boolean value. The result is that our whole app uses a dark color scheme when
available. The second use of setProperty(), again for a boolean variable, is to set
the "wrap" property of one of our label widgets. For this the label class provides
the function setWrap() which we generally would use. We used a GtkBox to arrange our
two labels vertically in our window. We will learn more details about the GtkBox
containers in the next section.</p>
<p>While GtkLabels are most of the time passive entities, they provide some signals like
"activate-link" and "move-cursor".  By default label text can not be copied to the
clipboard, but we can call setSelectable() on a label widget to make it selectable.
Then we can click with the mouse on the text, we can select all or part of the text
and the label widget will get a popup menu which pops up when we press the right
mouse button allowing to select and copy the label text to the clipboard. This can be
useful when a label displays messages which we may want to copy elsewhere.  One of
the many useful functions offered by labels is setEllipsize() which determines how
text not fitting into the available are is handled. That function is often used in
conjunction with setMaxWidhChars() or setWidhChars().  Our second example program
below displays some chess pieces using utf8 unicode glyphs, and an ordinary text
which is displayed in a small font and which is shortened by showing ellipsis when
the enclosing window is small. The label widget with the chess pieces is made
selectable, so you can copy the content into another window, maybe into an instance
of the the gedit text editor.</p>

<p>In both label texts we use html tags like &lt;big&gt; or &lt;small&gt; to modify the text
display. Currently we have to additional call setUseMarkup() on the label to tell it
that html tags should be used. We may expect that for the case that we use
setMarkup() that should be not necessary — maybe it is a bug of early GTK&nbsp;4
release? Modifying the label display with enclosed tags directly is convenient, but
restricted to only a few attributes. In the next section we will lean how we can use
XML UI files to do more advanced text customization.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_gtklabels_and_xml_ui_files">GtkLabels and XML UI files</h4>
<p>Earlier in this book we used already XML files to describe the structure of popup
menus.  And we said at the beginning of the book that GTK allows to declare the whole
GUI or parts of it with XML UI files which is then loaded by the GTK builder. Below
you can see such an XML UI file which describes a label and two buttons, which are
arranged into a GtkGrid widget.</p>

    <div><p>A colleague of mine has repeatedly called for some of the controllers in our project to be refactored. He says they're messy, but what I think he means is that they're hard to understand. At first glance they do seem complex yes but upon closer inspection:</p><ul>
<li>There are step-by-step instructions in the comments explaining what's going on.</li>
<li>Variable and method names are descriptive but not overly verbose.</li>
<li>The code is spaced, formatted and indented correctly.</li>
</ul><p>I can see why my colleague might see the code this way; it does have multiple concerns, but it came to be this way iteratively over the course of two years. Everything it does relates to a previously-defined requirement i.e. it does what it's supposed to. We also haven't made any changes to it for several months because it hasn't caused any bugs nor are there any major performance bottlenecks.</p><p>One common developer bias is that old code is bad. You've never heard anyone say the phrase "legacy code" without contempt in their tone. I <i>can</i> appreciate that sometimes old code doesn't conform to newer practices agreed on by a team. For example, legacy PHP code might use the now-deprecated PSR-2 standard, but the tech lead might want everyone to write PSR-12. But is this really a good enough reason to potentially jeopardise a piece of working functionality?</p><p>I think the reason old code is often seen this way is because it takes longer to remember. Developers yearn for clarity but if they're not immediately able to recall <a href="https://notoriousbfg.com/building-software-sharing-knowledge" target="_blank" title="Link: https://notoriousbfg.com/building-software-sharing-knowledge">under what circumstances some code was written</a> (in a few seconds or less), they only see ambiguity.</p><div id="posthaven_gallery[1659795]">

<p>Even when we talk about code, when we're able to recall previous conversations/decisions/motivations quickly, we can talk about it confidently and convey to others that we understand it well. Unfortunately saying, "I need five to ten minutes to refresh my memory of this" doesn't convey the same sense of confidence. Always prepare.</p><p>Part of the solution to reducing this "time to recall" is through better internal documentation. We use a tool like <a href="https://www.codestream.com/" target="_blank">Codestream</a> but I'll admit that context is not always captured; sometimes it's the "why" not the "what" that's relevant. In my opinion, good old-fashioned comments work best; I try to write mine like a numbered set of instructions. Of course you can also convey meaning with your git commit message.</p><p>The other part of the solution is to agree as a team under what circumstances code should be refactored. If your team collectively agrees that stable, well-documented code should be refactored, run.<br></p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    
<p>Compression is a trick that can be used to solve a load of problems. Often, your
tools will compress content transparently: most modern browsers ask for gzipped
HTTP payload, and some filesystems can be configured to compress blocks without
the user ever asking.</p>

<p>Outside of well known use cases, there are a variety of opportunities to improve
efficiency or save a load of money by leveraging compression. It’s useful to be
aware of common use cases, so you can take these opportunities when they arise.</p>



<p>As a recent example, my team were migrating logs from one Elasticsearch cluster
to another. While not quite Big Data™, this cluster had 10 billion log entries,
or some 60TB of raw JSON.</p>

<p>Having experience tackling long-running, large-scale migrations like this, you
want to build a process that allows you to ‘save game’ as frequently as
possible. This means you can build and run an export process, handling whatever
issues will occur (they will, I promise!), then move cleanly on-to the import
process. As with exports, your import process will also screw up: so it, too,
should be easily re-runnable.</p>

<p>As it is used across a load of GoCardless systems, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub">Google
Pub/Sub</a> is a natural fit for this problem.
Google’s marketing tagline even sounds like it was written to describe our
ideal, decoupled process:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pub/Sub is an asynchronous messaging service that decouples services that
produce events from services that process events.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Pub/Sub, you <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/publisher">publish messages to topics</a>. Each topic can
have many subscriptions, which <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/subscriber">consumers can pull messages
from</a>. In the most simple terms, the migration would:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Export logs from the origin cluster into a (per-index) Pub/Sub topic</li>
  <li>Configure the Pub/Sub subscriptions to retain events (set
<code>retain_acked_messages</code>, see: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview">Replaying and purging messages</a>)
so that we may replay them, if our import goes wrong</li>
  <li>Import logs by pulling messages from the topic subscriptions</li>
</ol>

<p>So, what’s this got to do with compression? Like most Cloud services, Pub/Sub
charges on usage, which means we’ll incur fees proportional to the data we’ll
push through the service.</p>

<p>These charges are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$40 per TiB delivered, applied to publish and subscribe</li>
  <li>Google Compute Engine network rates (we’ll ignore these, as they get complicated)</li>
  <li>Seek-related message storage, to retain our messages, at $0.27 per GiB-month</li>
</ul>

<p>In the best case where we import/export successfully on the first attempt (this
won’t, and did not happen), we’ll be charged <strong>2 x $40 x 60TB = $4,800 for
message delivery</strong>, as it will apply to both publish and subscribe. If we retain
our messages for 2 weeks while the migration is on-going, we’ll be charged <strong>0.5
x $0.27 x 60,000GB = $8,100 for message storage</strong>.</p>

<p>This leaves a <strong>lower-bound of $12,900 to perform the migration</strong>.</p>

<p>Now, GoCardless isn’t poor. And as a rule of thumb, you normally want to
optimise for engineering hours over infrastructure cost.</p>

<p>But if you can reduce cost with a minimal amount of effort, you should.</p>



<p>To this end, we made a small change to our migration tool (<code>elastic-toolbox</code>) to
support compression of the messages we published to Pub/Sub.</p>

<p>With error handling removed, this is the publish method, where we apply
compression after serialisation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Publish takes a message and publishes it to the Pub/Sub topic. If</span>
<span>// compression is enabled, the message payload is compressed, and the</span>

        <span>},</span>
    <span>})</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>nil</span>

<p>The compression itself is dead simple, and almost entirely observability code:</p>

<p>As our savings will be proportional to our compression ratio (compressed /
original bytes), we care a lot about how compressible our data is.</p>

<p>JSON logs are likely to be very compressible as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Logs share many of the JSON keys, which can be de-duplicated (<code>kubernetes.pod_name</code>)</li>
  <li>Values of common log fields might occur very often (<code>kubernetes.labels.namespace</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Using the modified <code>elastic-toolbox</code> to run an concurrent export of three
different indices, we can use the
<code>elastic_toolbox_export_pubsub_write_compression_ratio</code> Prometheus metric (see
the <code>compress</code> method above) to build a heatmap of compression ratios:</p>

<figure>
  <a href="https://snapshot.raintank.io/dashboard/snapshot/gHTtGvZh2hK67q03kIU4uJM3q4Sqek8p?orgId=2" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://blog.lawrencejones.dev/assets/images/compress-everything-ratio-heatmap.png" alt="Compressed bytes divided by original bytes, always less than 30%">
  </a>
  <figcaption>
    Compressed bytes / original bytes, always &lt;30%
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This heatmap shows that all messages compressed to <strong>at most 30% the original
size</strong>. When measured over our entire corpus of logs, we average at a <strong>~12%
compression ratio, meaning 1GiB of logs becomes just 120MiB.</strong></p>

<p>Our original bill of $12,900 has become 12% x $12,900 = $1,548.</p>

<p>This means <strong>we’ve saved about $11,500.</strong></p>

<p>Explore the data for yourself at this <a href="https://snapshot.raintank.io/dashboard/snapshot/gHTtGvZh2hK67q03kIU4uJM3q4Sqek8p?orgId=2" target="_blank">Raintank Snapshot: elastic-toolbox compression</a>.</p>



<p>The most obvious next step was to apply this to our logging pipeline all the
time. Given we ship container logs straight into Pub/Sub, pulling them out of a
subscription into Elasticsearch, we can easily write a
<a href="https://www.fluentd.org/">fluentd</a> filter that applies the same compression
strategy.</p>

<p>My colleague Ben put together an awesome dashboard to track how much we save,
which works out to be <strong>several thousand a month</strong>:</p>

<p>If you work in a Cloud environment, there are so many opportunities to save
money by compressing your data.</p>

<p>Beyond logs, another GoCardless example is a tool called
<a href="https://github.com/gocardless/draupnir">draupnir</a>. This service hosts copies of
our production databases for load testing and forensic analysis (query plan
prediction, etc). Google SSD storage costs $187 per TiB/month, which means every
copy of our <strong>5TB Postgres costs $1,000/month</strong>.</p>

<p>Draupnir might host several copies at a time, depending on the use cases. We can
save a load of money by enabling <a href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Compression">btrfs
compression</a> to
transparently compress the filesystem blocks, allowing us to use <strong>~70% less SSD
capacity</strong> than we may otherwise.</p>

<p>And if you thought compression was limited to cost savings, you’d be wrong!
Having suffered from occasional micro-outages when people ran large backfills or
built new database indexes, we solved the problem by enabling Postgres WAL
compression (see <a href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/postgresql-underused-features-wal-compression/">Postgres Underused Features: WAL Compression</a>,
or the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/runtime-config-wal.html">Postgres Write Ahead Log docs</a>).</p>

<p>The outages were caused by database operations creating a large amount of WAL
churn, where the replica would stall while writing the WAL to disk. By
compressing the WAL stream, we <strong>significantly reduced the IO spikes, allowing
the replica to handle the stream without issue</strong>.</p>

<p>There are more examples, but I think this paints a good picture.</p>



<p>Compression is a trade-off, a decision we make to trade CPU for another resource
that might be more expensive or less available. The value assigned to CPU,
memory, or network bandwidth continually changes, and you’ll need to make this
calculation on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>This post aimed to cover a scenario where the cost of compression, in both
compute resource and time-to-build, was significantly outweighed by the savings
it would make. Not all situations will have the same economics, but it takes a
few minutes of napkin maths to decide either way.</p>

<p>I hope this case study prompts consideration of compression outside of standard,
boring use-cases, and helps to find opportunities where you can apply it to your
own systems.</p>

<p>I will tell you a word, and you think of the first image that comes to your mind. Are you ready? Leader!</p>



<p>If you have thought of a white man, dressed in a perfectly fitting suit, you have thought about what most people think when they hear that word. But is that all there is for this word? Apart from the unconscious bias of race and gender, does it define leaders’ characteristics?</p>



<p>If we check the word ‘leader’ in the dictionary, we find:&nbsp;<em>“a person who guides or directs a group”.&nbsp;</em>That definition is so straightforward and clear that we often don’t question what makes a great technical leader. This article will dive deep into the requirements to become a great technical leader. We will understand the similarities and differences to non-tech leadership, and I hope this can guide you in your career.</p>



<h2>The first pillar: Teamwork</h2>

<p><span>Technical leadership doesn’t exist isolated; some other type of leadership always accompanies it.</span></p>



<p>An abundance of developers thinks their managers are obsolete dinosaurs who don’t know how to write a single code line. Yes, they may be right in some cases, but that doesn’t mean their managers cannot execute the tasks at hand. Let me explain!</p>



<p><span>The most important organizational factor for a company is to make sure they never lose sight of strategic decisions.</span> The bigger the company, the more substantial the term ‘strategy’ becomes. Enterprise strategy is the only way companies can guarantee employees are walking in the same direction and working for the same goals. Once the top management team decides which will be their primary goals, they are passed down to every team hierarchically, ensuring it reaches every single soul.</p>



<p>Managers are responsible for making sure their segment of the company is under control strategically, but not tactically, and there is where technical leadership shines. The fundamental responsibility of tech leadership roles is to make sure the manager’s strategic definitions are going in the right direction and that projects are executed correctly without hurting any of the premises defined by the board of directors.&nbsp;</p>



<p><span>The quintessence of technical leadership success is to work with your business partners as if you were a single entity in this universe. If you don’t do that, you will be doomed, I promise.</span></p>



<h2><strong>The second pillar: Knowledge</strong></h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="427" src="https://douglasrocha.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/matthew-feeney-Nwkh-n6l25w-unsplash.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://douglasrocha.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/matthew-feeney-Nwkh-n6l25w-unsplash.jpg 640w, https://douglasrocha.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/matthew-feeney-Nwkh-n6l25w-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure>



<p>You have become a technical leader. Congratulations! This promotion means you are a ‘knowledge reference’ to your peers. While this may seem counter-intuitive, <span>it means you now have way more pressure to keep yourself updated on computer science’s latest trends.</span></p>



<p>Let’s be sincere and frank here: people become more suspicious of you when you cannot clarify their doubts and help them solve their difficulties. There will be times where you will be challenged by developers both directly and indirectly, as they will try to check your boundaries and understand if you’re ready for that position. If you can answer those provocations politely and with strong fundamentals, you succeed at gaining developers’ trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Answer challenges appropriately and remember that if you respond in a non-polite way, you fail. You fail both because you have misbehaved and because you are there to support people. It is OK not to know things, make sure you write it down and be ready for answering the question the next day. Never say phrases such as: “Oh, you don’t know that? What a shame! Let me show you how to do that right”, that is typical of lousy knowledge leadership.</p>



<p><span>Never doubt your authority, but make sure you recognize your ignorance. Keep working on what you don’t know in a planned and organized fashion. Technology evolves fast, and without study planning, you will get obsolete fast too.</span></p>



<p>Another critical point is that <span>technical leadership implies that you will have to coach and help your peers think about problems in new ways.</span> But to delve into how to do that, we need to talk about the next pillar: communication.</p>



<h2><strong>The third pillar: Communication</strong></h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="427" src="https://douglasrocha.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pavan-trikutam-71CjSSB83Wo-unsplash.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://douglasrocha.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pavan-trikutam-71CjSSB83Wo-unsplash.jpg 640w, https://douglasrocha.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pavan-trikutam-71CjSSB83Wo-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure>



<p>Just like non-technical leaders, you will be responsible for communicating your ideas, and your action plans to execute each one of them. You will receive several invitations to present ideas to various people, such as clients, managers, developers, boards of directors, etc. But what differs from the regular communication of business leads? Well, a lot!</p>



<p>The first thing you have to understand is that the higher you go in your leadership career, the fewer people will understand the words you use. The more you know, the greater your vocabulary and the attention you will give to the definitions you use; hence you can’t talk as you normally would. You have to put a lot of effort to talk using less technical vocabulary.&nbsp;</p>



<p><span>I think this exercise applies well to this case, which helps techies explain challenging concepts in a very accessible format:&nbsp;<em><u>“How would you explain X to five years old with the fewer words possible?”</u></em>.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p>From my personal experience, I can tell you that developers live a very pressuring moment where technology novelties emerge every day. The learning pace they need to maintain in their careers is hard, which gives origin to the famous imposter syndrome.&nbsp;</p>



<p><span>The most important lesson I’ve learnt is that to motivate developers, the most efficient method is to help them learn new concepts and abilities</span>.&nbsp;That stern necessity to continually learn new things is the most significant pain in their lives. When you allow them to ease that pain, you start a genuine mentorship relationship that is exceptional for them and augment their loyalty and desire to work.</p>



<p><span>To create a safe learning environment for developers, you need to want that: genuinely!</span>&nbsp;Otherwise, you will cause questions and ideas to become threats. Developers will start to judge each others’ words, and you will create an oppressive environment.</p>



<p>It is harder for technical leaders to think of people first, but the truth is that no matter where you work, the labour output will always be produced directly or indirectly by people. But how can we excel at guiding a group of people?</p>



<p>First, you have to understand that almost every company oscillates into more relaxed and more challenging moments. The lower you go into the company’s hierarchy, the more difficulty you will find to maintain resiliency.&nbsp;</p>



<p><span>Be positive! The world is a constant duality of good and bad aspects of everything. Always choose to see the positive elements of every situation!</span>&nbsp;You have the choice to look at things as opportunities, no matter how hard they are, it means people will learn new things in the process. Doing that is key to developing an inspirational communication style that motivates your followers and allows them to ease their uncertainties.</p>



<p>Remember that on the other side of all communication media, there are people. Demonstrate consideration and understand that everyone has feelings and personal lives, ambitions and dreams. It never hurts to acknowledge their achievements or ideas to improve work quality. Remember to compliment others when they do outstanding work, and teach them the lessons you’ve learnt to become a technological leader. They might want that too.</p>



<p><span>The most important concept here is: Be real! You are not a technological machine. When you act genuinely, you will perform accordingly: People first, then comes technology.</span></p>



<h2><strong>The fourth pillar: Vision</strong></h2>



<figure><ul><li><figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="427" src="https://douglasrocha.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/karsten-wurth-rafblRbne3o-unsplash.jpg" alt="An image of a road suggesting long-term vision" data-id="791" data-full-url="https://douglasrocha.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/karsten-wurth-rafblRbne3o-unsplash.jpg" data-link="https://douglasrocha.me/?attachment_id=791" srcset="https://douglasrocha.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/karsten-wurth-rafblRbne3o-unsplash.jpg 640w, https://douglasrocha.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/karsten-wurth-rafblRbne3o-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure></li></ul></figure>



<p>The last, but not least important pillar for a great technical leader is vision. It is expected from you to understand the direction that the company is going in the short and long-term (5+ years). This pillar is only possible when you accomplish all the previous steps to become a great technical leader.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you don’t have excellent&nbsp;communication&nbsp;with the&nbsp;business leads,&nbsp;you will never understand the company’s&nbsp;strategical direction. If you have poor contact with the developers, either because you&nbsp;lack knowledge&nbsp;or&nbsp;treat them poorly, you won’t have support to execute your projects. <span>This paragraph shows how important it is to build the previous steps before you go into this one</span>, so let’s dive into what we mean by vision.</p>



<p>As we said before, the higher you go into the company’s hierarchy, the more critical the word strategy becomes. An understanding of the long-term plan is the only way you can excel in technical leadership roles. To suggest new features and products, you have to communicate with business leaders, and unless you talk the same language as them, you won’t be able to sell your ideas.</p>



<p><span>It doesn’t mean that you cannot criticize the strategical plan of the company!</span>&nbsp;Remember you are a technical person, if business leaders make decisions that go against technology’s core principles, you have to express your opinions, so don’t be afraid to do that.&nbsp;<span>Make sure you are polite and build your arguments with analytically profound details.</span> The larger the amount numbers, graphs, and projections, the easier it will be to explain your criticisms.</p>



<p><span>When you achieve the enlightenment of where the company is going, you become the technical glue.</span> When managers fail to explain the vision, you will be responsible for guaranteeing the tactical execution of projects is going in the right direction, so you must pass on the vision to the technical team.&nbsp;<span>The big picture is essential because it allows us to create a sense of unity and progress</span>, enabling creating a healthy development team culture.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><h5>December 31, 2020</h5><h2 id="intro">Intro
<a href="#intro">#</a></h2><p>My previous post <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline">Object Detection at 1840 FPS</a> made some readers wonder who would need to detect anything at 1840 FPS, but my good friend and “performance geek” <a href="https://tanelpoder.com/">Tanel Põder</a> had a different response:</p><blockquote><p>Nice article, I wonder if you could get to 2000 FPS?</p></blockquote><p>Challenge accepted.</p><p>This article is a deep dive into the techniques needed to get there. We will rewrite Pytorch model code, perform <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT/tree/master/tools/onnx-graphsurgeon">ONNX graph surgery</a>, optimize <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT/tree/master/plugin/batchedNMSPlugin">a TensorRT plugin</a> and finally we’ll quantize the model to bits (to 8 bit precision, that is). We will also keep track of divergence from full-precision accuracy with the COCO2017 validation dataset.</p><p>Code supporting this article can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/pbridger/tensorrt-ssd300-8bit-quantized">github.com/pbridger/tensorrt-ssd300-8bit-quantized</a>.</p><p>A quick preview of the final results:</p><div><p>

<label for="tabs-Preview-3">All Results</label></p></div><p>So how do we get to 2000 FPS? My previous post already brought the big guns — a <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline">TensorRT-optimized DeepStream pipeline</a> was needed to hit 1840 FPS running on 2x Nvidia 2080Ti cards. This time we will abandon TorchScript and <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk">DeepStream</a>, and we’ll put in the work to fully embrace TensorRT model compilation and execution.</p><h3 id="on-optimizing-arbitrary-numbers">On Optimizing Arbitrary Numbers
<a href="#on-optimizing-arbitrary-numbers">#</a></h3><p>1840 FPS, 2000 FPS, 2530 FPS — there is nothing special about any of these numbers, they are all hardware, resolution and model dependent. These optimization articles are about the practical usage of cutting-edge tools and techniques to achieve ambitious project goals or unlock cost savings.</p><p>Tuning a pipeline for throughput maximizes hardware utilization and efficiency in the datacenter, and it allows us to deploy larger models or more complex systems in compute-limited contexts (think IoT, embedded and mobile). It’s also just fun to explore the limits of powerful tools!</p><p>Let’s get started with a baseline from the <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline">previous article</a>.</p><h2 id="stage-0-deepstream-baseline">Stage 0: DeepStream Baseline
<a href="#stage-0-deepstream-baseline">#</a></h2><p>To recap, we got peak throughput with the DeepStream pipeline by using a hybrid model — a TensorRT-optimized SSD300 front-end with postprocessing code running in TorchScript in the libtorch runtime. All processing on GPU, of course. Here’s a reminder of some of the throughput milestones from the last article:</p><p>Why did we need TorchScript? Several common object-detection postprocessing operations — including thresholding and non-max-suppression (NMS) — can’t be seamlessly exported from Pytorch to ONNX and compiled with TensorRT. Leaving these operations in TorchScript allowed us to get great performance without rewriting any model code or creating TensorRT plugins.</p><p>Looking at the performance trace from Nsight Systems, we can see the TorchScript postprocessing comes in just under 10 ms. When we compiled the inference step with TensorRT we saw around 43 ms of TorchScript turn into about 16 ms equivalent processing — so anything executing in TorchScript seems ripe for optimization.</p><p>Here’s what it looked like in Nsight Systems:</p><a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/tensorrt-object-detection-quantized/images/ds_80pc_tensorrt_hacked_ds_two_batch.png"><figure><img src="https://paulbridger.com/posts/tensorrt-object-detection-quantized/images/ds_80pc_tensorrt_hacked_ds_two_batch_hudc758a7e69d7157937e6a1d7caab6946_489589_896x520_fill_box_top_2.png" width="896" height="520"><figcaption><small></small></figcaption></figure></a><p>Let’s eliminate the TorchScript postprocessing and get the entire model running end-to-end in TensorRT.</p><h2 id="stage-1-end-to-end-tensorrt">Stage 1: End-to-End TensorRT
<a href="#stage-1-end-to-end-tensorrt">#</a></h2><p>The baseline Pytorch SSD300 model (including postprocessing) cannot be easily compiled with TensorRT for several reasons, all of which involve missing (or impossible) support for tensor operations:</p><ul><li><p>Subscripted tensor assignment results in <code>ScatterND</code> (indexed assignment) nodes in ONNX.</p></li><li><p>Score thresholding uses a mask operation, which cannot be expressed in the fixed-dimension world of TensorRT.</p></li><li><p>Torchvision’s batched non-max suppression (NMS) operation has no exact equivalent in TensorRT.</p></li></ul><p>We can fix the first by tweaking model code and re-exporting to ONNX, but to fix the other issues we’ll have to modify the ONNX computational graph — replacing these operations with a TensorRT plugin.</p><h3 id="11-rewriting-subscripted-tensor-assignment">1.1 Rewriting Subscripted Tensor Assignment

Previous <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19590391/" target="_blank"><u>scientific studies</u></a> have shown that swearing can actually increase a person's pain tolerance. But in polite company, we may try and substitute those swears with a similar-sounding word.</p>  <p>Robertson and her colleagues at the Swear Lab at Keele University in the U.K. wanted to understand what it was about swear words that has this analgesic effect on our pain, and if those fake swears are convincing substitutes for our brains.</p>  <p>Their research is published in the journal <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00723/full"><u>Frontiers in Psychology</u></a>.</p>  <h2>'Fouch' and 'twizpipe' just won't cut it</h2>  <p>To find out how swearing affects pain tolerance, Robertson and her colleague, psychologist <a href="https://www.keele.ac.uk/psychology/people/richardstephens/"><u>Richard Stephens</u></a>, invented two fake swear words, 'fouch' and 'twizpipe.'&nbsp;</p>  <p>"We hypothesized that perhaps 'fouch' might help in the same way that swear words help because it sounds very similar, it's got that 'FFF-CHH' sound at the end," said Robertson, a post doctoral research assistant&nbsp;in the department of experimental psychology at the University of Oxford.</p>  <p>She adds that 'twizpipe' was chosen because it represented another hypothesis about why swears work —&nbsp;because they&nbsp;sound&nbsp;funny.</p>  <p>"There was an idea that perhaps swear words help because they're hilarious, and they help distract you in that way."</p>  <p>Robertson and Stephens then had 92 participants immerse their hands in a tub of ice cold water for as long as they could — which is a harmless, but painful experience. These participants were told to randomly repeat one of four words every three seconds - either a conventional swear word (in this case, the familiar 'f-word'), a neutral word (the word 'solid') and the words 'fouch' and 'twizpipe.' Throughout, the participants gave ratings of their pain perception, emotion, humour, and distraction levels, as well as had their hearts monitored.</p>    <blockquote><span><span><svg version="1.1" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" width="30px" height="25px" viewBox="0 0 52.157 39.117" enable-background="new 0 0 52.157 39.117" space="preserve"><g><g><path fill="000000" d="M22.692,10.113c-5.199,1.4-8.398,4.4-8.398,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.6,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.4,3.4,3.4,6.602   c0,3.799-3.4,6.799-7.4,6.799c-4.6,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z M45.692,10.113   c-5.199,1.4-8.399,4.4-8.399,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.601,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.399,3.4,3.399,6.602c0,3.799-3.399,6.799-7.399,6.799   c-4.601,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z"></path></g></g><g display="none"><g display="inline"> <path fill="000000" d="M6.648,29.759c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.399-3.4-3.399-6.6   c0-3.801,3.399-6.801,7.399-6.801c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z M29.648,29.759   c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.401-3.4-3.401-6.6c0-3.801,3.401-6.801,7.401-6.801   c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z"></path></g></g></svg>Swearing gives you that little bit of a jolt, it helps your heart beat faster, it helps your respiration rate increase, and so it gives you that power, that adrenaline to get through a stressful period.<svg focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" width="23px" height="22px" viewBox="0 0 52.157 39.117" enable-background="new 0 0 52.157 39.117" space="preserve"><g display="none"><g display="inline"><path fill="000000" d="M22.692,10.113c-5.199,1.4-8.398,4.4-8.398,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.6,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.4,3.4,3.4,6.602   c0,3.799-3.4,6.799-7.4,6.799c-4.6,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z M45.692,10.113   c-5.199,1.4-8.399,4.4-8.399,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.601,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.399,3.4,3.399,6.602c0,3.799-3.399,6.799-7.399,6.799   c-4.601,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z"></path></g></g><g><g><path fill="000000" d="M6.648,29.759c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.399-3.4-3.399-6.6   c0-3.801,3.399-6.801,7.399-6.801c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z M29.648,29.759   c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.401-3.4-3.401-6.6c0-3.801,3.401-6.801,7.401-6.801   c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z"></path></g></g></svg></span><cite>- Olly Robertson,&nbsp; Keele University</cite></span></blockquote>    <p>The new 'fake' swear words had the exact same effect on pain threshold and pain tolerance as the neutral word.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="content"><p>As we start a new decade, it’s a good time to reflect on expectations for the next 10 years. Tyler thinks the Great Stagnation <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/12/why-did-the-great-stagnation-end.html">could be ending</a>. Caleb sees <a href="https://www.agglomerations.tech/cracks-in-the-great-stagnation/">cracks</a>. Noah expresses <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/techno-optimism-for-the-2020s">techno-optimism</a>. In this post, my aim is not to predict an end or non-end to stagnation. Rather, it is to think through the particulars of how technology could evolve over the next decade. Then we can assess separately whether we should consider it the Roaring 20s or the Boring 20s.</p><p>What would constitute an end to the Great Stagnation? Any precise cutoff will be arbitrary, but for the sake of discussion, let’s say sustained growth in <a href="https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/indicators-data/total-factor-productivity-tfp/">utilization-adjusted total factor productivity</a> of 2 percent per year. By comparison, mean utilization-adjusted TFP growth from 1947 through 1972 was 2.1 percent. Since 2005, it has been 0.17 percent. (Note: it is important to use the utilization-adjusted series, as this corrects for the business cycle.)</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/a7a8a1d9e4c4d1050c2902966a316436559074f1/cd6b6/img/tfp.png" alt="Total factor productivity in the U.S. since 1947" title="Total factor productivity in the U.S. since 1947"></p><p>Whatever your cutoff for TFP growth, one of my convictions is that scientific breakthroughs alone are not enough to drive an end to the Great Stagnation. TFP only budges when new technologies are adopted at scale, and generally this means products, not just science. Science lays critical groundwork for new technology, but after all the science is done, much work remains. Someone must shepherd the breakthrough to the product stage, where it can actually affect TFP. This means building businesses, surmounting regulatory obstacles, and scaling production.</p><p>With that caveat firmly in mind, what will the next decade bring in terms of meaningful technological change? Here’s what I’m watching.</p><h2 id="biotech-and-health">Biotech and health</h2><p>We are coming off a huge win: two new mRNA COVID vaccines, conceived and brought to market in less than a year. The ability to encode and deploy arbitrary mRNA in our bodies sure seems like a game changer—it allows us to essentially program our cells to make whatever proteins we want. In the case of the COVID vaccines, the vaccine payload instructs our cells to make the coronavirus spike protein, which our immune system then learns to attack. Bert Hubert has a <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/">fascinating write-up</a> of the “code” in the vaccine.</p><p>Bringing a brand new vaccine to market in less than a year—using a never-before-applied-in-humans-at-scale technology no less—is a world record, but it could have been even faster. As David Wallace-Wells <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/12/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-design.html">emphasizes</a>, Moderna’s vaccine was designed by January 13. We had it the whole time. Some delay was necessary to determine effective dosing. Some further regulatory delay may have been warranted to ensure the vaccine was safe and to ascertain its efficacy. But as Wallace-Wells indicates, the regulatory outcome was never really in doubt. “None of the scientists I spoke to for this story were at all surprised by either outcome,” he writes. “All said they expected the vaccines were safe and effective all along.”</p><p>What should we make of the fact that all of the scientists knew all along that Moderna’s vaccine would work? The question in my mind is: what other mRNA treatments do we have the whole time? What if I told you Moderna has an <a href="https://www.poz.com/article/experimental-hiv-vaccine-stimulates-production-neutralizing-antibodies">HIV vaccine candidate</a>? HIV lacks SARS-CoV-2’s telltale spike protein and thus may prove a more challenging foe—but don’t you wonder, if we treated the problem with real urgency, whether new mRNA technology could wipe out the AIDS epidemic this decade? I do.</p><p>And mRNA technology can be deployed against more than just viruses. Both Moderna and BioNTech have personalized vaccine candidates targeting cancer. Although called a “cancer vaccine,” the treatment is only administered once the subject has cancer—it isn’t preventative. The companies use an algorithm to analyze the genetic sequences of the tumor and the patient’s healthy cells and predict which molecules could be used to generate a strong immune response against the cancer. “I was actually witnessing the cancer cells shrinking before my eyes,” <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03072-8">said</a> Brad Kremer, a melanoma patient who received the BioNTech treatment. So let’s milk mRNA technology for all it’s worth this decade. It can save us from more than just a pandemic.</p><p>What about CRISPR? It is a great example of a technology that has not yet made a meaningful economic contribution. Although the technique for editing DNA was discovered in 2012—and a Nobel Prize was awarded to its two discoverers this year—no treatment using CRISPR has been approved outside of clinical trials. So far, its impact has been limited to making researchers more productive—not a bad thing, to be sure, but not close to CRISPR’s full potential. As trials progress, however, I do think some CRISPR treatments will come online in the next few years, especially those targeting genetic disorders that we have very limited means of otherwise treating.</p><p>DeepMind’s <a href="https://medium.com/cgo-benchmark/deepminds-protein-folding-solution-what-just-happened-279d32e8d0f">protein-folding breakthrough</a> signals a promising decade for the science of proteomics. Most directly, being able to predict protein shapes will enable us to discover drugs more rapidly. Buuuut, because drug trials take many years, we might expect this technology not to really be felt by the general public until the 2030s.</p><p>What DeepMind’s achievement indicates to me the most is that machine learning is actually useful. This might seem obvious, but consider: most applications of machine learning so far—excluding autonomous vehicles, which have themselves not really arrived yet—are toys. I love watching AlphaZero crush Stockfish on YouTube, but chess is literally a game. GPT-3 produced some fun demos. AlphaFold heralds something different—non-toy superhuman performance is now here, and I am interested to see what else it can do. Aside from the aforementioned AVs, I expect it to be applied widely in other areas of biology. Again, it will take a long time for the breakthroughs to trickle down into products, but at least the 2030s should be sick. I mean, not sick. Healthy.</p><p>Let’s talk about life extension, one of my favorite biotech topics. 2020 was a big year for the Conboy Lab at Berkeley, which proved that all the weird past findings about “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabiosis">young blood</a>” extending life were not actually due to any elixir in the blood of children (thank goodness). Rather, the rejuvenating aspects of young blood experiments were due to the dilution of harmful factors in old blood. By mechanically removing plasma and replacing it with saline and enough albumin to replace what was taken out, they diluted aged blood factors in both mice and humans and were able to <a href="https://www.aging-us.com/article/103418/text#fulltext">rejuvenate germ layer tissues</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-020-00297-8">improve cognition by reducing neuroinflammation</a>.</p><p>These findings are exciting not only because they represent a scientific advance in understanding aging, but also because they herald the first real anti-aging product that could come to market. Therapeutic plasma exchange is FDA-approved (not for aging, but for a bunch of other conditions). I imagine there remain prohibitions on advertising that it can add years to your life, but it is safe, and a doctor can prescribe it off label. It’s also cheap. An automated plasmapheresis machine—which lets you do treatment after treatment—can be bought online for under $3,000. That is less than the cost of a single transfusion of young blood sold by the startup <a href="https://www.ambrosiaplasma.com/">Ambrosia</a>. How long until someone opens a clinic offering plasma dilution? I bet someone tries it in 2021. If it works, people will get over the weirdness, and it could be commonplace by 2030.</p><p>Another longevity product that is about to get hot: aging clocks based on DNA methylation or proteomics. Do you want to know how biologically old you are? Today, for a few hundred dollars, you can get a test that will tell you. As these tests become better and cheaper, self-experimenters are going to have a field day. Doing before-and-after aging tests, anyone who can get their hands on human growth hormone could replicate the protocol used by <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acel.13028">Fahy et al.</a> to rejuvenate the thymus. As the thymus is a critical element of the immune system, decline of which is a critical factor in aging, this is non-trivial rejuvenation. The Fahy study found that 12 months of treatment created about 2.5 years of epigenetic rejuvenation, with results accelerating in the last quarter of the trial.</p><p>There is a lot more in the <a href="https://www.lifespan.io/road-maps/the-rejuvenation-roadmap/">Rejuvenation Roadmap</a>—dozens of possible life-extending treatments are at various stages of development. There’s a good chance a few senolytic drugs will be approved by the end of the decade. As I noted <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/12/30/anti-aging-research-health-care-spending-biden/">yesterday at Fortune</a>, we spend less than 1% of the NIH budget on aging biology—we should raise that by a lot.</p><p>Unlike others, I am not-so-bullish on metformin. It does seem to reduce all-cause mortality in Americans, but it may do so because <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/met.2018.0105">88% of Americans are metabolically unhealthy</a>. If you are one of the 12%, and you should strive to be, I don’t think metformin will do much for you.</p><p>One final biotech observation: every year, the Apple Watch gets a new health-related sensor. This year it was blood oxygen, pretty good for detecting if you might have COVID! Fast forward to 2030 and wearables will have at least 10 more health-related sensors than they do today. Some no-brainers are body temperature, blood pressure, and blood glucose sensors. What will the other 7 be? At some point, it becomes possible to replace a lot of primary care with continuous monitoring. A few smart algorithms to provide simple medical advice could improve population-level health without much cost. More data could also yield faster, more accurate, and of course more remote diagnoses when you do have to see a doctor.</p><p>There is a lot in biotech that is promising right now, but in more than any other field, it is important not to be seduced by the sexy headlines showing rapid scientific progress. Don’t get complacent. Biology is proceeding faster than medical productivity because a lot of the wonderful discoveries are not being translated into approved treatments and products at a decent rate. Let’s salute and cheer for the discoveries, but spare many thoughts for the entrepreneurs trying to bring treatments to market.</p><h2 id="energy">Energy</h2><p>The 2010s were the …</p></article></div>

  <article>
	<header>
		
		<time date="2020-12-22">December 2020</time>
	</header>

		<p>
		My stack requires no maintenance, has perfect Lighthouse scores, will never have any security vulnerability, is based on open standards, is portable, has an instant dev loop, has no build step and… will outlive any other stack.
		</p>
		<p>
		It’s not LAMP, Wordpress, Rails, MEAN, Jamstack... I don’t do CSR (Client-side rendering), SSR (Server Side Rendering), SSG (Static Site Generation)...
		</p>
		<p>
		My stack is <b>HTML+CSS</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
		And because my sources are in git, pushed to GitHub, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> is my host.
		</p>
		<p>
		Of course, I’m being a bit provocative here. I should rather say that, for some specific use cases, I concluded that to get top performances and to guatantee long term support, HTML+CSS was the best choice, instead on relying on technologies currently more popular. Because I’m done rewriting my site every couple of years.
		</p>

		<h3>Why HTML+CSS?</h3>
		<p>
		It all started with <a href="https://labs.steren.fr/">a blog</a>, that I was hosting on Wordpress.com (which is "Wordpress-as-a-Service", because the last thing I want to do is administer a Wordpress installation on my own server). I <strong>paid</strong> Wordpress.com to do one job: host my blog. And one day I looked at its sources and Lighthouse scores:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="https://blog.steren.fr/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/wordpress-sources.png" alt="Sources of my Wordpress.com blog, showing a lot of inlined unreadable scripts">
			<figcaption>Sources of my Wordpress.com blog, what is all this?</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<figure>
			<img src="https://blog.steren.fr/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/wordpress-lighthouse.png" alt="Lighthouse scores of my Wordpress.com blog, showing 19/100 for Performance">
			<figcaption>Lighthouse score of my blog hosted on Wordpress.com</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
		What have we done?
		</p>
		<p>
		Sure, these are the problems of one specific blogging platform. I’m pretty sure others are better, at least in terms of performance. But isn’t there something fundamentally wrong if displaying a short text with images takes seconds, loads countless render-blocking scripts, and has unreadable sources?
		</p>
		<p>
		My requirements were:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>performance</li>
			<li>simplicity</li>
			<li>long long term support</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		It was time to say goodbye to Wordpress. I didn’t need 99% of its features anyway. Other blogging platforms didn’t meet expectations either (I seriously have no idea why so many people publish on Medium… behind a login wall). I looked at static site generators like Jekyll, Hugo, 11ty, but all of these require tooling installed, have a build step and will ultimately need some updates or be abandonned by their maintainer. What if we also get rid of these?
		</p>
		<p>
		The best tool is no tool, the best build step is no build step, the best update is no update. HTML gives us all that, and more.
		</p>

		</figure>

		<h3>What is the HTML+CSS stack good for?</h3>
		<p>
		Let’s first differentiate between what I call a web <em>page</em> and a web <em>app</em>: The goal of a web <em>page</em> is to serve content, on the other hand, the goal of a web <em>app</em> is to enable the user to perform interactive tasks. Of course, there are in-betweens, often in the form of content that might need customization depending on the logged in user and content that might allow some interactions.
		</p>
		<p>
		HTML+CSS fits the web <em>page</em> use case. Wow, what a revelation! It might seem obvious, but it seems we’ve all forgotten this these days. HTML+CSS does not fit the web <em>app </em>use case, or any in between.
		</p>
		<p>
		We said a web <em>page</em> serves content, but let’s dive into more concrete use cases:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Product / Company / Business landing page and marketing sites</li>
			<li>Personal portfolio / bio</li>
			<li>Blog</li>
			<li>Documentation</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>How to develop for HTML+CSS?</h3>
		<p>
		Authoring a pure HTML+CSS site can be done in any text editor, in any environment (any desktop OS, any smartphone, or even directly using GitHub’s single file editor) and previewed by simply opening the file in any browser.
		</p>
		<p>
		Keep the HTML of every page minimal and semantic. First, because there is no need for countless of &lt;div&gt;, but then because it makes sources more readable and easier to edit. See for example the <a href="https://github.com/steren/blog/blob/master/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/index.html">HTML sources of this page</a>: a total of 150 lines, 100 lines are for the content, the rest is metadata and page structure, nothing extra. 
		</p>
		<p>
		For consistency, all pages that need to share the same style can point to the same CSS file. This avoids  duplication when it comes to styling (but note that loading this file creates an extra HTTP request, which could be avoided if style was inlined).
		</p>
		<p>
		When not cluttered with unnecessary scripts, divs or classes, I have no issue writing HTML directly. Yes, the paragraph tags are a bit annoying and distracting, but proper indentation and syntax highlighting mitigate this.
		<br>
		Sometimes, for drafting long blog articles, I’m working in Google Docs, and when I’m happy, export the content to clean HTML using an add-on. Google Docs is awesome for collaboration, with powerful suggestions and commenting system. That’s ideal for the “draft” phase. 
		<br>
		Because all content is in git, final review and approval can be done via GitHub pull requests.
		</p>
		<p>
		When I publish a new page, I need to link to it manually from the index page. I’m OK with that. It’s done in one line. It also allows me to have more control over when I want the page to be “published”.
		</p>
		<p>
		I don't need to pay for custom themes, I have complete freedom in the style and layout of my site.
		I can embed anything I want without being restricted by the choice of the hosting platform: SVG images, 3D models, interactive JS experiences. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Creating a new page requires to clone an existing one.
		So... if I don’t use any templating system, how do I update my header, footer or nav? Well, simply by using the ”Replace in files” feature of any good text editor. They don’t need frequent updates anyway. The benefits of using a templating system is not worth the cost of introducing the tooling it requires.
		</p>
		
		<h3>In conclusion</h3>
		<p>
		You don’t need  Wordpress, or Hugo to put a blog online, or Angular, React or Next.js to put a web page online. Raw HTML and CSS do the job.
		</p>
		<p>
		That being said, you’ll need to pick up some tooling or framework if you want to build a web app or add more interactivity or customization to your web pages. And for that, I’m very glad to see that frameworks now seem to be prioritizing performance, notably by prioritizing serving the content first and leveraging caching whenever possible. The era of “download 5MB of JS first and then download content from athe REST API” seems to be over for content web pages. (I personally think it’s still OK to do so for web apps, as the user’s intent and expectations are different).
		</p>
		<p>
		Is the “HTML+CSS only” approach a bit extreme? A bit, it’s basically saying “all software is terrible, how can I minimize my dependencies on software”. Web standards are a model of backward compatibility. I’m pretty confident that my web pages written in raw HTML+CSS will have no issue being accessed and authored 10 years from now, without me having to do anything.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remote work is on the rise, the economy is on a decline and businesses are re-structuring themselves around what many consider the new normal. Increasingly more organisations are opening themselves up to the possibility of working remotely beyond just the temporary measure in the fight against COVID-19. Many begin to see remote work as not only a necessary consequence, but rather as a new opportunity to diversify their workforce, increase employee productivity and cut some cost. The biggest cost saving obviously comes from office space, and not just in terms of raw square footage but also in location. When previously companies had to boast huge HQs in expensive areas, now they can spread themselves thinner across more affordable cities. Another big cost saving can come from employee salaries. A more distributed workforce and more work from home opportunities will inevitably mean a bigger talent pool competing for the same open positions, effectively giving employers a bigger choice.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to existing employees' salaries the direction taken by big tech companies couldn't be of starker contrast. Companies like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/21/zuckerberg-50percent-of-facebook-employees-could-be-working-remotely.html">Facebook or Twitter</a> have made it clear that employees who choose to relocate to more affordable cities can expect big cuts to their existing salary whereas companies like <a href="https://redditblog.com/2020/10/27/evolving-reddits-workforce/">Reddit announced that they won't reduce the salary of any of their 600 US workers</a> regardless of where they live.</p>
<p>These recent announcements have revived a <a href="https://www.helpscout.com/blog/remote-employee-compensation/">long standing debate</a> around the topic of <a href="https://www.nityesh.com/equal-pay-for-equal-work-at-a-remote-company/">equal pay for equal work</a>. Before COVID-19 <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/02/28/why-we-pay-local-rates/">GitLab has already sparked a lot of controversy</a> around the concept of "cost of living" adjusted salaries. At GitLab two engineers who perform the exact same work could get vastly differently compensated based on where they live. It doesn't require a lot of imagination to understand that such policies can alienate a lot of good people and further contribute to the perception of an ever growing inequality gap. Personally I find cost of living adjusted salaries very problematic as they deflect from the real market forces which come into play. Those should be a decent minimum living wage and the forces of demand &amp; supply. If someone is a professional in a niche market, a rare specialist in a scientific field or an exceptionally sought after engineer then cost of living should have no say in determining their pay. Those so called knowledge workers are often higher in demand than there is supply. A good indicator for the scarcity of one's profession is when their employer recruits talent from all across the world and advertises unique perks such as relocation bonuses, dental care or exceptional holiday packages. These benefits would not exist if there wasn't a fierce competition for a particular skill.</p>
<p>Regardless of the real economics at play, it still comes down to a good old negotiation where each person has to stand up for their own beliefs and reach an agreement on their pay. If you find yourself in a situation where your current salary might be at risk due to recent relocation then hopefully the following write-up can help you to negotiate equal pay for equal work. It is a curated list of relevant points to formulate a strong argument why one should receive the same or perhaps an even better pay for the same work carried out from a remote position.</p>
<h2 id="same-duties-same-pay">Same duties, same pay</h2>
<p>If you're reading this blog post then you're most likely not being paid for your time or place of work. You are being paid for your knowledge, your skills, your duties, the challenges which come with your work and most importantly the responsibilities of your role. Your professionalism and your personal commitment which you bring to your every day job will not diminish when you move into a new place. Whether you work remotely or not, you will still contemplate over that tough work problem in your spare time. You will still lose sleep over that big presentation the next day. You will still stay up late to meet an important deadline by the end of the month. You do it because you take pride in your work. You do it because of a sense of personal accountability to your team. It is those qualities which have earned you the trust of your manager over the years. It is those qualities which earned you a pay rise long ago. Changing postcodes doesn't take away your accomplishments from the past. Changing postcodes shouldn't take away the things which you have already earned before.</p>
<h2 id="same-value-same-pay">Same value, same pay</h2>
<p>The value of your contributions hasn't been compromised by moving house. Customers still pay the same price for the products which you have helped to build. Sales figures didn't drop when you went remote. Why should your employer reduce your pay when they are not passing that cost saving onto their customers by cutting their own price? Based on the same principle why your employer won't reduce their prices when downsizing office, you also shouldn't accept a lower salary after moving place. The concept is the same and you shouldn't accept one principle for them, but another for yourself. As you continue to deliver the same value and quality as before, you equally deserve the same compensation in return.</p>
<h2 id="your-savings-their-savings">Your savings, their savings</h2>
<p>Let's be clear, when you transitioned from office to home it's not like you're the only one who benefited from a lower cost of living as a result. Whatever savings you might have made on your rent, your employer does now too. Every person in an office requires an extra desk. Every additional person requires a fraction more of bathroom space. More people mean bigger kitchens, bigger break out areas, more meeting rooms, larger hallways, bigger stairways and more facilities to comply with fire safety regulations. There is more pressure on lifts to avoid bottle necks during peak times. There is more building maintenance work to be done and more frequent cleaning intervals required. A bigger workforce automatically means more individual needs. Extra bicycle storage rooms, canteens, car parks, private offices, outdoor spaces, a bigger selection of refreshments and a larger variety of office perks are just a few to name. Unless your employer is prepared to share their own operational saving directly with you, why should you share your personal operational saving with them? Fundamentally their savings are theirs, and your savings are yours.</p>
<h2 id="their-profit-your-profit">Their profit, your profit</h2>
<p>Have you ever received a pay rise when your employer re-structured themselves to benefit from lower tax? Have you ever received a pay rise when your employer opened up a new factory in a less regulated place? Have you ever received a pay rise when your employer outsourced a call centre into a country without minimum wage? Probably not, because it was your employer and not you who took the risk. Guess what, when you are courageous enough to relocate to a different country, city or state, then any financial gains from your move are also only yours to claim. This shouldn't be a huge surprise as nothing comes without its own significant risk. Economic security, social safety nets, unemployment benefits, retirement support, access to public health services, cost of qualitative education or medical treatment are often some of the compromises which have to be taken into account. Simple things such as free playgrounds for children, access to public recreational grounds, well maintained parks, a good public transport system funded by tax or basic luxuries such as political stability or the ability to safely park a new car on a public road are many other cost calculations not to be dismissed. Of course this is not always the case, but those considerations are for you to make. Nobody else, particularly not your employer, who has a financial interest of dismissing or downplaying those issues should be making those calculations on your behalf. This is such a basic principle that it's almost offensive to suggest the opposite. Your employer should not decide what sort of lifestyle you deserve.</p>
<h2 id="higher-cost-higher-pay">Higher cost, higher pay</h2>
<p>Contrary to common belief, working from home is not cheap. First of all, working permanently from home requires an entire additional room. If your family lived in a three bedroom house before, now you need four.
Thanks to COVID-19 most will agree that working from a sofa is neither practical, nor sustainable or realistic by any means. A proper office desk and a good ergonomic chair are a necessity at the least. Those requirements alone make a legitimate home office significantly more expensive than many would like to admit. Throw in a couple of monitors, a qualitative web cam, microphone, printer, shredder, peripheral devices, a whiteboard, noise cancelling headphones, a mesh router and a backup laptop (assuming you'll get a work laptop provided) then the true cost of a home office begins to reach eye watering levels.</p>
<p>Some employers will try to provide you those supplies, but any seasoned remote worker will tell you to decline such an offer. After all you're still equipping your own personal home. You shouldn't have to pick from a selection of office desks which don't match your walls. You shouldn't have to settle on a chair which doesn't appeal to your eye. You shouldn't have to accept a black bezelled screen when all your other equipment is in space grey. Most importantly though, you want to treat those things as your own. You don't want to change your monitors when you change your job. You don't want to have to go through your employer to make a warranty claim. You don't want to ask for permission to replace a worn out chair. Instead you want to get a pay rise which allows you to set up your home office in the most productive way. If your employer is smart enough then they will not want to manage all of that inventory (which they never get to see) either.</p>
<p>Speaking of inventory, the true cost of working from home does not stop there yet. When working remotely nothing disrupts productivity more than a low bandwidth internet connection. One cannot …</p></div></div>

<p>The end of a year is the perfect time to review one’s life, goals, plans, and projects, as well as plan for the upcoming year. I’ve been fine-tuning my own review process for several years and thought others might be interested to know what I do and how.</p>
<p>So, I wrote up my general year review process in a short PDF guide titled “8,760 Hours”—a reference to the number of hours in a year. This is essentially the review process I use, minus a few details like <a href="http://alexvermeer.com/my-inbox-zero-system/">clearing out my inbox</a>.</p>
<h2 id="outline">Outline</h2>
<p>The guide has six sections:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Introduction.</strong> Why plan at all? To get more out of life, to take responsibility for your time.</li>
<li><strong>Tools.</strong> All you really need is pen, paper, and some time. There’s also a very quick introduction to mind mapping and mind mapping software. I then present my fourteen life categories that I use for breaking down my life into its constituent parts and analyzing them.</li>
<li><strong>A snapshot of the past year.</strong> Using the fourteen categories, how are things going? What went well or poorly in the past year? What is the status of your goals and projects?</li>
<li><strong>The next 8,760 hours.</strong> First off, what is your “ideal you”? What do you want each area of your life to look like in an ideal world? Which areas need the most work? What are your major projects or goals to focus on in the upcoming year? Set some priorities.</li>
<li><strong>Optimize for success.</strong> Setting goals is necessary but not sufficient. Using what’s known about <a href="http://alexvermeer.com/getmotivated/">procrastination and motivation</a> we can optimize our chances of success. If you address uncertainties before they creep up, you’ll be better prepared for them. If you schedule regular reviews you’re more likely to stay on track.&nbsp;Squeeze it all into a one-page calendar to keep yourself motivated and remember the big picture.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Resources.</strong> A small collection of additional resources to help you implement the rest of the guide and for further reading.</li>

<p>A novel SARS-CoV-2 variant, VOC 202012/01, emerged in southeast England in November 2020 and appears to be rapidly spreading towards fixation. We fitted a two-strain mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to observed COVID-19 hospital admissions, hospital and ICU bed occupancy, and deaths; SARS-CoV-2 PCR prevalence and seroprevalence; and the relative frequency of VOC 202012/01 in the three most heavily affected NHS England regions (South East, East of England, and London). We estimate that VOC 202012/01 is 56% more transmissible (95% credible interval across three regions 50-74%) than preexisting variants of SARS-CoV-2. We were unable to find clear evidence that VOC 202012/01 results in greater or lesser severity of disease than preexisting variants. Nevertheless, the increase in transmissibility is likely to lead to a large increase in incidence, with COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths projected to reach higher levels in 2021 than were observed in 2020, even if regional tiered restrictions implemented before 19 December are maintained. Our estimates suggest that control measures of a similar stringency to the national lockdown implemented in England in November 2020 are unlikely to reduce the effective reproduction number Rt to less than 1, unless primary schools, secondary schools, and universities are also closed. We project that large resurgences of the virus are likely to occur following easing of control measures. It may be necessary to greatly accelerate vaccine roll-out to have an appreciable impact in suppressing the resulting disease burden.</p>

Grey shaded areas (panels A, C, D) reflect the period of time when England was in a second national lockdown. We cut off the data after 1 December 2020 due to a substantial decrease in representativeness after this time (Fig. S4). (B) Proportion of S gene drop-outs (5 – 11 December) versus mean reproduction number (27 November – 4 December) by local authority in England. The one-week lag accounts for delays from infection to test. (C) Percentage change (95% CI) in Google Mobility indices relative to baseline over time and (D) setting-specific mean contacts (95% CI) from the CoMix study (9) over time and by age for local authorities that went into Tier 4 compared to the rest of England. Educ = education setting. Some local authorities that were within the South East, East of England, and London NHS England regions did not go into Tier 4 and were therefore included in the rest of England for panels C and D. (E) Estimates of R0 (50% and 95% CI) from CoMix social contact survey compared to Rt estimates from REACT-1 SARS-CoV-2 prevalence survey for England. R estimates based on single and aggregated REACT-1 survey rounds are shown.</p>

January 3, 2021 | https://www.vincentdelft.be/post/post_20210102 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.vincentdelft.be/post/post_20210102">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I'll list some of my tips and tricks around OpenBSD. <br>
I'm using OpenBSD as daily machine since +10 years now and I'm still amazed how simple and powerful this system is. </p>
<p>So most of the elements listed here under will match <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ksh">KSH</a> on OpenBSD. I'm using Openbox as window manager, xterm as terminal and neovim as editor. </p>
<p>If you want to re-use some of those ideas, you will have to adapt it to your own config. </p>

<p>On OpenBSD folder's organization is :</p>
<pre><code>- Base applications in /
- Packages in /usr/local
</code></pre>
<p>So I push all my own application is ~/.local</p>
<p>So, one of my first line in ~/.profile is the following</p>
<pre><code>PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
</code></pre>
<p>An other important element for Windows Manager and xdg's tool (pkg_add xdg-utils)  is to find .desktop files in :</p>
<pre><code>~/.local/share/applications
</code></pre>

<p>I often have lot of xterm windows open. Generally they are split between the Openbox virtual desktops depending on the scope/activity. </p>
<p>But even that, I have lot of windows. So, I like to change their window title, in order to retrieve them more easily when doing a Alt-TAB or by checking the task bar. </p>
<p>To modify the window's title of xterm, here after a simple command I've added in my .profile:</p>
<pre><code>set_title()
{
    echo -n "\033]0;$1\007"
}
</code></pre>
<p>When you want to change the window's title, you just have to type in the window where you want a new title:</p>
<pre><code>set_title "dev branch xxx"
</code></pre>

<p>To avoid the quazy monochrome of xterm, I'm using colorls (pkg_add colorls). </p>
<p>Then in .profile, I put:</p>
<pre><code>export LSCOLORS=gxfxcxdxbxegedabagacad
alias ls='colorls -GF'
</code></pre>
<p>The first line defines the color to use in the different situation. With colorls we have 11 different situations (directory, link, socket, pipe, exe, ...). For each of those 11, you must provide the foreground color and the background color. <br>
The second line is just to over-write the standard /bin/ls command. The -G is to use the defined colors, with -F colorls adds some visual characters to differentiate folders, executable, ... </p>

<p>As daily machine, I have a laptops, which travel a lot. So I need to know the exact state of the battery. This information is displayed on my status bar. But I do not look it so frequently. So, I prefer to have this information in my preferred shell. </p>
<p>I'm using the following script from my .profile file:</p>
<pre><code>battery()
{
    local bat=""
    local level=""
    local charg=""
    bat=$(apm -b 2&gt;/dev/null)
    if [ -n "$bat" -a "$bat" -lt "4" ]; then
        level=$(apm -l 2&gt;/dev/null)
        charg=$(apm -a 2&gt;/dev/null)
        if [ -n "$charg" -a "$charg" -eq "1" ]; then
            #charging
            print -- "\033[01;32m$level%\033[00m"
        else
            if [ "$level" -lt "20" ]; then
                #print red
                print -- "\033[01;31m$level%\033[00m"
            else 
                #print blue
                print -- "\033[01;34m$level%\033[00m"
            fi
        fi
    else
        #no battery
        print -- ""
    fi
}
</code></pre>
<p>It does report the battery status, if there is one, with 3 colors: green when the power cable is connected, blue when the battery is in good state, red when the battery is bellow 20%. </p>
<p>To have such information directly in my shell, I'm using it in PS1:</p>
<pre><code>export PS1='$(battery)\h:\w\$ '
</code></pre>
<p>By doing this, battery's usage is refreshed each time I press "enter". </p>
<p>The other parameters of PS1 does not provide colors, they display hostname "\h", folder "\w" and default prompt "\$". </p>
<p>Here after a print screen with colorls showing different type of files. Note that I've changed the window's title ;-)</p>
<p><img src="https://www.vincentdelft.be/static/post/post_20210102/color.png"></p>

<p>It's frustrating to type keywords completely, so I'm a big fan of the completion feature of KSH. </p>
<p>It's really easy to configure: just create an array with the elements you have to select. Then you just have to type TAB to have the relevant choice displayed in front of you. </p>
<p>I group them by command. </p>
<pre><code># ssh, scp
set -A SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS ~/.ssh/known_hosts
if [ -f /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts ]; then
 SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS="${SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS[@]} /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts"
fi
HOST_LIST=$(awk '{split($1,a,","); gsub("].*", "", a[1]); gsub("\[", "", a[1]); print a[1] " root@" a[1]}' $SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS | sort | uniq)
set -A complete_ssh -- $HOST_LIST
set -A complete_scp -- $HOST_LIST

set -A complete_ifconfig_1 -- $(ifconfig | grep ^[a-z] | cut -d: -f1)

set -A complete_signify_1 -- -C -G -S -V
set -A complete_signify_2 -- -q -p -x -c -m -t -z
set -A complete_signify_3 -- -p -x -c -m -t -z

set -A complete_sndioctl_1 -- $(sndioctl | cut -d= -f 1)

set -A complete_chown_1 -- $(users)

alias drcctl="doas rcctl"
set -A complete_drcctl_1 -- get getdef set check reload restart stop start disable enable order ls
set -A complete_drcctl_2 -- $(/bin/ls /etc/rc.d)
</code></pre>
<p>The first lines allow me to list all known hosts from known_hosts files. </p>
<p>The next group display possible interfaces on my machine for the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig">ifconfig</a> command. </p>
<p>The next group is to simplify the usage of signify, per type of command. </p>
<p>For sndioctl it display the possible parameters we can change. </p>
<p>for chwon's command, completion display the known users on my machine. </p>
<p>The last group of command concerns <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/rcctl">rcctl</a>. Since I'm never using "root", I've created a drcctl command in order to have the usual commands as 1st parameter, then the list of possible daemon available on my machine. </p>
<p>With such completion, I'm no more forced to type the full list of parameters. </p>
<p>For example, if I type:</p>
<pre><code>ifc "TAB" i "TAB" scan, I will execute the command
ifconfig iwm0 scan

drc "TAB" sta "TAB" pos "TAB", will become
doas rcctl start postgresql
</code></pre>

<p>Very simple tricks with facilitate the usage of a system like OpenBSD and KSH</p>
<p>In the same "laziness" I'm also a big fan if <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a>. I'll describe how I'm using is in a next blog's post. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>As you may know, back in 2007 I ressurected the development of <a href="http://grafx2.googlecode.com/">GrafX2</a>.
this old pixelart program, made only for DOS, was left out 6 years earlier by the authors, that had moved on to more modern computers.
Today, graFX2 is amongst the best tool for pixelling, particularly on Linux or other alternative operating systems.
Many people are using it daily to draw really nice pictures. The newer versions added a lot of features such as layers, and there's more to come.</p>

<p>This was possible only because the authors decided to release the source when the project stopped. The code wasn't perfectly clean; it was tied to ms-dos
with some optimized parts written directly in assembly language and accessing the video card hardware directly. Of course, getting an SDL-based version out of it
was not easy. But still, it took considerably less time than rewriting everything from scratch. Also, part of the userbase for the old GrafX2 upgraded to
the new one. For some of them it felt like getting back home after years of using suboptimal tools.</p>

<p>During the revival of GrafX2, I had to develop my web searching skills a lot. First, the original GrafX2 website was offline, and the sourcecode was
gone with it. Thanks to <a href="http://www.filewatcher.com/">filewatcher</a>, an ftpsearch engine, and <a href="http://www.archive.org/">the web archive</a>,
I was able to locate a copy on some russian FTP. Then, I wanted to get in touch with the authors to let them know their software finally found some use.</p>

<p>But grafX2 isn't the main purpose of this article. Last month, I downloaded APlayer, a music player for BeOS. After some hacking to get it working on Haiku
(which eventually led to uncovering and fixing a compatibility bug), I noticed that most musics from Burned Sounds, my preferred chiptune collection, didn't load.
The strange thing is that most of them were in formats supposed to be recognized by APlayer. But looking closer, it turned out they are packed using the Shrink
algorithm. This is a packing system from Amiga days, which can be unpacked only on amiga for lack of any sourcecode or format information. Well, that was until yesterday.
Using my high web searching skills, I found the author of Shrink and kindly asked him by mail if he was willing to release the sourcecode for hissoftware, the last version being from
1996.</p>

<p>He was a bit surprised to see there was some files using Shrink still around, but he had a linux version of the archiver. This version is now released as GPL sourcecode
at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ashrink/">sourceforge</a>. This is an important step for me in getting more open source software available ; but also in preserving
old files packed in this format. I hope some other people will find it useful too.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention I also made possible the release of a whole lot of other BeOS software made by Arvid and Jonas Norberg. This include the sawteeth sound synthetizer, as
well as the backslash n demo, and also some other unfinished code.</p>

<p>The overall message is, for developpers : think about opensourcing your old projects. Even if the source is not as clean as it could be ; even if they are of no use for you ;
even if they only work on a dead since 10 years operating system : someone, somewhere, may find it useful. You can visit the <a href="http://www.unmaintained-free-software.org/wiki/Main_Page">
Unamintained Free Software</a> page to get some examples of how passing on a project to someone else may work. But not everything goes through this website.</p>

<p>For non-developpers, don't hesitate to get in touch with the devs, even for unmaintained apps, and ask for an open source release. If the software is dead, the author isn't going to get
anymoney for it, so why not release it so other people can improve it ? This is the fastest way to get more open source software. And don't be shy, developpers are, above all, normal people, and they
do like hearing from users.</p>

  <p>The early Research Edition Unix versions featured a program that would turn a stream of ASCII text into utterances that could be played by a voice synthesizer. The source code of this program was lost for years. Here's the story of how I brought it back to life.</p>
<h3 id="finding-the-lost-code">Finding the lost code</h3>
<p>The (early 1973) Third Research Edition of Unix <a href="https://dspinellis.github.io/unix-v3man/v3man.pdf#page=130">documented</a> a program that would receive as input ASCII text and convert it into phonemes that could then be played by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Votrax">Votrax</a> voice synthesizer made by the Vocal Interface Division of Federal Screw Works. The program was written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_McIlroy">M. D. McIlroy</a>, who documented its operation in a detailed <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/speak.tar">technical report</a>.</p>
<p>Although the program appeared in the Unix manual pages up to the 1975 <a href="https://ia800600.us.archive.org/19/items/v6-manual/v6-manual.pdf#page=251">Sixth Research Edition</a>, its source code was missing from the archives that had survived. Even its author lacked a copy.</p>
<p>Fortunately, in 2011, Jonathan Gevaryahu <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140620170452/https://minnie.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/2011-December/002538.html">found</a> most parts of the program's source code in unallocated space of a Sixth Research Edition disk dump. (This means that the code was once stored on disk, but was later deleted, and the parts where it resided were never allocated to other uses.) Even better, he could reconstruct a single block that was missing from the program's compiled version, which was also available. Based on these findings, I added the <a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Research-V6-Snapshot-Development/usr/source/s2/speak.c">speak source code</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Research-V6-Snapshot-Development/usr/source/s2/speak.v">speech rules</a> to the <a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo">GiHub repository of Unix history</a> I am maintaining.</p>
<h3 id="reviving-the-code">Reviving the code</h3>
<p>To see how the program was working, I experimented with making it run and compile. As the program was written in an ancient dialect of C and was also unlikely to be portable, I first tried to make it work on a Sixth Edition Unix running on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMH">SIMH</a> PDP-11 emulator. This attempt quickly failed, because the console wasn't reliable enough to allow me to transfer the code via copy-paste.</p>
<p>I then run the PDP-11 2.11 BSD Unix on the same emulator, which offers rudimentary internet connection capabilities. After configuring a <code>.rhosts</code> file to allow remote copying (to obtain remote access, you simply add your remote host and user name), I was able to move the code to that machine.</p>
<p>However, compiling the code wasn't immediately possible. To make it compile I</p>
<ul>
<li>changed the old <code>=+</code>, <code>=^</code> to the modern <code>+=</code>, <code>^=</code> operators,</li>
<li>added forward declarations for functions returning pointers,</li>
<li>inserted an assignment operator in initialized constants (<code>int tflag 0;</code> became <code>int tflag = 0;</code> — I didn't even know this form ever existed),</li>
<li>changed calls from <code>seek</code> to <code>lseek</code>, and</li>
<li>added a proper exit code to <code>exit</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>At that stage the program could compile, but was crashing when I tried to run it. Given that 2.11 BSD lacked <em>gdb</em> and was generally slow and difficult to use, I decided to port the program to modern Unix/Linux. I also added more declarations, including full function prototypes to find other problems. (In early versions of C you didn't need to declare a function before using it.) I then methodically removed all compiler warnings, which allowed me to pinpoint a variable that was declared as a pointer but used as an integer. By correcting its declaration I fixed the initial crash.</p>
<p>Now I had a program that compiled and run, but was still crashing in some cases, and also wasn't producing correct output. For this further changes were needed.</p>
<ul>
<li>I replaced writing to a string with a write to a <code>char</code> array.</li>
<li>I corrected the size of a structure that was assumed to be 4.</li>
<li>I documented some functions to be able to follow the program logic.</li>
<li>I fixed the assumption that integers occupied two bytes.</li>
<li>I replaced integers initialized as pairs of characters (e.g. <code>'u1'</code>) with a macro that initialized the value in an endian-neutral manner.</li>
</ul>
<p>After these changes the program was able to compile the rules file and produce <a href="https://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Distributions/Research/Dennis_v5/v5man.pdf#page=285">Votrax phoneme codes</a>.</p>
<h3 id="getting-voice-output">Getting voice output</h3>
<p>Votrax voice synthesizers and their descendant chips (which appear to use similar phoneme codes) <a href="http://www.redcedar.com/sc01.htm">are not longer marketed</a>. In order to listen to the generated voice I needed a workaround. My first attempt was to use samples from the <a href="https://github.com/sealj553/votrax-speak">votrax-speak GitHub repository</a>. Converting the phoneme Votrax codes into their mnemonic names, and passing the corresponding sample files as arguments to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoX">SoX</a>, allowed me to create a sound file consisting of the phonemes played together. However, the generated sound file was almost unintelligible. As I read later, a great advantage of Votrax synthesizers was how they merged together the phonemes into continuous speech, which was not the case with my approach.</p>
<p>My second attempt involved using the phoneme output functionality of the <a href="https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng">espeak-ng</a> program. For this I created <a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/speak/blob/master/votrax-espeak.md">a map</a> between the Votrax phoneme codes and the corresponding <a href="http://espeak.sourceforge.net/phonemes.html">espeak phonemes</a>, which I then coded into a <em>sed</em> script that would feed <em>espeak</em> with the output of Unix <em>speak</em>. Through this method I was finally able to produce somewhat intelligible speech with a pipeline, such as the following.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>echo</span> Hello world <span>|</span>
<span>speak</span> speak.m <span>|</span>
<span>LC_ALL=</span>C <span>./votrax-espeak.sed</span> <span>|</span>
<span>espeak</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="code-availability">Code availability</h3>
<p>The revived source code is available in <a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/speak">this GiHub repository</a>.</p>

					<p>Once upon a time, someone with the handle “entha_saava” posted this question on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23791152">Hacker News</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can someone knowledgeable explain how are lisp REPLs different from
Python / Ruby REPLs? What is the differentiating point of REPL
driven development?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer is that there is a <a href="http://mikelevins.github.io/2020/02/03/programming-as-teaching.html">particular kind of programming</a>
in which you build a program by <em>interacting</em> with it as it runs, and
there are certain languages and runtimes that are designed from the
ground up to support that kind of programming.</p>
<p>Python and Ruby are not examples of such languages.</p>
<p>Why not? That’s the crux of entha_saava’s question, right? What are
these <strong>repl-driven</strong> programming systems, and what makes them
different from Python and Ruby and every other language that offers a
repl?</p>
<p>For that matter, what’s a repl?</p>
<p>The word <strong>repl</strong> is an acronym that stands for <strong>read-eval-print
loop</strong>. The term comes from the history of Lisp. From the start, sixty
years ago, the standard way of working with a Lisp has been to start a
language processor, type expressions at its prompt, and wait for it to
evaluate the expressions and print their results, before prompting for
another expression. Read, eval, print. Loop.</p>
<p>Nowadays, repls are all the rage. Every language and its brother
offers a repl. There’s a website, <a href="https://repl.it/">repl.it</a>, whose
entire purpose is to provide all the repls.</p>
<p>It doesn’t actually provide <em>all</em> the repls, of course. What’s
particularly ironic is that it doesn’t provide either of the canonical
repl-driven development environments: Common Lisp and Smalltalk.</p>
<p>That brings us back to entha_saava’s question: if Common Lisp and
Smalltalk are repl-driven environments, and Python and Ruby are not,
what’s the difference? What do Lisp and Smalltalk have that Python and
Ruby don’t?</p>
<p>What they have is a language and runtime system that are designed from
the ground up with the assumption that you’re going to develop
programs by starting the language engine and talking to it, teaching
it how to be your program <em>interactively</em>, by changing it <em>while it
runs</em>.</p>
<p>I can hear the objections formulating already. I’ve seen them
before. Yes, every language with a repl can do some things in the
repl. Obviously that’s true; if it weren’t, then the repl would be
entirely useless.</p>
<p>Being able to do <em>some</em> things in the repl does not make an engine
into a repl-driven programming environment. What distinguishes
old-fashioned Lisp and Smalltalk environments is that you can do
<em>everything</em> in the repl. They place no gratuitous limitations on what
you can do; if the language and runtime can do it, then the repl can
do it.</p>
<p>For example, you can ask the current version of Clozure Common Lisp to
rebuild itself from scratch by evaluating the following expression at
the repl prompt:</p>
<pre><code>(rebuild-ccl :full t)
</code></pre>
<p>CCL responds by completely rebuilding itself from source.</p>
<p>The point is not that you would want to rebuild CCL this way all the
time. The point is that there are no artificial limitations on what
the repl can do. The full range of the development system’s
capabilities is accessible from the repl.</p>
<p>That’s one of the first things I notice when using newer, lesser
repls: I’m always running into things I can’t do from the repl.</p>
<p>It’s not just about freedom from restrictions, though. Proper support
for interactive programming means that the language and its runtime
have positive features that support changing your program <em>while it
runs</em>.</p>
<p>Try this in your favorite repl:</p>
<p>Define a function, <code>foo</code>, that calls some other function, <code>bar</code>, that
is not yet defined. Now call <code>foo</code>. What happens?</p>
<p>Obviously, the call to <code>foo</code> breaks, because <code>bar</code> is not defined. But
what happens when it breaks? What happens next?</p>
<p>If your favorite repl is Python’s or Ruby’s or any of a few dozen
other modern repls, the answer is most likely that it prints an error
message and returns to its prompt. In some cases, perhaps it crashes.</p>
<p>So what’s my point, right? What else could it do?</p>
<p>The answer to that question is the “differentiating point” of
repl-driven programming. In an old-fashioned Lisp or Smalltalk
environment, the break in <code>foo</code> drops you into a <strong>breakloop</strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong>breakloop</strong> is a full-featured repl, complete with all of the
tools of the main repl, but it exists inside the dynamic environment
of the broken function. From the breakloop you can roam up and down
the suspended call stack, examining all variables that are lexically
visible from each stack frame. In fact, you can inspect all live data
in the running program.</p>
<p>What’s more, you can <em>edit</em> all live data in the program. If you think
that a break was caused by a wrong value in some particular variable
or field, you can interactively change it and resume the suspended
function. If it now works correctly, then congratulations; you found
the problem!</p>
<p>Moreover, because the entire language and development system are
available, unrestricted, in the repl, you can define the missing
function <code>bar</code>, resume <code>foo</code>, and get a sensible result.</p>
<p>In fact, there’s a style of programming, well known in Lisp and
Smalltalk circles, in which you define a toplevel function with calls
to other functions that don’t yet exist, and then define those
functions as you go in the resulting breakloops. It’s a fast way to
implement a procedure when you already know how it should work.</p>
<p>If you’re a user of old-fashioned Lisp or Smalltalk systems then this
all sounds obvious to you, but that reaction is not common. Surprise
is much more common, or even suspicion: what’s the catch?</p>
<p>The catch is that the designers of your language system had to think
that facility through in the planning stages. You don’t get a decent
implementation of it by bolting it on after the fact. Breakloops need
<em>full</em> access to the <em>entire</em> development system, interactively, with
a computation and its call stack suspended in the breakloop’s
environment.</p>
<p>Let’s take another example of a facility designed to support
interactive programming. Once again, try this in your favorite repl:</p>
<p>Define a datatype. I mean a class, a struct, a record type–whatever
user-defined type your favorite language supports. Make some instances
of it. Write some functions (or methods, or procedures, or whatever)
to operate on them.</p>
<p>Now change the definition of the type. What happens?</p>
<p>Does your language runtime notice that the definition of the type has
changed? Does it realize that the existing instances have a new
definition? When something touches one of them, does it automatically
reinitialize it to conform to the new definition, or, if it doesn’t
know how to do that, does it start a breakloop and ask you what to do
about it?</p>
<p>If the answer is “yes,” then you’re probably using a Lisp or Smalltalk
system. If the answer is “no,” then you’re missing a crucial element
of repl-driven development.</p>
<p>Remember: the point is to support programming <em>interactively</em>. You
don’t want to have to kill your program and rebuild it from scratch
just because you changed a definition. That’s silly; adding and
changing definitions is most of what you do! If your development
environment is going to support interactive development, then it had
better know how to keep your program running when you change some
definitions.</p>
<p>Old-fashioned Lisp and Smalltalk system know how to do that. There are
also a few other kinds of systems, mostly older ones, that know how to
do it.</p>
<p>These are not eccentric new ideas out of left field. They’ve been
around for half a century. They contribute materially to productivity
in interactive development.</p>
<p>They’re what sets <strong>repl-driven development</strong> apart from mere
development with a repl.</p>
<p>Now, not every programmer prefers that kind of development. Some
programmers prefer to think of development as a process of designing,
planning, making blueprints, and assembling parts on a
workbench. There’s nothing wrong with that. Indeed, a
multibillion-dollar international industry has been built upon it.</p>
<p>But if you prefer interactive development, if it’s more natural to
you, then it can make you enormously more productive, not to mention
happier in your work.</p>
<p>Interactive development with a proper repl-driven environment is the
exception. Most programming is done in other ways.</p>
<p>As a consequence, there are a lot of programmers out there who’ve
never even heard of it, who have no idea that it exists. My intuition
is that some fraction of those programmers would prefer well-supported
interactive programming, and would benefit from it, if they just knew
what it was.</p>
<p>Maybe if enough programmers are exposed to that style of programming
then we’ll begin to see new tools that embrace it.</p>

<h3 id="superhuman">Superhuman</h3>

<p>Superhuman is an invite-only $30/month email client.<sup id="fnref:pricing" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:pricing">1</a></sup> People like it for its sleek design, responsive speed, and suite of keyboard shortcuts to improve a user’s email efficiency. People justify this purchase over free alternatives by the fact that they spend hours on email everyday. Part of Superhuman’s feature offering includes read statuses, which is useful for executives and sales people who like to keep a pulse on their conversations.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.growthalytics.com/images/2021-01-02-the-sublime-text-editor-of-x/superhuman.png" alt="Superhuman Product Screenshot"></p>

<p>Users love Superhuman. Take a quick peak on Twitter<sup id="fnref:twitter" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:twitter">2</a></sup> at the effusive praise the company gets. Andreessen Horowitz led the latest investment round in the company with a valuation of roughly $260 million.</p>

<p>Following in the tailwind of this prosumer email client that has taken Silicon Valley and Twitter by storm are a suite of companies claiming to be “Superhuman for x”.<sup id="fnref:superhumanofx" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:superhumanofx">3</a></sup></p>

<p>As identified by Todd Goldberg, the “Superhuman of X” has the following traits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Designed for speed.</li>
  <li>Built as an opinionated product experience for a specific use case and/or target audience.</li>
  <li>Driven primarily by keyboard shortcuts.</li>

<h3 id="sublime-text">Sublime Text</h3>

<p>I present Sublime Text: a piece of software more than a decade older than Superhuman, that shares the above attributes. Sublime can be driven primarily by keyboard shortcuts. It’s as thoughtfully designed as I have been shamefully unwilling to purchase the non-trial version for 80 USD. The similarities lie much deeper than that. Sublime has two close-to-instant-speed search-bars: one for opening a file in your project [goto] and one for executing commands.</p>

<p>Sublime Text is also simultaneously opinionated but also configurable. It is simple enough for a programmer to install, open, and “hit the ground running” on a big project with a combination of GOTO (⌘+P) and project search (⌘+Shift+F).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I once worked in highly regulated environments and needed a way to recall dozens of complex passwords that changed frequently. I tried to use a password manager, but could not due to the burdens and insecurity of some common design flaws. I wrote a Deterministic Password Generator <a href="https://github.com/62726164/dpg">DPG</a> to address this.</p><p>If after reading this you still wish to use a traditional password manager, I suggest that you put your passwords into a plain text file and symmetrically encrypt it with <a href="https://gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a> or use <a href="https://www.pwsafe.org/">Password Safe</a>. I have no relation with either.</p><p>Here are three common design flaws in password managers:</p><ol><li>Password storage</li><li>Reliance on remote systems</li><li>Web browser integration</li></ol><h2 id="password-storage">Password storage</h2><p>When passwords are stored, they must be encrypted and then retrieved later when needed. Storage, of any type, is a burden. Users are required to backup stored passwords, synchronize them across devices and implement measures to protect them.</p><p>Users must also devise a master password to unlock the encrypted passwords stored by the password manager. This is similar to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_keying">master key</a>. It is generally accepted that master keyed locks are less secure than non-master keyed locks. If the master password is exposed, then confidence (in all the passwords that it unlocks) is lost.</p><p>And, are we certain that the encryption used to store the passwords is implemented correctly? Has the encryption been externally validated? Some password managers are closed-source and proprietary and cannot be examined.</p><p>Encryption is hard. Even respected, expert developers with many years of experience (who seldom make mistakes) <a href="http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2011-01-18-tarsnap-critical-security-bug.html">do make mistakes</a> that render encryption weak or in some cases almost useless.</p><h2 id="reliance-on-remote-systems">Reliance on remote systems</h2><p>Ironically, password managers rely on remote systems largely because they store passwords. The first design flaw causes the second.</p><p>Remote systems are outside the user’s control. They are opaque and cannot be examined and should not be trusted with password management. These systems may not be available when needed. They may not be storing or transmitting passwords correctly.</p><p>Externally, the systems may seem correct (strong HTTPS, reasonable CSP) but behind the scenes, no one really knows what’s going on. How are the passwords being transmitted, generated and stored internally? Who has access to them?</p><p>Several popular cloud-based password managers have reported security breaches: <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/onelogin-breach-reignites-concerns-over-password-managers/d/d-id/1329034">1</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/03/potent-lastpass-exploit-underscores-the-dark-side-of-password-managers/">2</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/06/hack-brief-password-manager-lastpass-got-breached-hard/">3</a>.</p><h2 id="web-browser-integration">Web browser integration</h2><p>Web browsers today have “everything but the kitchen sink” capabilities built-in and are becoming more and more complex each year. They are turning into whole platforms that have browser plug-ins and extensions for every possible need known to humankind.</p><p>While many of these add-ons are handy and useful, we should not trust them with password management. Browsers are just too complex and have far too much going on.</p><h2 id="dpg">DPG</h2><p>I wrote DPG (The Deterministic Password Generator) around 2010 to address the design flaws described above. Here are its key concepts.</p><ol><li>Never store passwords. Rather, generate them as needed based on user input. The need to backup, synchronize and properly encrypt passwords is removed. There is no master password that immediately unlocks all of the other passwords. There is nothing to become lost, stolen or corrupt.</li><li>Only run locally on end-use devices. No reliance on remote systems or web browsers.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/62726164/dpg">DPG is open-source</a> and has several implementations. The passwords it generates can be verified and validated by external implementations in multiple programming languages.</li></ol><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>DPG removes many of the flaws that I have experienced with traditional password managers over the years. Try it. You may like it. I hope you find it as useful as I have.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.go350.com/tags/passwords">passwords</a></li><li><a href="https://www.go350.com/tags/compliance">compliance</a></li></ul></div></div>]]>

<!-- Article: Content
================================================== -->
<section>
	<div>
	<p>Please write a short essay in response to each of the three essay topics below. There is a 100-word minimum and a 250-word maximum for each essay.
</p>		<p>First, let’s briefly get a sense of what 250 words means. It’s two average paragraphs, or three lean paragraphs. Also known as: not a ton of space! The burden is on you to think about the meatiest point you need to make, and then to build your surrounding elements strategically, so that they help you deliver that point with maximum impact, concisely. It’s not as easy as it may sound. For our analysis, we’re mostly going to dig into the “meat” aspect.</p>
<h3>Essay 1: The Stanford community is deeply curious and driven to learn in and out of the classroom. Reflect on an idea or experience that makes you genuinely excited about learning.</h3>
<p>Strangely, this one rides or dies on the PROOF that you’re actually, truly, genuinely excited about learning. What serves as proof? Action. The stuff YOU DO in response to the stuff you’re inspired by… that demonstrates it, and makes it real. Anyone can CLAIM to be super inspired by X Y and Z and talk about it. But if all they do is talk, does it really matter? Not exactly the world’s sexiest Zen koan, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>Something to consider here – something common to folks who are genuinely excited about learning – is an unusual comfort level with being WRONG. A thirst for learning is predicated on (1) acknowledging that you don’t know everything already, and (2) that the stuff you may THINK you know, is wrong or incomplete. Why mention this? Cuz it can help your case to give EVIDENCE of that. Have you ever been wrong about something, and were THRILLED to discover what ended up being a BETTER WAY OF LOOKING AT SOMETHING? Walk us through what it felt like, why it might have felt bad at some point, but why it felt GOOD eventually to have developed, improved, evolved. We need to really PROVE that you’re turned on by learning, and admitting that you’ve been wrong (and loved it), is an excellent way to do so.</p>
<p>Another way, alluded to earlier, is purely through action. Is there evidence of “tirelessness” when you’re attempting to learn something? We need to see ways in which you pursue this thing, especially when it’s INCONVENIENT to do so. In other words, if your pursuit is compelling, but kinda expected, it won’t weigh as much. If you decided you wanted to get some cereal, and then went out and bought yourself some cereal… um, okay? But if on the way, it started to rain, and a hurricane arrived, and the store closed, so you hitchhiked to another location, and that store was closed too, so you decided to call your friend you know who happened to have an extra box, but he wasn’t home, so you decided to……. [yada yada]…. You ended up with your box of Crispix. Now THAT GUY’s interest in “cereal” seems unimpeachable, no? Show us how, when pursuing something for the sake of learning, you’ve done it (1) when no one else was looking, or (2) when it became inconvenient to do so, but you still did it, or (3) when the risk of continuing to do it started to outweigh the benefits, or… you get the idea.</p>
<p>Most students will focus on THE THING they’re excited about, rather than proving their excitement through action. It’s that second group that ultimately wins, because we now have reason to believe that they have that forward-leaning trait which will carry them through college and beyond. (And that’s whole point of this question – to make sure you won’t drop out in freshman year when you take a class that’s harder than any class you’ve ever taken before.)</p>
<h3>Essay 2: Virtually all of Stanford’s undergraduates live on campus. Write a note to your future roommate that reveals something about you or that will help your roommate—and us—know you better.</h3>
<p>Classic Stanford undergrad question. The mistake we see 95% of the time on first drafts is the impulse to try to “slip in” resume highlights. As if this is a veiled attempt by Stanford to get those highlights, instead of, you know, just asking for them. The way to impress Stanford here is through honesty and charm. But mostly honesty.</p>
<p>Indulge us here and take two swings at this. On the first attempt, get it out of your system, whatever letter you want to write, just take a crack and then file it away for the time being.</p>
<p>On your second attempt, go with us on a little journey. Start by <strong>creating a roommate</strong>, leaving everything to chance (the same way it’ll more or less work out when you’re actually assigned a roommate in your freshman dorm). For starters, your roommate will almost certainly be the same gender. Now, generate a bunch of parameters, like ethnicity, height, weight, athletic/ musical/etc., liberal/conservative, east coast/southern/west-coast/etc., affable/surly, cool/not-so-cool, American/foreign-born/etc.…. Don’t spend too much time, because it doesn’t really matter much. Give this guy or gal a name. Again, don’t get stuck on this, the idea is to paint a vague picture. But once you have this picture, commit to it for a second. Imagine a real person on the other end.</p>
<p>Now, you’re gonna address a fresh new letter to this person. If the open-ended-ness of the Stanford prompt leaves you stuck, consider some of the following ideas. Write the letter using one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What if your roommate just confided in you, and told you an incredible secret. Something that leaves your roommate in an extremely vulnerable emotional state having just put him/herself on the line. What might you reveal about YOURSELF in response? “Hey, so here’s something most people don’t know about ME…” (What might follow that up?)</li>
<li>Treat it as though it were a dating profile. What kinds of preferences would you reveal about yourself that might give the BEST clues about what you’re all about? Think about quirks and specificity here. If you were to say “I like Chinese food” it doesn’t say all that much since so many different types of people would fall under that same category. If, however, you were to say you absolutely HATE the HBO show “Game of Thrones” that would have the opposite effect since “most people are obsessed with that show (INCLUDING ALL OF US AT ADMISSIONADO, SO WATCH YOUR STEP!).” Can you stack up a few such preferences that, when summed, may help someone get a sense for what you’re all about, and even better, become more curious to get to know you better?</li>
<li>You know that classic question “if you were stuck on a desert island forever, what album would you bring?” … You can put a twist on it here. Name a few KEY possessions you’re gonna bring that’ll be essential to your comfort. Forget bland necessities like “a toothbrush” (since everyone will be packing one of those). More like, the “sounds of the rainforest” you use to lull yourself to sleep every night. Stuff like that. And possibly even suggest a few things you DON’T have that your roommate may bring to complete the set for total roommate symbiosis. You don’t need to follow this conceit exactly, but maybe this gives you an idea from which you can springboard to help show us something about who you are exactly, and what makes you … you.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Essay 3: Tell us about something that is meaningful to you, and why?</h3>
<p>Ha, in 250 words… you’re asked to grapple with one of life’s more challenging questions. A fitting test for a place like Stanford. Let’s start with what NOT to do.</p>
<p>Extinguish the desire to imagine what Stanford wants to hear. If you pen a response that you <strong>BELIEVE</strong> will put you in good stead because you think it shows maturity, or emotional intelligence, or whatever else… you are in for a crash landing. Or, tell you what, let’s a make a deal. Write that version, and keep it handy. Now write <strong>ANOTHER</strong> version that may never ever see the light of day. Think of this as a private diary entry. An exercise that may lead to something. But take the pressure away that someone might read it, so be more honest than you might want to be otherwise.</p>
<p>For this version, imagine you’re addressing a &nbsp;huge crowd (as if you are the Pope, or MLK), and it’s a crowd of people who… aren’t really contributing all that positively to society. Maybe they’re lazy. Maybe they’re irresponsible. Maybe they’re disaffected. Maybe they’re dangerous. Let’s just call them the folks who aren’t model citizens of the world.</p>
<p>What might you say to inspire these folks? Think about it. If you were to say something obvious, wouldn’t it run the risk of not having much of an impact? Make it less about you (just for a second), and instead think about what you might say to inspire this crowd. If you were to say “say no to drugs” or “do unto others…” or “cherish each day as though it were your last” … hasn’t everyone heard it already? If they haven’t internalized those ideas, they’re certainly not gonna do so just because <strong>YOU</strong> said it, right? But they might if they hear something <strong>NEW</strong>, something fresh about what matters, in a way that may cause them to re-evaluate things or see things through a new lens.</p>
<p>Obviously, you won’t want to write about something trivial, like “driving a nice car matters because the value of a smooth ride is more pleasing than a bumpy one.” Unless it’s a cracking metaphor, something like that might make your message seem like you didn’t give it a whole lot of thought, or, worse, you’re someone who’s so privileged that that type of material comfort is truly something that matters more than deeper, cooler things. So, it probably will have to do with human interaction, or a way of approaching things, or a state of being, or the like. Think about where others are going wrong. What are others <strong>MISSING</strong>, in a way that leads to irresponsible behavior, actions, attitudes, etc.? What matters to <strong>YOU</strong> that makes you feel like your compass is pointed in a better direction?</p>
<p>This conceit (of addressing a crowd) is meant to unlock ideas, not for you to embrace the idea too literally. You’re not proselytizing. So, if it helps, use your imagination of …</p></div></section></div></div>

          <p><a href="https://nngorok.com/don-t-complete-their-thought">January 3, 2021</a></p>
<p>I’ve recently been thinking about why listening can be very difficult. One aspect that always comes to mind, a practice that is exceptionally difficult to give up, is the tendency to finish other’s thoughts. Here’s some similar scenarios to illustrate:</p>
<p>Meet Alice, a senior engineer on a team and Bob a recent addition on the team.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bob: Hey Alice. Got a sec?<br> Alice: Sure Bob. What’s up?<br> Bob: I was trying to use system X and I run into problem Y. I …<br> Alice: Oh, must be issue Z? That concurrency bug surfaces from time to time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This can go one of 2 ways. Either, Alice is on the money and has helped Bob figure it quickly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bob: Oh! Right! I hadn’t thought about that. Why is that?<br> Alice: My pleasure.<br> etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or alternatively, Alice is off the mark:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bob: I don’t think so. I’m seeing more of issue A.<br> Alice: I see. Must be the installation ordering!<br> etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In both these cases, Alice quickly concludes what issue Bob might be facing. With her wealth of experience on the team and deep knowledge of the systems, she is able to usually have a good idea what the issue is. However, in both cases, Alice unintentionally doesn’t allow Bob to complete his thoughts. What else could Bob have said about the issue? He, for instance, could have elaborated on the steps he had taken so far, and how he went about trying to figure out the issue. All this information could have given Alice more context and a better opportunity to coach Bob as he ramps up on the team even better. It also could have fostered more relationship building between them. Unfortunately, this doesn’t happen.</p>
<p>Cases such as this are very common. Let’s look at Juan a manager and Neda, an engineer that reports to him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Juan: Hey Neda! How’s the project going?<br> Neda: The project is coming along well. I do have some reservations on it’s value to the company. It…<br> Juan: What aspects are giving you reservations?<br> Neda: The project will take Y months and at best generate Z in revenue. <span>I…</span><br> Juan: That sounds pretty decent to me. This project has been a long time coming and will have impact around the company beyond revenue. It will…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Juan does a good job trying to understand the problem a bit better at the start asking a clarifying question. However, when he gets a whiff of what he thinks the issue is, he quickly jumps to address it, attempting to complete Neda’s thoughts.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it isn’t possible to truly know what another’s thoughts are. We simply cannot <strong>(yet)</strong> read each other’s minds. If we don’t let others finish their thought, we risk souring the conversation and/or relationship: whether that means the other person has to correct us and redirect the conversation or that the other person resorts to not voicing their opinions.</p>
<p>We all have busy schedules and want to be efficient in our conversations. As leaders, we often are having similar conversations with many different people. So much so, that we usually know what the person is<span></span> <span>“</span>getting at”; it is very tempting to make the connections! The crux though, is that when we guess wrong, it can be disastrous.</p>
<p>So the next time you have the urge, pressing as it may be, to complete someone’s thoughts, hold your tongue. Let them go over what they think even if you’ve heard it all before. Before you respond, ask yourself, have they finished their thought? Are you about to complete their thought because you think you know what they are getting at? Don’t respond until they finish. With all the context they give you, give them that great response! They will appreciate you for it. If you really must, and can’t fight the urge, count down for 5 seconds of silence or try asking a clarifying question instead.</p>

		<article>
			<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_State"><em>Seeing Like a State</em></a>, James C. Scott defines “legibility” as something a state imposes on its people and resources.  It is a coercive abstraction, not only treating different people, places, and ways of life as if they were the same<sup id="fnref:abstraction"><a href="#fn:abstraction">1</a></sup>, but creating an environment which encourages people to forget those differences ever existed.</p>

<p>One of Scott’s first examples is land ownership in pre-modern rural villages, each of which had its own peculiar practices built over generations, describing the obligations between neighbors, the obligations between relatives, and the use of common pastures and forests.  These practices were perfectly legible within a given village, but a cacophonous mess to state officials trying to understand all of them at once.</p>

<p>And so the states sent in surveyors, who drew sharp boundaries on their maps.  A year later came the tax collectors, maps in hand.  If a family paid taxes on what was once common property, they had little motivation to let their neighbors continue to use it.  Instead, the villagers reshaped their lives to fit the maps.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Image_of_the_City"><em>The Image of the City</em></a>, Kevin Lynch defines “legibility” as something that a complex environment offers to its inhabitants, allowing them to easily navigate it.  It is a clarifying abstraction, making the world more than an endless deluge of minute details.</p>

<p>Lynch interviewed long-time residents of various cities, and asked them to describe how they’d navigate from one part of the city to another.  He created reference maps of shared elements from these journeys, representing how each city was understood by its people.</p>

<p>Some cities, such as Boston, were highly legible; its map was full of reference points, and its residents were confident in each step of their imagined journey.  Other cities were less so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[A]lmost anyone can, if attentive, learn to navigate in Jersey City, but only at the cost of some effort and uncertainty.  Moreover, the positive values of legible surroundings are missing: the emotional satisfaction, the framework for communication or conceptual organization, the new depths that it may bring to everyday experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The moral hazard described in <em>Seeing Like a State</em> exists in any field of design.  In software, for instance, anywhere one implementation cannot be easily exchanged for another, users are forced to bend themselves to the needs of their software.  This is trivially true of enterprise software, since the users are not the buyers, but given the increasingly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_to_One">monopolistic bent</a> of all software companies, it can be also true in the consumer space.</p>

<p>This is worrisome, not least because of the tech industry’s continuous attempts to resurrect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_positivism">logical positivism</a>.  Someone who claims their design was conceived from first principles has almost always injected their own biases and incuriosity into those principles.  As coercive abstractions, these designs will preserve whatever is familiar to a small, homogeneous group, and allow everything else to wither away.</p>

<p>Scott offers prescriptions for avoiding the problems he describes, but they’re mostly process-oriented (“take small steps”, “favor reversibility”) and entirely focused on harm reduction.  For Scott, abstraction is always something done to people, never for people.</p>

<p>But this is just one side of the coin; to apply the insights in either book we must understand both kinds of legibility, and what separates them.  To get there, though, we must first explore two works of fiction.</p>

<hr>

<p>The Gnostics were a collection of early Christian sects which fused the gospels with Platonic dualism.<sup id="fnref:gnostics"><a href="#fn:gnostics">2</a></sup>  A true Creator was responsible for the world of ideal forms, while a lesser being, a <strong>demiurge</strong>, was responsible for the pale shadow of our physical world.  For the Gnostics, the work of the demiurge was a veil over our eyes, created out of malice or ineptitude, and their goal was to pierce that veil, to achieve <strong>gnosis</strong>.</p>

<p>Philip K. Dick had a lifelong fascination with the Gnostics, and their ideas appear constantly throughout his novels.  Nowhere is this more evident than in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Stigmata_of_Palmer_Eldritch"><em>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</em></a>.</p>

<p>In the novel, the Earth has become uninhabitably hot, forcing everyone to take shelter in buildings or subterranean structures during the day.  People are being forcibly migrated to even more hardscrabble lives on nearby planets, which can only be escaped via Perky Pat layouts, effectively Barbie Dream Houses they can temporarily inhabit using Can-D, a drug illicitly distributed by the creators of Perky Pat.</p>

<p>Using the drug, users are transported to a single, perfect day in San Francisco, before the Earth became too hot, in the bodies of a wealthy, beautiful couple.  They can accessorize their escapism by purchasing “minned” items, which will appear full-size and functional within Perky Pat’s world.</p>

<p>This is a false gnosis, layering something simple and idealized atop the messiness of the physical world, rather than peeling it back.  False gnosis is a central theme in all of Dick’s writing, which makes him perhaps the only science-fiction author who truly anticipated our present day.  Like everyone else, he failed to predict the smartphone, but he alone seemed to understand how completely technology could intermediate our understanding of the world.<sup id="fnref:cyberspace"><a href="#fn:cyberspace">3</a></sup></p>

<p><em>Three Stigmata</em> begins with the return of Palmer Eldritch, an industrialist who had travelled to Proxima Centauri in search of new business opportunities.  He has brought with him a new drug, Chew-Z, which promises the same escape as Can-D without the need to buy any accessories.</p>

<p>Anyone taking Chew-Z can create their own world to inhabit, but every person in that world takes on aspects of Eldritch himself, sharing his prosthetic hand, eyes, and mouth.  Even as the drug seems to subside, Eldritch remains, making it impossible to know what’s real.</p>

<p>In time, it’s revealed that the returned Eldritch is not the businessman, but rather a dying demiurge who has assumed his form.  He toys with anyone who takes Chew-Z, creating escapist fantasies that prove to be every bit as flawed as their real lives.  By the end, Eldritch has begun to merge with humanity, even infecting people who never touched the drug.</p>

<p>Eldritch doesn’t offer gnosis, but neither does he offer pure escapism like Perky Pat.  He gives humanity an understanding of <em>himself</em>, of the nature of the veil over our eyes.  Even if it tells us nothing of what lays beyond, Dick seems to suggest it’s the most we can hope for.<sup id="fnref:exegesis"><a href="#fn:exegesis">4</a></sup></p>

<p>A different sort of demiurge is portrayed in Italo Calvino’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Cities"><em>Invisible Cities</em></a>, in which Marco Polo tells Kublai Khan of all the cities he’s seen in his travels.  They sit in the Khan’s palace, at the center of an empire which has exceeded his grasp:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is the desperate moment when we discover that this empire, which had seemed to us the sum of all wonders, is an endless, formless ruin, that corruption’s gangrene has spread too far to be healed by our scepter, that the triumph over enemy sovereigns has made us the heirs of their long undoing.  Only in Marco Polo’s accounts was Kublai Khan able to discern, through the walls and towers destined to crumble, the tracery of a pattern so subtle it could escape the termites’ gnawing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His descriptions of the cities, however, are narrow.  In one, he only describes a memory it evokes.  In another, he only describes the relationship between the city and its reflection in the surrounding water.  Sometimes the cities themselves are narrow; one such city has been reduced to freestanding pipes, with attached bathtubs and fountains, populated by nymphs and naiads.</p>

<p>These are pieces of cities, mixed and distilled from everything Polo has seen in his travels.  But at their core, they are facets of a city he never describes, the city he knows best, his birthplace:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And Polo said: “Every time I describe a city I am saying something about Venice.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When I ask you about other cities, I want to hear about them.  And about Venice, when I ask you about Venice.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“To distinguish the other cities’ qualities, I must speak of a first city that remains implicit.  For me it is Venice.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marco Polo is a worldly man, but he is not of the world; he is Venetian, and everything is understood and remembered through that lens.  What he has discovered, in the course of his travels, is that certain pieces of Venice are timeless.  These are what will survive the collapse of the Khan’s empire, what will constantly reoccur throughout time; always different in detail, but unmistakably the same.</p>

<p>And yet Polo, just like Eldritch, does not offer true gnosis.  Each city hides all but a tiny piece of Venice through omission and fantastic obfuscations like the nymphs and naiads.  Unlike Eldritch, however, he offers choice.  The set of cities he describes is neither minimal nor exhaustive; each can be considered or ignored in isolation.</p>

<p>These cities may obscure their underlying reality, but they don’t attempt to replace it.  Instead, they simply reveal a resonance, a commonality of experience we might otherwise have missed.</p>

<hr>

<p>The legibility described in <em>Seeing Like a State</em>, and imposed by Palmer Eldritch, is <strong>singular</strong>; It overrides our own experience, forcing us to live within the mind of its creator.  The legibility described in <em>Image of the City</em>, and offered by Marco Polo, is <strong>faceted</strong>; it complements our own experience, allowing us to apply it where we see fit.</p>

<p>Creating singular legibility is simple: find something that’s easy for you to understand, and force people to use it.  What’s hard is using it responsibly; to predict its full effect, you’d need to first have an exhaustive understanding of the environments in which it will be used.</p>

<p>Faceted legibility is more forgiving, allowing us to understand the world incrementally and collaboratively.  It’s not, however, something we can simply create on our own.  Instead, we can only lay the groundwork and hope it flourishes.</p>

<p>How do we lay the proper groundwork?  It depends on what you’re …</p></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	
		<p>Writing in a thick notebook can be troublesome when you get close to the end of a page. If you're like most people you will encounter a zone where the palm, fingernails or wrist (which I will refer to collectively as "palm") of your writing hand have nowhere to rest, and you may find yourself trying to "float" your hand over the page. As a result, control of the pen-tip becomes enough of an effort to hamper the free-flow of thoughts from the brain through the nervous system to their final conversion to written word.</p>

<p>At best, you get your point across, but usually not without some effort, frustration, and sloppy penmanship.</p>

<p>I suppose one could simply turn to a fresh page before this becomes an issue. That would probably be ok with cheap notebooks, but if you are reading this, yours is probably not cheap, and you intend to wring out all of its value by using every bit of its space.</p>

<p>Thus, as your palm starts to drift off the bottom edge of the page, it needs somewhere to rest...two possible solutions come to mind...one is free, the other cheap:</p>

<p>1. The Smart Phone Trick (free)</p>
<p>2. The Writing Mat (cheap)</p>


<p><strong>The Smart Phone Trick</strong></p>

<p>Placing your smartphone at the bottom of the book at the right point serves as a rest for your palm. It feels like instant relief, at least compared to the alternative of doing nothing at all. It's as if your hand lost its balance at the edge of the page, and the phone is there to catch it.</p>

<p>A smart phone is also a very good thickness (about 10mm) for this purpose. At some point it will be lower than the page you are writing in, and at other points higher, but the differential will never be very great because you won't always need it.</p>

<p>A thin paperback also works well for this purpose, but it can't be too wide or long because it will use up a lot of desk space and may even dig into your forearm. And you'll have to always remember to have it on hand. So, a smartphone is nearly the perfect size....and it is very handy for many of us most of the time. It may take some trial-and-error to figure out exactly when and where you need to deploy the device, but once you do, you will once again find your thoughts freely flowing to any point on the page.</p>

<p>And, as a pen-and-paper person, you may gain some satisfaction from knowing that technology doesn't always exist just for its own sake.</p>


<p><strong>The Writing Mat</strong></p>

<p>Writing mats (sold on this site) are great for enhancing the pen-to-paper connection, and if while writing you press hard with fine points it will protect the lower pages from impressions.</p>

<p>They are also great as a lower extension of the page you are writing on. For that purpose the thin plastic mats seem to work better than the soft mats because they are stiffer and give more support to the palm. But the soft ones work fine too. As you get to that troublesome point on the page, you just keep moving the mat down as long as you need to, and it provides a gentle slope on which your palm can rest.</p>

<p>The mat should be at least the same size as the paper. It can be larger, but larger doesn't have any real advantage other than being able to work with more notebook sizes. They are also harder to carry around. But even if you have the perfect size mat, you have to remember to have it with you, so you may prefer the smart phone trick anyway.</p>


<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>There are many folks that don't write in notebooks because of this very issue, but given these simple solutions it doesn't have to be hard at all. There is also a certain feeling of satisfaction, security and abundance when writing in a thick notebook, and anyone can deploy these or similar tactics in order to get the full experience.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>We hear a lot about APIs as financial institutions open up their services for public access, but webhooks can be just as useful for user experience in personal finance management.</p>
<p>APIs are more passive whereas webhooks are more pro-active.</p>
<p>This makes a difference from a programmatic point of view, which then affects user experience.</p>
<p>You can imagine this difference with e-mail for example.</p>
<p>Imagine a time before push notifications. Without push notification, the manifest practice is to "Check mail". Remember those quaint days when we used to push that Send/Receive button? That's API call for you.</p>
<p>While we can code applications in such a way as to check an API very often, it's not very bandwidth-compute-energy efficient.</p>
<p>Webhooks are much better. Like push notification, applications gets notified when a transaction happens and changes its state accordingly.</p>
<p>Along with the change of state, any other triggers or reactive components can then come alive, a much better pattern :)</p>

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>"As Bitcoin surpasses previous price records and re-enters mainstream consciousness following several wilderness years, the twelve-year-old cryptocurrency appears to have “arrived” in the eyes of the market. The value proposition of an ungoverned, uncensorable digital means of value transfer is clear for all to see…but can humanity and Earth afford the thermodynamic price tag? </p>

<p>To maintain the integrity of the transaction record, the Bitcoin network creates a hard boundary to the outside through exacting validation requirements. However it does not possess any feedback mechanism or capacity to respond to the consequences of the thermoeconomic challenges it issues. This insensitivity of ‘mined’ cryptocurrencies to the energy sources used to secure them has led to criticism as to their inability to mitigate their ecological externalities."</p>

<p><em>by a literal banana</em></p>



<p>As a banana who lives among humans, I am naturally interested in humans, and in the social sciences they use to study themselves. This essay is my current response to the Thiel question: “What important truth do very few people agree with you on?” And my answer is that surveys are bullshit.</p>



<p>In the abstract, I think a lot of people would agree with me that surveys are bullshit. What I don’t think is widely known is how much “knowledge” is based on survey evidence, and what poor evidence it makes in the contexts in which it is used. The nutrition study that claims that eating hot chili peppers makes you live longer is based on surveys. The twin study about the heritability of joining a gang or carrying a gun is based on surveys of young people. The economics study claiming that long commutes reduce happiness is based on surveys, as are all studies of happiness, like the one that claims that people without a college degree are much less happy than they were in the 1970s. The study that claims that pornography is a substitute for marriage is based on surveys. That criminology statistic about domestic violence or sexual assault or drug use or the association of crime with personality factors is almost certainly based on surveys. (Violent crime studies and statistics are particularly likely to be based on extremely cursed instruments, especially the Conflict Tactics Scale, the Sexual Experiences Survey, and their descendants.) Medical studies of pain and fatigue rely on surveys. Almost every study of a psychiatric condition is based on surveys, even if an expert interviewer is taking the survey on the subject’s behalf (e.g. the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale). Many studies that purport to be about suicide are actually based on surveys of suicidal thoughts or behaviors. In the field of political science, election polls and elections themselves are surveys.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What I mean by “surveys” is standard written (or spoken) instruments, composed mostly of language, that are administered to subjects, who give responses, and whose responses are treated as quantitative information, which may then be subjected to statistical analysis. It is not the case that knowledge can never be obtained in this manner. But the idea that there exists some survey, and some survey conditions, that might plausibly produce the knowledge claimed, tends to lead to a mental process of filling in the blanks, of giving the benefit of the doubt to surveys in the ordinary case. But, I think, the ordinary survey, in its ordinary conditions, is of no evidentiary value for any important claim. Just because there exist rare conditions where survey responses tightly map to some condition measurable in other ways does not mean that the vast majority of surveys have any value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Survey evidence seems to be a new phenomenon. Robert Groves (2011) argues that it is a 20th century phenomenon, arising in the 1930s, achieving a golden age from the 1960s to the 1990s, and then falling off in prestige and reliability after that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why is it important that surveys are new? I think it is important to remember that there is no ancestral practice equivalent to surveys. That is to say, there is no ancient human practice or context in which people anonymously tell the pure, innocent truth with language, in response to questioning, with no thought for the motives of the questioner or the effect of their answers. However, in the new, wholly invented ethnomethod of [doing a survey], it is imagined that subjects do tell the innocent truth, comprehending the underlying sense of the question but not answering with any motive or particularity of context. The anonymity of survey takers is given as proof that they feel free to tell the truth, rather than being perceived as a bar to asking them what they might have meant by their responses.</p>



<p>To get at the philosophical weirdness of the survey, it is necessary to dissect the phenomenon of survey-taking in detail. First I will consider the legal perspective, since that is an ancient domain of getting at truth through language in particular contexts.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Surveys and Legal Evidence</strong></p>



<p>The vast majority of evidence in the legal context is and has always been testimonial. That is, a witness testifies in language to communicate some fact to the judge or jury, and the judge or jury then decides how much to believe it. This is true even for modern DNA evidence: the expert witness testifies about the alleged meaning of the laboratory findings, even if documents (also testimony of the writer or preparer) are also given to the trier of fact to examine. Good evidence and garbage evidence are both usually testimony.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the English common law tradition, the biggest rule about testimonial evidence is hearsay. To put it colloquially, the hearsay rule says that testimony has to come from the horse’s mouth. If you saw someone run a red light and crash into a fire truck, you could undergo the ritual of being put under oath (agreeing that negative legal consequences could befall you for untrue speech), and testify about what you saw in court. Then you would be subject to the further ritual of cross-examination, in which all the aspects of your testimony could be questioned: your vision, whether you had your glasses on, where you were positioned, what specifically you mean by “crashed,” your relationship with the driver, and perhaps even whether you had a past conviction for forgery, which might make you seem like a liar in general. Those responsible for deciding whether to believe your testimony would have the chance to look at your face and mannerisms while testifying, to look at your clothes and hair and grooming, to see whether your eyes are bloodshot, in order to judge your responses to questioning. This may seem superficial and unfortunate, but in conversation we make these judgments all the time. And a witness may lose credibility for appearing too slick as often as for appearing too tattered, as in ordinary life.</p>



<p>However, if you wanted to testify about what you heard <em>someone else</em> say, someone who isn’t present for ritual oath-taking and questioning, that would be hearsay, admissible only under a list of exceptions. The exceptions to the hearsay rule are generally contexts in which language evidence is considered particularly likely to be accurate and truthful, such as a record kept in the ordinary course of business, or an emotional shout just after the crash (the idea being that you wouldn’t have time to think up a lie).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Survey evidence, then, is plainly hearsay, since when we hear claims based on survey evidence, we get no opportunity to judge the credibility of the statements as we might in conversation (much less under oath). However, survey evidence is often admissible in legal proceedings, particularly under the much-abused “state of mind” exception. But I think the more common reasoning underlying admission of survey evidence is as stated by a legal scholar at the beginning of the golden age of surveys (Zeisel 1959): “[S]ince surveys provide the best, <strong>if not the only</strong>, evidence on certain issues, and since expert knowledge in the field has advanced sufficiently to protect the trier of the facts from error, the law may well lower its heavy guard” (bolded emphasis mine). In other words, survey evidence is admissible because there’s no other way to get at the underlying facts. Consider trademark confusion: how would one measure whether consumers confuse one mark with another except by asking them in some clever way? The phenomenon of confusion is hidden in the minds of consumers, and can’t be measured with calipers or rulers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even when surveys are the only way to get at some particular knowledge, they may be done well or poorly. Zeisel (1959), citing <em>Coca-Cola v. Nehi Corp.</em>, 27 Del. Ch. 318, 326, 36 A.2d 156 (1944), says:</p>



<blockquote><p>Other aspects of an interview can also become grounds for criticism. Word association tests given to students in a classroom were rejected because their reactions were “bound to differ from that of the buyer in the market place when confronted with the.., beverage …. ” As another court remarked, “the issue is not whether the goods would be confused by a casual observer, but [rather] .. .by a prospective purchaser at the time he considered making the purchase. If the interviewee is not in a buying mood but is just in a friendly mood answering a pollster, his degree of attention is quite different.”</p></blockquote>



<p>That is to say, even though a survey might be the only way to judge the phenomenon of confusion, a college classroom was judged to be sufficiently different from shopping in a store (e.g.) to render the survey meaningless. I find this standard touchingly exacting compared to the present lax standard for taking survey evidence seriously. The present standard seems to be that the more math you do to survey data, the more reliable it is.</p>



<p>The meaning of my title is from a joke told at the end of <em>Annie Hall</em>:</p>



<blockquote><p>I thought of that old joke—you know, this guy goes to a psychiatrist and say doc, my brother’s crazy! He thinks he’s a chicken. And the doc says, why don’t you turn him in? Then the guy says, I would, but I need the eggs. I guess that’s pretty much now how I feel about relationships. They’re totally crazy, irrational, and absurd, but I guess we keep going through it because most of us need the eggs.</p></blockquote>



<p>Surveys are perhaps the only way to get certain information, information about the most important and pressing phenomena, about happiness and suffering in all its forms. These are eggs that most of us need. So even though surveys are bullshit, they are not “turned in” like the unfortunate brother in Woody Allen’s joke, but embraced in a plausibility structure whose maintenance is widespread and in which we are all complicit.</p>



<p><strong>The Phenomenon of the Survey</strong></p>



<p>To understand what’s wrong with surveys, we must alternate between critically examining survey …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="content"><p>As we start a new decade, it’s a good time to reflect on expectations for the next 10 years. Tyler thinks the Great Stagnation <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/12/why-did-the-great-stagnation-end.html">could be ending</a>. Caleb sees <a href="https://www.agglomerations.tech/cracks-in-the-great-stagnation/">cracks</a>. Noah expresses <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/techno-optimism-for-the-2020s">techno-optimism</a>. In this post, my aim is not to predict an end or non-end to stagnation. Rather, it is to think through the particulars of how technology could evolve over the next decade. Then we can assess separately whether we should consider it the Roaring 20s or the Boring 20s.</p><p>What would constitute an end to the Great Stagnation? Any precise cutoff will be arbitrary, but for the sake of discussion, let’s say sustained growth in <a href="https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/indicators-data/total-factor-productivity-tfp/">utilization-adjusted total factor productivity</a> of 2 percent per year. By comparison, mean utilization-adjusted TFP growth from 1947 through 1972 was 2.1 percent. Since 2005, it has been 0.17 percent. (Note: it is important to use the utilization-adjusted series, as this corrects for the business cycle.)</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/a7a8a1d9e4c4d1050c2902966a316436559074f1/cd6b6/img/tfp.png" alt="Total factor productivity in the U.S. since 1947" title="Total factor productivity in the U.S. since 1947"></p><p>Whatever your cutoff for TFP growth, one of my convictions is that scientific breakthroughs alone are not enough to drive an end to the Great Stagnation. TFP only budges when new technologies are adopted at scale, and generally this means products, not just science. Science lays critical groundwork for new technology, but after all the science is done, much work remains. Someone must shepherd the breakthrough to the product stage, where it can actually affect TFP. This means building businesses, surmounting regulatory obstacles, and scaling production.</p><p>With that caveat firmly in mind, what will the next decade bring in terms of meaningful technological change? Here’s what I’m watching.</p><h2 id="biotech-and-health">Biotech and health</h2><p>We are coming off a huge win: two new mRNA COVID vaccines, conceived and brought to market in less than a year. The ability to encode and deploy arbitrary mRNA in our bodies sure seems like a game changer—it allows us to essentially program our cells to make whatever proteins we want. In the case of the COVID vaccines, the vaccine payload instructs our cells to make the coronavirus spike protein, which our immune system then learns to attack. Bert Hubert has a <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/">fascinating write-up</a> of the “code” in the vaccine.</p><p>Bringing a brand new vaccine to market in less than a year—using a never-before-applied-in-humans-at-scale technology no less—is a world record, but it could have been even faster. As David Wallace-Wells <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/12/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-design.html">emphasizes</a>, Moderna’s vaccine was designed by January 13. We had it the whole time. Some delay was necessary to determine effective dosing. Some further regulatory delay may have been warranted to ensure the vaccine was safe and to ascertain its efficacy. But as Wallace-Wells indicates, the regulatory outcome was never really in doubt. “None of the scientists I spoke to for this story were at all surprised by either outcome,” he writes. “All said they expected the vaccines were safe and effective all along.”</p><p>What should we make of the fact that all of the scientists knew all along that Moderna’s vaccine would work? The question in my mind is: what other mRNA treatments do we have the whole time? What if I told you Moderna has an <a href="https://www.poz.com/article/experimental-hiv-vaccine-stimulates-production-neutralizing-antibodies">HIV vaccine candidate</a>? HIV lacks SARS-CoV-2’s telltale spike protein and thus may prove a more challenging foe—but don’t you wonder, if we treated the problem with real urgency, whether new mRNA technology could wipe out the AIDS epidemic this decade? I do.</p><p>And mRNA technology can be deployed against more than just viruses. Both Moderna and BioNTech have personalized vaccine candidates targeting cancer. Although called a “cancer vaccine,” the treatment is only administered once the subject has cancer—it isn’t preventative. The companies use an algorithm to analyze the genetic sequences of the tumor and the patient’s healthy cells and predict which molecules could be used to generate a strong immune response against the cancer. “I was actually witnessing the cancer cells shrinking before my eyes,” <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03072-8">said</a> Brad Kremer, a melanoma patient who received the BioNTech treatment. So let’s milk mRNA technology for all it’s worth this decade. It can save us from more than just a pandemic.</p><p>What about CRISPR? It is a great example of a technology that has not yet made a meaningful economic contribution. Although the technique for editing DNA was discovered in 2012—and a Nobel Prize was awarded to its two discoverers this year—no treatment using CRISPR has been approved outside of clinical trials. So far, its impact has been limited to making researchers more productive—not a bad thing, to be sure, but not close to CRISPR’s full potential. As trials progress, however, I do think some CRISPR treatments will come online in the next few years, especially those targeting genetic disorders that we have very limited means of otherwise treating.</p><p>DeepMind’s <a href="https://medium.com/cgo-benchmark/deepminds-protein-folding-solution-what-just-happened-279d32e8d0f">protein-folding breakthrough</a> signals a promising decade for the science of proteomics. Most directly, being able to predict protein shapes will enable us to discover drugs more rapidly. Buuuut, because drug trials take many years, we might expect this technology not to really be felt by the general public until the 2030s.</p><p>What DeepMind’s achievement indicates to me the most is that machine learning is actually useful. This might seem obvious, but consider: most applications of machine learning so far—excluding autonomous vehicles, which have themselves not really arrived yet—are toys. I love watching AlphaZero crush Stockfish on YouTube, but chess is literally a game. GPT-3 produced some fun demos. AlphaFold heralds something different—non-toy superhuman performance is now here, and I am interested to see what else it can do. Aside from the aforementioned AVs, I expect it to be applied widely in other areas of biology. Again, it will take a long time for the breakthroughs to trickle down into products, but at least the 2030s should be sick. I mean, not sick. Healthy.</p><p>Let’s talk about life extension, one of my favorite biotech topics. 2020 was a big year for the Conboy Lab at Berkeley, which proved that all the weird past findings about “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabiosis">young blood</a>” extending life were not actually due to any elixir in the blood of children (thank goodness). Rather, the rejuvenating aspects of young blood experiments were due to the dilution of harmful factors in old blood. By mechanically removing plasma and replacing it with saline and enough albumin to replace what was taken out, they diluted aged blood factors in both mice and humans and were able to <a href="https://www.aging-us.com/article/103418/text#fulltext">rejuvenate germ layer tissues</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-020-00297-8">improve cognition by reducing neuroinflammation</a>.</p><p>These findings are exciting not only because they represent a scientific advance in understanding aging, but also because they herald the first real anti-aging product that could come to market. Therapeutic plasma exchange is FDA-approved (not for aging, but for a bunch of other conditions). I imagine there remain prohibitions on advertising that it can add years to your life, but it is safe, and a doctor can prescribe it off label. It’s also cheap. An automated plasmapheresis machine—which lets you do treatment after treatment—can be bought online for under $3,000. That is less than the cost of a single transfusion of young blood sold by the startup <a href="https://www.ambrosiaplasma.com/">Ambrosia</a>. How long until someone opens a clinic offering plasma dilution? I bet someone tries it in 2021. If it works, people will get over the weirdness, and it could be commonplace by 2030.</p><p>Another longevity product that is about to get hot: aging clocks based on DNA methylation or proteomics. Do you want to know how biologically old you are? Today, for a few hundred dollars, you can get a test that will tell you. As these tests become better and cheaper, self-experimenters are going to have a field day. Doing before-and-after aging tests, anyone who can get their hands on human growth hormone could replicate the protocol used by <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acel.13028">Fahy et al.</a> to rejuvenate the thymus. As the thymus is a critical element of the immune system, decline of which is a critical factor in aging, this is non-trivial rejuvenation. The Fahy study found that 12 months of treatment created about 2.5 years of epigenetic rejuvenation, with results accelerating in the last quarter of the trial.</p><p>There is a lot more in the <a href="https://www.lifespan.io/road-maps/the-rejuvenation-roadmap/">Rejuvenation Roadmap</a>—dozens of possible life-extending treatments are at various stages of development. There’s a good chance a few senolytic drugs will be approved by the end of the decade. As I noted <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/12/30/anti-aging-research-health-care-spending-biden/">yesterday at Fortune</a>, we spend less than 1% of the NIH budget on aging biology—we should raise that by a lot.</p><p>Unlike others, I am not-so-bullish on metformin. It does seem to reduce all-cause mortality in Americans, but it may do so because <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/met.2018.0105">88% of Americans are metabolically unhealthy</a>. If you are one of the 12%, and you should strive to be, I don’t think metformin will do much for you.</p><p>One final biotech observation: every year, the Apple Watch gets a new health-related sensor. This year it was blood oxygen, pretty good for detecting if you might have COVID! Fast forward to 2030 and wearables will have at least 10 more health-related sensors than they do today. Some no-brainers are body temperature, blood pressure, and blood glucose sensors. What will the other 7 be? At some point, it becomes possible to replace a lot of primary care with continuous monitoring. A few smart algorithms to provide simple medical advice could improve population-level health without much cost. More data could also yield faster, more accurate, and of course more remote diagnoses when you do have to see a doctor.</p><p>There is a lot in biotech that is promising right now, but in more than any other field, it is important not to be seduced by the sexy headlines showing rapid scientific progress. Don’t get complacent. Biology is proceeding faster than medical productivity because a lot of the wonderful discoveries are not being translated into approved treatments and products at a decent rate. Let’s salute and cheer for the discoveries, but spare many thoughts for the entrepreneurs trying to bring treatments to market.</p><h2 id="energy">Energy</h2><p>The 2010s were the …</p></article></div>

            <h3>Controls</h3>
            <p>
                Use the arrow keys to move left and right. Press down to soft
                drop. Use Z and X to rotate. Press enter to pause/unpause. Press
                escape to quick reset.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Pieces</h3>
            <p>
                There are 7 pieces total. There are 6 pieces made out of every
                possible configuration of 3 triangles, and 1 piece made out of a
                single triangle, which will always spawn in groups of 3.
                <img src="https://goel25.github.io/tritris/assets/allPieces.png">
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Mechanics</h3>
            <p>
                The mechanics are very similar to NES Tetris. It uses the same
                DAS, entry delay, and level speed timings.<br>
                All of the pieces are made out of 3 connected right triangles.
                There is also a white, single triangle piece which can be used
                to fix holes in your stack. It will always come out 3 at a time.
                The single triangle is also special, lines will only be cleared
                once they have all been placed. This allows you to fill 3 lines
                to score a Tritris!
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Phasing</h3>
            <p>
                <b>IMPORTANT - Since the release of the Youtube video, phasing
                    has become easier. There are no longer any frame-perfect
                    tricks. Instead, all phases can be performed by holding each
                    key (rotate can now be held to become "charged").</b>
                <br>
                One of the most unique mechanics of Tritris is phasing. A piece
                will always move to the next location as long as the next
                location is valid (no intersecting triangles). By moving a piece
                in multiple ways at the same time, pieces are able to do many
                types of tucks and spins. Below are a few examples.
            </p>
            <div>
                <div>
                    <p><img src="https://goel25.github.io/tritris/assets/down.gif"></p><p>
                        The pieces are able to easily move down into an empty
                        space.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p><img src="https://goel25.github.io/tritris/assets/downRotate.gif"></p><p>
                        For the bottom right triangle, X (rotate) is held once
                        above the desired position.
                        <b>Due to the phasing update, down does not need to be pressed.</b>
                        Once all 3 triangles are placed, the line clears.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p><img src="https://goel25.github.io/tritris/assets/downMove.gif"></p><p>
                        Left or right are held when the piece is above the
                        desired position, and when the piece moves down, it also
                        moves horizontally.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p><img src="https://goel25.github.io/tritris/assets/multiple.gif"></p><p>Here are a few examples of some phases!</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <hr>

            <h3>Scoring</h3>
            <div>
                <div>
                    <p><img src="https://goel25.github.io/tritris/assets/tritris.gif"></p><p>A Tritris is scored!</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    In Tritris, clearing 4 lines at a time is not possible, so
                    the highest score value is obtained from 3 lines at a time,
                    a Tritris. This can only be achieved by settings up 3 rows,
                    each missing only one triangle, then placing a single
                    triangle in each row. Once all triangles are placed, the
                    rows clear and a Tritris is scored!
                    <br>
                    A triple is equivalent to a Tetris in NES Tetris, a double
                    is equivalent to a triple, and a single is equivalent to a
                    double.
                </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s still magic even if you know how it’s done.</p>
<p>— Terry Pratchett</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Software is now as essential to research as telescopes, test tubes, and reference libraries.
This means that researchers <em>need</em> to know how to build, check, use, and share programs.
However,
most introductions to programming focus on developing commercial applications,
not on exploring problems whose answers aren’t yet known.
Our goal is to show you how to do that,
both on your own and as part of a team.</p>
<p>We believe every researcher should know
how to write short programs that clean and analyze data in a reproducible way
and how to use version control to keep track of what they have done.
But just as some astronomers spend their careers designing telescopes,
some researchers focus on building the software that makes research possible.
People who do this are called <a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/glossary.html#rse">research software engineers</a>;
the aim of this book is to get you ready for this role by helping you go from
writing code for yourself to creating tools that help your entire field advance.</p>
<div id="intro-big-picture">
<h2> The Big Picture</h2>
<p>Our approach to research software engineering is based on three related concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/glossary.html#open_science">Open science</a>: Making data, methods, and results
freely available to all by publishing them under <a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/glossary.html#open_license">open
licenses</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/glossary.html#reproducible_research">Reproducible research</a>: Ensuring that anyone
with access to the data and software can feasibly reproduce results, both to
check them and to build on them.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/glossary.html#sustainable_software">Sustainable software</a>: The ease with which to
maintain and extend it rather than to replace it. Sustainability isn’t
just a property of the software: it also depends on the skills and culture
of its users.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>People often conflate these three ideas,
but they are distinct.
For example,
if you share your data and the programs that analyze it,
but don’t document what steps to take in what order,
your work is open but not reproducible.
Conversely,
if you completely automate your analysis,
but your data is only available to people in your lab,
your work is reproducible but not open.
Finally,
if a software package is being maintained by a couple of post-docs
who are being paid a fraction of what they could earn in industry
and have no realistic hope of promotion because their field doesn’t value tool building,
then sooner or later it will become <a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/glossary.html#abandonware">abandonware</a>,
at which point openness and reproducibility become less relevant.</p>
<p>Nobody argues that research should be irreproducible or unsustainable,
but “not against it” and actively supporting it are very different things.
Academia doesn’t yet know how to reward people for writing useful software,
so while you may be thanked,
the effort you put in may not translate into academic job security or decent pay.</p>
<p>Some people worry that if they make their data and code publicly available,
someone else will use it and publish a result they could have come up with themselves.
This is almost unheard of in practice,
but that doesn’t stop it being used as a scare tactic.
Other people are afraid of looking foolish or incompetent by sharing code that might contain bugs.
This isn’t just <a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/glossary.html#impostor_syndrome">impostor syndrome</a>:
members of marginalized groups are frequently judged more harshly than others,
so being wrong in public is much riskier for them.</p>
<p>With this course, we hope to give researchers the tools and knowledge to be
better research software developers, to be more efficient in their work, make
less mistakes, and work more openly and reproducibly.
We hope that by having more researchers with these skills and knowledge,
research culture can improve to address the issues raised above.</p>
</div>
<div id="intro-personas">
<h2> Intended Audience</h2>
<p>This book is written for researchers who are already using Python for their data analysis,
but who want to take their coding and software development to the next level.
You don’t have to be highly proficient with Python,
but you should already be comfortable doing things like reading data from files
and writing loops, conditionals, and functions.
The following personas are examples of the types of people
that are our target audience.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Amira Khan</dt>
<dd>completed a master’s in library science five years ago
and has since worked for a small aid organization.
She did some statistics during her degree,
and has learned some R and Python by doing data science courses online,
but has no formal training in programming.
Amira would like to tidy up the scripts, data sets, and reports she has created
in order to share them with her colleagues.
These lessons will show her how to do this.
</dd>
<dt>Jun Hsu</dt>
<dd>completed an <a href="https://www.insightdatascience.com/">Insight Data Science</a> fellowship last year after doing a PhD in Geology
and now works for a company that does forensic audits.
He uses a variety of machine learning and visualization packages,
and would now like to turn some of his own work into an open source project.
This book will show him how such a project should be organized
and how to encourage people to contribute to it.
</dd>
<dt>Sami Virtanen</dt>
<dd>became a competent programmer during a bachelor’s degree in applied math
and was then hired by the university’s research computing center.
The kinds of applications they are being asked to support
have shifted from fluid dynamics to data analysis;
this guide will teach them how to build and run data pipelines
so that they can pass those skills on to their users.
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div id="intro-syllabus">
<h2> What You Will Learn</h2>
<p>Rather than simply providing reference material about good coding practices,
the book follows Amira and Sami as they work together to write an actual software package
to address a real research question.
The data analysis task that we focus on
relates to a fascinating result in the field of quantitative linguistics.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law">Zipf’s Law</a> states that the second most common word in a body of text
appears half as often as the most common,
the third most common appears a third as often, and so on.
To test whether Zipf’s Law holds for a collection of classic novels
that are freely available from <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>,
we write a software package that counts and analyzes the word frequency distribution
in any arbitrary body of text.</p>
<p>In the process of writing and publishing a Python package to verify Zipf’s Law,
we will show you how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organize small and medium-sized data science projects.</li>
<li>Use the Unix shell to efficiently manage your data and code.</li>
<li>Write Python programs that can be used on the command line.</li>
<li>Use Git and GitHub to track and share your work.</li>
<li>Work productively in a small team where everyone is welcome.</li>
<li>Use Make to automate complex workflows.</li>
<li>Enable users to configure your software without modifying it directly.</li>
<li>Test your software and know which parts have not yet been tested.</li>
<li>Find, handle, and fix errors in your code.</li>
<li>Publish your code and research in open and reproducible ways.</li>
<li>Create Python packages that can be installed in standard ways.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="intro-using">
<h2> Using this Book</h2>
<p>This book was written to be used as the material for a (potentially) semester
long course at the university level,
although it can also be used for independent self-study.
Participatory live-coding is the anticipated style for teaching the material,
rather than lectures simply talking about the code presented <span>(Brown and Wilson <a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/references.html#ref-Brow2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>; Wilson <a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/references.html#ref-Wils2018" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a><a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/references.html#ref-Wils2018" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span>.
The chapters and their content are generally designed to be used in the order
given.</p>
<p>Chapters are structured with the introduction at the start, content in the middle,
and exercises at the end. Callout boxes are interspersed throughout the content
to be used as a supplement to the main text,
but not a requirement for the course overall.
Early chapters have many small exercises;
later chapters have fewer but larger exercises.
In order to break up long periods of live-coding while teaching,
it may be preferable to stop and complete some of the exercises
at key points throughout the chapter,
rather than waiting until the end.
Possible exercise solutions are provided (Appendix&nbsp;<a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/solutions.html#solutions">A</a>),
in addition to learning objectives (Appendix <a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/objectives.html#objectives">B</a>)
and key points (Appendix <a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/keypoints.html#keypoints">C</a>) for each chapter.</p>

				<p>Recently I have been spending time on improving the performance of <a href="https://github.com/andrewchambers/bupstash">bupstash</a> (my encrypted backup tool), and wanted to compare it to some existing tools to try and find its relative performance in the backup tool landscape.</p>
<p>This post compares <a href="https://github.com/andrewchambers/bupstash">bupstash</a>, <a href="https://restic.net/">restic</a>, <a href="https://www.borgbackup.org/">borg backup</a> and plain old tar + gzip + GPG across a series of simple benchmarks.</p>
<p>What do all these tools have in common?</p>
<ul>
<li>They encrypt data at rest.</li>
<li>They compress data.</li>
<li>They have some form of incremental and/or deduplicated snapshotting.</li>
<li>They are all pretty great backup systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to checkout the project websites to learn more, let’s get to the benchmarks.</p>
<h2 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks</h2>
<p>For these tests we are using the following versions of the given software:</p>
<ul>
<li>GNU tar 1.32 + gzip 1.10 + GPG 2.2.23</li>
<li>Bupstash 0.6.1</li>
<li>Borg 1.1.14</li>
<li>Restic 0.11.0</li>
</ul>
<p>The test machine has an AMD Ryzen Threadripper 1950X 16-Core Processor with 16 GB of ram, and an NVMe SSD hard drive. It is probably best to simply compare results relatively, as reproducing my test environment exactly would be difficult.</p>
<p>The scripts I used for my benchmarking can be found <a href="https://github.com/andrewchambers/EncryptedBackupShootout">here</a>, though they will definitely need tweaking for your environment.</p>
<h3 id="deduplication-and-compression">Deduplication and compression</h3>
<p>For this benchmark we take 20 different consecutive versions of the linux kernel source code and add them all to the same directory, we then create a snapshot and measure the size of the resulting tarball/repository.</p>
<p>The linux kernel versions chosen for this test are all the consecutive git commits preceeding version 5.9, with the resulting directory containing 21 GB of uncompressed files.</p>

<p>This benchmark shows the advantage the more sophisticated tools have over plain tarballs, they all have extremely good compression ratios when similar data is added multiple times to
a backup repository.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-fresh-directory-snapshot">Creating a fresh directory snapshot</h3>
<p>For this benchmark we are snapshotting a copy of the linux
5.9.8 source code.</p>
<p>The directory we are snapshotting is 1.1 GB comprised of 74725 files and directories.</p>
<p>The snapshots are all made to tmpfs so hopefully does not measure delays introduced by the network or disk activity.</p>

<p>Bupstash is the clear winner here for raw snapshotting speed.</p>
<h3 id="sending-a-fresh-snapshot-to-a-remote-server">Sending a fresh snapshot to a remote server</h3>
<p>This benchmark is the same as the fresh local snapshot benchmark except the files are sent to a remote server hosted on google cloud via ssh. This benchmark should only be considered an approximation of the effect latency has on the tool performance as it is so dependent on network speeds.</p>
<p>At the time of benchmarking my connection to the remote server can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>server -&gt; client 10MiB/s</li>
<li>client -&gt; client 2.5MiB/s</li>
<li>ping 32 milliseconds</li>

<p>Plain tar takes the win, Restic performs poorly here, it has a far more latency-sensitive upload protocol.</p>
<h3 id="creating-an-incremental-directory-snapshot">Creating an incremental directory snapshot</h3>
<p>This benchmark is the same as the fresh local snapshot benchmark, except now we measure the time for an incremental snapshot using the builtin caching mechanism of the tools. What this means is each tool keeps a record of what files it has already sent, and is able to
skip doing that work again.</p>

</details>
<p>Incremental tar is the clear winner here, but why are the other tools slower? I think this is mainly because the other tools present each snapshot to the user as a full backup and thus do extra work to spare the end user from managing incremental backups manually.</p>
<p>It is also interesting to me that <code>bupstash put</code> is an order of magnitude faster than the other similar tools, though I currently can not explain clearly why that may be the case.</p>
<h3 id="sending-an-incremental-snapshot-to-a-remote-server">Sending an incremental snapshot to a remote server</h3>
<p>This benchmark is the same as the incremental local snapshot benchmark except the files are sent to a remote server hosted on google cloud via ssh.</p>
<p>Benchmark conditions are the same as the fresh remote snapshot benchmark.</p>

<p>These results match closely with the local incremental snapshots.</p>
<h3 id="restoring-a-snapshot">Restoring a snapshot</h3>
<p>In this benchmark we will restore the snapshot made in the fresh local snapshot benchmark to tmpfs. This is what measuring what happens when you need to do a bulk disaster recovery from your backup repository.</p>

<p>Bupstash is the winner for restoring backups.</p>
<h3 id="restoring-a-snapshot-from-a-remote-server">Restoring a snapshot from a remote server</h3>
<p>In this benchmark we will restore the snapshot made in the fresh remote snapshot benchmark to tmpfs. The main difference from the previous benchmark is the introduction of
an internet connection between the backup repository and restore point.</p>
<p>Network conditions are the same as the fresh network snapshot benchmark.</p>

</details>
<p>Interestingly, the introduction of the network pushed tar ahead of bupstash for backup restoration - this is something I am very interested in investigating further.</p>
<h3 id="pruning-an-old-backup">Pruning an old backup</h3>
<p>In this benchmark we will be removing an old snapshot from the backup repository on the same computer. For this test we generate a backup repository with 50 different snapshots of different versions of the linux kernel source code and then time how long it takes to remove one of the snapshots. This benchmark simulates
cycling old backups out of your backup repository when you no longer need them.</p>
<p>Tar with incremental backups does not easily support pruning of old backups, so does not participate in this benchmark.</p>

<p>The bupstash garbage collector is an order of magnitue faster than both restic and borg at pruning the backup repository.</p>
<h3 id="pruning-an-old-backup-on-a-remote-server">Pruning an old backup on a remote server</h3>
<p>In this benchmark we will be removing an old snapshot from the backup repository stored on a remote server. The remote server is the same as the one used in fresh remote snapshot benchmark, and the test data is the same as the local prune bench mark.</p>

<p>Once again restic suffers the worst from introduced network latency of all the tools.</p>
<h3 id="approximate-peak-client-side-ram-usage">Approximate peak client side ram usage</h3>
<p>For this benchmark we repeat the fresh snapshot benchmark, but measure the peak client ram usage (RSS) as reported by the ‘time’ command. For tar we approximate this by summing the peak memory usage across tar, gpg and gzip.</p>

<p>Bupstash is very memory-efficient compared to restic and borg, but ultimately loses out to the simplicity of tar + gzip + GPG.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions-and-discussion">Conclusions and discussion</h2>
<p>GNU Tar + gzip + gpg is an excellent encrypted backup option and performed better than I expected. I think tar and gpg is still a great choice for users who prefer to DIY their own backup scripts. With this in mind, we must ask what are the problems with tar that the other tools address? My opinion is that managing
incremental backups, deduplication, pruning, and searching backups are far more difficult when using incremental tar compared to borg/restic/bupstash. With incremental tar, it quickly becomes quite hard to track which incremental
tarballs depend on eachother and you often need to periodically do full snapshots - losing most of the speed benefits.</p>
<p>As the biased author of bupstash, I am also pleased with how it has performed and hope I can push it further in the future. Restic, while fast at local operation, seems to trail the other tools when network latency is thrown into the mix. Borg is an all-around great tool and performed very well.</p>
<p>I can see both strengths and room for improvement in each of the tools tested, and encourage everyone to give them a try for yourself if you haven’t already.</p>
<p>As always, thank you for your time and see you next time :).</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The blog post <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/articles/i-want-off-mr-golangs-wild-ride">“I want off Mr. Golang’s Wild Ride”</a> by Amos incited
me to write a comment on its <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25616593">HN</a> submission page. But as the comment ran 5
paragraphs long, I have turned it into this blog post.</p>

<p>It is a well written and in-depth look at the rot inside the Golang ecosystem.
Make sure to read to the end and notice that the rot started at the core
contributors level.</p>

<p>Golang’s tagline, from their <a href="https://github.com/golang/go">repository</a>, is “Go is an open source
programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient
software.”</p>

<p>Reading this post by Amos should make it clear to you that Golang has succeeded
ONLY in the “simple” part of the claim; unless written with extreme care,
programs written in Golang are neither reliable, nor efficient.</p>

<p>Amos presents some examples of why I have disliked Golang since the beginning.
After having used Golang for a few years seriously, I disliked it enough to
start a fork of the language named <a href="https://github.com/gurjeet/gofy/tree/gofy">GoFY</a>. I named the language as such
because, since the beginning when I saw some of initial presentations by Rob
Pike specifically, and some others’ presentations and blog posts generally, they
had an air of ego when dismissing others’ opinions and concerns, and appeared to
say “these are our decisions, that is how it is, and if you don’t like it, Go
F*** Yourself”. So the project name was a GoFY to them back, from me.</p>

<p>I’m sure it looks a great language from afar, and for newcomers. But as a
seasoned developer who has seen a few other languages in thier lifetime, you
will quickly begin to see the problems with the language and the ecosystem
around it.  The astute among you may notice that in my <a href="https://gurjeet.singh.im/blog/persistence-perseverance">post yesterday</a> I
did not claim to be an expert in Golang; it’s hard to be an expert in something
that’s fragile, flaky and full of special cases. For the same reason I
never took up using MySQL; I have heard enough stories of its flakiness and
special cases that it never looked like a solid technology to me. I openly and
whole-heartedly recommend learning and using <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">Postgres</a> to anyone who would
listen.</p>

<p>Fortunately I did not invest any more time in it other than to document a few
times in section <a href="https://github.com/gurjeet/gofy/tree/gofy#gofy-desired-differences">“GoFY Desired Differences”</a> as to what I would
like to see different in the GoFY language, which in turn would make it better
than Golang, at least for long-time systems developers like myself. I am glad I
didn’t burn any oil on it because creating a new language, even a fork, is
neither easy nor quick.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>In the modern nation state, courts ("justice") operate with the threat of violence. The exact way a dispute is settled varies (jury, single judge, etc.), but the "finality" of the resolution they provide is based on the fact that the state asserts the final say, and if you don't agree, it doesn't matter, because they have men with guns. Importantly, they don't just have <em>some</em> men with guns (that's something <em>you</em> might have, too), they have an overwhelming number of men and increasingly large guns depending on how much you don't want to accept their say.</p>
<p>If you are thinking "that's a stupidly over-simplified way of thinking about modern justice systems", then that's fine; a lot of what follows is precisely about the <em>finesse</em> around this simplified view of the world.</p>
<h3>The threat is stronger than its execution</h3>
<p>This aphorism comes from the world of chess (as far as I gather); it's somehow both obvious but also subtle at the same time.
Forgive the sidetrack, but it reminds me of the possible originator of this phrase, a controversial figure in the history of chess - Aron Nimzowitsch. One (apocryphal?) <a href="http://www.caissa.com/ext/bulletin/ms/tlda0000/fms1221935698008892000004-%22Why-must-I-lose-to-this-IDIOT-%22">story</a> of him features him pointing at his grandmaster opponent and loudly proclaiming "Why must I lose to this idiot?!". But to the matter in hand - Nimzowitsch wrote one of the most famous early-ish treatises on chess strategy called "My System".</p>
<p><img src="https://joinmarket.me/images/aronsystem.jpeg" width="436" height="436"></p>
<p>in this book he popularised (amongst many other less controversial things) the idea of <strong>overprotection</strong> - so for example, you have a pawn on square e5, and he considered it good strategy to protect it with a knight on f3, a rook on e1 and a bishop on g3 etc. etc. Many players - indeed top grandmasters - today find this idea faintly ridiculous. What interests me is that when they deride the idea they essentially never give credence to the element of truth it surely contains, which is this: if N &gt; 1 pieces protect a key square, it means that <em>any</em> of them can move without losing protection of that square. In other words the <em>potential</em> for <em>any</em> piece to move is preserved (contrasted with a single protector, which is therefore bound and cannot move away from protection).</p>
<p><img src="https://joinmarket.me/images/overprotection.png" width="436" height="436"></p>
<p>The idea behind the phrase "the threat is stronger than its execution" - which sounds paradoxical at first - is similar. Potentiality is more difficult for the adversary to handle than actuality, mostly because the adversary may have to handle many potential actions, rather than the one that is actualised.</p>
<p>This can manifest psychologically - inducing <em>fear</em> in an enemy is often a very excellent strategy, rather than directly attacking them. But it's important to understand that it's not just mind games. It's a matter of economy, and a matter of abstraction. Just like in the development of quantitative disciplines (all the way from early mathematics to modern computer programming, and much modern science), the development of abstractions allows for economy, which maximally leverages resources, and even open up whole new dimensions that were previously inaccessible.</p>
<h3>The virtualization of violence</h3>
<p>This line of thinking naturally leads us to how violence as a concrete actualization of will tends to get abstracted away. This is seen across nature, <em>not</em> only in human societies. It's well understood how access to mating in social animals (various types of mammals) is "arbitrated" through combat, and importantly, the combat is rarely to-the-death. Even more strikingly, the "combat" is reduced to competition over attributes <em>which might allow for better success in combat</em>. The obvious example is the stag's antlers:</p>
<p><img src="https://joinmarket.me/images/antlers1.jpeg" width="436" height="436"></p>
<p>That's a lot of physical raw material, requiring a lot of nutrition, and with unclear direct utility (very inefficient!). These are only a quasi-abstraction from real horns designed to kill - they <em>can</em> kill other stags, but apparently it's very rare, but they have evolved to be very visually assessable by other stags, and their complex geometry allows for battles ("horns locked") which are more of an assessment of the ability to kill, than an attempt to do so. There are of course many further examples that are more obviously abstractions. Further, displays may not be of attributes designed to inflict violence, but attributes that display high levels of general fitness, which itself is an abstraction from "ability to gather a lot of resources". The peacock being the most famous visually striking example, albeit the exact mechanisms involved may not be a matter of settled science.</p>
<p>i<img src="https://joinmarket.me/images/peacock.jpg" width="436" height="436"></p>
<p>I will leave the biologists to extend this list further with more obscure examples...</p>
<p>A rather interesting summary of one perspective on these phenomena is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handicap_principle">the handicap principle</a> (which somehow I had not read before writing most of this document, and as you will understand from reading it, I now rather wish I had!).</p>
<p>Also, the two examples we've seen so far show how there are two sides to this phenomenon: show dominance by showing the <em>ability</em> to win a fight without fighting; show superior suitability by showing the <em>ability</em> to gather resources without actually gathering resources. They are clearly not <em>completely</em> distinct.</p>
<h3>The same in modern human society</h3>
<p>We can see both types of 'abstraction' very clearly even in modern society. The violence-competition is virtualized in sport, most obviously:</p>
<p><img src="https://joinmarket.me/images/gridiron.jpeg" width="436" height="436"></p>
<p>(It's probably not an accident that in many places, sportsmen are pretty much at the top of the mating hierarchy, at least to some females!). But lest we get <em>too</em> abstract, let's not forget that just generally, displays of violence <em>capability</em> are also a big part of human society, even at the nation-state level:</p>
<p><img src="https://joinmarket.me/images/militaryparadewithtanks.jpeg" width="436" height="436"></p>
<p>Once we start thinking about human behaviour this way, we can see it everywhere. Consider the engagement ring and ask yourself where this tradition might come from:</p>
<p><img src="https://joinmarket.me/images/engagementring.jpeg" width="436" height="436"></p>
<p>We are not so different from peacocks here ... and it's not of course "irrational" in any but the most inane sense. Look at the analogy between the peacock's display and the engagement ring more closely, both:</p>
<ul>
<li>are costly in resources to create</li>
<li>are visually appealing</li>
<li>are (visually) very distinct from the normal "stuff" in the environment</li>
<li>are very immediately and easily recognized <em>by any viewer, on their own</em></li>
<li>signal that the creator is part of a group (genetic, or cultural)</li>
</ul>
<p>Much less obvious I think is that the <em>permanence</em> of these displays is not central. Sometimes they are very delicate and fragile (think: flowers, think: sports displays with substantial risk of injury that would cause permanent inability to repeat them), and this is <em>almost</em> the point - to the receiver of the signal, what matters is that the signal was unambiguously difficult to create. What matters much less is the "substrate", i.e. what the signal is "made of". This is part of the insight in the "handicap principle":</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>what matters is what you <em>couldn't</em> do, because you did this.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://joinmarket.me/images/smallbirdinjungle.jpeg" width="436" height="436"></p>
<p>Further, imagine yourself as a small bird in the jungle - to find mating partners in this <strong>extremely</strong> noisy environment, you are looking for a small signal - a patch of bright colour - in this high noise environment. You want the signal to be unambiguous - blue where everything is green, yellow, brown, red - and costly. You don't want to have to compare it to something else to check it's correct (is it the same color as something else on the other side of the jungle? sheesh!). You really don't care about semantics - you don't care what the signal "means", except specifically that it's in some sense pre-agreed (perhaps genetically? see the last bullet point); to an outsider the signal could be outlandish or ridiculous, and that doesn't matter.</p>
<h3>The court, the bank, and the abstraction of money</h3>
<p><img src="https://joinmarket.me/images/bankofmontreal.jpeg" width="436" height="436"></p>
<p>You can see it in architecture; there is of course a very good reason why historically banks were built of extremely sturdy materials, at considerable cost. They were originally actually vaults for high concentrations of physical wealth, and had to protect well from direct frontal assault.</p>
<p><img src="https://joinmarket.me/images/hongkong.jpeg" width="436" height="436"></p>
<p>Nowadays this is another abstraction of the type already mentioned; if an organization put <em>that</em> much money into building such an imposing building or flashy skyscraper, they're hardly likely to steal my pathetic little stash! Court buildings likewise represent an abstraction of the state's power, and so do government offices (this is particularly obvious in more authoritarian states like China, where the government buildings in smaller towns look almost absurd (this example is very typical, in Luxian):</p>
<p><img src="https://joinmarket.me/images/luxian.jpeg" width="436" height="436"></p>
<p>The whole "virtualization" paradigm, taking concrete physical force and replacing it with "threats, stronger than executions" has entirely entered the realm of money too. Not to dip my toe into the various debates about the origin of money, I'll just talk about recent history: we moved from bearer instruments and certificates for bearer instruments, through to certificates representing pure "fiat" in the literal sense - fiat meaning the will of the governing power, essentially. So "fiat is backed by men with guns", the famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWi8VUHUzk">Krugman</a> quote,</p>
<p><img src="https://joinmarket.me/images/krugman.jpeg" width="436" height="436"></p>
<p>... is certainly right <em>in essence</em> even if you quibble over various details. In the same way that courts are "backed by men with guns".</p>
<p>But I think it's important to step back and consider what role money takes in a society - its purpose is always exactly abstraction. It solves the "double coincidence of wants" problem by creating an entirely new class of good that no one originally wanted (this is the counter intuitive about much mathematics - to solve a problem involving 2 or 3 things you add another thing, superficially making everything more complicated, but suddenly everything 'falls into place', creating a new structure with more symmetry. For example, if the general solution of polynomials is tortuous and even insoluble (see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89variste_Galois">Galois</a>) for real numbers, by adding an apparent complexity: a new made-up solution to x^2=-1, you suddenly find that everything cleans itself up (see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra">the fundamental theorem of algebra</a>). Money does something similar, because we replace an O(N^2) pricing problem with an O(N) problem - …</p></div></div>

  <p><i><time datetime="2020-12-30">Last edited: December 30, 2020</time></i></p>

  <p>
    By default, Android has a strong security model and incorporates <a href="https://source.android.com/security/selinux/">
    full system SELinux policies</a>, <a href="https://source.android.com/security/app-sandbox">strong app sandboxing</a>,
    <a href="https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot">full verified boot</a>, modern exploit mitigations like
    <a href="https://source.android.com/devices/tech/debug/cfi">fine-grained forward-edge Control-Flow Integrity</a> and
    <a href="https://source.android.com/devices/tech/debug/shadow-call-stack">ShadowCallStack</a>, widespread use of
    memory-safe languages (Java / Kotlin) and more. As such, this article explains common ways in which people worsen the
    security model rather than criticisms of the security model itself.
  </p>

  <h2 id="unlocking-the-bootloader"><a href="#unlocking-the-bootloader">Unlocking the bootloader</a></h2>

  <div><p>
    Unlocking the bootloader in Android is a large security risk. It disables <a href="https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot/">verified boot</a>, a fundamental part of the security
    model. Verified boot ensures the integrity of the base system and boot chain to prevent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_maid_attack">
    evil maid attacks</a> and malware persistence. </p><p>
    
    Contrary to common assumptions, verified boot is not just important for physical security — it prevents the persistence
    of <b>any</b> tampering with your system, be it from a physical attacker or a malicious application that has managed to
    hook itself into the operating system. For example, if a remote attacker has managed to exploit the system and gain high
    privileges, verified boot would revert their changes upon reboot and ensure that they cannot persist.
  </p></div>

  <h2 id="rooting"><a href="#rooting">Rooting your device</a></h2>

  <div><p>
    Rooting your device allows an attacker to easily gain extremely high privileges. Android's architecture is built
    upon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege">principle of least privilege</a>. By default,
    unrestricted root is found nowhere in the system due to the <a href="https://source.android.com/security/selinux">
    full system SELinux policy</a>. Even the init system does not have unrestricted root access. Exposing privileges far
    greater than any other part of the OS to the application layer is not a good idea. </p><p>
    
    It does not matter if you have to whitelist apps that have root. An attacker can fake user input by for example,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking">clickjacking</a> or they can exploit vulnerabilities in apps that
    you have granted root to. By rooting your device, you are breaking Android's security model and adding further layers
    of trust where it is inappropriate. </p><p>
    
    A common argument for rooting is that Linux allows root but this does not account for the fact that the average
    desktop Linux system does not have a security model like Android does. On the usual Linux system, <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#root">gaining root is extremely easy</a>. This is why Linux hardening procedures often involve
    restricting access to the root account.
  </p></div>

  <h2 id="custom-roms"><a href="#custom-roms">Custom ROMs</a></h2>

  <p>
    The majority of custom ROMs severely weaken the security model by disabling verified boot, using userdebug builds,
    disabling SELinux, and various other issues. Furthermore, you are also usually at the mercy of the maintainer to
    apply security updates properly. Certain ROMs often apply security patches late or sometimes not apply them at all,
    especially when it comes to firmware patches.
  </p>

  <h3 id="lineageos"><a href="#lineageos">LineageOS</a></h3>

  <p>
    A common ROM that has many of these issues is <a href="https://lineageos.org/">LineageOS</a>:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      LineageOS <a href="https://github.com/LineageOS/hudson/blob/master/lineage-build-targets">uses
      userdebug builds by default</a>. This <a href="https://source.android.com/setup/build/building#choose-a-target">
      adds many debugging features as additional attack surface</a>. It also weakens various SELinux polices and exposes
      root access via adb which <a href="#root">as discussed above</a>, is not a good idea.
    </li>

    <li>
      LineageOS requires an unlocked bootloader, therefore disabling verified boot which <a href="#unlocking-the-bootloader">
      is essential to verify the integrity of the operating system</a>.
    </li>

    <li>
      It does not implement <a href="https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot/verified-boot#rollback-protection">
      rollback protection</a>. This allows an attacker to downgrade the system to an older version and then exploit already
      patched vulnerabilities. The default updater even allows you to downgrade versions yourself.
    </li>

    <li>
      Most LineageOS builds also do not include firmware updates which prevents users from getting new patches to fix
      vulnerabilities. Instead, it gives a pop-up advising users to flash updates manually that most people will simply
      ignore.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This is a non-exhaustive list. There are more issues than just those listed above. LineageOS (and most other custom
    ROMs) are focused on customizing the device and not privacy or security. Of course, you could build LineageOS yourself
    to fix many of these issues but most users will not be capable of doing so.
  </p>

  <h2 id="microg-signature-spoofing"><a href="#microg-signature-spoofing">MicroG / Signature Spoofing</a></h2>

  <div>
    <p><a href="https://microg.org/">MicroG</a> is a common alternative to Google Play Services. It is often used to get rid
    of Google's tracking but most people do not realise that this can potentially worsen security as it
    <a href="https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GmsCore/wiki/Signature-Spoofing">requires signature spoofing
    support</a> which allows apps to request to bypass signature verification. </p><p>
    
    Although, some signature spoofing implementations restrict it to make it less bad such as <a href="https://gitlab.com/calyxos/platform_frameworks_base/commit/dccce9d969f11c1739d19855ade9ccfbacf8ef76">CalyxOS'
    implementation</a> which allows only microG to spoof the Play Services signature and nothing else.
  </p></div>

  <h2 id="firewalls"><a href="#firewalls">Firewalls</a></h2>

  <div><p>
    Firewalls such as <a href="https://github.com/ukanth/afwall/">AFWall+</a> or <a href="https://www.netguard.me/">
    Netguard</a> are regularly used on Android to attempt to block network access from a specific app but these
    do not reliably work — apps can use IPC to bypass the restrictions. If you cut off network access to an app, it
    will not prevent the app from sending an <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent">
    intent</a> to another app (such as the browser) to make it make the same connection. </p><p>
    
    Many apps already do this unintentionally whilst using APIs such as the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/DownloadManager">download manager</a>. </p><p>
    
    The most effective way to block network access is to revoke the <code>INTERNET</code> permission from the app
    like <a href="https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_frameworks_base/commit/5e2898e9d21dd6802bb0b0139e7e496c41e1cd80">
    GrapheneOS allows you to do</a>. This prevents abusing OS APIs to initiate network connections as they contain checks
    for that permission, one example of which is the aforementioned download manager. You should also run the app in its
    own user or work profile to ensure that it cannot abuse third party apps either.
  </p></div>

<p><em>by a literal banana</em></p>
<p>I have been trying to understand the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_hypothesis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lexical hypothesis</a>” of personality, and its modern descendant, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Five Factor Model of personality</a>, for <a href="https://carcinisation.com/2020/01/27/ignorance-a-skilled-practice/">several</a> <a href="https://carcinisation.com/2020/06/24/the-extended-sniff-test/">months</a>. In that time, I have said some provocative things about the Big Five, and even some unkind things that I admit were unbecoming to a banana. Here, I wish to situate the Five Factor Model in the context of its historical development and modern use, and to demonstrate to the reader the surprising accomplishment that it represents for the field of psychology.<span id="more-732"></span></p>
<p>In personality research, the “lexical hypothesis” refers to a hypothesis attributed to Francis Galton (1884). Galton supposed that each human language would reflect important realities of human character within that language and culture. In particular, he noted that the words used to evaluate character and personality are very numerous (he estimated over a thousand, using a thesaurus), and often overlap in meaning.</p>
<p>But Galton immediately left his thesaurus behind, readily admitting of the impossibility of <a href="https://carcinisation.com/2020/06/26/words-fail/">defining</a> any aspect of character. Rather, he turned to experimental means of testing the character in various ways, and insisted that <em>no particular map or model of personality is needed to start from</em>.</p>
<p>Nowhere in his essay does Galton propose surveys as a means for studying character. He would probably regard such methods as unscientific, as indicated in his final paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>[C]haracter ought to be measured by carefully recorded acts, representative of the usual conduct. An ordinary generalisation is nothing more than a muddle of vague memories of inexact observations. It is an easy vice to generalise. We want lists of facts, every one of which may be separately verified, valued and revalued, and the whole accurately summed. It is the statistics of each man’s conduct in small every-day affairs, that will probably be found to give the simplest and most precise measure of his character.</p></blockquote>
<p>The methods that Galton proposed are exclusively non-linguistic. For instance, he commented that observing children involved in play quickly gives one an idea of each child’s emotional expression. Galton’s proposed methods prefigure both hidden camera prank shows and Goffman’s “breaching experiments:”</p>
<blockquote><p>I will not attempt to describe particular games of children or of others, nor to suggest experiments, more or less comic, that might be secretly made to elicit the manifestations we seek, as many such will occur to ingenious persons. They exist in abundance, and I feel sure that if two or three experimenters were to act zealously and judiciously together as secret accomplices, they would soon collect abundant statistics of conduct. They would gradually simplify their test conditions and extend their scope, learning to probe character more quickly and from more of its sides.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other methods Galton expressed enthusiasm for include heart rate measurement (he wore a home-brew heart-rate-measuring apparatus while he delivered the lecture that makes up the text) and methods discoverable from personal context (giving an example from Benjamin Franklin, of a man with one attractive and one deformed leg, who kept track of which leg his interlocutors paid attention to, as a gauge of their optimism or pessimism). Galton would be surprised, I think, to find that the most promising and scientific theory of personality in the twenty-first century is premised entirely on survey responses as its “facts.”</p>
<p>Early in the study of personality, there was a major shift of meaning in the lexical hypothesis. At first, the thesaurus and the word list were its tools of study (e.g., Allport &amp; Odbert, 1936); the idea was to find common factors of meaning in the words themselves. Of course, there is no particularly scientific way to decide how much the word “annoying” is the same as “obnoxious,” or how much either is the same as “low-status.” The major shift was to begin to measure the correlations of an entirely different construct: the correlations of the words <em>when used to describe a particular person</em>. That is, rather than trying to measure the underlying meaning of words, researchers began to measure the degree to which different words were applied to the same person. “Sameness” and “correlation” were no longer distinguishable concepts for the methods.</p>
<p>Initially, lists of adjectives, and eventually, short survey questions, were administered to subjects, who described either a person they knew or themselves. When the responses were subjected to factor analysis—a mathematical analysis to reveal the structure of correlations between responses—a varying number of factors emerged, depending on the methods and the researchers and the questions and the subjects, and these factors were given varying names. Since the early 1990s, the Five Factor Model has been dominant, although the names of the factors vary somewhat even today. The acronym OCEAN is used for the traits: Openness to experience (sometimes called “intellect” or “imagination” or “open-mindedness”), Conscientiousness, Extraversion (sometimes called “surgency”), Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (sometimes called “negative emotionality” or “emotional stability” reversed).<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Today, the five traits are measured with various survey instruments, with five questions on the shortest version (one for each aspect) and sixty questions on a common long-form version (that used by Soto, 2019). Survey instruments are validated in a number of ways: how much their responses correlate between testings (test-retest reliability, with astrological sign as the gold standard), how much different raters agree using the criteria (inter-rater reliability), and a nebulous concept of construct validity, which sometimes includes scientific gestures designed to ensure that the instrument measures what it purports to measure. Many papers present elaborate numerical artifacts of validation, and I have found that some characterize the validity of their instruments as “good” without providing an indication of what would be “not good enough.” From a brief review of dozens of validated instruments in social psychology, it seems to me that it is relatively easy to “validate” meaningless instruments. As long as the mathematical bona fides are present, the construct need not be meaningful in other ways. (The reader who is rightly suspicious of my broad and unsourced claims may wish to search Google Scholar with variations of “scale,” “inventory,” and “survey instrument,” and examine the results critically. The naming of factors is often a particularly interesting step.)</p>
<p>The strong claim made by advocates of the Five Factor Model is that any set of questions describing a human being, administered to subjects and the responses subjected to factor analysis, will reveal the same five factors (paraphrasing Jordan Peterson in <a href="https://youtu.be/pCceO_D4AlY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this video</a>, around 11:10-16:40). This strong claim, though dubious in a number of respects, is a major part of the basis for the scientific legitimacy of the Big Five. It is interesting to see which aspects of the strong claim are admitted to be false by advocates of the Big Five, and how much is excused on the grounds that <i>at least it’s something</i>. The Five Factor Model is not perfect, advocates grant, but it is better than nothing. It is not clear how they measure “better than nothing;” this is a potentially interesting hypothesis in need of precisification, perhaps.</p>
<p>The Big Five exist as a special, scientifically validated property of language and survey methods, and that is one basis for their legitimacy. The other basis for the legitimacy of the Five Factor Model is its <i>replicable correlation with consequential life outcomes</i>. We know that the Big Five are not merely phantoms that fall out of a certain analysis of a certain use of language in WEIRD college students, because these traits are reliably correlated with things we care about.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>One of the most interesting features of the Big Five is the nature of its scientific evidence. Observe what is held out as a “replication” of the theory, and you will discover the theory’s true nature. The most impressive aspect of the ongoing accomplishment of the Five Factor Model is the degree to which it <i>deflects curiosity </i>about its underlying meaning with <i>rituals of scientific validation</i>, regardless of the rituals’ appropriateness in context. Since “replication” is the scientific ritual most recently shown to detect poor science in psychology, being shown to reliably “replicate” is a huge boost to the credibility of a theory.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The interesting thing about the Five Factor Model is what it gets away with, in terms of being considered a theory, even though it is not causal, and makes no predictions. What counts as a “replication” of the Five Factor Model, as in Soto (2019), is the following: a correlation is found between one or more factors of the Five Factor Model and some other construct, and that correlation is found again in another sample, regardless of the size of the correlation. In almost all cases, and in 100% of Soto (2019)’s measures, the construct compared to a Big Five factor is derived from an online survey instrument.</p>
<p>What counts as a “consequential life outcome” is also fascinating. In most cases, the life outcome constructs are vague abstractions measured with survey instruments, much like the Big Five themselves. For instance, the life outcome “Inspiration” is measured with the Inspiration Scale, which asks the subject in four ways how often and how deeply inspired they are. Amazingly, this scale correlates a little bit with Extraversion and with Open-mindedness. Do these personality traits “predict” the life outcome of inspiration? Is “Inspiration” as instrumentalized here meaningfully different from the Big Five constructs, such that this correlation is meaningful?<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Compare the items for the construct “Inspiration” with the items for Extraversion and Open-mindedness used in Soto (2019):</p>
<p><b>Inspiration Scale Items</b></p>
<ul>
<li>I experience inspiration.</li></ul></div></article></div>

<li><code>dug help run</code> or <code>dug run --help</code> -&gt; Get details about a specific verb (run, which is the default)</li>
<li><code>dug help update</code> or <code>dug update --help</code> -&gt; Get details about the update verb</li>
</ul>
<p>The simplest way to get started is to just run a query against the domain whose DNS records you’re updating.
For example: <code>dug git.kaijucode.com</code>:
<a href="https://git.kaijucode.com/matt/dug/media/branch/main/cli/Resources/gif1.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://git.kaijucode.com/matt/dug/media/branch/main/cli/Resources/gif1.gif" alt=""></a></p>
<p>You can also do complicated things like ask for specific record types, get the output as json, and pipe it into other applications: <code>dug git.kaijucode.com -q A --output-format JSON --output-template Ipaddress,city,value,responsetime | jq</code>:
<a href="https://git.kaijucode.com/matt/dug/media/branch/main/cli/Resources/gif2.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://git.kaijucode.com/matt/dug/media/branch/main/cli/Resources/gif2.gif" alt=""></a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div component="post/content" itemprop="text">
	<p dir="auto">Re: <a href="https://fusionauth.io/community/forum/topic/382/gatsby-hasura-fusionauth-kintohub-my-dream-stack">Gatsby + Hasura + FusionAuth + KintoHub (My Dream Stack)</a></p>
<p dir="auto">There are several aspects you need to think about this topic. The first thing requires us to make our setup correct and authenticate GraphQL requests. The second part requires figuring out how to use refresh JWT tokens to continue operation without breaking something.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>This post covers the first part:  The Setup and authenticating the requests</strong></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>1 - Add Hasura custom claims in the JWT</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a Lambda function on FusionAuth to add Hasura claims to the tokens you issued. It's <a href="https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/61#issuecomment-493317279" rel="nofollow">pretty much covered on this GitHub issue</a></li>
<li>To do that, go to <a href="https://fusionauth:9011/admin/lambda/" rel="nofollow">https://fusionauth:9011/admin/lambda/</a></li>
<li>Add a new Lambda function with a name you can easily recognize later like "Populate - Hasura GraphQL Custom JWT Claims"</li>
<li>Leave ID empty, as you should always do <img src="https://fusionauth.io/community/forum/plugins/nodebb-plugin-emoji/emoji/android/1f642.png?v=9ro6udfbar8" title=":)" alt="ðŸ™‚"></li>
<li>Select JWT Populate as the type</li>
<li>Add <a href="https://fusionauth.io/community/forum/uid/3">@robotdan</a>'s code in the code area</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>// Using the user and registration parameters add additional values to the jwt object.
function populate(jwt, user, registration) {
// When writing a lambda we've added a few helpers to make life easier.
// console.info('Hello World'); # This will create an EventLog of type Information
// console.error('Not good.'); # This will create an EventLog of type Error
// console.debug('Step 42 completed.'); # This will create an EventLog of type Debug
//
   jwt["https://hasura.io/jwt/claims"] = {
    "x-hasura-allowed-roles": ["editor","user", "some-other-role"],
    "x-hasura-default-role": "user",
    "x-hasura-user-id": user.id,
    "x-hasura-org-id": "123",
    "x-hasura-custom": "custom-value"
  };
// To dump an entire object to the EventLog you can use JSON.stringify, for example:
// console.info(JSON.stringify(user));
// Happy coding! Populate your JWT here.
console.info(JSON.stringify(jwt, null, 2));
console.info(JSON.stringify(user, null, 2));
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Roles are used in Step #5 below. You'll have to figure it out later by yourself depending on your needs</li>
<li>Save your function<br>
<img src="https://fusionauth.io/community/forum/assets/uploads/files/1609169320679-add-hasura-claims.png" alt="add-hasura-claims.png"></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>2- Tell your FusionAuth app to use the lambda</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Find your FusionAuth app here <a href="https://fusionauth:9011/admin/application/" rel="nofollow">https://fusionauth:9011/admin/application/</a> and click edit.</li>
<li>Edit your app</li>
<li>Click on the JWT tab</li>
<li>Enable the JWT if you haven't before</li>
<li>Set <em><strong>Access Token populate lambda</strong></em> to your newly created lambda<br>
<img src="https://fusionauth.io/community/forum/assets/uploads/files/1609169294607-app-lambda.png" alt="app-lambda.png"></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>3 - Create a Signing key on FusionAuth</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <a href="https://fusioauth:9011/admin/key/" rel="nofollow">https://fusioauth:9011/admin/key/</a></li>
<li>Create a new key based on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39239051/rs256-vs-hs256-whats-the-difference" rel="nofollow">your choice of algorithm</a>. I'd go with RSA256 or RSA512 since you don't need to share your private key with Hasura or anybody else</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>4- Tell your Fusion App to use the key</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You've created a key. Now you need to have your tokens be signed with it. Find your FusionAuth app here <a href="https://fusionauth:9011/admin/application/" rel="nofollow">https://fusionauth:9011/admin/application/</a> and click edit.</li>
<li>Click on the JWT tab</li>
<li>Select your Key created before for <em><strong>Access Token signing key</strong></em></li>
<li>Select your Key created before for <em><strong>Id Token signing key</strong></em></li>
<li>Save your app</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>5- Tell Hasura where to get the signing public keys</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hasura has a config parameter named <em><strong>HASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET</strong></em>, which it uses to grab public keys to verify your Auth header tokens. Put it in your docker-compose file. (or into the file you set your Hasura config)</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>HASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET='{"type": "RS512", "jwk_url": "https://fusionauth/.well-known/jwks"}'
</code></pre>
<p dir="auto"><strong>6- Restart your Hasura instance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you're using Docker, you'd do</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>docker restart hasura_docker_image_name
</code></pre>
<p dir="auto"><strong>7- Tell your Hasura how to use  row or column level permissions for the tables you track</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hasura helps you to set row or column level permissions on the DATA page of its dashboard. Find your table and set select permission as it described <a href="https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/hasura-auth-slack/access-control/1-user-permissions/" rel="nofollow">in this tutorial</a></li>
<li>Basically, add your user group, and set your permission to check the user-id set in the request's header.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>{"users_id":{"_eq":"x-hasura-user-id"}}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Here, I set "user" role permission on my app's user "Settings" table we store user-specific settings so only the user in auth header could get the data that strictly belongs to him/her<br>
<img src="https://fusionauth.io/community/forum/assets/uploads/files/1609168109230-set-user-select-permission.png" alt="set-user-select-permission.png"></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>8- You're pretty much ready to make a request now with your token</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I Assume you've used one of the workflows to get your auth bearer token from FusionAuth. <a href="https://fusionauth.io/learn/expert-advice/authentication/login-authentication-workflows/" rel="nofollow">They cover pretty much every scenario on their blog you can find here, a must-read!</a>.</li>
<li>Make a Curl request or use a tool like Postman.</li>
<li>Authentication header</li>
<li>Make your request for the logged-in user by sending his/her token</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>curl -X POST https://publish.graph.circleboom.com/v1/graphql -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhb..............' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"query": "{ settings { job_start_time } }" }'
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Get your user-specific answer back for the token owner</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>{"data":{"settings":[{"job_start_time":"22:30:00"}]}}
</code></pre>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Next:</strong> Refresh JWT token by following <a href="https://hasura.io/blog/best-practices-of-using-jwt-with-graphql/" rel="nofollow">The Ultimate Guide to handling JWTs on frontend clients (GraphQL)</a> *</p>

<p>How can your early stage startup use technical debt to survive and thrive? How does technical debt in young startups look and where does it come from?</p>



<p>It’s hard to avoid technical debt completely but you can manage it and use it to your advantage. Let us have a look how technical debt is created in startups and how you can keep it in check even when your company is in hyper growth.</p>



<figure><img src="https://andreschweighofer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/survive-technical-debt-1024x648.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://andreschweighofer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/survive-technical-debt-1024x648.jpg 1024w, https://andreschweighofer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/survive-technical-debt-300x190.jpg 300w, https://andreschweighofer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/survive-technical-debt-768x486.jpg 768w, https://andreschweighofer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/survive-technical-debt-648x410.jpg 648w, https://andreschweighofer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/survive-technical-debt.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h2>The paradox of success</h2>



<p>The most common way for startups to create technical debt is ironically the very thing that makes them succeed: A validated idea. You build things and test them out. Most ideas don’t stick. You move on. Until suddenly you have something that people really want and things spin out of control. That hacked together throwaway prototype is so sticky you can’t afford to lose your momentum. There is no time to rebuild it. You build upon it. That’s your first piece of technical debt – your prototype turned MVP.</p>



<h2>The right kind of technical debt</h2>



<p>The successful prototype sounds much like a eulogy of failed startups but it doesn’t have to be. Up to this point your technical debt is manageable and it’s enabling you to stay in business. You have turned your throwaway prototype into a bridge loan to get to the next milestone. You can use it to close the next funding round or spend money on customer acquisition to grab a foothold in the market.</p>



<h2>Paying the interest on your technical debt</h2>



<p>If you keep funding your success with debt it will catch up to you once one of two things happen. Either your growth will slow down or your technical debt has accumulated and development slows down. Both lead to you struggling to pay the interest on your debt. So it’s vital so reduce your technical debt <em>before</em> it spirals out of control. Here is a strategy to do exactly that.</p>



<h2>Balancing the short term with the long term</h2>



<p>When you build out your product you will come across technical debt. At this point don’t work around it but work through the technical debt. You need to <a href="https://killalldefects.com/2019/12/24/technical-debt-as-risks/">understand the risk your technical debt carries</a> and not get lost in the short term opportunities ahead. As a lead engineer or CTO it’s your responsibility to advocate maintenance work as a <em>Must have</em>, not a <em>nice to have</em>.</p>



<p>Unfortunately this ties the faith of your startup’s technical debt to one single person – you. To mitigate this we can try to bake it into the organisation’s behaviour by designing a process which balances the short term and long term thinking.</p>



<h2>Manage technical debt through your product</h2>



<p>When you build something new you should commit to do two things with it: Either you remove the feature if it does not bring in the expected results or you iterate on it. Axe any code before it turns into a liability or grant yourself the time to fix it and redo it properly. This strategy is effective because when you build a new feature you know the least about it, so even if you tried you probably couldn’t build it completely <em>right</em>. But once you’ve released it you have learned a lot more which will help greatly paying back that technical debt.</p>



<p>With this commitment the burden of fixing technical debt is not solely on you anymore. The product side is now your party in crime. However, in an early startup that probably just means two people instead of one. Once your organisation grows you need to ensure this attitude survives.</p>



<h2>Culture can beat technical debt</h2>



<p>When your company grows you want to fight technical debt before it gets out of control. Unfortunately the rapidly changing structures in a fast growing startup are a great breeding ground for technical debt.</p>



<p>You can try to establish specific roles like architects and lead engineers and processes like code reviews to fight your technical debt. But an engineer can’t manage technical debt unless the organisation enables them to. You need to create a culture which balances the short term with the long term thinking. A culture where engineers can take pride in their craft and not have to be the bad guys who say No all the time. Here are some hints how such a culture could look like.</p>



<h3>Do less but do it well</h3>



<p>Instead of getting <a href="https://andreschweighofer.com/agile/anxiety-in-product-development/">trapped in a fear driven culture</a> focus on your strengths. What makes your startup stand out from the competitors? Hone that skill. This is important to cut out distractions. It also keeps the technical debt at bay because you’re not racing from one feature to the next.</p>



<h3>Celebrate your engineering</h3>



<p>What your startup celebrates and rewards is what it creates more of. So if you only celebrate sale numbers and growth rates but none of your engineering accomplishments you end up with stunted engineering. So celebrate the engineering solutions and put the engineers in the spotlight. They are behind the scenes of product too often.</p>



<h3>Hire the best and train them</h3>



<p>Your technical debt is rarely caused by just bad engineering. But it can be part of the problem. Great engineers can avoid many forms of careless technical debt. You should leverage their skills to keep the growth of your technical debt in check. We all want to hire the best engineers. That’s easier said than done. But you can work with what you already have. Invest in training your engineers the best you can. This not only avoids technical debt but greatly improves the satisfaction of your engineers and their retention.</p>







<p>What makes startups successful is often the root of their technical debt. If your startup struggles with technical debt it’s important to note that this is neither a death&nbsp;sentence nor something to be ignored. Use it wisely and give your organisation room to tackle it so your startup can continue to thrive.</p>

If you have some new year resolutions and you’re a casual person like me, I’m sharing one tip worked really well for me, in the hope it can help you to stick with your resolutions a little bit longer.</p><blockquote><p>Being generic with your plans.</p></blockquote><p>Being generic means having a sense of big directions (the <em>motion</em> towards your goals) rather than <em>specific</em> objectives. E.g. “To read <em>more</em> books about a topic” or simply “to read <em>more</em> books” is a big direction while “to read 2 books each month” is a specific objective. “To lose some weight” is a direction while “to lose 50 lbs” is a specific objective.</p><p>For many years I believed in setting specific, measurable objectives for personal habits/resolutions. After all, the idea is promoted a lot in business world, such as setting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria">SMART</a> goals. But one day I realized that unless my personal goal is specific by nature, being <em>specific</em> is actually counterproductive - it has a major problem.</p><blockquote><p>Before we start (moving towards our goal), we usually don’t know what plan works the best <em>for us</em>. Setting specific objectives prematurely tends to anchor misleading expectations, and thus causes negative feelings when the specifics aren’t met.</p></blockquote><p>Life is eventful and full of uncertainty. A seemingly viable plan this week could turn to be unrealistic in the next month. There are two common problems:</p><ul><li><p>Over-committing. This could be due to incorrect estimation of one’s ability, capacity or willpower, or it could be caused by unforeseeable life events. </p></li><li><p>What worked for others doesn’t necessarily work for me. E.g. To read more, some people are more productive reading a short period everyday while others could prefer reading full days over the weekends. Just <em>think</em> whether we will resonate with a routine doesn’t always tell the truth; we have to <em>experience</em> it to tell. </p></li></ul><p>I once set a resolution to read 1 hour everyday. But in the very next week my workload turned heavy and I didn’t have time to read anything over the weekdays. I felt so defeated regarding my reading “progress” and started to consider myself not the type of person that reads. I didn’t even think about reading for a little bit over the weekends when I actually had time.</p><p>Being specific draws our attention to the specifics (reading 1h everyday) rather than the big direction (read more books). The corollary is that such a plan would be disruption-prone. But, you see, a disrupted plan itself is not that harmful. It’s the negative feeling caused by the disruption that’s really destructive - it’s the catalyst for a vicious circle. </p><ol><li><p>The more you’re off the track (from the specifics you set)</p></li><li><p>The more unforgiving you become about the “mistakes”; the unforgivingness might (unconsciously) come from a sense of shame, anger or disappointment</p></li><li><p>The more likely you’re going to <em>deny your identity</em> being the type of person that is capable of achieving your goal</p></li><li><p>The more likely you choose to give up and become further off-track</p></li></ol><p>Being generic helps to break the circle. Because there is no specific objective to hit, we wouldn’t be distracted by the specifics, and thus not feel as strongly off-track when we miss the mark in the near term. More importantly it eases the negative feelings about ourselves and <strong>lowers the emotional barrier for us to refocus on the motion towards the goals</strong>. If the current schedule or routine stopped working, then find another. If it’s just a pause of the plan, then resume it later.</p><p>The essential logic behind is to <strong>make it easy to recover from setbacks and refocus on actions</strong>. According to the theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance">cognitive dissonance</a>, our mind tends to agree with our actions. Our action forges our identity, and our identity reinforces our action. That’s the virtuous circle that backs any sustainable behavior. </p><p>But there is a catch. We still need to somehow measure the progress to make sure we’re not simply procrastinating or staying in place.</p><blockquote><p>Measure <em>incremental</em>, instead of <em>absolute</em>, progress. </p></blockquote><p>Did I read more this month than last month? Did I exercise more than last week? Such incremental progress might look trivial, but it augments our confidence via action which reinforces our belief in certain identity, e.g. I am the type of person that can read.</p><p>Hopefully at one point we will reach a desired activeness level. But will it last? Likely. If you entered the virtuous circle for long enough, the belief in your identity probably has been forged, and you have probably found a routine that worked for you. At this point, it’s pretty much autopilot mode to carry out the desired activity. </p><p>OK. There is another catch. To form the habits to reach your goals, it definitely takes more than just being generic. I highly recommend the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=atomic+habits&amp;qid=1609621310&amp;sr=8-1">Atomic Habits</a>. The author provides tons of practical advices about forming habits. “Make it easy” is one of the four principles in the book. Being generic is my insight to how to make it a little bit easier.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05d330e5-90bd-45b9-821a-431f65770996_331x499.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05d330e5-90bd-45b9-821a-431f65770996_331x499.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/05d330e5-90bd-45b9-821a-431f65770996_331x499.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:499,&quot;width&quot;:331,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:203,&quot;bytes&quot;:30823,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>Hope you stick with your new year resolutions, and have a great new year!</p></div></div>]]>

<p>So what can be done about phone addiction in a world that <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/IntR-08-2012-0155/full/html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">loves the internet so much</a>?

<p><strong>Trivia:</strong> When you are bored in face-to-face conversations or don’t want to interact with others, do you slowly start using your phone and divert your attention away from the person? Snubbing another person in favor of your phone is called <em>phubbing</em> (phone + snubbing) and it is a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563215300704" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">common complaint in relationships</a>. <em>Phubbing your partner is called Pphubbing or Partner phubbing and research acknowledges that it worsens relationship satisfaction, life satisfaction, and could also add to depression.</em> Phubbing could be a form of social exclusion and researchers argue that <a href="https://cyberpsychology.eu/article/view/12590/11560" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">even watching others phub</a> can induce stress and lower regard for the phubbers.</p>



<h2><span id="What_is_phone_addiction">What is phone addiction?</span></h2>



<p>Let’s first understand what is phone addiction and what counts as excessive phone use.  Phone addiction or compulsive phone use goes along-side internet addiction and social media addiction. Psychologists also call it “problematic phone use.” For this post, we will consider them together. Cell-phones are habit-forming – once you go down that rabbit hole, you use more and more. Like drugs, one can get hooked to a phone or an activity on the phone that leads to addiction. There is abuse without control, changes in mood, excessive desire to use, withdrawals like irritability and anger when you can’t use the phone, low tolerance to avoid the phone, and the phone interferes with life in a negative way. </p>



<p>Strictly speaking, addiction is “the loss of control, the establishment of a dependent relationship, tolerance, the need for progressively more time and dedication, and severe interference with daily life (Echeburua et al., 2009).” Phones, internet-based activities, and any technology for that matter can <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2016.00175/full" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">become an addiction</a> in the truest sense (even though many disagree). And sometimes, phone addicts need to be rehabilitated in a hospital.</p>



<p>Not all phone use is a sign of addiction, even if the volume of use is high. A <em>loss of control</em> in how the phone is used and <em>psychological dependency</em> is an indicator of addiction. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/hcr/article-abstract/42/3/441/4064735?redirectedFrom=fulltext" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Recreational phone use</a> and productive phone use isn’t the problem, it’s the inability to regulate usage and unhealthy coping for larger problems that usually makes screen-time problematic. If you are addicted to your phone, you probably can’t let go of phone-related activities no matter how often you tell yourself you need to let go.</p>




<p>People often get addicted to the phone because they want to <em>escape from reality</em>, <em>gain social karma</em>, <em>cope with stress caused by social anxiety and low self-esteem</em>, <em>follow their greed for social validation</em>, <em>likes</em>, <em>and other types of rewards</em>, or <em>play rewarding games</em>. The constant flow of digital rewards and information can <em>pull</em> a person into addiction and day-to-day difficulties can <em>push</em> a person toward addiction. Social media addiction usually comes down to these “internet reward points.”</p>

<h3><span id="Indicators_of_problematic_phone_use">Indicators of problematic phone use</span></h3>



<p><strong>There is no cut-off point to show you are addicted to your phone which everyone agrees to but here are some indicators</strong>.</p>



<ol><li>You spend continuous hours on the phone to play games, scroll through social media, open and close apps, text people to invite a chat, etc.</li><li>You frequently pick up the phone without any aim to check for notifications or see if something has changed in your social feeds.</li><li>Your online and offline behavior gets more integrated and you don’t know what you did in the digital reality or the material reality.</li><li>You get restless if your phone is dead or has low-battery, is out-of-coverage, or low on data/balance.</li><li>You treat your phone as a security blanket without which you get uncomfortable in social gatherings.</li><li>Your day-to-day activities take a backseat, relationships are strained, and you can’t focus and commit to the important things in your life.</li><li>You feel bad about yourself and you go online to feel good but you end up feeling worse looking at what others are doing.<em> Such compulsive phone use is likely to emerge from other mental health issues.</em></li></ol>



<h3><span id="Common_examples_of_problematic_phone_use">Common examples of problematic phone use</span></h3>



<ol><li>Infinitely scrolling through Instagram.</li><li>Playing Call of Duty or PubG for hours and social activities contain little to no honest communication.</li><li>Excessive display of hurt, loneliness, attention-seeking behavior, hate, jealousy, and disapproval on social media.</li><li>Social needs are not met (sexual intimacy, close friendship, physical touch, etc.) and online alternatives are used to compensate for poor social health (chatbots, echo-chambers, porn, social gaming, virtual reality social games like second life, camming relationships).</li><li>Inability to feel pleasure and excitement in the offline world but excessive emotions are tied to online rewards like gambling, likes, shares, followers, sexting, masturbation to porn, etc.</li><li><em>FOMO</em> (fear of missing out) and <em>Nomophobia</em> (no-mobile phobia) cause mental and physical discomfort.</li><li>You frequently experience <em>Ringxiety</em> or <em>Textaphrenia</em> or Phantom notifications – the feeling that you received a notification when you actually did not.</li></ol>



<h2><span id="Statistics_on_phone_and_internet_use">Statistics on phone and internet use</span></h2>



<ol><li><a href="https://blog.rescuetime.com/screen-time-stats-2018/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">According to a 2019 report</a>, the average person spends about 3.5 hours on their phone in a day with the top 20% of people spending more than 4.5 hours a day. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/24/screen-time-iphone-coronavirus-quarantine-covid/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">The quarantine</a> has increased these numbers – many users report over 8 hours a day.</li><li>The 2019 report also says that 70% of all phone use lasts lesser than 2 minutes and 50% of all phone pick-ups occur within 3 minutes of the previous pick-up.</li><li><a href="https://wearesocial.com/blog/2019/01/digital-2019-global-internet-use-accelerates" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Another 2019 report</a> (2018 data) says at least 3.3 billion people use the internet and social media from their phones.</li><li><a href="https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Presentations-and-Whitepapers/2019/Global-State-of-Mobile" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Comscore’s 2019 Global state of mobile</a> report says 70% of all digital media engagement in the US happens from a smartphone. So TV, games, laptops, gaming consoles, theatres, etc. are all squeezed into the tiny remainder of 30%. </li></ol>



<h2><span id="Important_research_highlights_on_phone_addiction">Important research highlights on phone addiction</span></h2>



<p>Phone addiction goes <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08934215.2020.1780456" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">hand in hand</a> with anxiety and that anxiety often lowers the motivation to engage with people in real life. This is a huge problem because re-connecting with people in the offline world is a solution that improves the quality of life. The unnecessary drop in motivation because of addiction makes it that much harder to maintain social health.</p>




<p>Phone addiction can <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306460319311839" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">cause poor cognitive performance</a> in day-to-day life. That means poor attention, poor memory, poor reasoning skills, bad decision making, etc. One of the main reasons is the role of sleep. Addiction can disturb sleep and sleep worsens cognitive performance. However, self-regulation (personal control, commitment to healthy choices, tolerating negative emotions) can counter the negative effects of addiction and that can help you overcome it.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190740919311296" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">A dysfunctional family can push</a> children into addiction and one reason is social anxiety. A broken family or unhealthy parenting like neglect or excessive control can often hamper emotional growth. Children might fail to learn how to behave in social settings. There may be a fear of ridicule, disapproval, disappointment, etc. or simply a looming belief like “I am not good enough” or “I am a bad child” that creates pressure on children. These fears or thoughts transfer into the real-world and children cope with the social anxiety it causes by withdrawing into their phones – where the fantasy digital world rescues them from their real life. Fortunately, mindfulness – being aware of your actions and living in the moment as an observer – can reduce the negative impact of phone addiction.</p>




<p>Underlying mental health conditions like bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, and attachment issues can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7215249/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">increase the risk</a> of phone addiction. And improving mental health can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4354213/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">counter addiction</a>. Proneness to boredom <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0894439317741087" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">can increase</a> the likelihood of problematic phone use but not the frequency of phone use. This ultimately makes boredom a pathway between problematic phone use and anxiety or depression.</p>







<h2><span id="9_Ways_to_overcome_phone_addiction_and_reduce_screen_time">9 Ways to overcome phone addiction and reduce screen time</span></h2>



<h3><span id="1_Schedule_a_time_for_un-monitored_phone_use">1.&nbsp;<strong>Schedule a time for un-monitored phone use</strong></span></h3>



<p>Grant yourself as much time as you want within a fixed daily limit at a specific hour of the day. As long as you can first demonstrate some output. Random notifications and random experiences are potent in pulling you to check your phone precisely because they are random. Unpredictable notifications and call-to-actions are hard to anticipate so the brain maximizes their potential reward (feeling great) by constantly creating the urge to pick up the phone and check. Schedule an hour to commit to your phone or make it a rule to check it every 45 minutes. That way, the rewards will be hard to anticipate but they will occur at a known time and your brain will find it easier to adjust than completely abandoning your phone.</p>



<h3><span id="2_Interrupt_your_habitual_routine">2.&nbsp;<strong>Interrupt your habitual routine</strong>&nbsp;</span></h3>



<p>Habits are hard to break because neurons in your brain rigidly fire a certain way. Once an action is repeated enough, neural circuits become efficient. They then direct and dictate behavior automatically. Countering their tendencies becomes harder. Higher the repetitions, the more stable those neurons get. These neural circuits fire in a predictable way and they fire automatically with almost no external push. You may have little to no awareness about the start of habitual actions. …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><h2 id="wie-is-de-mol">Wie is de Mol?</h2><p><em>Wie is de Mol?</em> (‘Who is the Mole?’) is a popular Dutch television game show, currently airing its 21st season. Contestants compete in challenges to win money that goes into a shared prize pool. One of the contestants acts as a mole, attempting to sabotage the other contestants in their efforts to win challenges. The identity of the mole is unknown and it is up to the contestants to determine who it might be. Every episode a contestant leaves the show, until the final contestant leaves with the money collected during the season.</p><p>For the last couple of years, my colleagues have been competing in a group in the <em>Wie is de Mol?</em> app, available for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/avrotros-wie-is-de-mol/id760264022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.avro.demol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Android</a>. The app allows users to place a bet (using free digital tokens, there are no payments involved as far as I know) on the persons who they deem most likely to be the mole.</p><p>When I received an invitation from a colleague for this year’s group, I couldn’t resist to take a look inside the Android app and its accompying API to see whether I could dig up any interesting vulnerabilities. I should note that I first made sure that the broadcasting network, AVRO, has a <a href="https://www.avrotros.nl/privacy/responsible-disclosure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">vulnerability disclosure policy</a> in place that allows such research. They appear to welcome security research, so off we go!</p><h2 id="preface">Preface</h2><p>My goal for this post is to share my process in tackling challenges that may occur while reverse engineering an Android application in a black box setting, therefore I won’t delve into too much detail on the usage of any of the tools listed below. Having a basic understanding of Android and web applications is recommended.</p><div><table><thead><tr><td>Application <!-- -->&nbsp;<!-- -->&nbsp;<!-- -->&nbsp;<!-- -->&nbsp;<!-- -->&nbsp;<!-- -->&nbsp;</td><td>Usage</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Apktool</a></td><td>Used to disassemble the Android application and to inject Frida Gadget as a native library</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://frida.re/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Frida</a></td><td>Used for dynamic instrumentation at runtime</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://portswigger.net/burp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Burp Suite</a></td><td>Used to intercept traffic between the Android app and its backend</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CyberChef</a></td><td>Used for quick encoding/decoding/hashing/etc.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>For information on how to inject Frida Gadget into the apk, please take a look at one of the many tutorials out there, such as <a href="https://fadeevab.com/frida-gadget-injection-on-android-no-root-2-methods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this one</a> or <a href="https://koz.io/using-frida-on-android-without-root/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this one</a>.</p><h2 id="intercepting-http-traffic">Intercepting HTTP Traffic</h2><p>Frida enables us to override common certificate pinning implementations, so we can intercept traffic using a proxy of our choosing (in this case, Burp Suite). After setting up the environment, launch the Android application and interact with it to generate some traffic. Let’s start out by pressing the ‘I forgot my password’ button, resulting in the following request and response:</p><p><strong> Request </strong></p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>POST /profile/forgot_password/ HTTP/1.1</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>Content-Length: 26</span></p><p><span>4</span><span>Host: api.wieisdemol.nl</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>Connection: close</span></p><p><span>6</span><span>Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate</span></p><p><span>7</span><span>User-Agent: okhttp/4.7.2</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>X-Signature: HMAC widm-api:UaXaUB6YCKY2AeeuFk00K/Cj5O5cB77NivxtWFT03iU=</span></p><p><span>9</span><span>Date: 2021-01-01T23:38:50.529</span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span>{"email":"***REDACTED***"}</span></p></pre></div><p><strong> Response</strong></p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>Server: nginx/1.19.5</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>Date: Fri, 01 Jan 2021 22:38:50 GMT</span></p><p><span>4</span><span>Content-Type: application/json</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>Content-Length: 131</span></p><p><span>6</span><span>x-config-version: 9</span></p><p><span>7</span><span>Via: 1.1 google</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>Alt-Svc: clear</span></p><p><span>9</span><span>Connection: close</span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span>{"detail":{"email":["Geen e-mailaccount gevonden.\nMisschien was je ingelogd met een social account (bijv.

Sending a request with an invalid signature, or with no signature at all, results in a 403 response code:</p><div>

As an added bonus, we now have the UTF-8 encoded ‘secret’ key used to sign messages: <code>█████</code>.</p><ul><li><strong>Update — January 5, 2021</strong><br>Upon request from the broadcasting network, AVRO, I have removed all references to the secret signing key from this blog post (as well as from the repository linked down below).</li></ul><p>Remember that a HMAC function takes two arguments: a key and a message. Therefore, the aforementioned arguments need to be transformed into a message (i.e. a byte sequence) before being passed onto the hashing function. Usually developers simply compose the message by concatenating the strings. However, on occasion, a custom implementation is used. To be on the safe side, as well as to avoid making false assumptions, let’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/NDrong/2dea662016704fb99edcf0e9c7961e5f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">hook the call to the class method</a> that makes the actual call into the crypto library. This method is aptly named <code>hmac</code> and, as expected, accepts two strings: the message to be signed and a key. Logging provides the following arguments:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  </span><span>"0"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"POST\n078bdf5f7296200ae9a89901305dec37852dbf84e21496550ad2c477149aa6ac\napplication/json; charset=UTF-8\n2021-01-01T22:13:30.166\n/profile/forgot_password/"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>  </span><span>"1"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"█████"</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div><p>It appears that the strings, as seen in the first argument, are separated by newline characters. Somewhat surprisingly, a sequence that we haven’t seen before surfaces: <code>078bdf5f7296200ae9a89901305dec37852dbf84e21496550ad2c477149aa6ac</code>. Looking at our findings so far, notice that this sequence is right where the body of the request was placed before. Perhaps this represents a hash of the body? Since I’m not sure what this seemingly random sequence denotes, we’ll return to the decompiled methods to take a closer look.</p><p>Following some of the cross-references, it doesn’t take long to find a call to another class implementing hashing, this time using a SHA-256 message digest (i.e. good-old hashing without any secrets). Internally, a call is made into Java’s built-in security library:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>invoke-static {p1}, Ljava/security/MessageDigest;-&gt;getInstance(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/security/MessageDigest;</span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>move-result-object p1</span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>invoke-virtual {p1, p0}, Ljava/security/MessageDigest;-&gt;digest([B)[B</span></p></pre></div><p>Let’s verify whether we can compute the exact same hash for the request shown above, by applying the SHA-256 hashing algorithm to the request body. Start out by hashing the body of the request using <a href="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=SHA2('256')" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CyberChef</a>, like so:</p><div>

    </span></p><figcaption>SHA-256 message digest generated using CyberChef.</figcaption></div><p>Great, that’s the exact same hash as seen in the arguments above. Notice that I excluded the backslashes in the JSON, as these were added by <code>JSON.stringify</code> in our Frida script (due to escaping) and are therefore not part of the original body (as confirmed by the original request at the top of this post).</p><p>Now that we have all the arguments we need, all that’s left is to compute the final HMAC used to verify the integrity of the HTTP request. Again, we could use <a href="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=HMAC(%7B'option':'UTF8','string':'%E2%96%88%E2%96%88%E2%96%88%E2%96%88%E2%96%88'%7D,'SHA256')" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CyberChef</a> to do the heavy lifting for us, but for some reason I did not manage to get CyberChef to produce the same results as the built-in Java library, most likely due to encoding differences. Therefore, I wrote a small Python script based on a ready-to-use snippet I found <a href="https://www.jokecamp.com/blog/examples-of-creating-base64-hashes-using-hmac-sha256-in-different-languages/#python3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">online</a>. Computing the signature using this script indeed results in the expected base64 encoded string as present in the original request:</p><div>

Specifically, we want to be able to compose arbitrary requests, which we can then copy-paste into a tool to generate a valid HMAC signature, requiring as little manual labor as needed. Since we’ve already done most of the work, creating a Python script is not that much effort. You can find the resulting script <a href="https://github.com/NDrong/widm_request_signer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">in this repository</a>.</p><h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2><p>Now that we have successfully reverse engineered the signing algorithm, we can continue using the app as one normally would, while intercepting requests in the background. We can analyze these requests for interesting behavior, modifying and signing them as we please, thanks to our automated request signer. At the moment, I haven’t found any vulnerabilities yet, but if I find anything interesting, I’ll be sure to update this post once the issue has been resolved by the broadcasting network.
If you find a vulnerability using any of the methods described here, please let me know! You can contact me on Twitter or via any of the links down in the footer of the page. Thanks for stopping by! :)</p></div></article></div>]]>

January 2, 2021 | https://www.andreasrein.net/posts/hugo-to-nuxt | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.andreasrein.net/posts/hugo-to-nuxt">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have been using Hugo to generate my blog, but since I'm not so comfortable with Go, I wanted to try out something fresh and familiar. Between Gridsome and Nuxt, I chose Nuxt.</p>

<h2 id="hugo---gridsome--nuxt">Hugo -&gt; Gridsome || Nuxt</h2>
<p>Hugo has been working well for me but I find the template language unintuitive and compared to using Vue single-file components, it's like pitch-dark night and blending sunny day. Gridsome was also on my radar but it fell short for me. Some of my reasons were:</p>
<h3 id="gridsome-vs-nuxt">Gridsome vs. Nuxt</h3>
<ul>
<li>Relative immature project: <strong>Aug. 2018</strong> <em>vs.</em> <strong>Jan. 2017</strong>.</li>
<li>Low number of core contributors: <strong>1</strong> <em>vs.</em> <strong>5</strong>. (over 100 commits total).</li>
<li>Pure popularity: <strong>7.1k</strong> GitHub stars <em>vs.</em> <strong>32.6k</strong> Github stars.</li>
<li>Opinionated GraphQL data layer. But this can be a positive for someone.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, Gridsome is a young project so a lot can change in time. For now, I'm going for Nuxt.</p>
<h2 id="nuxt">Nuxt</h2>
<p>Generating the Nuxt project filled my developer heart with bliss and thrill. I was intrigued by picking Programming language, Package manager, UI framework, Linting tools, Testing framework, Rendering mode, Deployment target, and Development tools. So far, so good. Try it yourself by running this yarn command <code>yarn create nuxt-app nuxt-blog</code>. If you want to generate a static website choose:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nuxt.js modules: Content</li>
<li>Rendering mode: Universal (SSR / SSG)</li>
</ul>
<p>When I opened the project in VSCode, it hit me, this was the right choice for my dev blog. I was sitting comfortably in front of a clean and developer-friendly directory structure. My markdown articles are stored in <code>content/articles</code>. The documentation of Nuxt and it's static module: Nuxt Content was easy to follow and lovely to read. They also have a nice <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/blog/creating-blog-with-nuxt-content" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">guide</a> for creating a blog using Nuxt content.</p>
<p>Listing out the articles is done in <code>pages/index.vue</code> and it roughly look like so:</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>template</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span> <span>class</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>posts__container<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
      <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span>
        <span>v-for</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>article of articles<span>"</span></span>
        <span>:key</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>article.slug<span>"</span></span>
        <span>class</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>post__container<span>"</span></span>
      <span>&gt;</span></span>

<p>So far I have been delighted developing the blog in Nuxt. If you already have a love for Vue, there is no need to evaluate other options, Nuxt is for you. My plan is to extend the site using Vue components and write more articles. But life can be busy so we will see how it goes.</p>
<p>That was it so I wish you all a happy new year and don't forget to wear a mask 😷.</p></div></div>]]>

<p><strong>His two children could lose their father for the rest of their lives</strong></p>



<p>Although important legal principles are at stake in the extradition trial of Julian Assange, for which a ruling will be handed down on January 4, it should not be forgotten that there are important human issues at stake as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One such issue is Assange’s health, which has progressively worsened under what seems to be cruel and even sadistic maltreatment by the British government, including the refusal of appropriate medical care and confining him in his cell for 23 hours a day, seven days a week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other is that, if the Judge’s ruling is adverse, Julian’s two children may never see their father again.</p>



<p>Many stories have been written about the legal issues in Julian’s case, and the chilling effect that his extradition to the U.S.—where he will almost certainly be imprisoned for life—would have on journalists around the world who seek to expose the lies and crimes committed by their own governments.</p>



<p>Most of those stories present Julian, primarily, as a symbol, a hero to his principles, and an ominous example in how far tyrannical governments and corrupt politicians will go to keep their citizens ignorant and submissive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Julian is more than a symbol. He is also a father, a husband-to-be (even if he may have to be married in prison) and, most importantly, a human being—one who, as the world watches in horror and shame, is being subjected to calculated assaults on his physical and mental health in hopes that he will quickly die and spare the British and American governments the embarrassment of having to deal with him.</p>



<p>For nearly three years Assange and his partner, Stella Moris, had successfully kept their personal relationship and the existence of their two children a secret. Moris only revealed it (on April 11)&nbsp;because&nbsp;“Julian’s poor physical health puts him at serious risk, like many other&nbsp;vulnerable people, and I don’t believe he will survive infection with coronavirus”—which had been spreading rapidly through the British prison system, especially at Belmarsh, the high security prison in which Assange is being held.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a prison, Belmarsh has a very bad reputation, and is ordinarily reserved for the most violent and dangerous prisoners, which Assange was certainly not. Once known as <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/julian-assange-being-held-in-uk-belmarsh-prison-known-as-britains-guantanamo-bay-2019-4">“Britain’s Guantanamo Bay,”</a> a number of its inmates participated in high profile terrorist attacks, and at least one ISIS executioner, nicknamed “<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/terror-attacks-uk-prison-belmarsh-streatham-radicalisation-a9332531.html">Jihadi John”</a> resides there.</p>



<p>For much of his stay at Belmarsh, Assange has been forced to remain in his cell for 23 hours a day and has even been <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/10/06/julian-assange-trial-extradition/">deprived of a radio</a>. Three prisoners have died at Belmarsh this year under unexplained circumstances, and another was discovered dead in his cell just last month.&nbsp;With Coronavirus spreading throughout the facility, the danger to Assange increases every day.</p>

<p>Noting Assange’s growing fragility, Moris said that, “I have discovered that love makes the most intolerable circumstances seem bearable but this is different, I am now terrified I will not see him alive again.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stella Moris, 37, is a South African-born attorney who met&nbsp;Assange in 2011, after she had been engaged by his legal team to help fight his extradition.</p>



<p>“Over time,” she said, “Julian and I developed a strong intellectual and emotional bond. He became my best friend and I became his.” Their actual relationship began in 2015, under what she described as “extraordinary circumstances.” They became engaged in 2017.</p>

<p>Moris had been raising their two children on her own, as a single mother, and did her best to shield them from the harmful publicity she knew would surround them if their existence became known. But she changed her mind and finally went public, she said, because their lives were now “on the brink,” with Assange facing death every day as a result of his rapidly deteriorating health, which made him all the more vulnerable to the wave of Covid-19 spreading through Belmarsh.</p>



<p>“Julian has been fiercely protective of me and has done his best to shield me from the nightmares of his life,” she said. “I have lived quietly and privately, raising Gabriel and Max on my own and longing for the day we could be together as a family. Now I have to speak out because I can see that his life is on the brink.”</p>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8210957/WikiLeaks-boss-Julian-Assange-fathered-two-children-inside-Ecuadorian-embassy-lawyer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video interview with the Daily Mail</a>, Moris revealed that, via a secret video hookup, Assange was able to observe the births of both of his children in real time, at the hospital in London. He later was also able to meet Gabriel in person after Moris smuggled him into the embassy, without revealing that Assange was the father.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She further revealed that both boys had visited their father in prison, and that the couple planned to marry, even if Assange had to spend the rest of his life behind bars.</p>



<p>Moris says they were told by someone on the Ecuadorean embassy staff that the CIA (which had illegally planted spy cameras all over Assange’s quarters, including his bathroom) had tried to steal some of Gabriel’s DNA from his diaper because they suspected that Assange might be the father and wanted confirmation.</p>



<p>There were also reports that the U.S.&nbsp;plotted to kill Julian Assange and make it look like an accident, and that spies discussed kidnapping or poisoning him in the Ecuadorean embassy. That story appeared in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8041597/US-plotted-kill-Julian-Assange-make-look-like-accident.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 25 Daily Mail</a>, but was surprisingly (or not so surprisingly) not followed up by corporate media.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although not often covered, the human side of Julian Assange, even when reported, has too often been presented by the media in lurid tabloid fashion, not for sympathy but for sensation.</p>



<p>There has, in fact, been precious little sympathy for Assange in the media, and as a result his case has not been widely—or fairly—covered. The BBC, especially, has virtually buried all mention of the trial, even though it is taking place in their own backyard, and will have a huge impact on the way their reporters will be able to cover the news in the future.</p>



<p>What we and the rest of the world—especially members of the working press—will now have to do is simply bite our nails until Judge Vanessa Baraitser (a notoriously “hanging judge” with a 96% record of approving extraditions) hands down her ruling on January 4.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Over the past few years, I’ve noticed certain skills in people I admire, from Paul Graham, Vitalik Buterin, to Ender Wiggin.</p>

<p>Most normal people like me don’t realise these are skills. This makes the skills powerful - not everyone can see them, and very few people have mastered them.</p>

<p>However, I aim to change that. What follows below are 10 skills sourced from admirable people that I want to develop this decade.</p>

<p>Powerful life skills make powerful people.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-take-compounding-seriously">Learn to take compounding seriously</h2>

<p>It’s not just your wealth that compounds, but life experience and knowledge, too.</p>

<p>So, learn the most basic, most useful skills first. The longer you wait to learn skills like these, the less time there is for compounding magic. That’s what this entire list is about: powerful skills to learn and use for the rest of your life.</p>

<p>And even though you’ve heard about compounding, this item is first on the list, because <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/taking-ideas-seriously.html">taking ideas seriously is hard</a>.</p>

<p>A good way to figure out what compounds is <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/year-in-review-2019.html#compounding-is-powerful-building-intuition-for-compounding-even-more-so">to figure out what’s a platform</a>.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-develop-taste">Learn to develop taste</h2>

<p>Despite prevalent beliefs, taste isn’t subjective.</p>

<p>While it may seem like it on the outside, when you say “I just love this painting” or “I just love this coffee machine” - all it means is that the defining characteristics are illegible to you. And noticing this is the first step.</p>

<p>Let’s take a specific example. Say you’re designing a high quality clay pot - and you’ve never done this before.</p>

<p>What’s a good way to develop taste for quality here?</p>

<p>If you’ve heard this claypot parable, you know the answer: start by making lots of crap pots.</p>

<blockquote>
  <div><p>The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality. His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the “quantity” group: fifty pound of pots rated an “A,” forty pounds a “B,” and so on. Those being graded on “quality,” however, needed to produce only one pot—albeit a perfect one—to get an “A.”</p><p>

Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the “quantity” group was busily churning out piles of work—and learning from their mistakes—the “quality” group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay. - <a href="https://amzn.to/3o9o17A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Art and Fear</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup></p></div>
</blockquote>

<p>Let others tell you what you’ve made is crap. Learn why. Notice when they tell you something is great. Figure out why.</p>

<p>This transfers to writing as well: Popular advice to get better is to write a lot of junk, do it a 100 times, and pay particular attention to what is received well. Here’s <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/taste.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another example - developing taste for design</a>.</p>

<p>In effect, you bootstrap good taste by first learning what others consider good. Then, <a href="#learn-to-see-systems">you see the system behind it</a>. Then you break the rules and still manage to awe.</p>

<p>Then you’ve developed taste.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-sequence-things-well">Learn to sequence things well</h2>

<p>Waking up when others are asleep and getting lots done is a super power. It’s born out of a system of <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/sequencing-things-in-the-right-order.html">learning to sequence things well</a>.</p>

<p>It means choosing the right time for that Netflix binge.</p>

<p>It means being prepared before the meeting, not scrambling to get things done after.</p>

<p>It means reading the coursebook before the lecture, not after.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-see-what-others-see">Learn to see what others see</h2>

<p>How well can you understand other people? Can you sense their desires, their concerns, and what events lead to those desires and concerns?</p>

<p>If you can do this, you can understand them. But not before.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him. I think it’s impossible to really understand somebody, what they want, what they believe, and not love them the way they love themselves. - <a href="https://amzn.to/2KKe8Px" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ender’s Game</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s worth going this far because understanding is powerful. It helps you empathise. It helps you negotiate. It helps you figure out why you don’t have product-market fit. It helps you learn quickly: you can switch through personas and see what will and won’t work.</p>

<p>How do you do learn to see? I know no better way than to practice. Try it a 100 times. <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/subscribe">Come back next year</a>, and maybe I’ll have a better way once I’ve done it a 100 times.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-make-and-execute-decisions-quickly">Learn to make and execute decisions quickly</h2>

<p>Most people have a bias towards analysis-paralysis versus getting shit done.</p>

<p>When decisions are reversible - and they mostly are - speed is a super power. Cultivating a habit of making decisions quickly, and then executing them is better than just thinking about it.</p>

<p>Training this skill begins as easily as deciding what to eat on a huge menu. It’s a small step, but over time, <a href="#learn-to-take-compounding-seriously">even the smallest steps compound</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Hesitation is always easy, rarely useful” - Prof. Quirrel alterego, <a href="http://www.hpmor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HPMOR</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s an <a href="https://firstround.com/review/speed-as-a-habit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">example in the context of business</a>. And a <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1345140364995227648" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet from Sam Altman</a>.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-spot-a-convex-or-concave-world">Learn to spot a convex or concave world</h2>

<p>In the world of viral infections, a 50% lockdown is worse than a 0% and a 100% lockdown, both. The virus isn’t contained, and businesses have to shut down, too.</p>

<p>In the world of immigration policies, letting some specific people in is better than letting no one or everyone in. The middle ground is better than the extremes.</p>

<p>When the best of both worlds is great, you’re in a concave disposition.</p>

<p>When the best of both worlds is worse than either, you’re in a convex disposition.</p>

<p>The world is sometimes concave, and sometimes convex. Knowing your topology can help you make better decisions.</p>

<p>I first noted this when <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/08/concave.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vitalik Buterin explained it</a>. Read it for more concrete examples.</p>

<!-- ## Learn to do obvious things -->

<h2 id="learn-to-tell-stories">Learn to tell stories</h2>

<p>People donate more to charity when they know a single victim’s story, versus statistics of a thousand deaths. It’s called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifiable_victim_effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Identifiable Victim Effect</a>, but it’s the power of stories over facts. The right framing gets you further than all the facts combined.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ideas &amp; facts contextualised by stories are more powerful than either alone.</p>

<p><i></i><b>The Skill of Storytelling</b><br>
There’s lots to unpack here, and this is the first skill I’ve been working on for the past few months. Watch out for a long blogpost in 2 weeks!</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-dive-into-the-source-code-when-documentation-isnt-enough">Learn to dive into the source code when documentation isn’t enough</h2>

<p>Sometimes, there’s no precedent for what you want to do. Or the people who did it before didn’t write a manual.</p>

<p>In cases like these, figuring things out for yourself is powerful. Research papers and obscure books aren’t just for scientists. They’re freely available on the internet* for all of humanity to use. Learn to use it. Learn about resources like <a href="https://sci-hub.do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SciHub</a>, <a href="https://libgen.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LibGen</a>, and hiring researchers. You’re allowed to hire people (specially graduate students!) to satisfy your research concerns.</p>

<p>… and when you’re done, <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html#writing-code">preserve context for future you</a>.</p>

<p>It’s a lot like trying to use an API that has no documentation. Would’ve been easy if there was documentation, but there isn’t. So you got to do it the hard way: read the source code and figure out what you need to make things work.</p>

<p>It’s also like <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/A-framework-for-First-Principles-Thinking.html">figuring out what you need to build rockets yourself</a> when existing ones are too expensive.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/37sHjeisS9uJufi4u/scholarship-how-to-do-it-efficiently" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More resources here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-be-specific">Learn to be specific</h2>

<p>Every time I gave an example above, I was training my specificity muscles.</p>

<p>Most of the time, most people don’t know what they’re talking about. Not being specific is a sign of that. The more abstract the word, the harder it is to pin down a meaning.</p>

<p>For example, “negative ramifications” doesn’t tell you what exactly happened, while “the sonic boom from the new supersonic jet destroyed windows in a 100m radius” is a lot more specific.</p>

<p>Learn to be specific, and learn to spot when others aren’t. <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NgtYDP3ZtLJaM248W/sotw-be-specific" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here’s how</a>.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-see-systems">Learn to see systems</h2>

<p>There’s two kinds of people.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bob, who will see this list, find some skills very interesting, and then go about honing those skills</li>
  <li>Alice, who will see this list, and wonder how I came up with these
<!-- - The Inspiration-Junkie, who will lurk and move on to the next inspiring post without changing anything -->
</li>
</ul>

<p>Alice would then try to understand the system that generated these ideas. Then, she’ll adopt the system, and come up with skills possibly more relevant to herself.</p>

<p>Having the option to do both is powerful. Since Bob is the default, <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/How-to-see-Systems-in-everyday-life.html">learn to be like Alice</a>. Choose <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/understanding-systems.html">systems when things are important</a> to you. Choose hacks when you need a quickfix.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've had the same New Years Resolution for the last three years. Write More. And every year, for the past three years, December would roll around and I would have inevitably...well...not written. There were a series of impediments that always seemed to stand in the way. Not enough time. Not knowing what to write about. Fear of writing uninspiring or boring essays.</p><p>This post marks the 12th essay I've written &amp; published in 2020. One post a month (though I started late and crammed in December). I have <em>finally</em> fulfilled my writing resolution of 2017 🙌</p><p>I've found writing to be an incredibly fulfilling way to spend my quarantine, and I want to share the practical lessons I've learned from (most failing) to develop a writing habit. There's plenty of good resources on how to write (recommend <a href="https://www.julian.com/guide/write/intro">here</a>, <a href="https://moretothat.com/visual-storytelling/">here</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Writing-10th-Anniversary-Memoir-Craft/dp/1439156816">here</a>, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/useful.html">here</a>), so this isn't meant to be a comprehensive how-to guide for starting a blog. </p><p>But if you're thinking about starting a writing habit in 2021 or stuck in a rut on your writing, here's how I overcame it.</p><h2>Multiplayer Writing &gt; Single Player</h2><p>There was one takeaway that rose above the rest: writing is better when you write with others. Your essays will get better with crit and revisions, yes, but the experience of creating the essay is more fun when you write with friends.</p><p>The trope of the recluse writer returning from the cabin with a masterpiece in hand is eclipsed many-fold by the press rooms, the writers workshops, the smokey Parisian writing clubs. For many years I thought I needed a cabin and some quiet, when in reality I needed a crowded and busy writers’ room.</p><p>We started a writing community in our work slack channel for people trying to write more (#yolo-writers). It became a place where you can share a rough draft and get honest feedback on it. It created accountability (and FOMO) when everyone is sharing their drafts and publishing. It's a messy exchange of ideas on all kinds of topics that people are thinking about, but there is no shortage of new connections and ways of thinking about the idea.</p><p>Having a personal "editorial board" is helpful for a few reasons. The first is that it builds confidence, because you share your post with someone who is not you and they will typically have (at least some) nice things to say. The second is that they help you unpack the important pieces of the post.</p><p>Our #yolo-writers channel turned writing from single-player game into a multi-player game.</p><h2>Build Your Writing Funnel</h2><p>One of the ways a "funnel", or series of steps you need to go through to get your ideas out into the world:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Idea</strong> - first you need to pick something to write about, which can be a challenge if there are no constraints.</p></li><li><p><strong>Draft</strong> - this is where you take your idea and bang out a first draft. It requires hands on the keyboard, good space to think, and a touch of inspiration</p></li><li><p><strong>Edit</strong> - You need to take what is unlikely a good first draft and turn it into something that you think is valuable (either to the reader, or yourself)</p></li><li><p><strong>Publish &amp; Share</strong> - You need to hit the <code>Publish</code> button, and see the post live on the internet, and share it with folks</p></li></ol><p>By thinking about your essays as a funnel, you can figure out where you are jammed. Do you not have enough ideas? Are you not converting those ideas into drafts? Does it take too long to edit them?</p><p>Here's a snapshot of my writing funnel stats. You can see that I have a backlog of ideas for blog posts, a bunch of active drafts, a few in the Editing, and 11 published.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5871fd6-c6b6-48fd-a506-7f71550377e5_1666x1028.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5871fd6-c6b6-48fd-a506-7f71550377e5_1666x1028.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d5871fd6-c6b6-48fd-a506-7f71550377e5_1666x1028.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:898,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:60680,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>This is a pretty different approach to writing than what I've come across in school or work. In those contexts, there is a clear assignment and corresponding topic. There's a due date. With personal writing and essays, all of these constraints are relaxed so you can pick ideas up write, and edit as you please.</p><h3>Ideas 💡</h3><p>I have many more <strong>Ideas</strong> than I have <strong>Drafts</strong>. That's because (a) many of my Ideas are not actually interesting enough to warrant an essay and (b) it's a lot easier to add an idea to my list than to write an essay.</p><p>I like to have a place to put ideas as they come up. I have a Notion writing board and I'll create a new post with the headline as the idea, and link to whatever made me think of the idea. Sometimes I'll add some initial thoughts, but at this point I really just want to capture the idea and return to it later when I'm ready to write.</p><p>There's a great segment on <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/348/tough-room">This American Life</a>, where Ira Glass goes into the writers room at The Onion. The writers go through a brutal process every week of creating over 600 headlines for the satirical paper, only to whittle the list down to 16 articles that actually get written.  The problem is that many of the <em><strong>headlines</strong></em> are funny on the surface, but there's no depth to the joke.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71cc5073-c3a5-4b3c-90d2-6a14212a150f_1486x896.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71cc5073-c3a5-4b3c-90d2-6a14212a150f_1486x896.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/71cc5073-c3a5-4b3c-90d2-6a14212a150f_1486x896.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:878,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:573,&quot;bytes&quot;:377452,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a><figcaption>https://www.thisamericanlife.org/426/transcript</figcaption></figure></div><p>I've found the same with essay ideas. By the numbers, only about 1 in 5 of my ideas have actually materialized into an essay. This isn't from a lack of trying, many of them just don't go anywhere. Which means that ~80% of the ideas I think are good at the time, turn out to not be viable ideas at all! </p><p>Ideas will come throughout the day — on a run, in a meeting — so it's good to have an easy way to capture and figure out if it's a good idea later. </p><p>What topics should you write about? "Write whatever you want!" is not super helpful, but is the reality when starting out. This turned out to be the biggest impediments for me when getting this project off the ground. I didn't think I had a unique perspective on a particular topic. But I was pleasantly surprised to see how that vague concern came crumbling down.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F589359e1-c537-4ecc-8974-7a7c912a1971_2198x546.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F589359e1-c537-4ecc-8974-7a7c912a1971_2198x546.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/589359e1-c537-4ecc-8974-7a7c912a1971_2198x546.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:362,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:123850,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a><figcaption>Snapshot of my writing funnel…Ideas column is a dumping ground to mine later</figcaption></figure></div><p>It turns out that nobody sees and thinks about the world the way you do.

I am admittedly not great at marketing what I write. I write because it's personally fulfilling and helps clarify my thinking, so I'll point you to some strategies that Lenny Rachitsky recommends on building <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaeuZAqJwEY">his newsletter community</a>. But it's a really great feeling when someone references or engages with something that you wrote. Remember that feeling next time you're procrastinating or feeling embarrassed about a draft.</p><h2>KYSS</h2><p>Keep Your Stack Simple. KYSS. I repeat: Keep Your Stack Simple.</p><p>There was a point during the year where I was running Google Lighthouse tests to figure out how to optimize my page load performance for a <a href="https://github.com/ijjk/notion-blog">Next.js app running on Vercel powered by a Notion backend</a>. I wanted some analytics so I got Segment implemented and built a dashboard in Amplitude.</p><p>Worrying about my writing tech stack turned out to be a very good way to distract myself from <em>actually</em> writing. This is a common trap I've seen others fall into. My only advice is to recognize that this is a means of procrastinating, take a break instead of falling down an optimization rabbit hole, and come back when you're ready to write.</p><p>In the end, I simplified:</p><ul><li><p>I write and edit in <a href="https://n2parko.com/p/www.notion.so">Notion</a></p></li><li><p>I draw diagrams in <a href="https://excalidraw.com/">Excalidraw</a></p></li><li><p>I publish on <a href="https://n2parko.com/">Substack</a></p></li></ul><p>There's a bit of copy-pasting between Notion —&gt; Substack to get a post live, but I like being able to keep the Writing Funnel on a board in Notion and prefer the editor.</p><h2>Write for Your Why</h2><p>There are a lot of reasons to write more. It can help clarify your thinking, sharpen your ideas, build your community, release the pent up ideas in your brain. Reflecting on the reason <em><strong>why</strong></em> you're picking up a writing habit can help quell the internal excuses that are preventing you from doing it. At the end of the day, the <em>why</em> is personal.</p><p>If you are just getting started...don't write for others, write for yourself! The biggest mental blocker I had was in trying to fulfill some vague expectation of (future, imaginary) readers...when in reality, the value came from the messy exchange of ideas …</p></div></div>

        <h2><a href="http://thinking.farm/essays/2020-12-29-designing-money/">Designing Money: A Functional Trilemma for the Digital Age</a></h2>
            
            <section id="single-content">
                <p><em><strong>TL;DR: We need a new way to understand moneyâ€”instead of discussing what money is we are best served by clarifying what money does. I propose a trilemma of functions that money can support:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>adaptive supply</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>durable value</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>stable peg</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Fiat moneys support adaptive supply and value durabilityâ€”these are good media of exchange. Collateral moneys support value durability and peg stabilityâ€”these are good stores of value. Rebasing moneys support adaptive supply and peg stabilityâ€”these are good units of account.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Moneys that try to support all three functions are fragile and inevitably break, reverting to their most stable configurations. Fiat moneys with managed exchange rates eventually revert to pure fiat and give up peg stability, often through painful devaluations. Collateral moneys with fractional reserves eventually revert to full collateralization and give up adaptive supply, shrinking the money supply in circulation, often trigerring financial panics and crises.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>More importantly, this fragility remains regardless of the size of the money supplyâ€”it cannot be eliminated by â€œbootstrappingâ€� or â€œgrowingâ€� out of it.</strong></em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>It is time to do away with the conventional economistsâ€™ definition of money as a unit of account, store of value, and medium of exchange. For one, is a definition derived from myths about the origins of money, positing a progression from barter and the problem of coincidence of wants, to free trade and precious metals. More importantly, the definition is useless when it comes to designing money, leading to endless debates about what counts as money, not how it could be made.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-typologythe-functional-trilemma">A new typologyâ€”the functional trilemma</h2>
<p>I believe it is time to focus less on what money <strong>is</strong> and more on what money <strong>does</strong>. Thus, I propose a new typology based on a trilemma of three functions that money can supportâ€”adaptive supply, durable value, and a stable peg. In the long-run, each money can only support two of these functions. Those that try to support all three will inevitably revert back to their most robust two-function configuration, like how a rubber band stretched over three pegs might slip to just two.</p>
<p>We can derive the traditional economics definition and classify historical monetary systems just by combining these three functions. More importantly, the functional trilemma is a map to the design limitations of digital money, and highlights the fragility that will break the newest generation of â€œstablecoinâ€� protocols, which try to do too much.</p>
<figure>

</figure>

<p>Let us define these three functions in more detail. By adaptive supply, I mean that supply is a function of demand: \(\ S=f(D) \). By durable valueI mean that the purchasing power of a money stock stays constant across time:\(\ v_t (S) = v_{t+n} (S) \). By stable peg I mean that the measured purchasing power of a single money unit stays constant across time: \(\ v_t (unit) = v_{t+n} (unit) \).</p>
<h2 id="fiat-collateral-and-rebasing-moneys">Fiat, collateral, and rebasing moneys</h2>
<figure>
    <img src="http://thinking.farm/2020-12-29-designing-money/fiat.jpeg" width="100%"> 
</figure>

<p>Letâ€™s flesh the trilemma with three robust classes of money designsâ€”fiat, collateral, and rebasing moneys. We can represent them with some examples from traditional and digital finance:the US dollar (USD), USD Coin (USDC) , and Ampleforth (Ample/AMPL).</p>
<p>Fiat moneys are the easiest to understand: 1) their supply is modulated by the authorities to meet demand, and 2) the purchasing power of the total stock of money, in the long run, is stable over time. Monetary policy, for the most part, produces changes in consumer or asset price levels, as well as a redistribution of resources, but cannot change the long-run level of economic activity. For these reasons, pure fiat currencies have free floating exchange rates–that is, they cannot support a stable peg.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="http://thinking.farm/2020-12-29-designing-money/collateral.jpeg" width="100%"> 
</figure>

<p>Collateral moneys like USDC or currency boards with convertibility (also called redeemability) have 1) a stable peg, since convertibility into the reserve assets anchors the price, and 2) durable value, since each unit is backed by an exact quantity of the reserve asset, and is constant across time. In the case of USDC, each coin is backed by exactly one USD. Collateral moneys are the quintessential â€œstores of valueâ€�â€”many emerging market residents prefer that their national currency have a hard peg, as it guarantees that their savings and investments can retain their value over time, instead of suffering from inflation and devaluation.</p>
<p>Collateral moneys do not have adaptive supply, however. They can only mint or redeem money according to the amount of assets in their reserves. In a true specie standard, this was determined by the supply of gold or silver. In the age of the dollar, the reserves are held in dollars or other qualifying foreign exchange. In the case of USDC, the supply is a strict function of the amount of USD locked into custodian institutions, the same is true of wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC). Neither USDC or wBTC supply are functions of market demand for USDC or wBTC.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="http://thinking.farm/2020-12-29-designing-money/rebasing.jpeg" width="100%"> 
</figure>

<p>Lastly, consider what it would mean for a money to have both adaptive supply and a stable pegâ€”this combination is the trickiest one of them all, because it is so unintuitive, and historically rare. These are rebasing moneys.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="http://thinking.farm/2020-12-29-designing-money/ampl-illustration.jpg" width="100%"> <figcaption>
            <h4>Illustration of automatically changing AMPL balances over time (Ampleforth.org)</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The Ampleforth protocol adjusts the balances in owners’ wallets–this is a process called rebasing. When demand for Amples is high, the number of AMPL in wallets increases, and when demand is low, the number of AMPL decreases–so I might have 1 AMPL today, 3 tomorrow, and 2 the day after. Physically, this system is impossible to recreate, though Nobel Prize-winning economist James Buchanan dreamed of such an automatically adjusting digital money in the late 1950s. He imagined it would be run out of a massive mainframe, to which the keys to change its code had been destroyed, making it tamper-proof.</p>
<p>So far 1) the purchasing power of a single AMPL has remained more or less equal to the 2019 USD (when it was launched), and 2) the AMPL supply is responsive to demand. However, the purchasing power of the AMPL money stock has not remained constantâ€”it has risen and fallen, sometimes by more than an order of magnitude!</p>
<p>From a historical perspective, Amples have some similarity to the â€œvirtual tael/silverâ€� or <em>xuliang/xuyin</em> è™›å…©/è™›éŠ€ of the Qing Empire. During the Qing, the empireâ€™s vast majority of circulating media of commercial exchange were copper cash éŒ¢. Cash was the preferred money in the countryside where over 90% of the population worked. In cities and interregional trade lived a zoo of silver ingots called taels, as well as silver and gold coins, all minted locally or abroad. It took historians a long time to understand this financial system and how it worked without a unified territorial currency. Though assaying was sometimes used, for the most part taels and coins circulated at different prices in different regions. Thus, two taels or coins by different mints, even if they have the same silver content, could carry different prices.</p>
<p>The empireâ€™s Board of Revenue, however, kept its books in a unit called the <em>kuping tael</em> åº«å¹³å…©â€”taxes had to be settled and remitted in this unit. Long-dated commercial contracts were also in <em>kupingliang</em>. The price of silver and copper coins might fluctuate depending on how many were being minted or melted down, but the government and the private sector certainly thought contracts in <em>kupingliang</em> were more stable in value. Organizations rarely kept assets physically in this unit, which is why they were called â€œvirtualâ€� (though è™› also means “false”). To settle contracts or taxes one could either buy the <em>kupingliang</em> on the market, or the receiving authority could â€œconvertâ€� a payment into <em>kupingliang</em> at a rate of their choosing or estimate. Digital money is different because this second option is not availableâ€”smart contracts require the actual token in question to be settled. So a contract denominated in AMPL needs AMPL tokens to settle!</p>

<p>We can see from this excursion that the Economics 101 three-part definition of money is mistaken–money does NOT have to simultaneously satisfy all three properties! In fact, good money designs are robust because they are great at just one thing–whether that is as a store of value, medium of exchange, or unit of account. How is that the case? The economists definition’s three parts are actually equivalent to the two-function combinations embedded in the trilemma: fiat moneys are great media of exchange, collateral moneys are the best stores of value, and rebasing moneys are the ideal units of account. Since moneys can only robustly support two of three functions in the trilemma, this means that historical moneys robustly fulfilled only one part of the Economics 101 definition. <strong>In fact, history shows that moneys which try to fulfill all three functions inevitably have to snap back into a robust two-function configuration.</strong> In other words, to be robust, money has to focus on a fiat, collateral, or rebasing design.</p>

<p>Well, what about a fiat system with a managed peg, one might say? Most fiat currencies today have a â€œmanaged float,â€� where the central bank intervenes in foreign exchange markets to anchor the price of its money. But the arrangement is unstableâ€”it cannot last forever, and historically pegs have always broken down, usually when the central bank runs out of reserves. In those moments, the true nature of the system is revealed. In the case of the Mexican 1994 crisis or the Asian financial crisis of 1997, these currencies were exposed as true fiat moneys when they gave up their fixed exchange rates.</p>

<p>Something similar happens with collateral moneys that try to make their supply more responsive to money demand. A classic situation is …</p></section></article></section></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="content"><p>As we start a new decade, it’s a good time to reflect on expectations for the next 10 years. Tyler thinks the Great Stagnation <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/12/why-did-the-great-stagnation-end.html">could be ending</a>. Caleb sees <a href="https://www.agglomerations.tech/cracks-in-the-great-stagnation/">cracks</a>. Noah expresses <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/techno-optimism-for-the-2020s">techno-optimism</a>. In this post, my aim is not to predict an end or non-end to stagnation. Rather, it is to think through the particulars of how technology could evolve over the next decade. Then we can assess separately whether we should consider it the Roaring 20s or the Boring 20s.</p><p>What would constitute an end to the Great Stagnation? Any precise cutoff will be arbitrary, but for the sake of discussion, let’s say sustained growth in <a href="https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/indicators-data/total-factor-productivity-tfp/">utilization-adjusted total factor productivity</a> of 2 percent per year. By comparison, mean utilization-adjusted TFP growth from 1947 through 1972 was 2.1 percent. Since 2005, it has been 0.17 percent. (Note: it is important to use the utilization-adjusted series, as this corrects for the business cycle.)</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/a7a8a1d9e4c4d1050c2902966a316436559074f1/cd6b6/img/tfp.png" alt="Total factor productivity in the U.S. since 1947" title="Total factor productivity in the U.S. since 1947"></p><p>Whatever your cutoff for TFP growth, one of my convictions is that scientific breakthroughs alone are not enough to drive an end to the Great Stagnation. TFP only budges when new technologies are adopted at scale, and generally this means products, not just science. Science lays critical groundwork for new technology, but after all the science is done, much work remains. Someone must shepherd the breakthrough to the product stage, where it can actually affect TFP. This means building businesses, surmounting regulatory obstacles, and scaling production.</p><p>With that caveat firmly in mind, what will the next decade bring in terms of meaningful technological change? Here’s what I’m watching.</p><h2 id="biotech-and-health">Biotech and health</h2><p>We are coming off a huge win: two new mRNA COVID vaccines, conceived and brought to market in less than a year. The ability to encode and deploy arbitrary mRNA in our bodies sure seems like a game changer—it allows us to essentially program our cells to make whatever proteins we want. In the case of the COVID vaccines, the vaccine payload instructs our cells to make the coronavirus spike protein, which our immune system then learns to attack. Bert Hubert has a <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/">fascinating write-up</a> of the “code” in the vaccine.</p><p>Bringing a brand new vaccine to market in less than a year—using a never-before-applied-in-humans-at-scale technology no less—is a world record, but it could have been even faster. As David Wallace-Wells <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/12/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-design.html">emphasizes</a>, Moderna’s vaccine was designed by January 13. We had it the whole time. Some delay was necessary to determine effective dosing. Some further regulatory delay may have been warranted to ensure the vaccine was safe and to ascertain its efficacy. But as Wallace-Wells indicates, the regulatory outcome was never really in doubt. “None of the scientists I spoke to for this story were at all surprised by either outcome,” he writes. “All said they expected the vaccines were safe and effective all along.”</p><p>What should we make of the fact that all of the scientists knew all along that Moderna’s vaccine would work? The question in my mind is: what other mRNA treatments do we have the whole time? What if I told you Moderna has an <a href="https://www.poz.com/article/experimental-hiv-vaccine-stimulates-production-neutralizing-antibodies">HIV vaccine candidate</a>? HIV lacks SARS-CoV-2’s telltale spike protein and thus may prove a more challenging foe—but don’t you wonder, if we treated the problem with real urgency, whether new mRNA technology could wipe out the AIDS epidemic this decade? I do.</p><p>And mRNA technology can be deployed against more than just viruses. Both Moderna and BioNTech have personalized vaccine candidates targeting cancer. Although called a “cancer vaccine,” the treatment is only administered once the subject has cancer—it isn’t preventative. The companies use an algorithm to analyze the genetic sequences of the tumor and the patient’s healthy cells and predict which molecules could be used to generate a strong immune response against the cancer. “I was actually witnessing the cancer cells shrinking before my eyes,” <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03072-8">said</a> Brad Kremer, a melanoma patient who received the BioNTech treatment. So let’s milk mRNA technology for all it’s worth this decade. It can save us from more than just a pandemic.</p><p>What about CRISPR? It is a great example of a technology that has not yet made a meaningful economic contribution. Although the technique for editing DNA was discovered in 2012—and a Nobel Prize was awarded to its two discoverers this year—no treatment using CRISPR has been approved outside of clinical trials. So far, its impact has been limited to making researchers more productive—not a bad thing, to be sure, but not close to CRISPR’s full potential. As trials progress, however, I do think some CRISPR treatments will come online in the next few years, especially those targeting genetic disorders that we have very limited means of otherwise treating.</p><p>DeepMind’s <a href="https://medium.com/cgo-benchmark/deepminds-protein-folding-solution-what-just-happened-279d32e8d0f">protein-folding breakthrough</a> signals a promising decade for the science of proteomics. Most directly, being able to predict protein shapes will enable us to discover drugs more rapidly. Buuuut, because drug trials take many years, we might expect this technology not to really be felt by the general public until the 2030s.</p><p>What DeepMind’s achievement indicates to me the most is that machine learning is actually useful. This might seem obvious, but consider: most applications of machine learning so far—excluding autonomous vehicles, which have themselves not really arrived yet—are toys. I love watching AlphaZero crush Stockfish on YouTube, but chess is literally a game. GPT-3 produced some fun demos. AlphaFold heralds something different—non-toy superhuman performance is now here, and I am interested to see what else it can do. Aside from the aforementioned AVs, I expect it to be applied widely in other areas of biology. Again, it will take a long time for the breakthroughs to trickle down into products, but at least the 2030s should be sick. I mean, not sick. Healthy.</p><p>Let’s talk about life extension, one of my favorite biotech topics. 2020 was a big year for the Conboy Lab at Berkeley, which proved that all the weird past findings about “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabiosis">young blood</a>” extending life were not actually due to any elixir in the blood of children (thank goodness). Rather, the rejuvenating aspects of young blood experiments were due to the dilution of harmful factors in old blood. By mechanically removing plasma and replacing it with saline and enough albumin to replace what was taken out, they diluted aged blood factors in both mice and humans and were able to <a href="https://www.aging-us.com/article/103418/text#fulltext">rejuvenate germ layer tissues</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-020-00297-8">improve cognition by reducing neuroinflammation</a>.</p><p>These findings are exciting not only because they represent a scientific advance in understanding aging, but also because they herald the first real anti-aging product that could come to market. Therapeutic plasma exchange is FDA-approved (not for aging, but for a bunch of other conditions). I imagine there remain prohibitions on advertising that it can add years to your life, but it is safe, and a doctor can prescribe it off label. It’s also cheap. An automated plasmapheresis machine—which lets you do treatment after treatment—can be bought online for under $3,000. That is less than the cost of a single transfusion of young blood sold by the startup <a href="https://www.ambrosiaplasma.com/">Ambrosia</a>. How long until someone opens a clinic offering plasma dilution? I bet someone tries it in 2021. If it works, people will get over the weirdness, and it could be commonplace by 2030.</p><p>Another longevity product that is about to get hot: aging clocks based on DNA methylation or proteomics. Do you want to know how biologically old you are? Today, for a few hundred dollars, you can get a test that will tell you. As these tests become better and cheaper, self-experimenters are going to have a field day. Doing before-and-after aging tests, anyone who can get their hands on human growth hormone could replicate the protocol used by <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acel.13028">Fahy et al.</a> to rejuvenate the thymus. As the thymus is a critical element of the immune system, decline of which is a critical factor in aging, this is non-trivial rejuvenation. The Fahy study found that 12 months of treatment created about 2.5 years of epigenetic rejuvenation, with results accelerating in the last quarter of the trial.</p><p>There is a lot more in the <a href="https://www.lifespan.io/road-maps/the-rejuvenation-roadmap/">Rejuvenation Roadmap</a>—dozens of possible life-extending treatments are at various stages of development. There’s a good chance a few senolytic drugs will be approved by the end of the decade. As I noted <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/12/30/anti-aging-research-health-care-spending-biden/">yesterday at Fortune</a>, we spend less than 1% of the NIH budget on aging biology—we should raise that by a lot.</p><p>Unlike others, I am not-so-bullish on metformin. It does seem to reduce all-cause mortality in Americans, but it may do so because <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/met.2018.0105">88% of Americans are metabolically unhealthy</a>. If you are one of the 12%, and you should strive to be, I don’t think metformin will do much for you.</p><p>One final biotech observation: every year, the Apple Watch gets a new health-related sensor. This year it was blood oxygen, pretty good for detecting if you might have COVID! Fast forward to 2030 and wearables will have at least 10 more health-related sensors than they do today. Some no-brainers are body temperature, blood pressure, and blood glucose sensors. What will the other 7 be? At some point, it becomes possible to replace a lot of primary care with continuous monitoring. A few smart algorithms to provide simple medical advice could improve population-level health without much cost. More data could also yield faster, more accurate, and of course more remote diagnoses when you do have to see a doctor.</p><p>There is a lot in biotech that is promising right now, but in more than any other field, it is important not to be seduced by the sexy headlines showing rapid scientific progress. Don’t get complacent. Biology is proceeding faster than medical productivity because a lot of the wonderful discoveries are not being translated into approved treatments and products at a decent rate. Let’s salute and cheer for the discoveries, but spare many thoughts for the entrepreneurs trying to bring treatments to market.</p><h2 id="energy">Energy</h2><p>The 2010s were the …</p></article></div>

<p>Hey ___,</p>

<p>I know you've been curious about some of the stuff I've done at
<a href="https://dynamicland.org/">Dynamicland</a>. It might be a while until you
can make it out here and visit in person, so I'll try to explain one
project of mine, Geokit, from top to bottom, to give you some of the
flavor.</p>

<p>I'll discuss what Geokit actually is and what you do with it
first, and then I'll explain how it's made. That explanation might
help you understand how people make things in Dynamicland in
general. It's the kind of detail that isn't covered in the zine or on
the Dynamicland website.</p>

<p>I sort of hope you read this, come here yourself, and reimplement
Geokit better.</p>

<h2 id="what-geokit-is">What Geokit is</h2>

<p><img src="https://omar.website/posts/notes-from-dynamicland-geokit/tweet.jpg">
</p>

<p>Geokit is a 'kit' or 'library' for building and viewing maps.</p>

<p>One Dynamicland researcher, <a href="https://twitter.com/lukexi">Luke
Iannini</a>, writes about his experiences
with Geokit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The real estate group that owns the building Dynamicland lives in
uses their purchasing power to influence the city to improve
infrastructure to the underserved areas of Oakland they develop
in. The head of this initiative was visiting the space, and she
began describing her work while we were gathered around the lunch
table, which happened to have Geokit spread across it looking at
Oakland. Without breaking the flow of conversation, I dealt the
transit card to display the bus routes, and she grabbed the “zoom
and pan dial”<sup id="fnref:dial"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:dial">1</a></sup> without any instruction to zoom in on a portion
of West Oakland — noticing a huge hole in route coverage she’d never
seen before where she knew there were tons of working families. We
spent the next 15 minutes exploring as she taught me more about the
city's transit details than I ever knew I wanted to know.</p>

<p>In another case at a party I learned that a person I’d just met grew
up in the same city as me (Tucson, AZ) when she searched for it to
print it out, and we then bonded deeply over looking at the
incredibly stark racial divisions in North and South Tucson that we
knew from experience but had never seen laid out in raw data.</p>

<p>I’ve never had experiences like these in any other medium. Buildings
don’t tend to have detailed racial, transit and elevation maps of
every city in the US on the walls. In theory you could pull this
data up on your personal iPad, praying there aren’t any embarrassing
notifications and hopefully remembering what you were even going to
look at by the time you’re past the lock screen looking at 24
rainbow-gradient icons and red bubbles, but I am personally not in
the habit of pulling out my devices in the middle of parties. In
both of these cases these just-dynamic-enough maps were <em>places</em> at
the party, just like the appetizers table and the piano, where
people could casually gather, play and converse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Geokit lives on a shelf when it's not in use, so I'll take it off the
shelf and lay it out on a table:</p>

<div>
<iframe width="90%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_MENkVUZq54?showinfo=0&amp;ecver=1" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p>Taking Geokit off the shelf. Some other kits below it; <a href="https://twitter.com/smd4/status/1002410711354523648">general tools</a> on
the right</p>
</div>

<h3 id="geokit-in-action">Geokit in action</h3>

<p>I'm going to pull up a map of San Francisco and zoom into Dolores
Park.</p>

<p>I'll start by typing into the "Geomap above from place search" page,
which turns the giant blank page above it into a map.</p>

<div>
<video controls="">
  <source src="https://omar.website/posts/notes-from-dynamicland-geokit/typing-place-search.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>Typing places into Geokit and seeing maps</p>
</div>

<p>If you were here in person, I'd hand <em>you</em> the keyboard, and I bet
you'd want to type your hometown in. But I'll just use San Francisco.</p>

<p>OK, now I want to zoom in to the park. I have a tool for zooming, the
"Map magnifier with IR (infrared) dial" page (the smaller page on the
right). When I put that page on the table, it becomes a zoomed-in
'inset map.'</p>

<div>
<p><img src="https://omar.website/posts/notes-from-dynamicland-geokit/ir-dial-labeled.jpg"></p><p>Inset map (right) shows a zoomed-in view of the dial's
location on the big map (left)</p>
</div>

<p>I also have to put this rotating dial on the big map of SF, which
controls both the location and zoom level of the inset map. Moving the
dial pans the inset map, and rotating the dial zooms it in and
out. Being able to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_manipulation_interface">directly</a>
move the map position is really satisfying.</p>

<p>In this next clip, I put the dial down and then pan over and zoom the
inset map to Dolores Park in the Mission.</p>

<p>Using the dial to pan and zoom the inset map to Dolores Park</p>
</div>

<p>Now I'm curious about this part of the neighborhood. How diverse is
it?  How has it changed over time? Are there stark dividing lines?
I'll apply some data layers: a color-coded demographic map (<a href="https://demographics.virginia.edu/DotMap/">"racial
dot map"</a>), and then street
lines and labels on top so the map is more understandable. I point
them at the big map first, then point them at the zoomed map (just to
show that both work).</p>

<p>Applying tilelayer overlays to the big map and then
just to the inset map</p>

the "Demographic dots tilelayer" page at the inset map. The color legend is
written on that tilelayer page – an advantage of using real paper
rather than a screen</p>
</div>

<p>Check out how the west (toward Castro) is bluer on the inset map,
while the east (toward Mission) is more orange.<sup id="fnref:census"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:census">2</a></sup> Imagine
having multiple people at the table: each person might have their
personal view on smaller pages, but the table can all share the big
map at the center.</p>

<h4 id="zoom-lenses">Zoom lenses</h4>

<p>To be honest, this whole project started with a <a href="https://omar.website/posts/notes-from-dynamicland-geokit/zoom-lens-series.jpg">very clear
image</a> I had in my head. I wanted to make <em>zoom
lenses</em>, where you could point a lens at a map to zoom into it, then
point a lens at that lens... so I want to show you those lenses now.</p>

<div>
<iframe width="90%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/awHtInUjPBQ?showinfo=0&amp;ecver=1" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p>Applying a zoom lens to the inset map, then
applying a zoom lens to that zoom lens</p>
</div>

<p>You can see me playing with the OpenPTMap (public transport) tilelayer
as I mess with zoom, applying it here and there at various zoom levels
(it propagates down from wherever I put it). The layer shows some bus
lines, as well as the J-Church light rail line.<sup id="fnref:whitespots"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:whitespots">3</a></sup> I'm
trying to get the <em>flexibility</em> of these tools across to you: layers
work everywhere and zoom works everywhere, and you can pull a tool out
and use it wherever and whenever you want.</p>

<p>Here's my play on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powers_of_Ten_(film)">Powers of
Ten</a> in Geokit:
starting from the Earth, I apply a zoom lens, then a lens to that
lens, and so on, until I get down to our neighborhood in Oakland.</p>



<p>I can even print a map. I have a printed map of San Francisco here,
for instance. I use exactly the same tools on this printout: I look at
public transit lines, then demographics, then I zoom and pan around
east of Golden Gate Park.</p>

<div>
<iframe width="90%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nfDOzBiwvuE?showinfo=0&amp;ecver=1" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p>Working with a printed map: applying tilelayers
and zoom lens
</p></div>

<p>Even if Geokit isn't drawing any tiles on a map and it's just a
printout, it's still a fully functioning map.</p>

<div>
<blockquote data-lang="en"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>…and a "map" page is just any page which represents a (lon1, lat1, lon2, lat2) geographic box, even if it doesn't render any tiles!</p><p>(e.g. the printed maps are still meaningful maps even though there is no projection on them)</p></div>— Omar Rizwan (@rsnous) <a href="https://twitter.com/rsnous/status/990405274526662656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2018</a></blockquote>
</div>

<p>I've been using San Francisco as an example, but I could have entered
any place in the world, and everything would have worked exactly the
same.<sup id="fnref:except"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:except">4</a></sup></p>

<p>The one-page 'engine' page makes all these maps and tools work, and
that little engine doesn't need to know anything about the stuff built
above it. Basically, the engine takes a page representing some
geographic coordinates, and it draws some map tiles from the Internet
on top. I'll show how you might build that engine from scratch here in
Dynamicland, step by step.</p>

<h3 id="all-the-parts">All the parts</h3>

<p>These are all the 'game pieces' inside the kit. Each page is both a
little computer program and an <em>object</em> that people and other pages
can see and work with. Some pages are face-down, but most of them are
face-up, which means they're running right now. (Face-up is the side
with the colored dots.)</p>



<p>You often <strong>point</strong> one page at another to make it do something, like
how the <em>zoom lens</em> points at the <em>printed map</em>, or how the <em>keyboard</em>
points at the <em>text box</em> which points at the <em>big map</em>.</p>

<p>We have a few ways to get a map of a place:</p>

<ul>
<li>⌨️<strong>type a place name</strong> into the text box to search for it</li>
<li>use a premade map like my <strong>📄 printed map</strong> of SF</li>
<li>apply the <strong>🔍 zoom lens</strong> to an existing map: the lens becomes a zoomed-in map
of the green region it points at</li>
<li>use the <strong>🎛 zoom &amp; pan dial</strong> ('loupe') page on an existing map: it zooms into
wherever the dial is, and you rotate the dial to change the zoom
level</li>
</ul>

<p>These parts are the ones in the kit right now, but anyone here can
make new parts: you could come here and write up a new kind of
tilelayer or a new way to make maps.</p>

<p>That's why I call Geokit a kit and not an application: it's naturally
extensible. You could come here, pull a keyboard off the shelf, point
it at any part of Geokit, and just start editing it and printing new
stuff for your own use. You might provide a new tileset to answer some
question you have, or come up with a new zoom mechanism to derive
maps. (I'll explain how to do both of those things in this writeup!)
You have the same status that I do, and you don't have to open your
laptop and download and recompile some source code if you want to
change something.</p>

      <section>
        <p>One of the more intriguing qualities of the most effective people I know is that they tend have an ability to think ‘at the right level of abstraction’. Not too high; not too low. Just right for the problem they’re solving.</p><p>Historically, I haven’t been very good at this.</p><p>When I first moved to Vietnam, I wrote a personal essay about betting on Asia. The piece was logically coherent and tightly argued, but it was also laughably wrong. I argued that Asia was the future. I argued that a young person of Asian descent would do better to learn how to build companies in Asia; that the problems of Asia were different from the problems of Silicon Valley. I argued that if you wanted to build a tech company under such constraints, an Asian startup should be focused on Asian problems: the larger, the more valuable, and the more overlooked by Silicon Valley, the better. I used manufacturing as a thought experiment.</p><p>But I was wrong.</p><p>It wasn’t that any of these points were necessarily <em>mistaken</em> — arguably, the most successful Asian startups were started by Asian people and built to solve Asian problems. (This is the problem with tightly argued generalities: they often contain truisms). The issue with my argument was that it was simply <em>irrelevant</em> — it didn’t matter if all of these things were true. It didn’t matter that the centre of global power was shifting East; it didn’t matter that venture capital didn’t give a shit about Asia in 2014 but changed its mind quickly; it didn’t matter that Asian unicorns would emerge over the course of the 2010s. I was too small to take advantage of any of these shifts. I was a young person moving into a job. I was thinking at the wrong level of abstraction.</p><p>Much later, I discovered an old nut by investors Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, which they named the Noah Rule (after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah">biblical story</a>): ‘predicting rain doesn’t count, building an ark does’. To hijack that aphorism a little, I was essentially gesticulating at all the storm clouds in the horizon, reporting on the shapes of the cumulonimbuses, telling everyone who would listen about the coming thunderstorm. But I had no carpentry skills to speak of; I couldn't take advantage of any of these analyses. It was a waste of time.</p><h2 id="reasoning-at-the-wrong-level">Reasoning at the Wrong Level</h2><p>I occasionally talk to juniors from my alma mater. They tend to be interested in a conversation after learning that I write a blog about careers; on my end, I’m more than happy to talk to them so I can hear about the changes that have occurred in the School of Computing, which I loved.</p><p>One common pattern that emerges from those conversations are versions of the same reasoning that led me to write my <em>Because Asia</em> essay. The arguments tend to be made by incredibly smart, analytical people: my juniors would explain to me that venture capital in Asia is under-developed, or that Singapore is a terrible place to work in because of bad incentives for remote FAANG offices, or perhaps that Singapore will be caught between Great Power conflict, or perhaps its advantages in the first 50 years of its life no longer hold true for the next 50. They then conclude that perhaps it would be better to move out from Singapore, and seek their fortunes elsewhere.</p><p>The arguments tend to be well-articulated, intelligent analyses of macro-level trends. But I now suspect they are wasteful attempts at thinking. Like my essay about Asian startups, the arguments operate at the wrong level of abstraction — wrong, that is, for the decisions these people are to make.</p><p>It doesn’t matter if Singapore is geopolitically challenged, or that it faces new challenges in the 2020s or that VC money is skipping SG entirely and flowing into Indonesia. What matters for these students are questions at a lower level of abstraction: “What are my career goals, and which companies may I work at to advance towards those goals?” along with “What are the market/regulatory/economic shifts that are <em>affecting those companies directly</em>?” These questions operate at the right level of abstraction. Commentary about macro-economic trends do not.</p><p>Why? I think the answer is obvious when you think about it for a bit: macro-economic shifts trickle a long way down, through a complex system, before they become local trends. These shifts may or may not result in the outcomes you expect. So if you operate at a much lower level in the system, and you want to make a decision about your career, you should probably pay attention to the local trends <em>first</em>, without thinking about the macro-economic shifts that may or may not have led to them.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Another way of thinking about this is that proximate causes (the cause immediately preceding an event) are easier to reason about than remote causes (causes that are further away from the event at question, but that contribute through the chain of causality). Remote causes are often complex and intertwined with a huge number of factors (think: the Fed raising the interest rate, and affecting the whole economy in one fell swoop); proximate causes are simpler to think about. And so it is usually more effective to focus on proximate causes, because any change in the macro-environment that will affect you will likely show up as a proximate cause <em>first</em>. The way I like to think about this is that remote causes are akin to the interactions of water molecules in a vapour cloud — you’ll have to spend a huge amount of analytical power to figure out if they’ll ultimately affect your windows. The effective person won’t bother with any of that; they would instead watch for the movement of water droplets on glass.</p><p>I mentioned previously that I ran a software engineering office in Vietnam, and that none of the trends that I wrote about in my Asia essay ultimately mattered to my stint there. What ended up being important were the following shifts:</p><ul><li>Regulatory changes by the Singapore government, that affected our customers.</li><li>What our customers did (these were mostly retail companies; so we paid attention to things that affected them — including what their landlords were doing.)</li><li>What our competitors did.</li><li>The shape of the labour market in Vietnam, where I had to hire from.</li></ul><p>It's mistaken to think that analysis of these topics are <em>always</em> less time consuming than macro-level analysis — in reality, some investigations demanded about the same amount of time and energy that you might have expected from a study of geopolitical trends.</p><p>But they were two important differences:</p><ol><li>These topics sat at the ‘right’ level of abstraction — it was nearer to the business, and therefore nearer to the decisions that we had to make. This made them more useful.</li><li>I couldn’t use any of these insights to sound smart in normal conversation. The intelligence was hard-won, but too specific to our industry to be interesting to most of my friends.</li></ol><h2 id="an-appreciation-for-complex-adaptive-systems">An Appreciation for Complex Adaptive Systems</h2><p>There’s another explanation for the effect that I think is worth talking about.</p><p>Many of the systems we operate in are complex adaptive systems. They are:</p><ol><li>Complex, for they consist of many interweaving parts.</li><li>Adaptive, for they consist of many agents that compete, cooperate, and adapt to each other.</li><li>A system, for these interconnected elements may be said to be coherently organised.</li></ol><p>Complex adaptive systems lie at the heart of a field of study we now call ‘complexity science’. The most approachable popular introduction to the field of complexity science is M. Mitchell Waldrop’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/337123.Complexity"><em>Complexity</em></a>, which examines the founding of The Santa Fe Institute — a multi-disciplinary research organisation set up to study such systems.</p><p>The book explains complex adaptive systems as follows (forgive this long excerpt; Waldrop has a tendency to drag explanations out to make them more palatable):</p><blockquote>(…) the economy is an example par excellence of what the Santa Fe Institute had come to call “complex adaptive systems.” In the natural world such systems included brains, immune systems, ecologies, cells, developing embryos, and ant colonies. In the human world they included cultural and social systems such as political parties or scientific communities. Once you learned how to recognize them, in fact, these systems were everywhere. But wherever you found them, said Holland, they all seemed to share certain crucial properties.<p>First, he said, each of these systems is a network of many “agents” acting in parallel. In a brain the agents are nerve cells, in an ecology the agents are species, in a cell the agents are organelles such as the nucleus and the mitochondria, in an embryo the agents are cells, and so on. In an economy, the agents might be individuals or households. Or if you were looking at business cycles, the agents might be firms. And if you were looking at international trade, the agents might even be whole nations. But regardless of how you define them, each agent finds itself in an environment produced by its interactions with the other agents in the system. It is constantly acting and reacting to what the other agents are doing. And because of that, essentially nothing in its environment is fixed.</p><p>Furthermore, said Holland, the control of a complex adaptive system tends to be highly dispersed. There is no master neuron in the brain, for example, nor is there any master cell within a developing embryo. If there is to be any coherent behavior in the system, it has to arise from competition and cooperation among the agents themselves. This is true even in an economy. Ask any president trying to cope with a stubborn recession: no matter what Washington does to fiddle with interest rates and tax policy and the money supply, the overall behavior of the economy is still the result of myriad economic decisions made every day by millions of individual people.</p><p>Second, said Holland, a complex adaptive system has many levels of organization, with agents at any one level serving as the building blocks for agents at a higher level. A group of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids will form a cell, a group of cells will form a …</p></blockquote></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <!-- Left content -->
  <p>The early Research Edition Unix versions featured a program that would turn a stream of ASCII text into utterances that could be played by a voice synthesizer. The source code of this program was lost for years. Here's the story of how I brought it back to life.</p>
<h3 id="finding-the-lost-code">Finding the lost code</h3>
<p>The (early 1973) Third Research Edition of Unix <a href="https://dspinellis.github.io/unix-v3man/v3man.pdf#page=130">documented</a> a program that would receive as input ASCII text and convert it into phonemes that could then be played by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Votrax">Votrax</a> voice synthesizer made by the Vocal Interface Division of Federal Screw Works. The program was written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_McIlroy">M. D. McIlroy</a>, who documented its operation in a detailed <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/speak.tar">technical report</a>.</p>
<p>Although the program appeared in the Unix manual pages up to the 1975 <a href="https://ia800600.us.archive.org/19/items/v6-manual/v6-manual.pdf#page=251">Sixth Research Edition</a>, its source code was missing from the archives that had survived. Even its author lacked a copy.</p>
<p>Fortunately, in 2011, Jonathan Gevaryahu <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140620170452/https://minnie.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/2011-December/002538.html">found</a> most parts of the program's source code in unallocated space of a Sixth Research Edition disk dump. (This means that the code was once stored on disk, but was later deleted, and the parts where it resided were never allocated to other uses.) Even better, he could reconstruct a single block that was missing from the program's compiled version, which was also available. Based on these findings, I added the <a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Research-V6-Snapshot-Development/usr/source/s2/speak.c">speak source code</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Research-V6-Snapshot-Development/usr/source/s2/speak.v">speech rules</a> to the <a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo">GiHub repository of Unix history</a> I am maintaining.</p>
<h3 id="reviving-the-code">Reviving the code</h3>
<p>To see how the program was working, I experimented with making it run and compile. As the program was written in an ancient dialect of C and was also unlikely to be portable, I first tried to make it work on a Sixth Edition Unix running on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMH">SIMH</a> PDP-11 emulator. This attempt quickly failed, because the console wasn't reliable enough to allow me to transfer the code via copy-paste.</p>
<p>I then run the PDP-11 2.11 BSD Unix on the same emulator, which offers rudimentary internet connection capabilities. After configuring a <code>.rhosts</code> file to allow remote copying (to obtain remote access, you simply add your remote host and user name), I was able to move the code to that machine.</p>
<p>However, compiling the code wasn't immediately possible. To make it compile I</p>
<ul>
<li>changed the old <code>=+</code>, <code>=^</code> to the modern <code>+=</code>, <code>^=</code> operators,</li>
<li>added forward declarations for functions returning pointers,</li>
<li>inserted an assignment operator in initialized constants (<code>int tflag 0;</code> became <code>int tflag = 0;</code> — I didn't even know this form ever existed),</li>
<li>changed calls from <code>seek</code> to <code>lseek</code>, and</li>
<li>added a proper exit code to <code>exit</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>At that stage the program could compile, but was crashing when I tried to run it. Given that 2.11 BSD lacked <em>gdb</em> and was generally slow and difficult to use, I decided to port the program to modern Unix/Linux. I also added more declarations, including full function prototypes to find other problems. (In early versions of C you didn't need to declare a function before using it.) I then methodically removed all compiler warnings, which allowed me to pinpoint a variable that was declared as a pointer but used as an integer. By correcting its declaration I fixed the initial crash.</p>
<p>Now I had a program that compiled and run, but was still crashing in some cases, and also wasn't producing correct output. For this further changes were needed.</p>
<ul>
<li>I replaced writing to a string with a write to a <code>char</code> array.</li>
<li>I corrected the size of a structure that was assumed to be 4.</li>
<li>I documented some functions to be able to follow the program logic.</li>
<li>I fixed the assumption that integers occupied two bytes.</li>
<li>I replaced integers initialized as pairs of characters (e.g. <code>'u1'</code>) with a macro that initialized the value in an endian-neutral manner.</li>
</ul>
<p>After these changes the program was able to compile the rules file and produce <a href="https://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Distributions/Research/Dennis_v5/v5man.pdf#page=285">Votrax phoneme codes</a>.</p>
<h3 id="getting-voice-output">Getting voice output</h3>
<p>Votrax voice synthesizers and their descendant chips (which appear to use similar phoneme codes) <a href="http://www.redcedar.com/sc01.htm">are not longer marketed</a>. In order to listen to the generated voice I needed a workaround. My first attempt was to use samples from the <a href="https://github.com/sealj553/votrax-speak">votrax-speak GitHub repository</a>. Converting the phoneme Votrax codes into their mnemonic names, and passing the corresponding sample files as arguments to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoX">SoX</a>, allowed me to create a sound file consisting of the phonemes played together. However, the generated sound file was almost unintelligible. As I read later, a great advantage of Votrax synthesizers was how they merged together the phonemes into continuous speech, which was not the case with my approach.</p>
<p>My second attempt involved using the phoneme output functionality of the <a href="https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng">espeak-ng</a> program. For this I created <a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/speak/blob/master/votrax-espeak.md">a map</a> between the Votrax phoneme codes and the corresponding <a href="http://espeak.sourceforge.net/phonemes.html">espeak phonemes</a>, which I then coded into a <em>sed</em> script that would feed <em>espeak</em> with the output of Unix <em>speak</em>. Through this method I was finally able to produce somewhat intelligible speech with a pipeline, such as the following.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>echo</span> Hello world <span>|</span>
<span>speak</span> speak.m <span>|</span>
<span>LC_ALL=</span>C <span>./votrax-espeak.sed</span> <span>|</span>
<span>espeak</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="code-availability">Code availability</h3>
<p>The revived source code is available in <a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/speak">this GiHub repository</a>.</p>

So for the foreseeable future my workstation will be pulling double-duty for macOS-based software development with a MacBook Pro and Windows-based gaming on a PC.</p> <p>Modern monitors come with a lot of interesting features. Did you know you can connect a MacBook to a monitor using a single USB-C cable and transmit USB, power, audio <strong><em>and</em></strong> video?</p> <p>Unfortunately, it’s not as simple as knowing whether a monitor supports USB-C. Many monitors support USB-C but don’t have any sort of way to pipe the audio out from the monitor (for example, to a sound bar). And some monitors have USB-C and audio out, but only provide 15W of power.</p> <p>With enough features, the monitor effectively acts as a KVM+audio, like so:</p> <p><img src="https://jamejone.github.io/public/usb-c-monitor-diagram.png" alt="USB-C monitor diagram"></p> <p>So I set out to identify a monitor that meets all of my criteria. Specifically:</p> <ul> <li>Has a built-in KVM switch that lets me easily switch between my PC and MacBook.</li> <li>Provides at least 60W power over USB-C (the bare minimum to power a 16-inch MacBook Pro).</li> <li>Some sort of audio output (almost always analog).</li> <li>Upstream USB-B Port so that I can plug my keyboard and mouse into the monitor and pipe PC audio through the monitor to the sound bar.</li> <li>VESA mountable.</li> <li>IPS panel. The viewing angles on my TN panel are so bad it interferes with my work so IPS is a must.</li> <li>27” or 34” ultrawide @ 1440p. Good for gaming and happens to be <a href="https://bjango.com/articles/macexternaldisplays/">the ideal non-retina DPI for macOS</a>. Full retina @ 5k instead of 1440p would be nice, but unfortunately I couldn’t find such a monitor that meets all the minimum criteria. Awkward DPIs are a deal-breaker due to scaling and “shimmering” effects mentioned in the linked post.</li> </ul> <p>Nice-to-haves:</p> <ul> <li>Adaptive sync (AS).</li> <li>144hz refresh rate. At 60hz I lose track of my mouse cursor in League of Legends and we can’t have that!</li> <li>90W power delivery over USB-C.</li> <li>Reasonable price.</li> </ul> <p>Here’s what I found after about 15 hours of research:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Model</th> <th>Size</th> <th>Pros</th> <th>Cons</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>ViewSonic VP2771</td> <td>27” 1440p</td> <td>$200-$450</td> <td>60hz, 60W USB-C</td> </tr> <tr> <td>LG 34WK95C-W</td> <td>34” 1440p UW</td> <td>Adaptive Sync</td> <td>75hz, 60W USB-C, ~$1,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Dell U3421WE</td> <td>34” 1440p UW</td> <td>90W USB-C</td> <td>60hz, ~$1,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>LG 34WK95U</td> <td>34” 4k UW</td> <td>85W USB-C</td> <td>60hz, ~$1,300, awkward DPI</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Dell U3219Q</td> <td>32” 4k</td> <td>90W USB-C</td> <td>60hz, ~$800, awkward DPI</td> </tr> <tr> <td>BenQ PD3220U</td> <td>32” 4k</td> <td>85W USB-C</td> <td>60hz, ~$1,200, awkward DPI</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Razer Raptor 27</td> <td>27” 1440p</td> <td>AS, 144hz, HDR</td> <td>15W USB-C, No VESA mount, $700</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Philips 346B1C</td> <td>34” 1440p UW</td> <td>90W, AS, $450</td> <td>100hz, VA panel</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Acer Predator X34 S</td> <td>34” 1440p UW</td> <td><strong>200hz</strong>, AS, 85W</td> <td>Not available (yet)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>I can’t guarantee this is an exhaustive list, but it might be. I left off monitors that are no longer for sale or lack crucial features like an audio output or upstream USB-B port.</p> <p>As you can see, there’s no ideal monitor except for the Acer Predator X34 S, which <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/acer-predator-x34-s-a-34-inch-200hz-nano-ips-curved-monitor-w-05ms-response-time">isn’t available in the US yet and currently costs ¥9999</a> (roughly $1,500). In terms of what’s available today, you ultimately need to choose whether you want to sacrifice refresh rate, VESA mounting, USB-C charging, or panel type.</p> <p>As luck would have it, I ended up snagging a ViewSonic VP2771 on eBay for $200 shipped. After all, I still have a 144hz TN panel that I can keep plugged into the gaming PC. It’s not ideal but it’ll work until I get my hands on that Acer.</p> <p>Let me know in the comments if you find a monitor that should be in this list. If you want to play League of Legends together you can find me under the summoner name JamesJonesJrJr.</p> <p>Stay safe out there, friends.</p> <h3>Thanks for reading. Feel free to leave a comment.</h3>  </article>  </main>  </div></div>]]>

  <article>
    <p>2020 has been an incredibly challenging year, and on a personal note, has marked an important milestone — graduating with my PhD in computer science from Cornell University. This has been a six year journey, where my personal growth as a machine learning researcher (from thrills of first discoveries to the laborious grind through publication rejections to identifying a broader research vision) also took place against the backdrop of the rapid growth and change of the entire field (<a href="https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2014">2014 NeurIPS</a>: ~2k attendees, <a href="https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2020">2020 NeurIPS</a>: ~20k attendees).</p>

<p>With this year coming to an end, I’ve put together some of my reflections and lessons learned from my (Machine Learning) PhD experiences. I discuss topics including expectations going in, common challenges during the PhD (and some strategies for helping with them), keeping up with papers, the community nature of research and developing a research vision. I hope that these topics are helpful in navigating the PhD and research in Machine Learning!</p>

<h3 id="expectations-going-into-the-phd">Expectations going into the PhD</h3>
<p>In the post title, I’ve referred to the PhD as a “journey”, an aspect often underappreciated, particularly if one is coming straight out of undergrad (which was my experience). A typical Machine Learning PhD is going to be ~5-6 years of relatively unstructured time, and during this, not only will you learn research skills and knowledge about the field, but you’ll also develop personal preferences on how interesting specific problems are, the aesthetics of different subfields, and even perspectives on the <em>type</em> of work being done across academia/industry/policy/nonprofits.</p>

<p>These evolving personal preferences will influence the type of research you decide to work on, and even the post-PhD career path you pick. But particularly at the start of the PhD, it’s hard to predict how these personal perspectives will evolve. In my case, I started my PhD fully assuming I’d stay in industry, part way through began seriously considering academia, and at the end made the very difficult decision to turn down academic offers and stay on in industry. So going into the PhD program, it’s often helpful to take it step by step, and focus on getting the most out of the experience (learning/research/community participation), instead of a very specific desired outcome (which is prone to change, and may also add unnecessary pressure.)</p>

<h3 id="common-challenges-through-the-journey">Common Challenges through the Journey</h3>
<p>Doing a PhD can be an immensely rewarding experience, and, particularly in Machine Learning, offers the chance to contribute to fundamental scientific understanding as well as impactful technology deployment. I’ve been grateful to my PhD for providing many opportunities to experience both of these! However, the duration and unstructured nature of the PhD can also make it challenging. My journey definitely consisted of ups and downs, and at various times I’ve struggled with feeling isolated, completely stuck, and even overwhelmed by trying to keep up with the rapid pace of progress. Looking back, and through discussion with peers, I now know these low points can unfortunately be quite common. But because these experiences are shared across many people, there can also be strategies for working through them. Below I discuss some of these experiences and strategies.</p>

<h4 id="feeling-completely-stuck">Feeling completely stuck</h4>
<p>One very common challenge is feeling completely stuck, either on a specific project or with regards to the research process on the whole.</p>

<p>If the challenge is a specific project, where you’ve pushed hard and it’s still not quite working, then some strategies that might help are</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Making a write up</strong>: Collect any partial experimental results, mathematical insights, jotted notes on motivation, etc and take time to put together a write up. This can help with providing a picture of where things stand and where the important gaps are.</li>
  <li><strong>Pivot</strong>: if there’s a specific part of the project that’s not working, is there the possibility to reframe the question (possibly taking inspiration from related work) to make it more tractable?</li>
  <li><strong>Forming connections</strong>: are there links between what the current project focuses on and other areas of study? Can that connection be explored in this project? This can both help progress and in making the project relevant to a broader community.</li>
  <li><strong>Feedback on writeup</strong>: It might also be helpful to get feedback on the project write up from peers, collaborators and friends in the research community. They may be able to offer new perspectives or suggest improvements.</li>
  <li><strong>Workshop submission</strong>: it can also be useful to make a workshop submission. This also provides a chance to help collect together all the research results and get useful feedback. (For some time now, I’ve gained the most out of the workshops at machine learning conferences, due to being able to discuss/get feedback on ongoing directions and meeting other researchers working on the same area.)</li>
  <li><strong>Wrap up and move on</strong>: Occasionally, there may be a project which sounded promising in the beginning, but has been difficult to make work, and is also inherently challenging to reframe or form connections to other areas. In this (difficult) situation, it may make most sense to wrap up the project quickly and move on. If you have partial results, it’s likely worthwhile to create a final writeup of those and share, so one option is to do this, get confirmation from collaborators and final feedback, and keep it as an arXiv preprint or workshop paper.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the feeling of being stuck originates from the research process more broadly, one important point I’ve realised is that <em>gaining research maturity can often be very hard to measure, especially when evaluating yourself!</em> Midway through my PhD, I started working on some healthcare applications, and was only making slow headway on learning about the area/writing papers. This had me feeling stuck and somewhat frustrated at my slowdown in research progress. But when I re-read some papers that I’d first come across at the start of my PhD, the depth and context with which I could understand their results was strikingly different from earlier on.</p>

<p>Critical aspects of research maturity — understanding the broader context of results, being able to form connections between different areas, quickly narrowing in on novel key contributions in your subfield — don’t immediately translate to tangible outputs (more papers). But they’re central for becoming an independent researcher with a rich research vision — arguably the main research goal of the PhD. And if you’re reading papers, learning about the field, and working on research directions yourself, (and maybe even teaching/mentoring) most likely you’re making progress on all of these important aspects!</p>

<h4 id="feeling-overwhelmed-with-keeping-up-with-ml-progress">Feeling overwhelmed with keeping up with ML progress</h4>
<p>Machine Learning is a vibrant, fast-paced field. But the flipside of this is drowning in the flood of new papers, new preprints, new blogposts, new implementations, new frameworks, etc, etc. (Fun statistic: NeurIPS this past year had ~10k submissions and ~2k accepted papers — no wonder we’re feeling overwhelmed!)</p>

<p>My strategy in dealing with this has been</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Have a number of go-to links to find references to related papers.</strong> For me, this has been a combination of (i) subscribing to the arxiv stat.ML cs.LG mailing lists, <a href="http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/">arXiv-sanity</a>, Twitter, (occasionally) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/">reddit/MachineLearning</a>, <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/">paperswithcode</a> and perusing <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/">Semantic Scholar</a>/<a href="https://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Keep a reading list of papers</strong> If I come across an interesting paper but don’t have time to read it then (often the case), I make a note of it and try to return to it later.</li>
  <li><strong>Have a paper reading strategy</strong> If a paper is very close to research directions I’m actively working on, I’ll read it in detail, otherwise I’ll skim the abstract to get a high level picture.</li>
  <li><strong>Occasionally read up on different areas</strong> Occasionally (maybe once per year), I’ll look into a few interesting areas I’m not working on, and read several papers in each to get a sense of what is being worked on.</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s also helpful to remember that (i) <em>everyone</em> feels overwhelmed with the rate of publishing and (ii) many papers may rely on the same underlying idea, and often being familiar with the idea is enough for keeping up with the field.</p>

<h4 id="feeling-isolated">Feeling Isolated</h4>
<p>Another common challenge in the PhD is struggling with feelings of isolation. In the first couple of years of my PhD, some projects required that I kept laser focus on very narrow, specific questions, which were also highly laborious and (felt) never-ending. During those times, it was hard not to feel completely cut-off from other researchers and the broader field, and I’m very grateful for all the support and guidance from my PhD advisor in pushing through that situation.</p>

<p>More broadly, this scenario can be common especially earlier on during the PhD, where you might simultaneously be learning how to see through a research project from start to finish, and at the same time have less context and connections to the broader research field/community. Maintaining connections to the field/community can be very helpful in making sure you don’t feel isolated. Some ways to do this could be: (i) setting up collaborations with (senior) students/postdocs (ii) getting feedback on your work in progress – this might be your advisor/lab, but could also be other peers/mentors working in the field (iii) actively participating in the broader community, whether that’s through simply attending conferences, mentoring or organizing workshops.</p>

<p>Having discussed some of the common challenges faced in the PhD and ways to help address them, the rest of this post will overview some useful considerations for research progress.</p>

      <div>
        <p>This article describes the approach I’m following to set personal goals for myself, in the form of Objectives and Key-results (OKR).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are new to OKR, scroll down to the <strong>Resources</strong> section for more details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://hackpravj.com/images/pageimage-setting-up-personal-okr-jfm-2021.png" alt="Personal OKR for JFM 2021" title="Personal OKR for JFM 2021"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A publically available worksheet for my personal OKRs for January-February-March 2021 is available <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hN5ldi0SgoGFyvXwyLCmf98337AyIt1xzbynVicGH-8/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve worked them out in order to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get a better grip on the concept by implementing them in a relatively newer setting/environment outside of the work</li>
<li>Effectively set goals in the personal life where it’s easy to measure progress and find out weeker/strong areas to work on</li>
</ul>
<p>I will continue updating this article and the attached document in case of any changes or updates. If you want to discuss more, or in case of any feedback, please reach out to me at <a href="https://twitter.com/hackpravj">@hackpravj</a></p>
<h3 id="themes">Themes</h3>
<p>Start with the themes representing the different areas of life. For example, in your case, it can be Personal-finance, Health, Creativity, and more. You can have your own personal reasons behind selecting the final themes.</p>
<p>Here are the 7 separate themes in my current plan.</p>
<ol>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Habits</li>
<li>Networking</li>
<li>Reading</li>
<li>Writing</li>
<li>Learning</li>
<li>Relationships</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="backlog">Backlog</h3>
<p>For each of the themes, I came up with a backlog of aspirations and ideas.</p>
<p>This has helped me connect the ideas with each other if there is any such possibility, OR ruling out ideas that are duplicate to each other.</p>
<p>Some of the themes or ideas that didn’t make it to the current plan, will be considered during the next quarter’s OKRs.</p>
<h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3>
<p>To come up with the objectives associated with the themes, ask yourself</p>
<ul>
<li>Where do you want to reach? (in relation to this theme or some specific area related to the theme)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>As a rule-of-thumb, objectives are ambitious and qualitatively represent an end state. It’s more of an outcome, rather than an output.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, if you’ve selected “Health” as one of the themes, the following can be an objective for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Objective-1: Get in a better shape</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="key-results">Key-results</h3>
<p>Once you’ve decided your objective, the key-results will be a mechanism to show your progress towards that objective.</p>
<p>To come up with the key-results associated with the objective, ask yourself</p>
<ul>
<li>How will I know I am getting there (<em>reaching the objective</em>)?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Key-results are milestones that will move you closer to the objective if achieved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Considering the earlier example of the Objective (<em>Get in a better shape</em>), here are two representative key-results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Key-result-1: Reduce weight by 10 kilograms (<em>or pounds</em>)</li>
<li>Key-result-2: Achieve a daily step count of 10K steps walked</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="initiatives">Initiatives</h3>
<p>Once you know the key-results, ask yourself the following question to come up with the initiatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are we doing to get there (to the milestone set by the key-result)?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the common mistake during OKR planning is; ignoring the difference between the initiatives/key-results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, consider the first key-result (<em>Reduce weight by 10 kilograms</em>), there can be different initiatives (that you can do to reach the milestone set by the key-result).</p>
<ul>
<li>Initiative-1: Limit total meals per day to 2</li>
<li>Initiative-2: Stop eating after 7 PM</li>
<li>Initiative-3: Start intermittent-fasting every other day</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="okr-check-in">OKR check-in</h3>
<p>As you’re moving ahead with your OKR planning, you need to ensure that you’re regularly measuring your progress.</p>
<h3 id="measurement">Measurement</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can provide different weights to the key-results associated with an objective.
<ul>
<li>For example, the first key-result (<em>Reduce weight by 10 kilograms</em>) can take up 70% (<em>relatively higher</em>) weightage than the second key-result (<em>Walking 10K steps daily</em>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The progress for a key-result can be measured based on the % completion of the same.
<ul>
<li>A typically considered “sweet-spot” for OKRs is 60-70%.</li>
<li>If a key-result’s progress is higher than 70%, it might be a sign of lower ambitious objectives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>OKRs can also be implemented in personal life, out of the business/work (refer to Manas’s work on personal OKR [<a href="https://manassaloi.com/2020/01/15/personal-OKRs-2020.html">start</a>] [<a href="https://manassaloi.com/2020/12/31/okrs-2020-update.html">final update</a>]).</li>
<li>They serve as a goal-setting tool that helps you assess your progress on a regular basis.</li>

                <p>Hey folks!</p>
<p>The PHP-Documentation has moved to git!</p>
<p>Not at the same day as the PHP8-release but at least in the same year ;-)</p>
<p>Nikita and myself took the last steps today to finalize what a number of <br>
people have been working on for the last at least 4 years.</p>
<p>Thanks to Derick, Rasmus, Sara, Paul, Peter, Gabriel and a lot of others <br>
for their support, encouragement and help.</p>
<p>So from now on there is no possibility to contribute to the <br>
documentation via SVN. All the contributions have to go via git now.</p>
<p>Details regarding setup can be found at <br>
<a href="https://github.com/php/doc-base/blob/master/README.md" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/php/doc-base/blob/master/README.md</a></p>
<p>This move also means that there are now mirrors of the documentation at <br>
github through which contributions can be made now.</p>
<p>There are some minor things still waiting to happen like the revcheck <br>
(which is currently being worked on) or not all github mirrors having <br>
actually "mirrored" yet (as they need a propper commit to start the <br>
mirroring).</p>
<p>But in general: It is done!</p>
<p>What is the next goal now? Create the best documentation PHP has ever had!</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

				<p>I've never had a customer complain about the design.</p><p>It feels worse to have a nicely designed product that does not work as expected (or at all).</p><p>I am not a designer. It is not a skill that I care to improve. Instead I would rather rely on the best practices of frameworks like <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> to get me there (at least in the beginning). In my experience design is something to consider later on the the product lifecycle. <strong>I am more interested in how things work vs. how things look.</strong></p><p>This is how I think about product life-cycles:</p><h3 id="phase-1-speed-shipping-and-finding-what-makes-it-sticky-">Phase 1: Speed, shipping, and finding what makes it sticky. </h3><p>It is hacky, has duplicated code, and probably some dead code paths. Invite only and only for the most forgiving users. I only need a few users who will probably expose the major flaws here. I usually don't write any tests. I don't add too many third-party libraries or utilities at this point. For me this is just <a href="https://djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>. <strong>Use the defaults!</strong></p><h3 id="phase-2-lay-the-groundwork-for-robustness-">Phase 2: Lay the groundwork for robustness. </h3><p>Unit tests, application metrics, logs, and repeatable, consistent deployments. I don't have to get everything right, but I must make these decisions and commit to them. Biggest challenge is to keep my early-invite users engaged. The early users and my own testing revals the hot-spots that need more attention (unit tests or end-to-end test).</p><h3 id="phase-3-make-bigger-changes-with-confidence">Phase 3: Make bigger changes with confidence</h3><p>Now that we have testing in place we can refactor, clean up dead code paths, and redundant &nbsp;UI code with more confidence. This is a good time to onboard junior developers into the project. Or, in my case, this is when I feel comfortable hiring a contractor to work on "the little things" (tm). Maybe I offer-up another round of invites to a wider network of potential customers.</p><h3 id="phase-4-prepare-for-a-broader-market-showing">Phase 4: Prepare for a broader market showing</h3><p>At this point we have a reasonably stable product. We understand our own development workflow as well as the strongest customer use cases. Now I start making basic user documentation and videos. This becomes the v1 of my marketing materials and social media story-telling. <strong>Note: documentation can go a long way to patch over incomplete or hard-to-use parts of your application.</strong> This is my public beta phase (usually the Reid Hoffman embarrassment stage)</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">"If you review your first site version and don’t feel embarrassment, you spent too much time on it." - Reid Hoffman (via <a href="https://twitter.com/37signals?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@37signals</a>)</p>— LinkedIn (@LinkedIn) <a href="https://twitter.com/LinkedIn/status/1876035921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 21, 2009</a></blockquote>

</figure><h3 id="phase-5-i-feel-pretty">Phase 5: I feel pretty</h3><p>Now that we are in public beta it is time to consider the design. The first 4 phases have helped us create a deeper understanding of the problem space, our core customers (their needs, industry, and expectations), and ourselves. We probably know our pain-points and deficiencies well enough to have solid asks to a designer/UX. I want them focused on real problems, not exploring around looking for things to do. Real output here is "<em>I want designs and flows that work in the app that we can display in marketing materials</em>"</p><h3 id="maturing-into-a-real-sdlc-with-design-support">Maturing into a real SDLC with design support</h3><p>From here on out this is more of a traditional SDLC (Software development life-cycle) process. There is more <strong>structured iteration</strong> around development, market feedback, and experimentation. Design has been integrated into the process but only in a supporting role. </p>

<![CDATA[The 8TB Backup and the Search for Duplicates]]>

		<p>My 8 TB drive I use for all stuff that might may or may not be useful in the future again is filling up faster than prices are dropping for bigger drives. In the past I’ve always ‘upgraded’ after drive capacities have doubled. But currently, the price for a 16 TB external drive still hovers around €300. And since I always keep several backups, that price would multiply. So that’s not quite in the cards for the time being. So I did the next best thing and had a look for duplicates. Now how hard can that be, I thought.</p>

<p>The easiest way to do this is to just look for duplicate names. In my case that would have given quite a number of false positives. When creating backups of optical media for example, the audio and video files created often get the same name. Also, one would miss quite a number of duplicates when the filename was changed at some point in time.</p>
<p>Fortunately someone had this problem before and was kind enough to write ‘<em>rdfind</em>‘ (redundant data find). Available in the Debian repository for easy installation with <em>‘</em><em>apt install’,</em> rdfind will not only look for duplicate filenames, but also for identical file sizes, compares first and last byte sequences and calculates a sha1 checksum over potential matches. Once the tool got to work on my 8 TB drive, it took a couple of hours before it returned with a result. I was positively surprised with all the things it had found that I would have missed if I had done a manual search or just looked for identical file names. In the end I could remove over 700 GB of duplicated files. One additionally nice feature: One can give <em>rdfind</em> a minimum file size (in bytes) which makes it ignore all smaller files:</p>
<pre>rdfind -minsize 50000000 ~/Documents</pre>

				<p>Recently I have been spending time on improving the performance of <a href="https://github.com/andrewchambers/bupstash">bupstash</a> (my encrypted backup tool), and wanted to compare it to some existing tools to try and find its relative performance in the backup tool landscape.</p>
<p>This post compares <a href="https://github.com/andrewchambers/bupstash">bupstash</a>, <a href="https://restic.net/">restic</a>, <a href="https://www.borgbackup.org/">borg backup</a> and plain old tar + gzip + GPG across a series of simple benchmarks.</p>
<p>What do all these tools have in common?</p>
<ul>
<li>They encrypt data at rest.</li>
<li>They compress data.</li>
<li>They have some form of incremental and/or deduplicated snapshotting.</li>
<li>They are all pretty great backup systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to checkout the project websites to learn more, let’s get to the benchmarks.</p>
<h2 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks</h2>
<p>For these tests we are using the following versions of the given software:</p>
<ul>
<li>GNU tar 1.32 + gzip 1.10 + GPG 2.2.23</li>
<li>Bupstash 0.6.1</li>
<li>Borg 1.1.14</li>
<li>Restic 0.11.0</li>
</ul>
<p>The test machine has an AMD Ryzen Threadripper 1950X 16-Core Processor with 16 GB of ram, and an NVMe SSD hard drive. It is probably best to simply compare results relatively, as reproducing my test environment exactly would be difficult.</p>
<p>The scripts I used for my benchmarking can be found <a href="https://github.com/andrewchambers/EncryptedBackupShootout">here</a>, though they will definitely need tweaking for your environment.</p>
<h3 id="deduplication-and-compression">Deduplication and compression</h3>
<p>For this benchmark we take 20 different consecutive versions of the linux kernel source code and add them all to the same directory, we then create a snapshot and measure the size of the resulting tarball/repository.</p>
<p>The linux kernel versions chosen for this test are all the consecutive git commits preceeding version 5.9, with the resulting directory containing 21 GB of uncompressed files.</p>

<p>This benchmark shows the advantage the more sophisticated tools have over plain tarballs, they all have extremely good compression ratios when similar data is added multiple times to
a backup repository.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-fresh-directory-snapshot">Creating a fresh directory snapshot</h3>
<p>For this benchmark we are snapshotting a copy of the linux
5.9.8 source code.</p>
<p>The directory we are snapshotting is 1.1 GB comprised of 74725 files and directories.</p>
<p>The snapshots are all made to tmpfs so hopefully does not measure delays introduced by the network or disk activity.</p>

<p>Bupstash is the clear winner here for raw snapshotting speed.</p>
<h3 id="sending-a-fresh-snapshot-to-a-remote-server">Sending a fresh snapshot to a remote server</h3>
<p>This benchmark is the same as the fresh local snapshot benchmark except the files are sent to a remote server hosted on google cloud via ssh. This benchmark should only be considered an approximation of the effect latency has on the tool performance as it is so dependent on network speeds.</p>
<p>At the time of benchmarking my connection to the remote server can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>server -&gt; client 10MiB/s</li>
<li>client -&gt; client 2.5MiB/s</li>
<li>ping 32 milliseconds</li>

<p>Plain tar takes the win, Restic performs poorly here, it has a far more latency-sensitive upload protocol.</p>
<h3 id="creating-an-incremental-directory-snapshot">Creating an incremental directory snapshot</h3>
<p>This benchmark is the same as the fresh local snapshot benchmark, except now we measure the time for an incremental snapshot using the builtin caching mechanism of the tools. What this means is each tool keeps a record of what files it has already sent, and is able to
skip doing that work again.</p>

</details>
<p>Incremental tar is the clear winner here, but why are the other tools slower? I think this is mainly because the other tools present each snapshot to the user as a full backup and thus do extra work to spare the end user from managing incremental backups manually.</p>
<p>It is also interesting to me that <code>bupstash put</code> is an order of magnitude faster than the other similar tools, though I currently can not explain clearly why that may be the case.</p>
<h3 id="sending-an-incremental-snapshot-to-a-remote-server">Sending an incremental snapshot to a remote server</h3>

<p>Interestingly, the introduction of the network pushed tar ahead of bupstash for backup restoration - this is something I am very interested in investigating further.</p>
<h3 id="pruning-an-old-backup">Pruning an old backup</h3>
<p>In this benchmark we will be removing an old snapshot from the backup repository on the same computer. For this test we generate a backup repository with 50 different snapshots of different versions of the linux kernel source code and then time how long it takes to remove one of the snapshots. This benchmark simulates
cycling old backups out of your backup repository when you no longer need them.</p>
<p>Tar with incremental backups does not easily support pruning of old backups, so does not participate in this benchmark.</p>

<p>Bupstash is very memory-efficient compared to restic and borg, but ultimately loses out to the simplicity of tar + gzip + GPG.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions-and-discussion">Conclusions and discussion</h2>
<p>GNU Tar + gzip + gpg is an excellent encrypted backup option and performed better than I expected. I think tar and gpg is still a great choice for users who prefer to DIY their own backup scripts. With this in mind, we must ask what are the problems with tar that the other tools address? My opinion is that managing
incremental backups, deduplication, pruning, and searching backups are far more difficult when using incremental tar compared to borg/restic/bupstash. With incremental tar, it quickly becomes quite hard to track which incremental
tarballs depend on eachother and you often need to periodically do full snapshots - losing most of the speed benefits.</p>
<p>As the biased author of bupstash, I am also pleased with how it has performed and hope I can push it further in the future. Restic, while fast at local operation, seems to trail the other tools when network latency is thrown into the mix. Borg is an all-around great tool and performed very well.</p>
<p>I can see both strengths and room for improvement in each of the tools tested, and encourage everyone to give them a try for yourself if you haven’t already.</p>
<p>As always, thank you for your time and see you next time :).</p>

    <p>Making things look nice can take a long time, either due to lack of resources or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality">abundance of opinions</a>. This could delay launches, frustrate people, and waste precious energy. Those are high costs for startups or companies hoping to move fast.</p>

<p>Is it worth it?</p>

<p>Long ago I got fed up with delaying marketing campaigns because an email had to look nice. I tested styled versus unstyled emails and found that <a href="https://www.gkogan.co/blog/dont-design-emails/">making emails look nice was <em>not</em> worth it</a>.</p>

<p>After years of repeating some form of that test, and generally noticing that <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">simplistic</a> <a href="https://www.ncino.com/">and</a> <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/">rough-around-the-edges</a> <a href="https://www.jamf.com/">designs</a> <a href="https://www.duckcreek.com/">don’t</a> <a href="https://jfrog.com/">seem</a> <a href="https://unity.com/">to</a> <a href="https://www.cohesity.com/">affect</a> <a href="https://www.zscaler.com/">outcomes</a> <a href="https://www.changehealthcare.com/">of</a> <a href="https://www.okta.com/">enterprise</a> <a href="https://tintri.com/">software</a> <a href="https://www.avalara.com/">companies</a>, I developed a bias towards <a href="https://www.gkogan.co/blog/simple-systems/">simplicity</a> and shipping things before they look nice.</p>

<p>From time to time I like to test my assumptions. Maybe looking nice matters more now than before, or maybe the effects I saw only applied to email, or maybe I’m just looking for reasons to do <a href="https://www.gkogan.co/blog/increase-reply-rates/">less work</a>?</p>

<p>For the latest experiment I ran two ads on LinkedIn, targeting executives at enterprise software companies, to see which of them got more clicks. One ad looked nice (or nice enough), like something a marketing team would spend a couple of hours to discuss and produce. The other ad looked like, well…</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b38efe41c13f8c6ce04f4b37ce9cc1190d842109/13687/images/uploads/ad-test.png" alt="A/B test of pretty vs ugly ad"></p>

<p>One is a beautiful work of art, the other is Option A and took $148 plus a few days of waiting.</p>

<p>Let’s see how they performed:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/80dc44df97f02f04bbe43976e9b36fedfb201656/0f78f/images/uploads/ad-test-results.png" alt="A/B test results of pretty vs ugly ad"></p>

<p><strong>An ad that took me 15 seconds to create had a 2.5x better clickthrough rate than one done by a paid designer.</strong> If this were an actual campaign it would mean 2.5x more sales leads or user signups at a lower acquisition cost, on top of shipping faster with less overhead.</p>

<p>From time to time we need a reminder about what’s worth the effort, and what isn’t.</p>

<p>This is a summary of how to compile and boot the Linux kernel on the KVM-qemu virtual machine. It coveres how to get a VM running in KVM, how to build a customized kernel, and how to use GDB with the Linux kernel. The experiment is conducted on an amd64 architecture CPU. We use Ubuntu as our testing environment but the steps covered here should apply to other distros as well.
<!--description--></p>

<h2 id="getting-a-vm-running-in-kvm">Getting a VM running in KVM</h2>
<p>The Ubuntu ISO image is downloaded from the <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop">Canonical website</a>. The kernel is downloaded directly from <a href="https://www.kernel.org/">kernel.org</a>. The specs of our test environment is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6800K CPU @ 3.40GHz</li>
  <li>RAM: 32 GB</li>
  <li>Host and Guest OS: Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS</li>
  <li>Host Kernel Version: 5.4.0-47-generic</li>
  <li>GCC: 7.5.0</li>
  <li>QEMU emulator version: 4.2.0</li>
  <li>Guest Kernel Version: 5.8.6</li>
</ul>

<p>After we obtained the Ubuntu ISO image, we use GUI virt-manager to install the OS. One thing to notice here is the default directory for virtual disks is <code>/var/lib/libvirt/images</code>, since my system partition is located on a seperate SSD with limited space, the virtual disk directory is changed to my <code>/home</code> directory instead.</p>

<p>We also create the new virtual disk inside virt-manager. We chose raw format instead of qcow2. Creating a new image file can also be done in command line using:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>qemu-img create <span>-f</span> raw <span>-o</span> <span>preallocation</span><span>=</span>full vmdisk.img 40G
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The preallocation can be turn either on or off depends on personal choices. After the disk image is created, we proceeds in virt-manager to install Ubuntu on the newly allocated virtual disk. We enabled storage for this virtual machine so that we don't need to repeat the installation process everytime we launch the VM. One thing to be noticed here is we don't need swap area inside a virtual machine. We can simply use the whole virtual disk for <code>/</code> partition.</p>

<p>To start the VM from cmd, you might need to change the owner of the disk image. We add the user to both <code>kvm</code> and <code>libvirt</code>. The image created or accessed by virt-manager seems to change the file owner to libvirt-qemu, which may cause problems when starting from cmd.</p>

<p>After the installation is finished, we can simply launch the virtual machine inside virt-manager through its GUI interface. We can also use command line to start the VM:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>kvm <span>-accel</span> kvm <span>-m</span> 8G <span>-smp</span> 6 <span>--snapshot</span> <span>-drive</span> <span>format</span><span>=</span>raw,file<span>=</span>/home/ed/virtimg/ubuntu20.04
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The argument <code>-accel kvm</code> enables Kernel-based Virtual Machine full virtualization, which uses hardware acceleration. Without this option the VM will become extremely slow. The <code>-m 8G</code> assigns the given amount of memory to the VM. The <code>-smp 6</code> assigns the given number of cores to the guest if the host has multiple cores. The <code>--snapshot</code> ensures that no changes are made to your image during an execution so you can do something dangerous and have the original image file preserved. The <code>-drive</code> option specifies the location of the virtual disk and its format. We will use some of these options later.</p>

<p>To confirm the VM has internet access, simply execution <code>apt install pkg-name</code> in the guest terminal. No error message would indicates properlu functioning network access from the guest VM. For example, when we execute <code>sudo apt install llvm</code> it shows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
The following additional packages will be installed:
  llvm-runtime
The following NEW packages will be installed:
  llvm llvm-runtime
0 upgraded, 2 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
Need to get 6,796 B of archives.
After this operation, 128 kB of additional disk space will be used.
Do you want to continue? [Y/n] 
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="building-the-kernel">Building the Kernel</h2>
<p>We can use out customized kernel for our newly created VM. After we obtain the Linux kernel from <a href="https://www.kernel.org/">kernel.org</a>, we extract teh source into &lt;kernel dir&gt; and create a separate build directory &lt;kbuild&gt; (outside &lt;kernel dir&gt;).</p>

<p>Then we enter the &lt;kbuild&gt; directory, run</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>yes</span> <span>""</span> | make <span>-C</span> /home/ed/Desktop/linux_kernel/kbuild <span>O</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span><span>pwd</span><span>)</span> config
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will create a <code>.config</code> file inside &lt;kbuild&gt; with the default options selected. We then open the configuration file and ensures <code>CONFIG_SATA_AHCI=y</code>, which builds the SATA disk driver into the kernel. That will allow your kernel to boot off a (virtual) SATA drive without having to load a module to do it.</p>

<p>Next we build the kernel by running <code>make</code> in &lt;kbuild&gt;. We use the -j 6 option speedup the building process using multiple processor cores. This process can take a long time.</p>

<h2 id="build-and-install-kernel-modules">Build and Install Kernel Modules</h2>
<p>To build modules locally on host, we create another seperate &lt;install_mod_dir&gt; directory for building kernel modules. Then in &lt;kbuild&gt;, execute</p>

<div><div><pre><code>make INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/home/ed/Desktop/linux_kernel/install_mod_dir modules_install 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now there is a <code>lib</code> directory inside <code>/home/ed/Desktop/linux_kernel/install_mod_dir</code>, which holds all the kernel modules we are about to install.</p>

<p>The complete list of modules can be listed using <code>cat modules.builtin</code> inside <code>lib/moduels/5.8.6</code>. Here is a <a href="https://gist.github.com/BDHU/4d31d18ad106a13caceac4a961d04a44">link</a> to all the modules being built. We didn't modify anything in the configuration.</p>

<p>Then we use guestmount to mount the virtual disk to a mount point on the host</p>

<div><div><pre><code>guestmount -a /home/ed/virtimg/ubuntu20.04 -i ~/vm/linux/
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>In Ubuntu this step yields the following message:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>libguestfs: error: /usr/bin/supermin exited with error status 1.
To see full error messages you may need to enable debugging.
Do:
  export LIBGUESTFS_DEBUG=1 LIBGUESTFS_TRACE=1
and run the command again.  For further information, read:
  http://libguestfs.org/guestfs-faq.1.html#debugging-libguestfs
You can also run 'libguestfs-test-tool' and post the *complete* output
into a bug report or message to the libguestfs mailing list.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The underlying problem is that the kernel cannot be read and according to the <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/1046828/how-to-run-libguestfs-tools-tools-such-as-virt-make-fs-without-sudo">post</a> and the <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1467579">bug report</a> on Ubuntu Launchpad.</p>

<p>To fix the issue, we need to run</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sudo chmod +r /boot/vmlinuz-*
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can verify the contents inside ~/vm/linux by simply cd into it.</p>

<p>To install the modules we just built, we can copy the <code>&lt;install_mod_dir&gt;lib/modules</code> into the mounted filesystem <code>&lt;mount_point&gt;/lib/modules</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, we unmount the filesystem by doing</p>

<div><div><pre><code>fusermount -u /mnt/hdd1/vm/linux
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="booting-kvm-with-new-kernel">Booting KVM with new Kernel</h2>
<p>To boot up the VM with the new kernel, we will add a few extra command line options to kvm. For convenience, we put the scritps into a file. It's also available on <a href="https://gist.github.com/BDHU/8c6ab518ab37571a1cae132d79ac9a9e">gist</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

kvm <span>\</span>
    <span>-s</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>-display</span> gtk <span>\</span>
    <span>-cpu</span> host <span>\</span>
    <span>-vga</span> qxl <span>\</span>
    <span>-accel</span> kvm <span>\</span>
    <span>-kernel</span> <span>"/home/ed/Desktop/linux_kernel/kbuild/arch/x86/boot/bzImage"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>-append</span> <span>"root=/dev/sda1 console=ttyS0,115200n8 nokaslr"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>-drive</span> <span>format</span><span>=</span>raw,file<span>=</span>/home/ed/virtimg/ubuntu20.04 <span>\</span>
    <span>-m</span> 8G <span>\</span>
    <span>-smp</span> 6 <span>\</span>
    <span>--snapshot</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>-S</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Aside from the command line arguments we discussed before, there are a few new members here. the <code>-s</code> switch is a shorthand for <code>-gdb tcp::1234</code>. The <code>-display gtk</code> is optional. It enables the opengl context in the display device for gtk display output. <code>-cpu host</code> says the guest should emulate the host processor. <code>-vga qxl</code>  enables 3D acceleration on the guest system. <code>-vga virtio</code> also offers good performance in our case. <code>-kernel</code> allows bootloader to pickup the new kernel. The <code>-append</code> along with its arguments specifies where the root partition of the hard disk is and the console parameter adds a serial console at boot so you can see boot messages. The <code>--snapshot</code> in QEMU says the images that refer to an original image will use Redirect-on-Write to avoid changing the original image. The <code>-S</code> means the kernel won't start executing unless we attach a debugger to it. We only use it later in the debugging stage.</p>

<p>Again, we can verify there is internet access using the new kernel using <code>apt update</code>. There are no errors shown, which indicates the network is functioning correctly.</p>

<h2 id="booting-process">Booting Process</h2>
<p>Now we are able to boot up the VM successfully, we can first measure how much time the kernel spends in booting. Running <code>dmesg -d</code> shows the timestamp and time delta spent between messages. The final line shows <code>[10.842998]</code>. If we use <code>systemd-analyze</code>, it outputs</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Startup finished in 795ms (kernel) + 5.451s (userspace) = 6.247s
graphical.target reached after 5.439s in userspace
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The reason why there is a gap between these two measurement is because <code>dmesg</code> is not a reliable test of how long a boot-up process goes. <code>dmesg</code> itself merely collects information. The drivers and other system processes can output messages at any point in time. There may or may not be processes spawning between those messages.</p>

<p>Next, we are going to look at how PCI device is involved in kernel startup. <code>lspci</code> outputs the follow</p>

<div><div><pre><code>00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation 440FX - 82441FX PMC [Natoma] (rev 02)
00:01.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation 82371SB PIIX3 ISA [Natoma/Triton II]
00:01.1 IDE interface: Intel Corporation 82371SB PIIX3 IDE [Natoma/Triton II]
00:01.3 Bridge: Intel Corporation 82371AB/EB/MB PIIX4 ACPI (rev 03)
00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Red Hat, Inc. Virtio GPU (rev 01)
00:03.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 82540EM Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 03)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can use the PCI address here to search for corresponding information in <code>dmesg</code>. For example, if we use the domain value \(0000:\) as query, we get something like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[    0.295026] PCI host bridge to bus 0000:00

			<p>I don’t usually do Happy New Year posts, but given how “well” 2020 went I thought it was appropriate to start 2021 with a whimsy post.&nbsp; This post is probably going to date me since it’s been a few years – OK, decades – since these were current.</p>
<p>Well, it’s not the actual computer, but the same model. I was first exposed to computers during the personal computer heyday of the early 1980s. Back then, my school had two computers, one <a href="http://www.trs-80.org/model-3/">TRS 80 Model 3</a> and one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81">Sinclair ZX81</a>. The ZX81 was used to teach pupils rudimentary programming. I wouldn’t be surprised if one of the teachers actually built it from a kit as that was the cheapest way to get into one.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that I grew up in Europe where computers like the Apple ][ were very expensive and didn’t gain much traction in the educational field. Or with hobbists, either. Yes, there were some around but you saw a lot more VIC20s, C64s or Ataris. A lot of schools including mine bought European manufactured computers like Sinclairs and later, Amstrad/Schneider CPC 464s.</p>

<p>Either way I probably watched too many retro computing videos on YouTube and ended up finding a Timex 1000 on eBay. For those not well versed in personal computer history, Timex sold variants of Sinclair computers in the US. Here it is, in all its glory:</p>

<figure id="attachment_1759" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1759"><a href="http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/2021/01/01/i-bought-the-first-computer-i-ever-wrote-a-program-on/zx81/" rel="attachment wp-att-1759"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/zx81.jpg" alt="My Timex 1000/Sinclair ZX81" width="1024" height="683" srcset="http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/zx81.jpg 1024w, http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/zx81-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/zx81-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/zx81-380x253.jpg 380w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1759">My Timex 1000 (nee Sinclair ZX81) in all it’s glory</figcaption></figure>
<p>I actually bought this computer a couple of year ago. Between a house move, work and a bunch of other projects it mostly sat in its box. It is very clean and doesn’t appear to have seen a lot of use, so I’m hopeful that I’ll be able to get it working with minimal effort. If not, well, it’s a cheap way to polish my soldering skills.</p>
<p>As the ZX81 only came with 1KB of RAM – which included the video RAM – there isn’t that much that you can do with one out of the box. Fortunately this one came with the humongous 16KB RAM expansion that connects on the back.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1758" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1758"><a href="http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/2021/01/01/i-bought-the-first-computer-i-ever-wrote-a-program-on/zx81-16k/" rel="attachment wp-att-1758"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/zx81-16k.jpg" alt="ZX81 with 16KB RAM expansion" width="1024" height="683" srcset="http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/zx81-16k.jpg 1024w, http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/zx81-16k-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/zx81-16k-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/zx81-16k-380x253.jpg 380w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1758">ZX81 with 16KB RAM expansion</figcaption></figure>
<p>Those expansions were notorious for causing involuntary resets if you looked at the computer funny. They actually connect straight the motherboard and are only held on by the connector itself, so any movement is, well, not great.</p>
<p>Also, I guess the warranty has run out:</p>
<figure id="attachment_1757" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1757"><a href="http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/2021/01/01/i-bought-the-first-computer-i-ever-wrote-a-program-on/zx81-warranty/" rel="attachment wp-att-1757"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/zx81-warranty.jpg" alt="Timex 1000 warranty slip" width="683" height="1024" srcset="http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/zx81-warranty.jpg 683w, http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/zx81-warranty-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/zx81-warranty-173x260.jpg 173w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1757">The warranty.

		<p><a href="http://multicians.org/"><b>Multics</b></a>, the <i>Multiplexed Information and Computing Service</i>, is the quintessential interactive time-sharing mainframe operating system. </p><!--running on 36-bit General Electric GE-645, Honeywell 6180, Honeywell Series 60 Level 68 <small>(Level 68/DPS, DPS-68)</small> and Honeywell-Bull DPS-8/M hardware.-->

<p> Multics began in 1965 as a pioneering research project, a joint effort of the best and brightest minds in academia, government, and industry. 
</p><p><b>Without exaggeration, one could say Multics was the <i><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/"><b>Project Apollo</b></a></i> of operating system development.</b></p><p>

Virtually every operating system from 1965 forward was heavily influenced by Multics. Nearly every feature associated with modern computing — the hierarchical file system, interprocess communication, single-level storage, dynamic linking, high-availability, online reconfiguration, ACL-based access control, multilevel isolation, and even the relational database — is a Multics innovation. 
</p><!--Despite networking not being "baked-in" to the original design, the modular structure of the system allowed rapid development and deployment of communication and network technologies including serial links, modem dialin/dialout, HASP/RJE, BSC, TCP/IP, NCP, X.25, CHAOS, and DSA.
<br><br>-->

<p><b>MIT Multics was the sixth system to join the Internet &nbsp;</b>(<i><small>ARPAnet</small></i>)<b>&nbsp; in September of 1971.</b></p><p>

Unlike most research projects, the Multics system graduated from academia, becoming an acclaimed commercial product of Honeywell <small>(later Bull)</small>, and finding success in education, government, and industry. Multics sites included MIT, the U.S. Air Force, Navy, Pentagon, NSA, the Canadian Department of National Defense, Bell Canada, Ford, General Motors, the University of Calgary, and Oakland University.
</p><!--Many Multics sites were on the cutting edge of computing, pushing the limits of technology, expanding their installations with additional novel hardware. Multics was at the heart of early massively-parallel processing and vector supercomputing installations, integrating and interfacing with systems like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STARAN">Goodyear STARAN</a>, the first commercial massively parallel system, and the famous <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/supercomputers/10/7">Cray-1</a> &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray_X-MP">Cray X-MP</a> machines.<br><br>-->

<!--<code><b>BAN.AI Public Access Multics</b></code> hopes to fulfill the role envisioned by the <a href="http://multics50.org">Multics50 initiative</a> of "a practical, living exhibit of one of the most influential contributions to computer science".<br><br>-->

<!--As noted by the <a href="http://multics50.org/">Multics50 initiative</a>,--><p> Although the Multics system software and the hardware on which it ran spanned multiple commercial generations and was used in critical production until the year 2000, the overall body of knowledge for Multics  primarily consists of the <a href="https://ban.ai/multics/doc">papers, reports, and books</a> written about the academic iterations of the system, as it existed from 1965&nbsp;-&nbsp;1972.</p><p><span size="+1">By providing the <b>BAN.AI Public Access Multics</b> service, we hope to challenge misconceptions and myths by providing access to an actively developed, maintained, and functional example of a Multics production system, operating in the intended role of a computing utility — not a mere historic artifact.</span></p><p>

<p>Clearly, this stuff must be really hard to get right.  I also must be a moron, since,
after having written some thousand lines of Python, I don’t even know what problem we are
trying to solve here, and the abundance of relevant programs with subtly different names
has deterred me from reading up on it so far.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-is-a-virtual-environment">So what <em>is</em> a virtual environment?</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html" title="The Python Tutorial: Virtual Environments and Packages">official docs’ tutorial</a> describes a virtual environment as</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a self-contained directory tree that contains a Python installation for a particular
  version of Python, plus a number of additional packages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it’s a directory with a Python interpreter?  Easy enough.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>mkdir virtual_env
<span>$ </span>cp /bin/python3 virtual_env/
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Let’s see.  Directory?  Check.  Contains a Python installation?  Check.  Contains a number
of additional packages?  Zero is a number!  (Check.)  Particular version?  Um…</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>cd </span>virtual_env/
<span>$ </span>./python3 --version
Python 3.6.3
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>I think that will do.  Is it self-contained, though?  It doesn’t contain itself…</p>

<p><span>
<img src="https://meribold.org/assets/russell.png" alt="Another nerd: Bertrand Russell in 1916" title="Consider the directory containing all directories that don't contain themselves.">
</span></p>

<p>Jokes aside, there are only two things missing to actually make our directory a virtual
environment as specified by <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0405/" title="PEP 405 -- Python Virtual Environments"><abbr title="Python Enhancement Proposal">PEP</abbr> 405</a>, the proposal that integrated a standard mechanism
for virtual environments with Python.<sup id="fnref:before-405"><a href="#fn:before-405">1</a></sup></p>

<ol>
  <li>A file named <code>pyvenv.cfg</code> containing the line <code>home = /usr/bin</code></li>
  <li>A <code>lib/python3.6/site-packages</code> subdirectory</li>
</ol>

<p>(Both paths are subject to the <abbr title="Operating system">OS</abbr> and the second one also to the Python version used.)</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>'home = /usr/bin'</span> &gt; pyvenv.cfg
<span>$ </span>mkdir -p lib/python3.6/site-packages
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>I will also move the Python binary into a <code>bin</code> subdirectory.<sup id="fnref:why-tho"><a href="#fn:why-tho">2</a></sup></p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>mkdir bin <span>&amp;&amp;</span> mv python3 bin/
</code></pre>
</div>

<!-- >   [T]he internal virtual environment layout mimics the layout of the Python installation
>   itself on each platform.  
>   ---<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0405/#creating-virtual-environments> -->

<p>Fair.  We have a directory that formally qualifies as a virtual environment:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>tree --noreport
.
├── bin
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── python3
├── lib
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── python3.6
│&nbsp;&nbsp;     └── site-packages
└── pyvenv.cfg
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This leads us to the next question.</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-point">What’s the point?</h2>

<p>When we run our copy of the Python binary, the <code>pyvenv.cfg</code> file changes what happens
during startup: the presence of the <code>home</code> key tells Python the binary belongs to a
virtual environment, the key’s value (<code>/usr/bin</code>) tells it where to find a complete Python
installation that includes the standard library.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that <code>./lib/python3.6/site-packages</code> becomes part of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html">module search
path</a>.  The point is that we can now install packages to that location, in particular,
specific versions that may conflict with the dependencies of another Python program on the
same system.<sup id="fnref:python-level-isolation"><a href="#fn:python-level-isolation">3</a></sup></p>

<p>For example, if your project needs exactly version 0.0.3 of
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/left-pad">left-pad</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>pip3 install -t lib/python3.6/site-packages/ left-pad<span>==</span>0.0.3
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now this will work:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>./bin/python3 -c <span>'import left_pad'</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>While this should raise <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ModuleNotFoundError"><code>ModuleNotFoundError</code></a>, as desired:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>python3 -c <span>'import left_pad'</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Another project on the same system could have a different version of left-pad in its own
virtual environment, without interfering with this one.</p>

<!--
TODO: talk about isolation from the system-level and user-level site-packages directories?
-->



<p>In practice, one does not simply create virtual environments by hand, which brings us back
to the dauntingly long list of tools above.  Fortunately, one of them is not like the
others.  While it’s predated by most of them, this one ships with Python as part of the
standard library: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" title="The Python Standard Library: venv — Creation of virtual environments"><em>venv</em></a>.<sup id="fnref:venv-and-pyvenv"><a href="#fn:venv-and-pyvenv">4</a></sup></p>

<p>In its simplest form, venv is used to create a virtual environment like so:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>python3 -m venv virtual_env
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This creates the <code>virtual_env</code> directory and also copies or symlinks the Python
interpreter:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>cd </span>virtual_env
<span>$ </span>find -name python3
./bin/python3
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>It also copies a bunch of other stuff: I get 650 files in 89 subdirectories amounting to
about 10 MiB in total.  One of those files is the <code>pip</code> binary, and we can use it to
install packages into the virtual environment without passing extra command-line
arguments:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>./bin/pip install left-pad

<p>You can read more about using venv and <em>optional</em> magic like “activate” scripts in the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html">Python tutorial</a> or venv’s
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html">documentation</a>—this post is only meant to
boil down what a virtual environment actually is.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>A virtual environment is a directory containing a Python interpreter, a special
<code>pyvenv.cfg</code> file that affects startup of the interpreter, and some third-party Python
packages.  Python packages installed into a virtual environment will not interfere with
other Python applications on the same system.  The “<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/installing/">standard tool for creating virtual
environments</a>” is venv.</p>

		<p>As you may know, I am Qt 5 maintainer in Debian. Maintaning Qt means not only
bumping the version each time a new version is released, but also making sure
Qt builds successfully on all architectures that are supported in Debian (and
for some submodules, the automatic tests pass).</p>
<p>An important sort of build failures are endianness specific failures. Most
widely used architectures (x86_64, aarch64) are little endian. However, Debian
officially supports one big endian architecture (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_on_IBM_Z">s390x</a>), and unofficially
a few more ports are provided, such as <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/PPC64">ppc64</a> and <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Sparc64">sparc64</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Qt upstream does not have any big endian machine in their CI
system, so endianness issues get noticed only when the packages fail to build
on our build daemons. In the last years I have discovered and fixed some such
issues in various parts of Qt, so I decided to write a post to illustrate how
to write really cross-platform C/C++ code.</p>
<h2>Issue 1: the WebP image format handler (<a href="https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtimageformats/+/86275">code review</a>)</h2>
<p>The relevant code snippet is:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>srcImage</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>()</span> <span>!=</span> <span>QImage</span><span>::</span><span>Format_ARGB32</span><span>)</span>
    <span>srcImage</span> <span>=</span> <span>srcImage</span><span>.</span><span>convertToFormat</span><span>(</span><span>QImage</span><span>::</span><span>Format_ARGB32</span><span>);</span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>WebPPictureImportBGRA</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>picture</span><span>,</span> <span>srcImage</span><span>.</span><span>bits</span><span>(),</span> <span>srcImage</span><span>.</span><span>bytesPerLine</span><span>()))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The code here is serializing the images into <code>QImage::Format_ARGB32</code> format, and
then passing the bytes into WebP’s import function. With this format, the image
is stored using a 32-bit ARGB format (0xAARRGGBB). This means that the bytes
will be 0xBB, 0xGG, 0xRR, 0xAA or little endian and 0xAA, 0xRR, 0xGG, 0xBB on
big endian. However, <code>WebPPictureImportBGRA</code> expects the first format on all
architectures.</p>
<p>The fix was to use <code>QImage::Format_RGBA8888</code>. As the <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qimage.html#Format-enum">QImage documentation</a>
says, with this format <em>the order of the colors is the same on any architecture
if read as bytes 0xRR, 0xGG, 0xBB, 0xAA</em>.</p>
<h2>Issue 2: <code>qimage_converter_map</code> structure (<a href="https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtbase/+/101769">code review</a>)</h2>
<p>The code seems to already support big endian. But maybe you can spot the error?</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>#if Q_BYTE_ORDER == Q_LITTLE_ENDIAN</span>
        <span>0</span><span>,</span>
        <span>convert_ARGB_to_ARGB_PM</span><span>,</span>
<span>#else</span>
        <span>0</span><span>,</span>
        <span>0</span>
<span>#endif</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>It is the missing comma! It is present in the little endian block, but not in
the big endian one. This was fixed trivially.</p>
<h2>Issue 3: QHandle, part of Qt 3D module (<a href="https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qt3d/+/162737">code review</a>)</h2>
<p>QHandle class uses a union that is declared as follows:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>struct</span> <span>Data</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>quint32</span> <span>m_index</span> <span>:</span> <span>IndexBits</span><span>;</span>
    <span>quint32</span> <span>m_counter</span> <span>:</span> <span>CounterBits</span><span>;</span>
    <span>quint32</span> <span>m_unused</span> <span>:</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
<span>union</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Data</span> <span>d</span><span>;</span>
    <span>quint32</span> <span>m_handle</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The sizes are declared such as IndexBits + CounterBits + 2 is always
equal to 32 (four bytes).</p>
<p>Then we have a constructor that sets the values of Data struct:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>QHandle</span><span>(</span><span>quint32</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>quint32</span> <span>count</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>d</span><span>.</span><span>m_index</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span><span>;</span>
    <span>d</span><span>.</span><span>m_counter</span> <span>=</span> <span>count</span><span>;</span>
    <span>d</span><span>.</span><span>m_unused</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The value of <code>m_handle</code> will be different depending on endianness!
So the test that was expecting a particular value with given constructor
arguments was failing. I fixed it by using the following macro:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>#if Q_BYTE_ORDER == Q_BIG_ENDIAN</span>
<span>#define GET_EXPECTED_HANDLE(qHandle) ((qHandle.index() &lt;&lt; (qHandle.CounterBits + 2)) + (qHandle.counter() &lt;&lt; 2))</span>
<span>#else </span><span>/* Q_LITTLE_ENDIAN */</span><span></span>
<span>#define GET_EXPECTED_HANDLE(qHandle) (qHandle.index() + (qHandle.counter() &lt;&lt; qHandle.IndexBits))</span>
<span>#endif</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2>Issue 4: QML compiler (<a href="https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtdeclarative/+/197746">code review</a>)</h2>
<p>The QML compiler used a helper class named LEUInt32 (based on <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qleinteger.html">QLEInteger</a>)
that always stored the numbers in little endian internally. This class
can be safely mixed with native quint32 on little endian systems, but not
on big endian.</p>
<p>Usually the compiler would warn about type mismatch, but here the code used
<code>reinterpret_cast</code>, such as:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>quint32</span> <span>*</span><span>objectTable</span> <span>=</span> <span>reinterpret_cast</span><span>&lt;</span><span>quint32</span><span>*&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>data</span> <span>+</span> <span>qmlUnit</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>offsetToObjects</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So this was not noticed on build time, but the compiler was crashing. The fix
was trivial again, replacing quint32 with QLEUInt32.</p>
<h2>Issue 5: QModbusPdu, part of Qt Serial Bus module (<a href="https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtserialbus/+/245206">code review</a>)</h2>
<p>The code snippet is simple:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>QModbusPdu</span><span>::</span><span>FunctionCode</span> <span>code</span> <span>=</span> <span>QModbusPdu</span><span>::</span><span>Invalid</span><span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>stream</span><span>.</span><span>readRawData</span><span>((</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>code</span><span>),</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>quint8</span><span>))</span> <span>!=</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>quint8</span><span>))</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>stream</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>QModbusPdu::FunctionCode</code> is an enum, so <code>code</code> is a multi-byte value (even if
only one byte is significant). However, <code>(char *) (&amp;code)</code> returns a pointer to
the first byte of it. It is the needed byte on little endian systems, but it is
the wrong byte on big endian ones!</p>
<p>The correct fix was using a temporary one-byte variable:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>quint8</span> <span>codeByte</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>stream</span><span>.</span><span>readRawData</span><span>((</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>codeByte</span><span>),</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>quint8</span><span>))</span> <span>!=</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>quint8</span><span>))</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>stream</span><span>;</span>
<span>QModbusPdu</span><span>::</span><span>FunctionCode</span> <span>code</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>QModbusPdu</span><span>::</span><span>FunctionCode</span><span>)</span> <span>codeByte</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2>Issue 6: <code>qt_is_ascii</code> (<a href="https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtbase/+/258164">code review</a>)</h2>
<p>This function, as the name says, checks whether a string is ASCII. It does
that by splitting the string into 4-byte chunks:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>ptr</span> <span>+</span> <span>4</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>end</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>quint32</span> <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>qFromUnaligned</span><span>&lt;</span><span>quint32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>ptr</span><span>);</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>data</span> <span>&amp;=</span> <span>0x80808080U</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>uint</span> <span>idx</span> <span>=</span> <span>qCountTrailingZeroBits</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>);</span>
        <span>ptr</span> <span>+=</span> <span>idx</span> <span>/</span> <span>8</span><span>;</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>ptr</span> <span>+=</span> <span>4</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>idx / 8</code> is the number of trailing zero bytes. However, the bytes which are
trailing on little endian are actually leading on big endian! So we can use
<code>qCountLeadingZeroBits</code> there.</p>
<h2>Issue 7: the bundled copy of tinycbor (<a href="https://github.com/thiagomacieira/tinycbor/pull/1">upstream pull request</a>)</h2>
<p>Similar to issue 5, the code was reading into the wrong byte:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>bytesNeeded</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>read_bytes_unchecked</span><span>(</span><span>it</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>it</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>extra</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>bytesNeeded</span><span>);</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>bytesNeeded</span> <span>==</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span>
        <span>it</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>extra</span> <span>=</span> <span>cbor_ntohs</span><span>(</span><span>it</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>extra</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>extra</code> has type uint16_t, so it has two bytes. When we need only one byte,
we read into the wrong byte, so the resulting number is 256 times higher on
big endian than it should be. Adding a temporary one-byte variable fixed it.</p>
<h2>Issue 8: perfparser, part of Qt Creator (<a href="https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt-creator/perfparser/+/305990">code review</a>)</h2>
<p>Here it is not trivial to find the issue just looking at the code:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>qint32</span> <span>dataStreamVersion</span> <span>=</span> <span>qToLittleEndian</span><span>(</span><span>QDataStream</span><span>::</span><span>Qt_DefaultCompiledVersion</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>However the linker was producing an error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>undefined reference to `QDataStream::Version qbswap<qdatastream::version>(QDataStream::Version)'</qdatastream::version></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On little endian systems, <code>qToLittleEndian</code> is a no-op, but on big endian
systems, it is a template function defined for some known types. But it turns
out we need to explicitly convert enum values to a simple type, so the fix
was passing <code>qint32(QDataStream::Qt_DefaultCompiledVersion)</code> to that function.</p>
<h2>Issue 9: Qt Personal Information Management (<a href="https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtpim/+/319865">code review</a>)</h2>
<p>The code in test was trying to represent a number as a sequence of bytes,
using <code>reinterpret_cast</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>static</span> <span>inline</span> <span>QContactId</span> <span>makeId</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>QString</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>managerName</span><span>,</span> <span>uint</span> <span>id</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>QContactId</span><span>(</span><span>QStringLiteral</span><span>(</span><span>"qtcontacts:basic%1:"</span><span>).</span><span>arg</span><span>(</span><span>managerName</span><span>),</span> <span>QByteArray</span><span>(</span><span>reinterpret_cast</span><span>&lt;</span><span>const</span> <span>char</span> <span>*&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>id</span><span>),</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>uint</span><span>)));</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The order of bytes will be different on little endian and big endian systems!
The fix was adding this line to the beginning of the function:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>id</span> <span>=</span> <span>qToLittleEndian</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This will cause the bytes to be reversed on big endian systems.</p>
<h2>What remains unfixed</h2>
<p>There are still some bugs, which require deeper investigation, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-56806">https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-56806</a></li>

We recently came across the study by 2015 Standard University that confirms our suspicions that they are indeed turning styrofoam into usable organic matter!</p>
<p>Their notes are not much different than ours, except their equipment (gel permeation chromatography, solid-state 13C cross-polarization/magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) was a little better than ours. I mean, we do have a microscope and a few 5-gallon buckets…</p>

Polystyrene (PS) is generally considered to be durable and resistant to biodegradation. Mealworms (the larvae of Tenebrio molitor Linnaeus) from different sources chew and eat Styrofoam, a common PS product. The Styrofoam was efficiently degraded in the larval gut within a retention time of less than 24 h. Fed with Styrofoam as the sole diet, the larvae lived as well as those fed with a normal diet (bran) over a period of 1 month… Within a 16 day test period, 47.7% of the ingested Styrofoam carbon was converted into CO2 and the residue was egested as fecula with a limited fraction incorporated into biomass. Tests confirmed that the polystyrene was mineralized to CO2 and incorporated into lipids.</p></div></div></div><div id="x-section-3"><div><div><div><p>The mealworms are able to do this due to their gut bacteria (Exiguobacterium sp. strain YT2) that actually breaks down the polystyrene. The Stanford study uses a common mealworm (the larvae of Tenebrio molitor Linnaeus) – we are using this same mealworm, but in addition to that we are also using what’s known as a “superworm” (the larvae of Zophobas morio), a type of darkling beetle, that has a lifespan of 3 to 15 years.</p>
<p>The superworm seems to be more aggressive, larger, more sturdy, and eats a lot more material. It also has the ability to live for up to a year in the larval stage just by keeping them all in constant contact of each other’s bodies. The other mealworm has a very short cycle.</p>

<p>*100 worms can eat 380mg in 30 days (12.7mg/day). That means each worm can eat 0.127mg per day – 46.36mg per year!</p>
<p>We are in the process of measuring the amount of styrofoam that the superworms eat on a daily and yearly basis. So far, the numbers seem significantly higher than the numbers that the Stanford researchers found for the mealworms that they used.</p>
</div><hr><div><p>We also have found that the plants we grow with the mealworms manure show no significant differences from those grown in other compost. This is an ongoing experiment. We are looking to have the plants tested, that are grown with the mealworm manure and try and see if there any detrimental effects.</p>
<p>There was also some information that was mentioned in the Stanford study indicating that the Indian meal moth is able to digest polyethylene plastic! This is very interesting as well…</p>
</div><h2><span>Are the mealworm droppings actually becoming usable organic material?</span></h2><hr><div><p>The 2015 Stanford tests indicate that the mealworm droppings actually become usable organic material through the fact that they’re calling the process “mineralization.”</p>
<p>Mineralization is the process of nutrients becoming available to plants. If you think about the carbon to nitrogen ratio – when it’s up 30:1 the bacteria need to the use the nitrogen to process the carbon. You often hear the term that the nitrogen is “unavailable,” “locked up,” or “bound.”</p>
<p>When the ratio drops to 25:1 the nitrogen becomes available for the plants.</p>
<p><strong>The fact that these worms are converting about half of the styrofoam they eat into carbon dioxide and the rest into mineralized organic material suggest that it has come full circle.</strong></p>
</div><hr><div><p>We don’t know that we would grow all of our carrots and food that we eat in this stuff, but it definitely is food for thought. </p>
<p>We need to start thinking about how we’re going to leave a healthy planet for the generations beyond ourselves, and using mealworms to compost styrofoam is definitely thinking out of the box.</p>

<p>
Recently, I had the pleasure of talking with KC Sivaramakrishnan - one
of the lead developers of the OCaml multicore project - when he came
to NUS to give us a talk on his work on multicore and a potential new
language feature for OCaml: <b>Algebraic effects</b>.  At a high level, the
run-down on algebraic effects is that they can be considered as a sort
of alternative to monads,<sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> however with the key benefit that they
<i>play a lot nicer</i> with existing direct-style code and thus might be a
<i>more fluid</i> and <i>ergonomic</i> tool.  One of my most surprising takeaways
from meeting KC was in realising the significant amount of progress
that had already been made on implementing algebraic effects in
OCaml - in fact, algebraic effects, far from just being a far-off
pipe-dream (cough, modular implicits, cough), are actually at a point
where it is possible (<i>fairly easy even</i>) to play with them right now
(albeit using an experimental fork of the OCaml compiler).
</p>

<p>
Indeed, this is exactly what I have been working on over the past few
weeks - so moved was I by the world of possibilities opened up by this
development, I immediately set about experimenting on inserting
algebraic effects into various OCaml projects that I happened have
handy at the time.  Over the course of these experiments, I ended up
considering the application of algebraic effects to functional game
development, and in the process stumbled upon a rather elegant pattern
for representing animations in a functional style.  In fact, this
pattern actually ended up solving a longstanding issue I was having
with managing the control flow for animations alongside game logic,
and so I think it forms a rather nice setting for exploring the
benefits of algebraic effects, hence this post.
</p>

 


<p>
In the rest of this blog post, I'm going to provide a <i>gentle
introduction</i> to algebraic effects, provided in the context of their
use in implementing <b>functional game animations</b> - we'll look at using
algebraic effects to implement 3 different case studies of <i>relatively
complex</i> animations (see above) for games in a fluid and elegant way.
Hopefully, through exploring these case-studies, you should be able to
gain a better understanding of the pros and cons of algebraic effects
and why they are certainly something to be excited about.

<div id="outline-container-orgbc783f7">
<h3 id="orgbc783f7">The vision: Functional Game Development</h3>
<div id="text-orgbc783f7">
<p>
While our final code uses a mix of functional and imperative code (as
is idiomatic OCaml style), our journey really begins in the world of
pure functional games.
</p>

<div> 
<p><img src="http://gopiandcode.uk/images/functional_update.png" alt="functional_update.png"></p><div><p> 
Fundamentally, functional games work by separating
the execution of a game into two distinct functions representing the main phases of the game loop:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>an update function</b> that takes user input and time and updates the state of the world</li>
<li><b>a draw function</b> that displays the current state of the world to the
screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The idea here is that while the state of the game may change over time, the individual update and draw functions are pure and referentially transparent, and thus come with all the usual benefits of functional code (modularity and compositionality, reusable code, easier to reason about etc.).
</p></div> 
</div> 


<p>
To see these ideas in practice, suppose we wanted to implement a simple menu for a game:
</p><p><img src="http://gopiandcode.uk/images/a_game_menu.png" alt="a_game_menu.png">
</p> 


<p>
Following the functional approach, we could define the state of our menu as follows:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>type</span> <span>menu</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> selected<span>:</span> int<span>;</span> options<span>:</span> string list<span>;</span> <span>}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Using this fairly simple state, we can easily
write a pure draw function for the menu as follows:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>let</span> <span>draw_item</span><span> </span><span>~</span><span>pos </span><span>~</span><span>is_active txt</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span> <span>(* </span><span>draw an individual menu item </span><span>*)</span>

<span>let</span> <span>draw</span> <span>{</span>selected<span>;</span>options<span>}</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>List.</span>iteri <span>(</span><span>fun</span> <span>ind option</span> <span>-&gt;</span>  
       draw_item <span>~pos</span><span>:</span>ind <span>~is_active</span><span>:(</span>ind <span>=</span> selected<span>)</span> option
    <span>)</span> options
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Similarly, if we wanted to make the menu respond to user inputs, we
can write a functional update operation for the menu as follows:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>let</span> <span>update</span><span> menu key</span> <span>=</span> 
   <span>let</span> <span>len</span> <span>=</span> length menu.options <span>in</span>
   <span>let</span> <span>next</span><span> pos</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span>pos <span>+</span> 1<span>)</span> <span>mod</span> len <span>in</span>
   <span>let</span> <span>prev</span><span> pos</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span>pos <span>-</span> 1 <span>+</span> len<span>)</span> <span>mod</span> len <span>in</span>
   <span>match</span> key <span>with</span>
   <span>|</span> <span>Up</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>{</span>menu <span>with</span> selected <span>=</span> next menu.selected<span>}</span>
   <span>|</span> <span>Down</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>{</span>menu <span>with</span> selected <span>=</span> prev menu.selected<span>}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Hooking these all up together, the main loop for our program might then look as follows:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>let</span> <span>main</span><span> </span><span>()</span> <span>:</span> <span>unit</span> <span>=</span> 
   <span>let</span> <span>rec</span> <span>loop</span><span> menu</span> <span>=</span> 
      draw menu<span>;</span>
      <span>let</span> <span>input</span> <span>=</span> get_input <span>()</span> <span>in</span>
      <span>let</span> <span>menu</span> <span>=</span> update menu input <span>in</span>
      loop menu <span>in</span>
   loop <span>{</span>selected<span>=</span>0<span>;</span> options<span>=[</span><span>"A"</span><span>;</span> <span>"B"</span><span>;</span> <span>"C"</span><span>]}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
And tada! We now have a fully functional menu that <i>dynamically</i>
responds and updates to user inputs, and we were able to do it all
without having to ever dirty our hands with any <b>evil impure code</b>.
</p>

<p><img src="http://gopiandcode.uk/images/functional_menu.png" alt="functional_menu.png">
</p> 


<p>
Functional game development sounds great, right?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge7daf0a">
<h3 id="orge7daf0a">The challenge: Managing animations</h3>
<div id="text-orge7daf0a">
<p>
The stuff that I presented in the previous section is nothing new -
there are countless prior blog posts and videos on the web that all
describe this style of a game engine, and it paints a very pretty
picture.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, I am afraid to say, not all is as it seems in the land
of functional game development, and when you start using this
methodology to develop any kind of <i>non-trivial</i> games, you can quickly
find yourself running into edge-cases, and one <i>particularly nefarious</i>
example of such issues is handling animations.
</p>

<p>
Returning back to our running example of a game menu, suppose we now
wanted to come back and add a <i>simple</i> quality of life feature to our
menu - nothing complex, just a <b>fade-in</b> between states of the menu.
</p>

<p>
In other words, when the user presses a button, there should be small
<b>time-delay</b> as the menu <i>gradually transitions</i> from the original state
to the new one:
</p>

<p><img src="http://gopiandcode.uk/images/functional_animation.png" alt="functional_animation.png"> 
</p> 


<p>
<i>Okay, sure - that's not a complex transformation - so this should be
simple to implement within our framework, right?</i>
</p>

<div> 
<p><img src="http://gopiandcode.uk/images/functional_update_q.png" alt="functional_update_q.png"></p><div> 


<p>
<b>Unfortunately, no.</b>
</p>

<p>
Our methodology so far was based entirely around the assumption that
the update function is <i>pure</i> and <i>stateless</i> and should be called on each
frame of the game.
</p>

<p>
As such, if we were to return a new menu with the next item selected
when the user presses down, the <b>transformation would be immediate</b>
rather than the <i>gradual change</i> we want.
</p>

<p>
<i>So what exactly should we return from our update function then?</i>
</p></div> 
</div> 


<p>
If one were to strictly adhere to the functional game development
paradigm, then one hacky way to achieve this would be to explicitly
track the state of animations in the menu.
</p>

<p>
For example, we can update our definition of menu to be as follows:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>type</span> <span>time</span> <span>=</span> int
<span>type</span> <span>state</span> <span>=</span> <span>Static</span> <span>of</span> int <span>|</span> <span>MovingBetween</span> <span>of</span> int <span>*</span> int <span>*</span> time
<span>type</span> <span>menu</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> selected<span>:</span> state<span>;</span> options<span>:</span> string list<span>;</span> <span>}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The idea here is that the <code>state</code> type tracks the two possible states of the menu and its animations:
</p>
<ul>
<li>either the animation is complete and the menu is static</li>
<li>or the menu is in the middle of an animation between two states
with some amount of <code>time</code> (in ms) remaining.</li>
</ul>

<p>
With this change, we can then write our update function as follows
(now updated to take an additional time parameter tracking the time
between frames):
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>let</span> <span>update</span><span> menu key delta</span> <span>=</span> 
  <span>let</span> <span>len</span> <span>=</span> length menu.options <span>in</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>next</span><span> pos</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span>pos <span>+</span> 1<span>)</span> <span>mod</span> len <span>in</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>prev</span><span> pos</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span>pos <span>-</span> 1 <span>+</span> len<span>)</span> <span>mod</span> len <span>in</span>
  <span>match</span> menu.state <span>with</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>MovingBetween</span> <span>(</span>old_ind<span>,</span>new_ind<span>,</span> remaining<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>remaining</span> <span>=</span> remaining <span>-</span> delta <span>in</span>
    <span>if</span> remaining <span>&lt;</span> 0 <span>(* </span><span>is animation completed? </span><span>*)</span>
    <span>then</span> <span>{</span>menu <span>with</span> selected <span>=</span> <span>Static</span> new_ind<span>}</span> <span>(* </span><span>yes: return to static </span><span>*)</span>
    <span>else</span> <span>{</span>menu <span>with</span> selected <span>=</span> <span>MovingBetween</span> <span>(</span>old_ind<span>,</span> new_ind<span>,</span> remaining<span>)}</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Static</span> ind <span>-&gt;</span>
    <span>match</span> key <span>with</span> <span>(* </span><span>only process inputs when animations completed </span><span>*)</span>
    <span>|</span> <span>Up</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>{</span>menu <span>with</span> selected <span>=</span> <span>MovingBetween</span> <span>(</span>ind<span>,</span> next menu.selected<span>,</span> 100<span>)}</span>
    <span>|</span> <span>Down</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>{</span>menu <span>with</span> selected <span>=</span> <span>MovingBetween</span> <span>(</span>ind<span>,</span> prev menu.selected<span>,</span> 100<span>)}</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
So this will work decently well, however, we're now starting to mix
our animation code with the logic of the program, making it harder to
understand and also more probable for bugs to creep in.  Additionally,
while this happens to work for our simple example, the pattern isn't
scalable - adding more animations would require rewriting the entire
function.
</p>

<p>
Clearly, taking this purely functional approach to games development
has some <b>serious difficulties</b> with managing animations, but it would
be unfair to say that this is uniquely due to the functional
approach:
</p>

<p><b><i>The challenge of balancing animations flow with logic is inherent to the domain</i></b>
</p>


<p>
For the rest of this blog post, we'll shift gears to investigate how
algebraic effects can be used to implement animations when dealing
with a slightly more imperative game structure, however this is mainly
to simplify the implementation: the core ideas presented below can be
easily ported to a pure implementation.

<h3 id="org0873648">Algebraic effects to the rescue</h3>
<div id="text-org0873648">
<p>
Taking a step back from our previous example, the fundamental issue
was that we were trying to mix <b>two</b> separate threads of control - one
for the core logic, and a separate one for the animation - in other
words, what we need is some kind of <b>non-local control flow</b>.
</p>

<p>
….as it just so happens, this is exactly the functionality that
algebraic effects provide.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org7da722a">
<h4 id="org7da722a">What are algebraic effects?</h4>
<div id="text-org7da722a">
<p>
We'll sidestep a more detailed discussion of the theory, and instead
focus on the general picture for the end user: algebraic effects as
effectively "resumable" exceptions.<sup><a id="fnr.3" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
When defining an effect, the user specifies the type of the input
supplied by the caller, and the type of the output that the effect
should return on completion:
</p>


<p>
To perform an effect, we can use the builtin primitive perform:
</p>

<p>
At this point, the execution of the current program is stopped (much
like an exception), and control changes up the stack until the nearest
effect handler:

We’ve done it for decades. We pick some
honored, time-tested examples—<wbr>Fibonacci numbers and factorial being leading
candidates—<wbr>and use them to teach the general idea. They’re so canonical they
come directly from the gods: you can find these in books by people like
Niklaus Wirth.</p><p>But I’m here to tell you they got it wrong, and everyone’s been getting it
wrong ever since. Students come away underwhelmed and baffled, and go on to
become the next generation of teachers who repeat this process. However, we
need not repeat this cycle; we have much better methods.</p><h3>1<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Some_.Canonical_.Examples)"></a>Some Canonical Examples</h3><p>Let’s start by looking at what’s wrong with our canonical examples.</p><h4>1.1<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Factorial)"></a>Factorial</h4><p>First off, almost nobody has ever needed to compute a factorial. I’ve been
programming for about 35 years and the only times I’ve needed to compute a
factorial was when doing recreational mathematics or using programming to
explore some especially thorny combinatorics problem. Otherwise, I’ve never had
any need for factorials.</p><p>Second, the answer isn’t <span>meaningful</span>. Quick, what’s the factorial of 13?
Most people have no idea and (related to the above) don’t care. There’s nothing
recognizable about the answer. The only reason most programmers recognize the
number 3628800 is because we’ve tested factorial on a “big enough number” to
confirm that it worked, not because we actually cared about it. If you adopt a
curriculum that asks students to <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/wk-examplar/">develop examples
before they write code</a>, students would be hard-pressed to write the answer
independently; many would resort to implementing it first and plugging in the
answer.</p><p>Third, factorial has poor numeric properties in most languages. Unless you have
built-in, automatic support for big numbers, you will soon either get answers
that print in odd-looking scientific notation, or worse, overflow (on many
languages, with default integers, factorial of 17 is -288522240).</p><p>Finally, many students have written factorial-like programs before, perhaps
even factorial itself, using loops. A natural question they (should!) ask an
instructor is, “Why should I do this again?” The answer, inevitably, is,
“Because I’m asking you to.” There’s no better way to turn off a student.</p><p>So let’s summarize the “recursion experience”: a useless problem, with
unrecognizable answers, with wonky-looking behavior, using an unnecessary new
technique that you’re forced to use “because”.</p><h4>1.2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Fibonacci)"></a>Fibonacci</h4><p>Let’s turn our gaze to Fibonacci.</p><p>First off, almost nobody has ever needed to compute a Fibonacci number,
either. I’ve been programming for about 35 years and the only times I’ve needed
it was when doing recrea—<wbr>you see where this is going.<span><span><span>I do find them
useful to convert beween miles and kilometers, though.</span></span></span></p><p>Second, the answer isn’t meaningful, and students would again be hard-pressed
to write the answer independently (what, keep track of all those
calls?!?). Third, it has poor numeric properties: around 44, Fibonacci is
correct, then becomes negative (which is obviously incorrect), then immediately
again is a very reasonable-looking positive number that just happens to be
completely wrong. The main reason we haven’t cared for decades is because we
really just don’t have much use for Fibonacci numbers.</p><p>Finally, it has atrocious time-complexity.</p><p>So let’s summarize the “recursion experience”: a useless problem, with
unrecognizable answers, with wonky-looking behavior, that runs really sloooowly
(and worse, the slowness first creeps up on you stealthily and then suddenly
administers a hammer-blow to the back of your head). In fact, its main value is
as a function that you should <span>not</span> write (straightforwardly) recursively.</p><p>This is how we teach recursion.</p><h4>1.3<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Euclid_s_.Algorithm)"></a>Euclid’s Algorithm</h4><p>Oh, I’m not done.</p><p>Another famous mathematician, another famous function.</p><p>Okay, I’ll grant, many students have at least heard of the greatest common
divisor. They may vaguely recall using it in school for dealing with
fractions. So it has familiarity going for it.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was useful in a context that <span>no longer makes
sense</span>. Once you have a programming language, you have a calculator. Unless
you’re implementing a calculator (and perhaps even then), you have no real need
to implement Euclid’s algorithm.</p><p>And even if you do, admit it: you don’t remember why Euclid’s algorithm
works. I certainly have to re-derive why it produces the right answer every
time I’ve implemented it (purely for illustrative purposes, every few
years). Otherwise, it’s just a mystical pattern.</p><p>So what’s the lesson we get from Euclid’s algorithm? That recursion is for
encoding mystical patterns for no-longer-useful functions? In fact, is
recursion useful for anything <span>other</span> than weird math functions?</p><h4>1.4<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Towers_of_.Hanoi)"></a>Towers of Hanoi</h4><p>Oh yes it is! Maybe that’s why we have this old standby.</p><p>First, we’ll start with some invented Eastern mysticism. Orientalism is always
a good pedagogic device, right?</p><p>Next, it’s a problem fraught with questions of representation: how exactly do
you represent the content of the towers? That is actually a somewhat
interesting question for a beginning student, but (a) it’s not obvious until
you’ve had some programming practice, and (b) it has absolutely nothing to do
with recursion. So you have a hard, unrelated sub-problem in the middle of your
example that “demonstrates” recursion. Doesn’t that utterly violate the
pedagogic principle of changing just one thing at a time so students can focus
on what’s salient? (And don’t forget, this is another problem with exponential
time behavior!)</p><p>Furthermore, if you don’t tell students the (recursive) solution and leave them
to figure it out for themselves, you haven’t given them a programming problem:
you’ve given them a puzzle. Those are different things. In particular, the
Towers of Hanoi is a particularly <span>difficult</span> kind of recursion—<wbr>oh, you
didn’t know there are different kinds of recursion? Read on.</p><p>Finally, again, does anyone care? Do students believe they would be called on
to help monks move disks around? What other problem is similar to this one? And
if there are any, do we teach them, or do we present these magnificently
isolated monks…in magnificent isolation?</p><p>What’s worse is that so many of these are fundamentally <span>static</span> problems:
there are only so many interesting inputs, and each one has a completely
deterministic solution, so once one builds up a table of outputs for standard
inputs, the problem is essentially solved. For such problems, it would be smart
(especially when the run-time complexity is exponential in the input) to just
stash the answers and never run the code again.<span><span><span>Yes, I know,
memoization.</span></span></span></p><h3>2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Recursion_versus_.Cyclicity)"></a>Recursion versus Cyclicity</h3><p>Another standard, time-honored pedagogic device is the dumb joke: “to
understand recursion you must understand recursion”, and so on.</p><p>These confuse recursion with cyclicity.</p><p>If you don’t understand the difference, don’t use the dumb jokes.</p><p>If you do understand the difference, don’t use the dumb jokes then
either. They’re still <span>dumb</span> jokes.</p><h3>3<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Is_.Recursion_in_the_.Problem_)"></a>Is Recursion in the Problem?</h3><p>An attempt at a better answer might be that a <span>problem</span> is “inherently”
recursive. However, that’s just a limitation of viewpoint. There’s nothing more
inherently recursive than iterative about factorial. All the problems above can
be expressed even more declaratively, as in a mathematical specification, that
eliminates any implementation directive (e.g.: the greatest common divisor is the
<span>greatest</span>, <span>common</span>, <span>divisor</span>: the definition of the problem
says nothing about how to find it, and searching through all numbers to find
divisors that are common and taking the largest one is no less valid a
solution).</p><p>No, the essence lies elsewhere. But we’re getting closer.</p><h3>4<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.How_to_.Teach_.Recursion)"></a>How to Teach Recursion</h3><p>Wait up, I didn’t promise this. Check the title again.</p><p>But I know, I can’t just stop here. So I’ll give you a brief peek of how to
proceed.</p><p>In <span><a href="https://htdp.org/">How to Design Programs</a></span> (<span>HTDP</span>), we have a rather different view of
recursion. The key idea is this.</p><h4>4.1<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Function_.Follows_.Form)"></a>Function Follows Form</h4><p>Where does recursion come from? <span>HTDP</span> argues that it arises from
<span>self-references in data</span>. That is, <span>recursive data suggest recursive
solutions</span>. This is the key insight you need for understanding recursion. Not
only does it make sense once you think about it, it also demonstrates why most
other approaches to teaching recursion are essentially incorrect.</p><p><span>HTDP</span> teaches a design “recipe”. In it, you describe your program’s (or
function’s) data structures, and identify self-references in these
data. Self-referential data are pretty straightforward: even kids can understand
them. For instance, even a child informed about biology can answer basic
questions like these:
</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td><p><span>- Does a child have (biological) parents?</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>- Yes.</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>- How many?</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>- Two, a (biological) male and (biological) female.</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>- Does the female have parents?</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>- Yes.</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>- How many?</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>- Two, a (biological) mother and a (biological) father.</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>- Does the male…</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>They can see where this goes. They grasp the idea of a (biological) family tree
pretty intuitively. They can similarly see other kinds of self-referential data
even at a young age, well before they program.</p><p>Next, <span>HTDP</span> explains how the structure of the data suggest a structure to the
solution. This solution structure is generic, and called the “template”. You
arrive at this entirely mechanically from the data structure, even before
you’ve contemplated the exact problem you’re trying to solve.</p><p>(The template is not a rule, it’s a suggestion. It helps you overcome the
“blank page” problem by offering the outline of a suggestion. Sometimes, the
template leads to a correct but insufficiently-efficient solution. Such a
solution is …</p></div></div></div>

<p>This is the fourth…and LAST…entry in my series of blog posts analyzing the accuracy of Ray Kurzweil’s predictions about what things would be like in 2019. These predictions come from his 1998 book&nbsp;<em>The Age of Spiritual Machines</em>.&nbsp;You can view the previous installments of this series here:</p>



<p><a href="https://www.militantfuturist.com/how-ray-kurzweils-2019-predictions-are-faring-pt-1/">Part 1</a></p>



<p><a href="https://www.militantfuturist.com/how-ray-kurzweils-2019-predictions-are-faring-pt-2/">Part 2</a></p>

<p><strong><em>“An undercurrent of concern is developing with regard to the influence of machine intelligence. There continue to be differences between human and machine intelligence, but the advantages of human intelligence are becoming more difficult to identify and articulate. Computer intelligence is thoroughly interwoven into the mechanisms of civilization and is designed to be outwardly subservient to apparent human control. On the one hand, human transactions and decisions require by law a human agent of responsibility, even if fully initiated by machine intelligence. On the other hand, few decisions are made without significant involvement and consultation with machine-based intelligence.”</em></strong></p>



<p><strong>MOSTLY RIGHT</strong></p>



<p>Technological advances have moved concerns over the influence of machine intelligence to the fore in developed countries. In many domains of skill previously considered hallmarks of intelligent thinking, such as driving vehicles, recognizing images and faces, analyzing data, writing short documents, and even diagnosing diseases, machines had achieved human levels of performance by the end of 2019. And in a few niche tasks, such as playing Go, chess, or poker, machines were superhuman. Eroded human dominance in these and other fields did indeed force philosophers and scientists to grapple with the meaning of “intelligence” and “creativity,” and made it harder yet more important to define how human thinking was still special and useful. </p>



<p>While the prospect of artificial general intelligence was still viewed with skepticism, there was no real doubt among experts and laypeople in 2019 that task-specific AIs and robots would continue improving, and without any clear upper limit to their performance. This made technological unemployment and the solutions for it frequent topics of public discussion across the developed world. In 2019, one of the candidates for the upcoming U.S. Presidential election, Andrew Yang, even made these issues central to his political platform. </p>



<p>If “algorithms” is another name for “computer intelligence” in the prediction’s text, then yes, it is woven into the mechanisms of civilization and is ostensibly under human control, but in fact drives human thinking and behavior. To the latter point, great alarm has been raised over how algorithms used by social media companies and advertisers affect sociopolitical beliefs (particularly, conspiracy thinking and closedmindedness), spending decisions, and mental health. </p>



<p>Human transactions and decisions still require a “human agent of responsibility”: Autonomous cars aren’t allowed to drive unless a human is in the driver’s seat, human beings ultimately own and trade (or authorize the trading of) all assets, and no military lets its autonomous fighting machines kill people without orders from a human. The only part of the prediction that seems wrong is the last sentence. Probably most decisions that humans make are done without consulting a “machine-based intelligence.” Consider that most daily purchases (e.g. – where to go for lunch, where to get gas, whether and how to pay a utility bill) involve little thought or analysis. A frighteningly large share of investment choices are also made instinctively, with benefit of little or no research. However, it should be noted that one area of human decision-making, dating, has become much more data-driven, and it was common in 2019 for people to use sorting algorithms, personality test results, and other filters to choose potential mates. </p>



<p><strong><em>“Public and private spaces are routinely monitored by machine intelligence to prevent interpersonal violence.”</em></strong></p>



<p><strong>MOSTLY RIGHT</strong></p>



<p>Gunfire detection systems, which are comprised of networks of microphones emplaced across an area and which use machine intelligence to recognize the sounds of gunshots and to triangulate their origins, were emplaced in over 100 cities at the end of 2019. The dominant company in this niche industry, “ShotSpotter,” used human analysts to review its systems’ results before forwarding alerts to local police departments, so the systems were not truly automated, but nonetheless they made heavy use of machine intelligence. </p>



<p>Automated license plate reader cameras, which are commonly mounted next to roads or on police cars, also use machine intelligence and are widespread. The technology has definitely reduced violent crime, as it has allowed police to track down stolen vehicles and cars belonging to violent criminals faster than would have otherwise been possible. </p>



<p>In some countries, surveillance cameras with facial recognition technology monitor many public spaces. The cameras compare the people they see to mugshots of criminals, and alert the local police whenever a wanted person is seen. China is probably the world leader in facial recognition surveillance, and in a famous 2018 case, it used the technology to find one criminal among 60,000 people who attended a concert in Nanchang. </p>



<p>At the end of 2019, several organizations were researching ways to use machine learning for real-time recognition of violent behavior in surveillance camera feeds, but the systems were not accurate enough for commercial use. </p>



<p><strong><em>“People attempt to protect their privacy with near-unbreakable encryption technologies, but privacy continues to be a major political and social issue with each individual’s practically every move stored in a database somewhere.” </em></strong></p>



<p><strong>RIGHT</strong></p>



<p>In 2013, National Security Agency (NSA) analyst Edward Snowden leaked a massive number of secret documents, revealing the true extent of his employer’s global electronic surveillance. The world was shocked to learn that the NSA was routinely tracking the locations and cell phone call traffic of millions of people, and gathering enormous volumes of data from personal emails, internet browsing histories, and other electronic communications by forcing private telecom and internet companies (e.g. – Verizon, Google, Apple) to let it secretly search through their databases. Together with British intelligence, the NSA has the tools to spy on the electronic devices and internet usage of almost anyone on Earth. </p>

<p>Snowden also revealed that the NSA unsurprisingly had sophisticated means for cracking encrypted communications, which it routinely deployed against people it was spying on, but that even its capabilities had limits. Because some commercially available encryption tools were too time-consuming or too technically challenging to crack, the NSA secretly pressured software companies and computing hardware manufacturers to install “backdoors” in their products, which would allow the Agency to bypass any encryption their owners implemented. </p>



<p>During the 2010s, big tech titans like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple also came under major scrutiny for quietly gathering vast amounts of personal data from their users, and reselling it to third parties to make hundreds of billions of dollars. The decade also saw many epic thefts of sensitive personal data from corporate and government databases, affecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide. </p>



<p>With these events in mind, it’s quite true that concerns over digital privacy and confidentiality of personal data have become “major political and social issues,” and that there’s growing displeasure at the fact that “each individual’s practically every move stored in a database somewhere.” The response has been strongest in the European Union, which, in 2018, enacted the most stringent and impactful law to protect the digital rights of individuals–the “General Data Protection Regulation” (GDPR). </p>



<p>Widespread awareness of secret government surveillance programs and of the risk of personal electronic messages being made public thanks to hacks have also bolstered interest in commercial encryption. “Whatsapp” is a common text messaging app with built-in end-to-end encryption. It was invented in 2016 and had 1.5 billion users by 2019. “Tor” is a web browser with built-in encryption that became relatively common during the 2010s after it was learned even the NSA couldn’t spy on people who used it. Additionally, virtual private networks (VPNs), which provide an intermediate level of data privacy protection for little expense and hassle, are in common use. </p>



<p><strong><em>“The existence of the human underclass continues as an issue. While there is sufficient prosperity to provide basic necessities (secure housing and food, among others) without significant strain to the economy, old controversies persist regarding issues of responsibility and opportunity.” </em></strong></p>



<p><strong>RIGHT</strong></p>



<p>It’s unclear whether this prediction pertained to the U.S., to rich countries in aggregate, or to the world as a whole, and “underclass” is not defined, so we can’t say whether it refers only to desperately poor people who are literally starving, or to people who are better off than that but still under major daily stress due to lack of money. Whatever the case, by any reasonable definition, there is an “underclass” of people in almost every country. </p>



<p>In the U.S. and other rich countries, welfare states provide even the poorest people with access to housing, food, and other needs, though there are still those who go without because severe mental illness and/or drug addiction keep them stuck in homeless lifestyles and render them too behaviorally disorganized to apply for government help or to be admitted into free group housing. Some people also live in destitution in rich countries because they are illegal immigrants or fugitives with arrest warrants, and contacting the authorities for welfare assistance would lead to their detection and …</p></div></article></div>

<p>People sometimes ask me for robotics resources. There aren’t many high quality internet-first lists available on this topic, so I made one I can link to. I’ll continually update this list so feel free to give <strong><a href="mailto:arthur@allshire.org">suggestions if things are missing or you have better links</a></strong>.</p>
<p>There’s some more interesting comments on this topic in the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25608932">Hacker News discussion</a>.</p>
<h3 id="general-advice">General Advice</h3>
<p>Robotics can be overwhelming from the sheer number of fields involved (everything from mathematics to physics to computer science to mechanical engineering enters in). Remember: <em>you won’t start as an expert in anything; you can’t end up as an expert in everything</em>. Also learning will not be a linear path; outside of courses, acquire knowledge as you need it in projects.</p>
<p>Try as much as possible to avoid this antipattern (I still struggle)…
</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">An illustrated guide to learning absolutely nothing <a href="https://t.co/bKIMX2r6iU">pic.twitter.com/bKIMX2r6iU</a></p>— Eugene Vinitsky (@EugeneVinitsky) <a href="https://twitter.com/EugeneVinitsky/status/1343701831210307586?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 28, 2020</a></blockquote>


<h4 id="communities">Communities</h4>
<p>Instead of attempting to pre-load your head with maximum theory, try to get as much <strong>practical experience</strong> as possible (see below), whether that be joining a club, lab, or if you’re lucky in an internship or job.</p>
<p>It is incredibly hard to do something on your own without some kind of <a href="https://dcgross.com/the-environment-diet/">environmental forcing function</a>.  If at all possible, embed yourself in a community of people working on problems of interest to you.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FIRST robotics competition</a> - Simply put, FRC was the awesomest thing ever for me. If you can find a team, beg them to let you participate…</li>
<li>If you are a student at a university - try joining a lab!</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately outside of these robotics is currently not an easy field to break into. The sheer number of ‘moving parts’ to a (useful) robotic system - from hardware to drivers to algorithms to user interfaces - means it’s tough to hack together a demo in a few weeks, get users, and bootstrap / apply to some accelerator like in many software projects. Making the jump from “hacker” to “career”, even with all the knowledge in the world is hard. If you know solutions to this, let me know.</p>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p><strong>Computer programming</strong> - this is essential if you want to do basically anything in robotics. Python and <a href="https://www.stroustrup.com/Tour.html">C++</a> are the most important languages to know - learn both.
Familiarity with basic data-structures and algorithms concepts is helpful for problem solving and in some fields like motion planning but initially less vital than you may think - it’s not necessary to be a master leetcoder.</p>
<p><strong>Maths</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Linear algebra - vital in most topics beyond basic basic control. If you want to become an expert, <a href="https://linear.axler.net/">Axler’s book</a> is good (though I didn’t make it through the whole thing 😳).</li>
<li>Calculus - fundamental differential calculus and partial derivatives is required to understand optimisation algorithms which are everywhere in robo.</li>
<li>The book <a href="https://pimbook.org/">A Programmer’s Introduction to Mathematics</a> is actually a solid foundation if you want a quick overview of both of the above topics.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="important-concepts">Important Concepts</h3>
<p><strong>Controllers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wiki’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller">PID controller</a> isn’t bad if you want to learn the basics (<a href="https://www.argmin.net/2018/04/19/pid/">95%</a> of controllers used in industry are PID). Ben Recht’s <a href="https://www.argmin.net/2018/04/19/pid/">blog post</a> is also decent.</li>
<li><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/ee/ee392m/ee392m.1056/">These course slides</a> are good for basics and more advanced concepts like <strong>MPC</strong> .</li>
<li><a href="https://janismac.github.io/ControlChallenges/">Control challenges</a> is a set of (very fun) challenges that will allow you to test your ability to write basic controllers.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8319J1BEHwM">This talk</a> from FIRST Robotics team 254 is great for going over the basics of robot control and showing how we can improve on basic PID using simple interpolation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mathematics and Mechanics of Robotics &amp; Manipulation</strong> - This set of <a href="http://www.nathanratliff.com/pedagogy">notes by Nathan Ratliff</a> provides a great overview of many topics.  These <a href="https://ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/mavt/robotics-n-intelligent-systems/rsl-dam/documents/RobotDynamics2017/RD_HS2017script.pdf">notes on robot dynamics</a> from ETH are also great.</p>
<p><strong>Filtering</strong> - <a href="https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python">Kalman and Bayesian Filters in Python</a> is a great read with interactive notebook examples throughout. Good for building intuition on both Bayesian statistics as well as how filters for linear and nonlinear dynamical systems work. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter#Technical_description_and_context">wiki article on the Kalman Filter</a>  and <a href="https://www.bzarg.com/p/how-a-kalman-filter-works-in-pictures/">this blog post</a> is also well written if you want a shorter overview.</p>
<p><strong>Machine Learning &amp; Neural Networks</strong> - Focus less on the basics of machine learning than the application of neural networks as function approximators, which is their primary utility as perception and decision making modules in robotics. <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/">Michael Nielsen’s book</a> is my favourite resource in this regard. The <a href="https://www.deeplearningbook.org/">canonical deep learning book</a> is good reference but you don’t need to read the whole thing - pick out specific topics as required.</p>
<p><strong>Path and motion planning</strong> - Wiki has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_planning">decent overview</a> and details some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapidly-exploring_random_tree">basic</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">algorithms</a>. I haven’t read it but this book is apparently a <a href="http://lavalle.pl/planning/">good comprehensive guide</a>, and a course based on it is available <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dmitryb/courses/winter2019motionplanning/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong> &amp; more on controllers - Ben Recht’s “<a href="http://www.argmin.net/2018/06/25/outsider-rl/">outsider’s tour of RL</a>” provides a nice concise overview of many relevant concepts and ties them to classical control. <a href="https://openai.com/blog/spinning-up-in-deep-rl/">Spinning up in Deep Reinforcement Learning</a> is another great reference on the topic and exhibits many of the most important algorithms for research in the field.</p>
<h3 id="other-topics--resources">Other Topics &amp; Resources</h3>
<h4 id="books">Books</h4>
<ul>
<li>For beginners looking for a single book, <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-62533-1">Elements of Robotics</a> looks like an a great resource, and I’m only sorry it didn’t exist when I was starting. Provides self-contained introductions to many topics listed, pitched at a level high-schoolers / beginning university students can understand.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781846286414">Robotics: Modelling, Planning and Control</a> is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25609653">apparently</a> an all time classic covering many topics listed above..</li>
<li>Convex Optimisation is used in everything from simulators to controllers and beyond. I intend to read the <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/">canonical book</a> (free) at some point.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="courses">Courses</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Berkley <strong><a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/cs287-fa19/">Advanced Robotics</a></strong> course provides relatively self contained expositions of many topics in lecture format (don’t be scared off by the ‘advanced' moniker, it’s not that incomprehensible 😅.)</li>
<li>Russ Tedrake’s courses on <a href="http://underactuated.mit.edu/">Underactuated Robotics</a> and <a href="http://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/">Manipulation</a> seem really high quality (I haven’t gotten around to doing them myself yet).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="software">Software</h3>
<p>The space of software is so vast I couldn’t fit it all here… <a href="http://jslee02.github.io/awesome-robotics-libraries/">this list</a> provides a much more comprehensive overview in this regard. Some utilities I’ve found useful are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ros.org/install/">ROS</a> is very widely used many projects, worth picking up the basics.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/rllib.html">RLLib</a> has implementations of many reinforcement learning algorithms and support for distributed training.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="simulators">Simulators</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ARISE-Initiative/robosuite">Robosuite</a> is great for robot learning and has many richly-designed built-in environments.</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym">Isaac Gym</a> is recently released and provides extremely fast samples for reinforcement learning. It does this by running thousands of environments in parallel on the GPU (in almost all other sims physics is run on the CPU meaning you can only run one environment at once). You can train tasks in minutes that previously took hours.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="interesting-lines-of-work">Interesting Lines of Work</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain Randomisation</strong>  is highly underrated, and will likely get more important as we get faster simulators which are able to generalize better. <a href="https://openai.com/blog/learning-dexterity/">Learning Dexterity</a> from OpenAI is a very interesting paper, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRupIVknV-A">line</a> of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01728.pdf">work</a> around improving simulator parameter show two different and interesting takes on this powerful approach.</li>
<li><strong>Hierarchy</strong> in reinforcement learning has shown promising results in getting behaviour that generalises, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08399.pdf">DeepGait</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.15119">UniCon</a> paper being two interesting examples.</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03135">DexPilot</a> is a really cool low-cost system for teleoperation (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGE-deYfb8I">video</a>). Partially inspired <a href="https://allshire.org/teleop/">my piece on teleoperation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>
<p>Probably my weakest area… up for recommendations about specific great resources.
<a href="https://www.onshape.com/en/">OnShape</a> is a great resource for designing things and is great even with minimal CAD experience (even I am able to use it!)</p>
<p><a href="https://open-dynamic-robot-initiative.github.io/">Open Dynamic Robot initiative</a> has many robots that you can build with off-the-shelf components.</p>
<p>Others' recommendations -</p>
<p>In the HN thread, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25612255">contingencies had some tips</a> on how to get started yourself on the hardware side.</p>
<p>I’m told cadathons such as those <a href="https://blogs.solidworks.com/tech/2020/03/20-years-of-model-mania.html">organised by Solidworks</a> are a good way to get started. They also have a <a href="https://my.solidworks.com/training/path/14/cswa-exam-prep-course">series of lessons</a> on CADding fundamentals.</p>
<p><a href="https://grabcad.com/">GrabCAD</a> has big libries of pre-existing models you can use.</p>
<h3 id="business--higher-level-thinking">Business &amp; Higher-Level Thinking</h3>
<p>Very interesting side of things, however there is somewhat of a paucity of great resources (I’m pretty sure many in the space refrain from publishing their theses.) Please send if you have others I have missed!</p>
<ul>
<li>Michael Dempsey has some <a href="http://www.michaeldempsey.me/archive.html">great writing</a> on the business of autonomy.</li>
<li>Trucks VC has an interesting newsletter about <a href="https://www.trucks.vc/">autonomy</a>.</li>
<li>Jessy Lin wrote <a href="http://jessylin.com/blog/">some essays</a> on topic surrounding the economics and future of autonomy and HRI.</li>
<li><a href="https://rodneybrooks.com/blog/">Rodney Brooks</a> makes predictions in the robotics space on a yearly basis and has some good rigorous thinking on there.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.eetimes.com/">EE Times</a> has news and frequent opinion pieces in this space.</li>
<li>Though inexperienced, I sometimes try my best to <a href="https://allshire.org/">write on this topic</a> :)</li>
