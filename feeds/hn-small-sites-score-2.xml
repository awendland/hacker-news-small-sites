<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-3831">

<div>
<p>I have been engaging with WSB (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">/r/WallStreetBets</a>) since 2014.</p>
<p>Every regular person on WSB understands it’s a game. You can loose it all, make it big, sometimes both in the same day — it’s all a game. The most accurate assessment of WSB culture was clearly:</p>
<blockquote><p>Like 4chan found a Bloomberg Terminal.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the influx of new users may change the community, prior to January 15, 2021 the above was indeed an accurate description.</p>

<p>Honestly, this world feels like we are in a simulation. The company GameStop appears to be poised to bring down the entire financial system — stopping the game.</p>
<p>The infinity squeeze appears to be coming, what is an infinity squeeze you ask? It’s a really massive short squeeze:</p>
<blockquote><p>A short squeeze occurs when a stock or other asset jumps sharply higher, forcing traders who had bet that its price would fall, to buy it in order to forestall even greater losses. Their scramble to buy only adds to the upward pressure on the stock’s price.</p></blockquote>
<p>Short positions can technically lead to infinite losses. Simply put, if I open a short position for $10 and the share price drops 10%, I make $1. However, if the stock price increases say 10,000% I now owe $1,000.</p>
<p>In the case of GameStop, the situation appears dire. At one point the short positions were 140% of available shares of the market. This means that more shares were lent out than were available on float, i.e. shorts were resold / lent several times. At this point, several things are happening[<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/shortsaleclosed.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1</a>]:</p>
<ul>
<li>Those holding short positions are paying ridiculously high interest rates</li>
<li>If the short positions were forced to close, it would cause a major loss to multiple hedge funds (tens of billions total &amp; bankrupcies)</li>
<li>Due to the level of shorting, exiting the short positions would be excessively expensive and cause a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">short squeeze</a></li>
<li>There is less GameStop stock available for purchase</li>
<li>The price of GameStop stock is rising</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, it appears to me that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short holders cannot exit their positions without going bankrupt</li>
<li>Short holders are being hit by high interest rates</li>
<li>Closing other positions in the stock market should help them cover the interest rates</li>
<li>Best option for short position holders is is to wait &amp; pray the stock price drops</li>
<li>What happens if not enough people are willing to sell?</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, I believe all of this will suck all the liquidity from the stock market. Either those shorting suffer the loss and close their positions or wait as the stock continues to stay high… in either case hundreds of billions of dollars is leaving the market.</p>
<p>How did we get here?</p>
<h3>Infinity Squeeze – Short Positions</h3>
<p>There’s a lot to this story I’ll come back an fill in, but the gist is this — In mid-January 2021 GameStop was <em>extremely</em> shorted.</p>
<figure id="attachment_3832" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3832"><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17.png" alt="" width="424" height="417" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17.png 424w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17-300x295.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17.png 424w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17-300x295.png 300w"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3832">Courtesy of <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yahoo Finance</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The massive short position and didn’t go unnoticed, WSB had been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201222153244/https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussing it for months</a>. That being said, the massive spikes in purchases did not start until January 12:</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-05-15.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-05-15.png" alt="" width="916" height="411" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-05-15.png 916w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-05-15-300x135.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-05-15-768x345.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 916px) 100vw, 916px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-05-15.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-05-15.png 916w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-05-15-300x135.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-05-15-768x345.png 768w"></a></p>
<p>What happened at that time? The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210118091858/https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxeq23/gme_yolo_update_jan_14_2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YOLO updates</a> definitely started at that time and stocks started to rise. Once the stocks started to rise, I believe institutions and WSB itself started piling into GameStop. The stock started to move and if they could get in they could make a boat load. It’s important to remember WSB is often visited by hedge fund mangers, CEOs, day traders big and small, etc. It’s not always the little guy(s). When they piled in, the price started to rise further.</p>
<h3>Infinity Squeeze – Let’s Make Money</h3>
<p>As they purchased, I personally believe some short sellers managed to exit their positions (about 7m shares, per Yahoo Finance data)</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17-highlighted.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17-highlighted.png" alt="" width="424" height="417" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17-highlighted.png 424w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17-highlighted-300x295.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17-highlighted.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17-highlighted.png 424w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17-highlighted-300x295.png 300w"></a></p>
<p>What this indicates to me is that many of those holding short positions did not realize what was about to happen. They kept holding believing this was a classic pump-and-dump. Even WSB at the time didn’t not necessarily think about much <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210115023914/https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">besides making money</a>. I know I even purchased call options during this week, particularly when the new data came out January 15, 2021. To me, it became clear the stock was about to rocket.</p>
<h3>Infinity Squeeze – Let’s Stick it to the Man</h3>
<p>In light of the massive number of short position(s) open in January 15, 2021, WSB realized they could (a) make money and (b) stick it to the hedge funds. Frankly, WSB have been waging a war on short selling for years. With GameStop they had a company with relatively few shares&nbsp; in float (47m), a low market cap, basically something that purchases would have an outsized impact.</p>
<p>I’m not 100% sure this was intentional, but as people started buying and holding waiting for the squeeze the stock started to rise.The rising stock both led to discussions on news outlets and the stock started going viral on social media platforms outside of WSB – further raising the going rate for a share of GameStop.</p>
<p>Those holding short positions did not want to sell as they’d lose money, so they were searching for capital to cover their leveraged positions. Citadel and Point72 partners appears to have <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340" target="_blank" rel="noopener">come to at least one short sellers aid</a>. This showed they were weak and further emboldened the WSB folks – “Let’s make some money on the hedge funds behalf”</p>
<p>Purchases from Jan 19 to Jan 23, 2021 and the stock price increased exponentially as it went viral:</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-46-17.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-46-17.png" alt="" width="507" height="423" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-46-17.png 507w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-46-17-300x250.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 507px) 100vw, 507px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-46-17.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-46-17.png 507w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-46-17-300x250.png 300w"></a></p>
<h3>Infinity Squeeze – The Rebellion</h3>
<p>On January 27, 2021 across the board buying for GameStop was <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/money/2021/01/27/robinhood-td-ameritrade-other-brokerages-have-tech-problems-at-market-open/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restricted (along with multiple other stocks) across various trading platforms</a>. This effectively forced purchase volume lower and as users of these platforms could only sell it drove down the share price. This likely startled many GameStop shareholds and many liquidated their positions, letting the short sellers exit some of their positions. Through January 29, 2021 the ability to purchase in an unrestricted manner has not been restored.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>Personally, I’m of the opinion that there was not enough shares to go around and likely these platforms colluded to drive down the stock price. What’s more interesting is how few people sold. As of January 29, 2021 the price of a GameStop share was back at $325. This has led to some very VERY strong backlash and I know I’ll be joining a lawsuit at some point (if not filing my own), as this collusion cost me tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>One essay that particularly struck me was made on WSB: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210130034124/https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6omry/an_open_letter_to_melvin_capital_cnbc_boomers_and/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An Open Letter to Melvin Capital, CNBC, Boomers, and WSB</a></p>
<p>I recommend reading the comments on this essay to really get an under standing of what’s happening. Look at the charts. This is personal now. The market manipulation is obvious and people want revenge. For the current events, for 2008, for the entire corrupt system. They want to send a message. This is a protest.</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/vymOZEhH.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/vymOZEhH.jpg" alt="" width="474" height="567" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/vymOZEhH.jpg 474w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/vymOZEhH-251x300.jpg 251w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/vymOZEhH.jpg" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/vymOZEhH.jpg 474w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/vymOZEhH-251x300.jpg 251w"></a>Many retail investors will hold until the bitter end.</p>
<h3>Infinity Squeeze – End Game</h3>
<p>So what happens next?</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting on January 27-29 people were trying to transfer funds off Robinhood and the other platforms which disabled purchasing of GameStop shares.</li>
<li>Come the <span>first week of February</span> these assets will be again available and can be used to purchase GameStop shares.</li>
<li>Everyone saw much fewer shares being traded Friday</li>
<li>Everyone is talking with their families</li>
<li>People are going to purchase more GameStop shares &amp; hold</li>
<li>I expect many are going to pull their assets out of the stock market</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some unknowns, for instance have the short positions been closed? Have there been backroom deals to stave off the infinity squeeze?</p>
<p>If neither of those assumptions above hold, then what happens when the price rises further and there’s not enough shares for sale?</p>
<p>Hedge funds either bleed out as they pay the massive interest rates on holding those short positions or they will close their short positions causing an infinity squeeze (GameStop shares will be priced in the thousands). In either case hundreds of billions would likely leave the market.</p>
<h3>Conclusion – The Black Hole</h3>
<p>It’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nash Equilibrium</a>, essentially the share holders have every reason to ask the maximum amount they can get for a share of GameStop (i.e. make money). If for some reason these GameStop share holders are unwilling to sell at a low rate, then these hedge funds stand to lose hundreds of billions and will go bankrupt (slowly via interest payments or quickly via short squeeze). To try and pay for their debts, they’ll have to sell off market wide and the entire market collapses.</p>
<p>There are three ways to alleviate the issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>GameStop issues a massive number of new shares</li>
<li>Market manipulation (such as Robinood and friends only enabling selling – of course that didn’t work last time)</li>
<li>Government settles the matter by confiscating shares</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, I view government involvement as inevitable. They could settle everyone accounts fairly by giving everyone the current share price or what they bought it for, which every is higher. That being said, I suspect the more likely course of action is some flat rate $100/share or something to that effect. In either case, if they don’t get involved, I suspect the system really will collapse.</p>
<p>Unless of course, I am wrong. I am not a financial expert and nothing in this article should be taken as advice.</p>
<p>It’s completely possible I’m inaccurately reading the situation and those shorting GameStop have already exited their position(s) and GameStop is currently just in a classic bubble.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>In December last year I was able to sit for the coveted Certified Kubernetes Administrator and Certified Kubernetes Application Developer exams, and clear them both after some preparation.</p>

<p>This post is meant to share my exam experience, and all the materials used.</p>

<h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Read the exam questions carefully.</li>
  <li>Know imperative commands with <code>kubectl</code> like the back of your hand.</li>
  <li>Get comfortable looking things up on <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">kubernetes.io</a>.</li>
  <li>Build a bookmark folder in Chrome with relevant pages in kubernetes.io: you can use it during the exam!</li>
  <li>Seriously, read the damn questions carefully.</li>
  <li>Practice, practice and practice more.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-exams">The exams</h3>
<p>The exam for any of these Kubernetes certifications consists in solving a set of tasks, in a 2 hour terminal session.</p>

<p>There are 17 scenarios/questions for CKA, and 19 for CKAD.
The whole time, a proctor is watching and listening to you via webcam and microphone, and seeing the content of your screens (you can use more than one).
You communicate with the proctor only via a live chat application which is part of the PSI interface for the exam.</p>

<p>At the beginning they will ask you to show your ID, and then you will need to show them your working area from the webcam.
You will need to show your desk, and the room youâ€™re in.
Ensure that nothing written is visibile on the walls, and that you are the only person in the room.</p>

<p>Once the exam starts, the proctor may ask you every once in a while to show your hands to the webcam.
Donâ€™t bother asking questions about the exam itself, chances are the proctor really doesnâ€™t know about the subject and is only there to ensure you donâ€™t cheat.
You will need to share your screens for the proctor to see.
If you have 2 screens you can have the exam terminal on one, and the tab with k8s docs on the other.</p>

<p>In the terminal itself, you are given 6 or so k8s clusters, and you will need to switch between them.
You will always have a command printed at the beginning of each question, for easy copy paste:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>kubectl config use-context bla
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Make sure to <strong>use it</strong>!</p>

<p>Do not be fooled by the fact that you are able to search documentation during the exam.
The tasks that you will be given are often complex ones; time is of the essence! If you waste it while reading up docs you will not be able to complete all of the tasks in time.</p>

<p>The CKA ensures we have the skillset to setup and maintain a Kubernetes cluster, and manage it by using best practices.</p>

<p>As this exam is aimed at the Systems administrator/devops engineer, some linux as well as infrastructure skills are expected, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Knowledge of Linux OS.</li>
  <li>Being comfortable on the terminal.</li>
  <li>Knowing how to quickly edit files with text editors like Vi/Vim.</li>
  <li>Working knowledge of networking concepts.</li>
  <li>Working knowledge of TLS encryption concepts.</li>
  <li>Working knowledge of docker and containerization concepts.</li>
</ul>

<p>A deep dive is done on Kubernetes concepts and architecture during the indicated courses.</p>

<h3 id="study-plan">Study plan</h3>
<p>I began studying around the end of September 2020, by purchasing Mumshad Mannambethâ€™s excellent Udemy course for both CKA and CKAD, both on sale at the time.
That was a major source of material for me, as the courses included access to Katacoda/Kodekloud practice labs, and access to a Slack community where the trainer and other exam-takers participated.
The videos of Mumshadâ€™s course are very well done, each in the 5-10 minute range in length, slowly and clearly explaining each concept.
I would get to practice that concept later with labs provided by Mumshadâ€™s platform, KodeKloud.</p>

<p>The course itself has a section later on where we must manually install a Kubernetes cluster from scratch on a local vagrant setup, based on <a href="https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way">Kelsey Hightowerâ€™s excellent Kubernetes the Hard way project</a> (the original project leverages infrastructure on Google Cloud instead).
During the same course, we get to setup another cluster by using <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/">kubeadm</a>, which is part of the exam curriculum.</p>

<p>I would say that before taking the exam, I spent an average of about 1 hour every day watching the course videos and playing around with the labs (around 2 hours or more during weekends), for a couple months;
I took care of understanding every concept presented in the videos, and verified my knowledge with the labs and on a local cluster where I spent some practice time on, on top of study time.
I also re-did all of the course labs multiple times until I knew almost all of the answers by heart, and could get around them easily.</p>

<p>When something was unclear, the slack communities on kodekloud and kubernetes were always very helpful, always answering all of my questions, no matter how dumb I thought they were :)</p>

<p>I made sure to know <code>kubectl</code> imperative commands like the back of my hand, and building a library of bookmarks in my browser with relevant pages ready, as we are allowed an extra tab with the documentation during the exam.</p>

<p>After 2 months of that, I felt like I was ready.</p>

<h3 id="cka-exam-attempt-1">CKA Exam attempt #1</h3>
<p>I booked the exam for end of November, on a Saturday morning at 8AM, and sat for it in the guest room of my home.
The exam setup time with the proctor went pretty smoothly, and I was able to start on time.</p>

<p>I was not so confident by the end of the two hours. After 36 hours I got the news that I failed that attempt with 60% (minimum passing grade is 66%).
What went wrong for me was that I did not read/understand one specific question, which was related to ETCD backup and restore (part of the official curriculum); because of this, I ended up performing a task that effectively made one of the exam clusters unavailable.</p>

<p>Looking back, I am quite sure I invalidated several correct answers due to this mistake, which resulted in the score.
The method of how to backup/restore an ETCD cluster was also not entirely clear to me at the time, so I was not 100% sure of what I was doing.</p>

<p>Clearly I overestimated my knowledge, and depended too much on memorizing certain commands on one study platform, instead of being completely confident in all concepts and commands applied.</p>

<h3 id="new-study-plan">New study plan</h3>
<p>Enter <a href="https://killer.sh/">killer.sh</a>.
A CKA/CKAD/CKS exam simulator created by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimwuestkamp/">Kim Wuestkampf</a>.</p>

<p>For CKA, the simulator offered 25 HARD questions to be done in 2 hours, with guided and comprehensive answers made available after the alotted time.
Such answers also offered different ways to do things, for maximized learning experience.</p>

<p>This alternative platform helped a lot in understanding things that werenâ€™t clear to me, and to practice more varied scenarios.
Completing a killer.sh simulator in under two hours gives good confidence in being able to tackle the real exam.</p>

<h3 id="cka-exam-attempt-2">CKA Exam attempt #2</h3>
<p>I booked the exam one week after getting the results of the previous one.
The exam setup experience was again pretty smooth and I was up and ready to go 10 minutes before the start time.</p>

<p>I felt pretty confident the whole time and finished up all of the questions around 1 hour and 10 minutes later.</p>

<p>The results came around 36 hours after the end of the exam, in an email.
Score was a pass with 85% :)!
As it is not possible to see the actual answers, to this day I donâ€™t really donâ€™t know what I got wrong, but am still satisfied with the result.</p>

<h2 id="ckad">CKAD</h2>
<p>I took the CKAD exam while the knowledge of the previous training was still fresh, so I felt like I had an easier time with this one.</p>

<h3 id="objectives-1">Objectives</h3>
<p>To be able to efficiently design and implement working kubernetes production workloads.</p>

<h3 id="requirements-1">Requirements</h3>
<p>Not so much system administration knowledge, but more focus on k8s concepts, architecture and best practices.
Actual programming experience is not required for the exam (although in â€œreal lifeâ€� it will probably not hurt either ;) ).</p>

<h3 id="study-plan-1">Study plan</h3>
<p>I booked the CKAD exam roughly for 3 weeks after passing the CKA.
In those 3 weeks, I took my time and spent again around 30min to 1 hour a day on Mumshadâ€™s course and labs.</p>

<p>When exam time was closer, I booked two sessions on killer.sh and focused on practicing there.
I challenged myself by finishing all the questions under 2 hours, and afterwards going through slowly through the answers section on the site.
This was very helpful and allowed me to learn different, more effective approaches.</p>

<h3 id="ckad-exam-attempt-1">CKAD Exam attempt #1</h3>
<p>I once again took the exam from the guest room in my home.</p>

<p>This time the exam setup with the proctor wasnâ€™t so smooth.
The connection from my end and theirs wasnâ€™t great, and we kept getting disconnected from the session. Webcam images werenâ€™t so clear so they had to ask me to show identification more than once. It took about 40 minutes to start the actual exam, and that did get me a bit stressed out.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I felt comfortable and finished all the questions in about 1 hour and a half.
36 hours later, I got the email with the good news of a pass with 83%.
Doing the CKA before really helped with the whole experience.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>From my experience, I would say that the hardest exam was the one for CKA, as it didnâ€™t just go through the new knowledge of k8s concepts, but also on existing understanding of systems administration.
I felt like doing CKAD immediately afterwards made it a bit easier, as the knowledge was still fresh.</p>

<p>The CKAD questions however were much more time consuming, in the sense that one task would require to perform several smaller tasks quickly, building a workload and making sure everything works together.</p>

<p>All in all, I feel the time trying to tackle these certifications was well spent; since the exams are performance based, they are fair in what they expect …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Google recently blocked the Matrix based chat app Element from the Play Store sighting sexual content on the platform. It’s really hard to define the explanation because WhatsApp, Telegram users of other chat clients also share the same content. Telegram is also known to host groups sharing pirated content as well.</p>
<p>This post is not going to bash Google on the ban of Element. It’s about how Google can win the chat app </p>
<p>Chat apps have been hot for the past couple of years. When I initially Tweeted that chat apps are the new social network, 6-7 years ago (I wish if I can find that tweet, but I can’t seem to find it, maybe it was lost when I deleted all my tweets sometime ago), I remember how people laughed replying how can that even possible, but now as Facebook is on the decline, chat apps are the goto place to hang out with friends.</p>
<p>Google currently doesn’t have a house in the chat app race. Google tried with several chat applications, like Ello, Hangout, Google Talk, none of them took off. Even though Ello looked promising, and was integrated into Android, people never jumped the ship to Ello. And since Google now allowing several chat/video platforms like Hangout, Meet etc, Google’s direction in communication platform seems big vague.</p>
<p>Google also has had a poor history with social networking, Google does not have social in their DNA, it feels like they are engineering, technology first in their approach, while Facebook feels more social first than anything else.</p>
<p>However, after seeing this ban I feel what Google should have a horse in the chat app race, and it should be a matrix/element based chat client. Allow me to explain,</p>
<p>Google should embrace an open protocol like Matrix and build a chat client on top of it, yes it’s against their pattern of hoarding data, and usage of open protocol.</p>
<p>But Google was able to win the email, the email protocol is an open protocol, anyone can implement it, anyone can use any client they want, but still Google was able to create the most popular email service available out their, and even monetise it. </p>
<p>Before Google started gmail, services like hotmail only allowed 200mb of storage, I remember Yahoo deleting my email account because I didn’t login for 6 months (I was still schooling at that time, and didn’t use email much), and not to mention Yahoo, and hotmail had atrocious ads on their email service. But google changed all that, they gave a better UI, more storage, and even a better ad experience.</p>
<p>So what makes then incapable of using an open chat protocol and build a great experience around it? With engineers and money to back a project like that Google can build a good chat service around an open chat protocol.</p>
<p>Even ads might not be a thing, Google can still provide enterprise chat service to organisations, powered by their data servers. They can even keep their source closed if they want to, like they are doing with Gmail, but an open source client would be great.</p>
<p>And Google’s backing for a open chat platform will make people interested about it, and even more people will use it just because it’s from Google. People will be able to use their own clients like Element, or another Matrix client, still and users can build a network greater than a centralised chat service, like we use gmail in our mail app to chat with someone else with a different email provider. </p>
<p>And the bottom line is Facebook, Telegram, Signal, and other chat platforms are going on a race without Google, all providing a centralised experience, with the exception of Signal, who is providing a semi-centralised experience. So even if you can’t beat them, why not try to destroy them all with an open chat protocol?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Shell script and AWK are very complementary languages.  AWK was designed from
its very beginnings at Bell Labs as a pattern-action language for short
programs, ideally one or two lines long.  It was intended to be used on the
Unix shell interactive command line, or in shell scripts.  Its feature set
filled out some functionality that shell script at the time lacked, and often
still lacks, as is the case with floating point numbers; it thereby
(indirectly) brings much of the C language’s expressive power to the shell.</p>

<p>It’s therefore both common and reasonable to see AWK one-liners in shell
scripts for data processing where doing the same in shell is unwieldy or
impossible, especially when floating point operations or data delimiting are
involved.  While AWK’s full power is in general tragically underused, most
shell script users and developers know about one of its most useful properties:
selecting a single column from whitespace-delimited data.  Sometimes,
<a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cut.1p.html"><code>cut(1)</code></a> doesn’t, uh, cut it.</p>

<p>In order for one language to cooperate with another usefully via embedded
programs in this way, data of some sort needs to be passed between them at
runtime, and here there are a few traps with syntax that may catch out unwary
shell programmers.  We’ll go through a simple example showing the problems, and
demonstrate a few potential solutions.</p>

<h2>Easy: Fixed data</h2>

<p>Embedded AWK programs in shell scripts work great when you already know
<em>before</em> runtime what you want your patterns for the pattern-action pairs to
be.  Suppose our company has a vendor-supplied program that returns temperature
sensor data for the server room, and we want to run some commands for any and
all rows registering over a certain threshold temperature.  The output for the
existing <code>server-room-temps</code> command might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ server-room-temps
ID  Location    Temperature_C
1   hot_aisle_1 27.9
2   hot_aisle_2 30.3
3   cold_aisle_1    26.0
4   cold_aisle_2    25.2
5   outer       23.9
</code></pre>

<p>The task for the monitoring script is simple: get a list of all the locations
where the temperature is above 28°C.  If there are any such locations, we need
to email the administrator the full list.  Easy!  It looks like every
introductory AWK example you’ve ever seen—it could be straight out of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AWK-Programming-Language-Alfred-Aho/dp/020107981X">the
book</a>.  Let’s type it up on the shell to test it:</p>

<pre><code>$ server-room-temps | awk 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; 28 {print $2}'
hot_aisle_2
</code></pre>

<p>That looks good.  The script might end up looking something like this:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
alerts=/var/cache/temps/alerts
server-room-temps |
    awk 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; 28 {print $2}' &gt; "$alerts" || exit
if [ -s "$alerts" ] ; then
    mail -s 'Temperature alert' sysadmin &lt; "$alerts"
fi
</code></pre>

<p>So, after writing the alerts data file, we test if with <code>[ -s ... ]</code> to see
whether it’s got any data in it.  If it does, we send it all to the
administrator with <code>mail(1)</code>.  Done!</p>

<p>We set that running every few minutes with <code>cron(8)</code> or <code>systemd.timer(5)</code>, and
we have a nice stop-gap solution until the lazy systems administrator gets
around to fixing the Nagios server.  He’s probably just off playing
<a href="https://www.adom.de/home/index.html">ADOM</a> again…</p>

<h2>Hard: runtime data</h2>

<p>A few weeks later, our sysadmin still hasn’t got the Nagios server running,
because his high elf wizard is about to hit level 50, and there’s a new request
from the boss: can we adjust the script so that it accepts the cutoff
temperature data as an argument, and other departments can use it?  Sure, why
not.  Let’s mock that up, with a threshold of, let’s say, 25.5°C.</p>

<pre><code>$ server-room-temps &gt; test-data
$ threshold=25.5
$ awk 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; $threshold {print $2}' test-data
hot_aisle_1
hot_aisle_2
</code></pre>

<p>Wait, that’s not right.  There are <em>three</em> lines with temperatures over 25.5°C,
not two.  Where’s <code>cold_aisle_1</code>?</p>

<p>Looking at the code more carefully, you realize that you assumed your shell
variable would be accessible from within the AWK program, when of course, it
isn’t; AWK’s variables are independent of shell variables.  You don’t know why
the hell it’s showing those two rows, though…</p>

<p>Maybe we need double quotes?</p>

<pre><code>$ awk "NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; $threshold {print $2}" test-data
awk: cmd. line:1: NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp;  &gt; 25.5 {print}
awk: cmd. line:1:            ^ syntax error
</code></pre>

<p>Hmm.  Nope.  Maybe we need to expand the variable inside the quotes?</p>

<pre><code>$ awk 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; "$threshold" {print $2}' test-data
hot-aisle-1
hot-aisle-2
cold-aisle-1
cold-aisle-2
outer
</code></pre>

<p>That’s not right, either.  It seems to have printed <em>all</em> the locations, as if
it didn’t test the threshold at all.</p>

<p>Maybe it should be <em>outside</em> the single quotes?</p>

<pre><code>$ awk 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; '$threshold' {print $2}' test-data
hot-aisle-1
hot-aisle-2
cold-aisle-1
</code></pre>

<p>The results look right, now … ah, but wait, we still need to <a href="https://mywiki.wooledge.org/Quotes">quote it to
stop spaces expanding</a>…</p>

<pre><code>$ awk 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; '"$threshold"' {print $2}' test-data
hot-aisle-1
hot-aisle-2
cold-aisle-1
</code></pre>

<p>Cool, that works.  Let’s submit it to the security team and go to lunch.</p>

<h3>Caught out</h3>

<p>To your surprise, the script is rejected.  The security officer says you have
an unescaped variable that allows arbitrary code execution.  What?  Where?
It’s just AWK, not SQL…!</p>

<p>To your horror, the security officer demonstrates:</p>

<pre><code>$ threshold='0;{system("echo rm -fr /*");exit}'
$ echo 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; '"$threshold"' {print $2}'
NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; 0;{system("echo rm -fr /*");exit} {print $2}
$ awk 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; '"$threshold"' {print $2}' test-data
rm -fr /bin /boot /dev /etc /home /initrd.img ...
</code></pre>

<p>Oh, hell… if that were installed, and someone were able to set <code>threshold</code> to
an arbitrary value, they could execute <em>any</em> AWK code, and thereby shell
script, that they wanted to.  It’s <em>AWK injection</em>!  How embarrassing—good
thing that was never going to run as <code>root</code> (…right?)  Back to the drawing
board …</p>

<h3>Validating the data</h3>

<p>One approach that might come readily to mind is to ensure that no unexpected
characters appear in the value.  We could use a <code>case</code> statement before
interpolating the variable into the AWK program to check it contains no
characters outside digits and a decimal:</p>

<pre><code>case $threshold in
    *[!0-9.]*) exit 2 ;;
esac
</code></pre>

<p>That works just fine, and it’s appropriate to do some data validation at the
opening of the script, anyway.  It’s certainly better than leaving it as it
was.  But we <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">learned this lesson</a> with PHP in the 90s; you don’t just
filter on characters, or slap in some backslashes—that’s missing the point.
Ideally, we need to safely pass the data into the AWK process <em>without</em> ever
parsing it as AWK code, sanitized or nay, so the situation doesn’t arise in the
first place.</p>

<h3>Environment variables</h3>

<p>The shell and your embedded AWK program may not share the shell’s local
variables, but they <em>do</em> share environment variables, accessible in AWK’s
<code>ENVIRON</code> array.  So, passing the threshold in as an environment variable
works:</p>

<pre><code>$ THRESHOLD=25.5
$ export THRESHOLD
$ awk 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; ENVIRON["THRESHOLD"] {print $2}' test-data
hot-aisle-1
hot-aisle-2
cold-aisle-1
</code></pre>

<p>Or, to be a little cleaner:</p>

<pre><code>$ THRESHOLD=25.5 \
    awk 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; ENVIRON["THRESHOLD"] {print $2}' test-data
hot-aisle-1
hot-aisle-2
cold-aisle-1
</code></pre>

<p>This is already much better.  AWK will parse our data <em>only</em> as a variable, and
won’t try to execute anything within it.  The only snag with this method is
picking a name; make sure that you don’t overwrite another, more important
environment variable, like <code>PATH</code>, or <code>LANG</code>…</p>

<h3>Another argument</h3>

<p>Passing the data as another <em>argument</em> and then reading it out of the <code>ARGV</code>
array works, too:</p>

<pre><code>$ awk 'BEGIN{ARGC--} NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; ARGV[2] {print $2}' test-data 25.5
</code></pre>

<p>This method is also safe from arbitrary code execution, but it’s still somewhat
awkward because it requires us to decrease the argument count <code>ARGC</code> by one so
that AWK doesn’t try to process a file named “25.5” and end up upset when it’s
not there.  AWK arguments can mean whatever you need them to mean, but unless
told otherwise, AWK generally assumes they are filenames, and will attempt to
iterate through them for lines of data to chew on.</p>

<p>Here’s another way that’s very similar; we read the threshold from the second
argument, and then blank it out in the <code>ARGV</code> array:</p>

<pre><code>$ awk 'BEGIN{threshold=ARGV[2];ARGV[2]=""}
    NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; threshold {print $2}' test-data 25.5
</code></pre>

<p>AWK won’t treat the second argument as a filename, because it’s blank by the
time it processes it.</p>

<h3>Pre-assigned variables</h3>

<p>There are two lesser-known syntaxes for passing data into AWK that allow you
safely to assign variables at runtime.  The first is to use the <code>-v</code> option:</p>

<pre><code>$ awk -v threshold="$threshold" \
    'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; threshold {print $2}' \
    test-data
</code></pre>

<p>Another, perhaps even more obscure, is to set them as arguments before the
filename data, using the <code>var=value</code> syntax:</p>

<pre><code>$ awk 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; threshold {print $2}' \
    threshold="$threshold" test-data
</code></pre>

<p>Note that in both cases, we still <em>quote</em> the <code>$threshold</code> expansion; this is
because the shell is expanding the value before we pass it in.</p>

<p>The difference between these two syntaxes is when the variable assignment
occurs.  With <code>-v</code>, the assignment happens straight away, before reading any
data from the input sources, as if it were in the <code>BEGIN</code> block of the program.
With the argument form, it happens when the program’s data processing reaches
that argument.  The upshot of that is that you could test several files with
several different temperatures in one hit, if you wanted to:</p>

<pre><code>$ awk 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; threshold {print $2}' \
    threshold=25.5 test-data-1 threshold=26.0 test-data-2
</code></pre>

<p>Both of these assignment syntaxes are standardized in <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/awk.1p.html">POSIX <code>awk</code></a>.</p>

<p>These are my preferred methods for passing runtime data; they require no
argument count munging, avoid the possibility of trampling on existing
environment variables, use AWK’s own variable and expression syntax, and most
importantly, the chances of anyone reading the script being able to grasp
what’s going on are higher.  You can thereby avoid a mess of quoting and
back-ticking that often plagues these sorts of embedded programs.</p>

<h2>Safety not guaranteed</h2>

Google’s ad blocker would only block ads that were deemed unacceptable by the <a href="http://www.thedrum.com/news/2016/09/16/procter-gamble-unilever-google-facebook-and-more-form-coalition-better-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://www.thedrum.com/news/2016/09/16/procter-gamble-unilever-google-facebook-and-more-form-coalition-better-ads">Coalition For Better Ads</a>, effectively allowing the company to use its dominant web browser to strengthen its already dominant advertising business.</p><p id="d68f">Even after making this desperate and <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/04/20/google-ad-blocker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://fortune.com/2017/04/20/google-ad-blocker/">legally questionable</a> move, it would quickly become clear to Google that even though ads were getting better, ad blocking numbers would <a href="http://adage.com/article/digital/ad-blocking-increases-consumers-improving/305978/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://adage.com/article/digital/ad-blocking-increases-consumers-improving/305978/">continue to rise</a>. Google had given even more people a small taste of what an ad-free internet experience could look like.</p><p id="5e12"><strong>The company discovered that it wasn’t just annoying ads that people didn’t like; it was ads in general.</strong></p></div><div><p id="5603">A key platform where Google served ads was YouTube, which it bought in 2006 and quickly turned into one of its biggest entities. But even with a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/21/youtube-stats_n_2922543.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/21/youtube-stats_n_2922543.html">sixth of the world</a> visiting this video-sharing behemoth every month, YouTube <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/viewers-dont-add-up-to-profit-for-youtube-1424897967" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/viewers-dont-add-up-to-profit-for-youtube-1424897967">never became profitable</a>. In an attempt to combat the effect of ad blockers, YouTube launched an ad-free subscription model in late 2015, but the subscription numbers were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13498470/youtube-red-subscribers-video-content-music" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13498470/youtube-red-subscribers-video-content-music">underwhelming</a>.</p><p id="7afb">YouTube’s already insurmountable problems multiplied in early 2017 as advertisers <a href="http://www.fiercepharma.com/marketing/google-scrambling-for-solutions-after-advertiser-departures-youtube" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://www.fiercepharma.com/marketing/google-scrambling-for-solutions-after-advertiser-departures-youtube">began to pull out amid ad placement controversies</a>, and huge revenue generators began to <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/pewdiepie-starts-weekly-twitch-show-uploads-youtube-over-party-video-2523797" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://www.ibtimes.com/pewdiepie-starts-weekly-twitch-show-uploads-youtube-over-party-video-2523797">leave the site</a>.</p><p id="f0ab">Even those who weren’t blocking ads had trained themselves to ignore them entirely. Researchers dubbed this phenomenon “<a href="http://www.tobiipro.com/fields-of-use/marketing-consumer-research/advertising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://www.tobiipro.com/fields-of-use/marketing-consumer-research/advertising/">banner blindness</a>”. The average banner ad was clicked on by a dismal <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-gb/planning-tool/display-benchmarks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-gb/planning-tool/display-benchmarks/">0.06% of viewers</a>, and of those clicks, roughly <a href="http://www.goldspotmedia.com/fat-finger-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://www.goldspotmedia.com/fat-finger-report/">50% were accidental</a>.</p><p id="c67f">Research showed that <a href="https://www.bannersnack.com/blog/build-trust-display-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://www.bannersnack.com/blog/build-trust-display-ads/">54% of users</a> reported a lack of trust as their reason for not clicking banner ads and 33% found them completely <a href="http://downloads.pagefair.com/reports/adblocking_goes_mainstream_2014_report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://downloads.pagefair.com/reports/adblocking_goes_mainstream_2014_report.pdf">intolerable</a>. These figures painted a pretty grim picture for the sustainability of online advertising, but especially for Google’s position within the industry.</p><blockquote id="8a50"><p>Google’s mighty engine had started to&nbsp;sputter.</p></blockquote><h3 id="def0">A chance to pivot, and how Google missed&nbsp;it</h3><p id="ec19">If losing a major portion of their audience and annoying the rest wasn’t bad enough, Google also failed to get ahead of one of the biggest shifts in technology’s history. They recognized the importance of artificial intelligence but their approach missed the mark. Since Google’s search pillar had become unstable, a lot was riding on the company’s strategy for artificial intelligence.</p><blockquote id="2408"><p>“We will move from mobile first to an AI first&nbsp;world.”</p></blockquote><p id="814d">Google’s then-CEO Sundar Pichai <a href="https://blog.google/topics/inside-google/this-years-founders-letter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://blog.google/topics/inside-google/this-years-founders-letter/">famously predicted</a> in 2016 that “<em>the next big step will be for the very concept of the ‘device’ to fade away” </em>and that<em> “over time, the computer itself — whatever its form factor — will be an intelligent assistant helping you through your day. We will move from mobile first to an AI first world.”</em></p><p id="6d2f">Google’s ability to acknowledge the coming trend and still fail to land in front of it reminded many observers of its catastrophic failures in the booming industries of social media and instant messaging.</p><figure id="179f"><div></div><figcaption>Sundar Pichai wondering how to monetize a virtual assistant</figcaption></figure><h3 id="deb3">Google vs.&nbsp;Amazon</h3><p id="d2e7">Meanwhile, in 2014, Amazon released a product called Amazon Echo, a small speaker that could sit in your home and answer questions, perform tasks, and buy things online for you. The Echo was a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-echo-success-could-spell-big-trouble-for-google-2017-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-echo-success-could-spell-big-trouble-for-google-2017-1">smash success</a>. Google released its copycat product, Google Home, two years later, but it was already <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/22/home-battleground-amazon-google-voice-technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/22/home-battleground-amazon-google-voice-technology">too late to catch up</a>, and had no clear revenue strategy.</p><p id="a3f9">Alexa — the assistant that lived inside the Echo — on the other hand, was quickly integrated into several products and services, and its monetization model was clear, viable, and most importantly future-friendly. The Echo made it easy to order products through Amazon, and every time someone used an Echo to purchase something, Amazon made money.</p><p id="dde3">Google extended the reach of their virtual assistant by building it into Android, but doing so still didn’t provide an answer for how the technology would generate enough revenue to sustain Google’s expanding repertoire of expensive innovations.</p><p id="c590">Google’s ads relied on screens, yet voice interaction subverted screens entirely. Google briefly tried playing audio ads with the Google Home, but consumers were <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/17/google-home-ads-bad-precedent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/17/google-home-ads-bad-precedent/">far from receptive</a>.

But in a world where people despised ads, Google’s business model was not innovation-friendly, and they missed several opportunities to pivot, ultimately rendering their numerous grand and ambitious projects unsustainable.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1565793939038_266584"><div><p>The human genome is an incredible thing. Six billion letters of DNA – that’s more than two metres of DNA in every single cell – containing all the genes that enable a single cell to grow into a fully-formed, fully functioning person. </p><p>So when the first draft sequence of the human genome was published in 2001, researchers around the world were eager to discover exactly how many genes must be packed into our glorious genome.</p><p>The answer was a big surprise.</p><p>Many people thought that it must take at least a hundred thousand genes to make a human – with a sweepstake on offer to the person who made the closest guess to the final number – yet the human genome turns out to contain only 20,000 or so genes (roughly the same number of genes as a fruit fly or nematode worm).</p><p>This seems remarkably low to make an organism with as much dazzling complexity as a human being.  Even more perplexingly, the genes that we do have make up less than two per cent of all that DNA. So what’s the rest?</p><p>To find out, we need to go back in time to 1972.</p><p>That’s when geneticist Susumu Ohno published a paper entitled “So much ‘junk’ DNA in our genome” in an obscure scientific journal, the Brookhaven Symposia in Biology, in which he mused upon a mathematical problem.</p><p>By that point, scientists had already measured how much DNA was present in bacteria and figured out that these little bugs must contain a few thousand genes. They also knew that a single human cell contained at least 750 times as much DNA.</p><p>Ohno did a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation – if the number of genes in any genome was directly proportional to the amount of DNA, then humans should have….. three million genes, more or less.</p><p>But, as he pointed out in his paper, ‘lowly lungfish and salamanders’ can have 36 times more DNA in their cells than is present in ours, suggesting that they should have…. A hundred million genes.</p><p>He didn’t believe it. What would a slimy salamander need with all those genes? Therefore, Ohno concluded, the vast majority of the human genome must be junk. And, correspondingly, varying proportions of other organisms’ genomes must be junk too. And once the Human Genome project revealed that the vast majority of our genome doesn’t seem to contain actual genes, it looked like he was right.</p><p>The function of this remaining 98% of the human genome - sometimes called ‘junk DNA’ but more accurately referred to as non-coding DNA – is a hotly debated topic in the world of genetics, fought out within the dignified pages of journals and the more febrile atmosphere of scientific conferences.</p><p>An absolutely massive study published in 2012, known as ENCODE, suggested that around 80% of the human genome was functional – namely, that it did something important for the proper functioning of our cells and bodies. Just under 10 per cent is thought to be control switches responsible for turning genes on and off at the right time and in the right place, while the rest does all manner of things, from producing little pieces of RNA that control gene activity to organising the three-dimensional structure of the DNA inside a cell.</p><p>Others were unconvinced. For example, evolutionary geneticist Chris Ponting suggests that less than 10% of the human genome is functional, based on how much has been strongly preserved through evolutionary time and must therefore be very important.</p><p>It’s against this backdrop we bring in the Onion Test, devised by T. Ryan Gregory and posted on his blog in April 2007. It was later formalised as a scientific paper that he published in 2014, together with Alexander Palazzo.</p><p>Put simply, the Onion Test goes like this.</p><p>The onion in your vegetable drawer has five times more DNA than humans. So if you’re a researcher who thinks that non-coding DNA has a particular function in the genome, can you explain why an onion needs about five times more of it than a human to do the same thing?</p><p>Unpeeling this idea a bit further, Gregory points out that some species of onions have around double the amount of DNA as your regular onions, while others have less than half. Yet they’re pretty much the same and have the same number of genes, so why would they need double or half the amount of non-coding DNA?</p><p>This argument works for all kinds of species, from Ohno’s lowly salamanders with their giant genomes containing roughly the same set of genes as other vertebrates, including humans, to the biggest genome discovered to date, which belongs to the Japanese canopy flower, Paris Japonica, with around 150 time more DNA in its genome than a human.</p><p>Then there’s the poisonous Fugu pufferfish – often eaten (very carefully!) as a delicacy in Japan.  They have remarkably compact genomes, roughly an eighth of the size of our own yet containing almost exactly the same repertoire of genes and very little junk.</p><p>Perhaps our obsession with finding function for all the junk in our genome comes from a desire to think that humans are something special in the biological world – certainly more special than an onion.</p><p> But in the words of the grumpy geneticist Dan Graur, who I interviewed for my book Herding Hemingway’s Cats in which I dig into the junk in our genetic trunk,  “Either you have to assume that humans are the pinnacle of creation –that everything is functional and those organisms with more DNA than us have junk DNA but we don’t. Or you have to assume that humans are a regular organism that has junk DNA just like everything else.”</p><p><strong>Further reading:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/2007/04/onion-test/" target="_blank">T.

      <div><p>Hi all,</p><p>At 2021-01-29 at 21:35 UTC Google suspended Element from the Play Store without warning or notification. &nbsp;We submitted an appeal asking for clarification at 23:18, and at 05:31 received a generic update from the Google Play Policy team citing that the app has been removed due to content which contravenes their terms of use, and asking us to “make the necessary changes to [our] app” and “upload a new app using a new package name and a new app name”.</p><p>As of 11:44 UTC we’ve submitted a detailed appeal to reiterate that Element is a generic chat app for connecting to the global Matrix communication network, just as Chrome is a generic web browser for connecting to the Web - and just as Google does not control the content on the Web, Element does not control the content on Matrix.</p><p>We have also explained that the Matrix servers that we <em>do</em> run as Element (including the default Matrix.org homeserver, which we run on behalf of <a href="https://matrix.org/foundation">The Matrix.org Foundation</a>) have <a href="https://matrix.org/legal/terms-and-conditions#6-play-nice-clauses">strict Terms of Use</a> which we actively enforce. We abhor abuse, and Element is not an app that caters to abusive content.</p><p>In order to enforce our terms of use on the Matrix servers we run as Element, we have a formal Trust and Safety team hired full-time who are dedicated to investigating and tracking abuse reports sent to <a href="https://element.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e48586919781a4898590968d9cca8b9683"><span data-cfemail="d3b2b1a6a0b693beb2a7a1baabfdbca1b4">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> or reported from the app. &nbsp;The team takes appropriate action on a ticket by ticket basis - deactivating abusive accounts and blocking chatrooms from our servers which contravene our terms of use, and building tooling to help enforce the terms of use on the servers we run.</p><p>Managing abuse is an ongoing activity, and <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/element-whatsapp-exodus/">Matrix is expanding massively at the moment</a>. We are expanding Element’s Trust and Safety team to match that growth, focusing on improving our anti-abuse mechanisms, and we are also constantly expanding the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/guides/moderation/">moderation tools</a> we provide to the community.</p><p>Meanwhile, we’re also continuing to work on decentralised reputation as a <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors/">scalable solution to empower other users to combat abuse</a> for the wider Matrix network - effectively bringing control back to users and empowering communities to remain safe online.</p><p>Element and Matrix are used by the French, German, UK and US governments, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/01/29/this-week-in-matrix-2021-01-29#dept-of-status-of-matrix-%EF%B8%8F">countless universities</a>, thousands of businesses and millions of people across the world - we can only apologise for the disruption caused by the app disappearing like this.</p><p>We’re currently waiting for an update to Google and will keep this blog post updated as the situation develops. &nbsp;We look forward to resolving the problem and getting the app back in the store shortly.</p><p>-- The Element Team</p><p>Update: reminder that in the interim you can download a (slightly outdated) version of Element Android from F-Droid at <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/im.vector.app/">https://f-droid.org/en/packages/im.vector.app</a>. &nbsp;We're also looking into running our own F-Droid repository going forwards so the most recent build is always available there.</p><p>UPDATE: At 2021-01-30 23:17 UTC we received a call from a VP at Google who apologised for the bad communication from Google and explained the situation, which related to some extremely abusive content which was accessible on the default matrix.org homeserver. &nbsp;Our Trust and Safety team had already identified and acted on this content to enforce the server's terms of use, and so we've explained how Element and Matrix works, established a channel for communication over any future moderation concerns, and expect the app to be restored shortly.</p><p>UPDATE: The app is restored as of 2021-01-31 00:30 UTC. &nbsp;Huge thanks to everyone for your patience and support while we sorted this out, and to the wider Element team who spent their Saturday on this. &nbsp;Thanks also to Google for being transparent and apologetic and the rapid resolution once we'd established contact.</p></div>

<p><strong>Never use a lousy schematic editor again!</strong>
SKiDL is a simple module that lets you describe electronic circuits using Python.
The resulting Python program outputs a netlist that a PCB layout tool uses to
create a finished circuit board.</p>

<p>SKiDL is a module that allows you to compactly describe the interconnection of 
electronic circuits and components using Python.
The resulting Python program performs electrical rules checking
for common mistakes and outputs a netlist that serves as input to
a PCB layout tool.</p>

<p>First, let’s look at a “normal” design flow in <a href="https://kicad-pcb.org/">KiCad</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://xesscorp.github.io/skidl/docs/_site/images/schematic-process-flow.png" alt="Schematic-based PCB design flow"></p>

<p>Here, you start off in a <em>schematic editor</em> (for KiCad, that’s EESCHEMA) and
draw a schematic. From that, EESCHEMA generates
a <em>netlist file</em> that lists what components are used and how their pins are interconnected.
Then you’ll use a <em>PCB layout tool</em> (like KiCad’s PCBNEW) to arrange the part footprints
and draw the wire traces that connect the pins as specified in the netlist.
Once that is done, PCBNEW outputs a set of <em>Gerber files</em> that are sent to a
<em>PCB fabricator</em> who will create a physical PCB and ship it to you.
Then you’ll post a picture of them on Twitter and promptly dump them
in a drawer for a few years because you got bored with the project.</p>

<p>In the SKiDL-based design flow, you use a <em>text editor</em> to create a <em>Python code file</em>
that employs the SKiDL library to describe interconnections of components.
This code file is executed by a <em>Python interpreter</em> and a netlist file is output.
From there, the design flow is identical to the schematic-based one
(including dumping the PCBs in a drawer).</p>

<p><img src="https://xesscorp.github.io/skidl/docs/_site/images/skidl-process-flow.png" alt="Schematic-based PCB design flow"></p>

<p>So, why would you <em>want</em> to use SKiDL?
Here are some of the features SKiDL brings to electronic design:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Requires only a text editor and Python.</li>
  <li>Has a powerful, flexible syntax (because it <em>is</em> Python).</li>
  <li>Permits compact descriptions of electronic circuits (think about <em>not</em> tracing
signals through a multi-page schematic).</li>
  <li>Allows textual descriptions of electronic circuits (think about using 
<code>diff</code> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">git</a> for circuits).</li>
  <li>Performs electrical rules checking (ERC) for common mistakes (e.g., unconnected device I/O pins).</li>
  <li>Supports linear / hierarchical / mixed descriptions of electronic designs.</li>
  <li>Fosters design reuse (think about using <a href="https://xesscorp.github.io/skidl/docs/_site/pypi.org">PyPi</a> and <a href="https://xesscorp.github.io/skidl/docs/_site/github.com">Github</a>
to distribute electronic designs).</li>
  <li>Makes possible the creation of <em>smart circuit modules</em> whose behavior / structure are changed parametrically
(think about filters whose component values are automatically adjusted based on your
desired cutoff frequency).</li>
  <li>Can work with any ECAD tool (only two methods are needed: one for reading the part libraries and another
for outputing the correct netlist format).</li>
  <li>Takes advantage of all the benefits of the Python ecosystem (because it <em>is</em> Python).</li>
  <li>Free software: MIT license.</li>
  <li>Open source: <a href="https://github.com/xesscorp/skidl">https://github.com/xesscorp/skidl</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As a very simple example, the SKiDL program below describes a circuit that
takes an input voltage, divides it by three, and outputs it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>skidl</span> <span>import</span> <span>*</span>

<span># Create input &amp; output voltages and ground reference.
</span><span>vin</span><span>,</span> <span>vout</span><span>,</span> <span>gnd</span> <span>=</span> <span>Net</span><span>(</span><span>'VI'</span><span>),</span> <span>Net</span><span>(</span><span>'VO'</span><span>),</span> <span>Net</span><span>(</span><span>'GND'</span><span>)</span>

<span># Create two resistors.
</span><span>r1</span><span>,</span> <span>r2</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span> <span>*</span> <span>Part</span><span>(</span><span>"Device"</span><span>,</span> <span>'R'</span><span>,</span> <span>TEMPLATE</span><span>,</span> <span>footprint</span><span>=</span><span>'Resistor_SMD.pretty:R_0805_2012Metric'</span><span>)</span>
<span>r1</span><span>.</span><span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>'1K'</span>   <span># Set upper resistor value.
</span><span>r2</span><span>.</span><span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>'500'</span>  <span># Set lower resistor value.
</span>
<span># Connect the nets and resistors.
</span><span>vin</span> <span>+=</span> <span>r1</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span>      <span># Connect the input to the upper resistor.
</span><span>gnd</span> <span>+=</span> <span>r2</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span>      <span># Connect the lower resistor to ground.
</span><span>vout</span> <span>+=</span> <span>r1</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>],</span> <span>r2</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span># Output comes from the connection of the two resistors.
</span>
<span># Or you could do it with a single line of code:
# vin &amp;&amp; r1 &amp;&amp; vout &amp;&amp; r2 &amp;&amp; gnd
</span>
<span># Output the netlist to a file.
</span><span>generate_netlist</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And this is the netlist output that is passed to <code>PCBNEW</code> to
do the PCB layout:</p>

<p>SKiDL is pure Python so it’s easy to install:</p>



<p>To give SKiDL some part libraries to work with,
you’ll also need to install <a href="http://kicad-pcb.org/">KiCad</a>.
Then, you’ll need to set an environment variable so SKiDL can find the libraries.
For Windows, do this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>set KICAD_SYMBOL_DIR=C:\Program Files\KiCad\share\kicad\kicad-symbols
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And for linux-type OSes, define the environment variable in your <code>.bashrc</code> like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>export KICAD_SYMBOL_DIR="/Library/Application Support/kicad/kicad-symbols"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>These paths are OS-dependent</strong>, so launch KiCAD and click <code>Preferences-&gt;Configure Paths</code>
to reveal the needed paths.</p>



<p>This is the minimum that you need to know to design electronic circuitry
using SKiDL:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How to get access to SKiDL.</li>
  <li>How to find and instantiate a component (or <em>part</em>).</li>
  <li>How to connect <em>pins</em> of the parts to each other using <em>nets</em>.</li>
  <li>How to run an ERC on the circuit.</li>
  <li>How to generate a <em>netlist</em> for the circuit that serves as input to a PCB layout tool.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll demonstrate these steps using SKiDL in an interactive Python session,
but normally the statements that are shown would be entered into a file and
executed as a Python script.</p>

<h2 id="accessing-skidl">Accessing SKiDL</h2>

<p>To use skidl in a project, just place the following at the top of your file:</p>



<p>But for this tutorial, I’ll just import everything:</p>



<h2 id="finding-parts">Finding Parts</h2>

<h3 id="command-line-searching">Command-line Searching</h3>

<p>SKiDL provides a convenience function for searching for parts called
(naturally) <code>search</code>.
For example, if you needed an operational amplifier, then the following command would
pull up some likely candidates:</p>

  </p>


<p>A great deal of effort has been expended on figuring out what makes a
programming language “good” (or, more accurately, <em>popular</em>).</p>

<p>What I’m about to propose is really just conjecture, but I think the conclusions
drawable from it are amusingly accurate.</p>

<h2 id="the-theory">The Theory</h2>

<p><em>The popularity of a given programming language can be described accurately
as if the language were a file on a Unix filesystem, with <strong>read</strong>, <strong>write</strong>,
and <strong>execute</strong> bits. A language with all three “bits” set is more likely to
be popular than a language with two or less.</em></p>

<p>That alone is fairly meaningless, so I’ll detail exactly what is meant by
“readability”, “writability”, and “executability”.</p>

<h2 id="readability">Readability</h2>

<p>What does it mean for a programming language to be readable? That’s an
inflammatory question.</p>

<p>At the risk of being overly simplistic and broad, I’ll say that a language’s
readability is largely a function of 3 characteristics:</p>

<h3 id="similarity-to-other-popular-languages-or-overall-styles">Similarity to other popular languages, or overall styles.</h3>

<p>To a certain extent, this characteristic can be simplified to a single question:</p>

<p><em>“How similar is it to C?”</em></p>

<p>For the last 50 years, the vast majority of programming has been done
in procedural fashion, in languages with syntaxes directly derived from
or heavily inspired by ALGOL and C. Even languages that aren’t directly
procedural (read: anything remotely object-oriented) regularly borrow
constructions from their ALGOL-derived cousins.</p>

<p>This doesn’t mean that ALGOL-like syntaxes are objectively <em>good</em>, just that
their universal familiarity has a tangible effect on how we approach <em>new</em>
languages.</p>

<p>For example, how do you feel about these function calling syntaxes?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre>(1): foo(bar, baz, quux)
(2): foo bar baz quux
(3): foo bar withBaz: baz withQuux: quux
(4): [quux;baz;bar | foo]
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you’re like me, <code>(1)</code> is the most immediately understandable - it’s standard
function-with-arguments-separated-by-commas-in-parentheses-style. <code>(2)</code> might
also be fairly recognizable, if you’re used to working in a shell - it’s
utility-with-stringy-arguments-separated-by-whitespace-style. <code>(3)</code> will feel
familiar to Smalltalk programmers - the
receiver-object-taking-a-message-and-keyword-arguments-style. Finally, <code>(4)</code>
should feel relatively foreign to everybody - the argument list is reversed to
reflect the structure of the stack.</p>

<p>Without getting into which one of these styles is objectively best (I wouldn’t
be able to tell you), it’s apparent to most people that <code>(1)</code> is the most
<em>readable</em> simply by virtue of being so common. If I see <code>foo(bar, baz, quux)</code>
in a language I’ve never used before, I can be <em>relatively</em> confident that it
will behave like the other languages I’ve seen it in. The principle would be
the same, even if we lived in a world where Smalltalk or Lisp styles were
overwhelmingly popular.</p>

<h3 id="apparent-meaning">Apparent meaning.</h3>

<p>If you had (or have) never written a line of code in your life, which one of
these lines is most apparent in meaning? It’s okay if neither is apparent:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>(1): foobar[0]
(2): foobar.first
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Although <code>(1)</code> is what I learned first and is significantly more common, I find
<code>(2)</code> much more apparent. Compared to <code>(1)</code>, which requires that I know that
arrays are (usually) zero-based and accessed with <code>[]</code>, <code>(2)</code> only requires
that I recognize what I want (getting the first element of <code>foobar</code>) and
the general pattern for “doing things” from the line’s surroundings (calling a
method on an object with <code>.</code>).</p>

<p>What about this pair?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>(1): foo = bar * baz + quux
(2): = foo + * bar baz quux
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>(2)</code> is conceptually cleaner (no memorization of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations">PEMDAS</a> required), but it’s
also significantly less apparent to someone who’s already gone through
basic arithmetic with infix notation.</p>

<p>These are simple examples, but I think that they demonstrate a truth in
language design that we’re often not willing to admit, namely that precedent
and apparency matter more than conceptual purity. It’s nice to think of
radically new languages the reimagine common operations in</p>

<h3 id="complexity-of-mental-representation">Complexity of mental representation.</h3>

<p>This ties closely into apparent meaning, although it’s slightly different.</p>

<p>Consider each of the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>for</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>foobar</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>foobar</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>].</span><span>baz</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>



<p>In both examples, I call <code>baz</code> on every element in the <code>foobar</code> array.</p>

<p>However, in the first one, I have to keep track of an index variable (<code>i</code>), a
loop condition and iteration (<code>i &lt; foobar.length; i++</code>), and a new scope (<code>{}</code>).</p>

<p>In the second one, I take advantage of a little bit of magic in the form of
an <code>each</code> method and a <code>:baz</code> symbol to reduce <em>N</em> operations to a single line.
I don’t have to worry about my index variable, the correctness of my condition,
or my scope.</p>

<p>Although <code>(1)</code> is probably more immediately <em>apparent</em> and much more similar
to currently popular styles, it also requires me to maintain a mental
representation of <em>details irrelevant to what I’m actually trying to
accomplish</em>. I don’t want (or need) to know <em>how</em> each element is accessed or
that there are <code>foobar.length</code> elements, I just want to apply <code>baz</code>.</p>

<h2 id="writability">Writability</h2>

<p>A programming language’s writability is closely related to its readability.
The readability of a language refers to analyzing idiomatic programs written by
<em>everybody</em>, while the writability of a language refers to an <em>individual’s</em>
ability to <em>produce</em> idiomatic programs.</p>

<p>My thoughts on writability fall into a few already well-defined categories:</p>

<h3 id="pola">POLA</h3>

<p>POLA stands for the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">Principle of Least Astonishment</a>.</p>

<p>It’s hard to think of a language that is uniformly unastonishing (in a good
way!), but I often point to Ruby as one that <em>can</em> be unastonishing.</p>

<p>Ruby’s <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Array.html">Array</a> class is a good
example of this. Compare the following code snippets:</p>

<p>Python:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

<span>not</span> <span>foobar</span> <span># =&gt; True
# OR
</span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>foobar</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span># =&gt; True
</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Java:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

<span>foobar</span><span>.</span><span>length</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>// =&gt; true</span>

</pre></td><td><pre><span>foobar</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>

<span>6</span> <span>in</span> <span>foobar</span> <span># =&gt; False
</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Java:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
</pre></td><td><pre><span>foobar</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>};</span>
<span>found</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span>

<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span> <span>:</span> <span>foobar</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span> <span>==</span> <span>6</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>found</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
		<span>break</span><span>;</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ruby:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>foobar</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>..</span><span>5</span><span>]</span>

<span>foobar</span><span>.</span><span>include?</span><span>(</span><span>6</span><span>)</span> <span># =&gt; false</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>In both examples, the Ruby solution is fairly unastonishing. Predicates are
trailed by “<code>?</code>”, and are single English words corresponding to their behavior.</p>

<p>The Python examples tend to be equally short, but not as unastonishing.
<code>not foobar</code> relies on empty arrays being considered falsey (just be careful
with tuples!). Checking the length is not particularly astonishing (aside from
<code>len()</code> being called from the global namespace), but “the size of <code>foobar</code> is
zero” is an awfully roundabout way of saying “<code>foobar</code> is empty”.</p>

<p>The first Java example is about as short and astonishing as its Python
counterpart. The second one, on the other hand, is absolutely insane. It
could be shortened by using a helper like <code>Arrays.asList(foobar).contains(6)</code>,
except that this is invalid (primitives and Java generics don’t mix) and
also completely astonishing (an <code>Arrays</code> class? <code>asList</code>?).</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There's_more_than_one_way_to_do_it">There’s more than one way to do it</a>
is a longstanding Perl principle. People don’t often think of Perl when it
comes to <em>readability</em>, but I would argue that it is one of the most
<em>writable</em> languages (perhaps even
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-only_language">write-only</a>).</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<h4 id="a-read-loop-that-capitalizes-input-and-spits-it-back">A read-loop that capitalizes input and spits it back</h4>

<p>In C, this would involve buffering <code>stdin</code> in a loop, converting each character
to its uppercase equivalent (don’t forget Unicode!), and printing them back out.
The process in Java would be similar.</p>

<p>In Perl:</p>



<p>a little more explicitly (and off of the command line):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>&lt;&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>print</span> <span>uc</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>even more explicit:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>my</span> <span>$line</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>STDIN</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>print</span> <span>uc</span><span>(</span><span>$line</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>and so on:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>my</span> <span>$line</span> <span>=</span> <span>readline</span><span>(</span><span>*STDIN</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>print</span> <span>uc</span><span>(</span><span>$line</span><span>));</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Although this may seem like a shortcut to terse and unreadable code, it
<em>is</em> a legitimate reason to like a language (and enjoy writing in it). Perl
provides an astounding number of primitives and shortcuts for common operations
(<a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlop.html">look at all of these operators!</a>), making
quick scripting painless and straightforward.</p>

<p>(By the way, the Ruby version: <code>ruby -pe '$_.upcase!'</code>).</p>

<h2 id="executability">Executability</h2>

<p>This is probably the murkiest of the three “bits”.</p>

<p>Let’s clarify it:</p>

<h3 id="ease-of-setup">Ease of setup</h3>

<p>Let’s say I found a cool program written in “Etaoin”. How am I going to run it?</p>

<p>If Etaoin is compiled and the developer was kind enough to provide a package
or installer, I’d probably just download their package and let my system take
care of the little details. The is the <strong>best case scenario</strong>.</p>

<p>But what if Etaoin is interpreted? Well, the developer <em>might</em> bundle the
interpreter into a package, but this would be a bit overkill. It would probably
be better to install Etaoin discretely, a process that involves either a package
or manual compilation, depending on Etaoin’s popularity.</p>

<p>Once I’ve got the interpreter, what about the program’s dependencies? Does
Etaoin have a package manager? Are the dependencies available through it? Are
they compatible with my release of the language? Am I going to need other
languages and tools to build them?</p>

<p>Whenever I see a new language or an interesting project written in a new
language, these are the very first questions I ask. It’s a lot harder to
justify installing a relatively simple program If it requires me to manually
build an interpreter and dependencies, solely by virtue of being written in an
uncommon language.</p>

<p>Of course, this is not a completely fair or accurate characterization. It’s a
little ridiculous to place the onus of “executability” solely upon package
maintainers.</p>

The output capacitor for 5V was in worse shape. A 3900 uF / 6VDC Sprague with impressive connectors never managed to get to the nominal voltage even using a 560 ohm resistor and plenty of time. <br></span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">&nbsp;<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/O4FWlpH.png" imageanchor="1"><img alt="Capacitor replacement" src="http://i.imgur.com/O4FWlpH.png"></a></p><br><span><img alt="Zooma in (verklig storlek: 800 x 598)" src="http://elektronikforumet.com/forum/images/spacer.gif" title="Zooma in (verklig storlek: 800 x 598)"></span><p>Nowadays there are no such capacitors as 3900 uF / 6VDC with screw connectors so I replaced it with a 6800uF / 40VDC RIFA&nbsp; </p></span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">With a new capacitor the power supply managed well to deliver 3 Amps in my dummy load which after while smelt nicely from hot pertinax<br></span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif"><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/3v9ATUo.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img alt="test" src="http://i.imgur.com/3v9ATUo.jpg"></a></p><br><span><img alt="Zooma in (verklig storlek: 1000 x 747)" src="http://elektronikforumet.com/forum/images/spacer.gif" title="Zooma in (verklig storlek: 1000 x 747)"></span><p>But does the it work if one connects the power supply to the back plane? Unfortunately it doesn't. Apparently two signals from the power supply was permanently in low state, BUS DC LO L and BUS AC LO L. These are active low signals and in its' low state the inhibits the clock generation of the main CPU.</p></span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">The schematics above describes the 5V regulator of the H777 power supply. The blue marked area is a current source circuit which is fed by incoming raw DC and which charges a 50uF capacitor which thus creates a nice ramp signal. A resistor ladder circuit and a number of comparators generate the BUS DC LO L, BUS AC LO L and an internal signal which causes the clock signal to the main PWM switch. The voltage over the capacitor never exceeded 20.4 V which was not enough to get the two of the comparators to change polarity. It seems like to much current is consumed from the current source. The capacitor was replaced, but no difference. But the current source was not only connected to the capacitor. It was also connected to the red marked area which is a crow bar circuit. If any of the main switch transistors would fail a 38 V raw DC would be the result on the output. Not very good. Therefore there is a zener diode and a couple of thyristors which fires off if the output voltage exceeded 5.6 VDC. This will also short circuit the current source, effectively stopping all activities in&nbsp; power supply. The problem seemed to be that even under normal circumstances 1.5 mA was consumed by leakage in the thyristor even though hasn't fired. Apparently all thyristors have leakages but not this much.<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/U0GunMu.png" imageanchor="1"><img alt="Thyristor" height="389" src="http://i.imgur.com/U0GunMu.png" width="400"></a></p><p>Change of thyristor to a modern BT145 resulted in a fully functional power supply!</p><p><span>Testing the CPU</span></p><p>All cables were connected and the power was switched on. No smoke leaked anywhere which was a good sign. But the RUN lamp were just flashing briefly. Pressing INIT switch on the console only gave a short blink of the RUN lamp. Not very promising.</p><p>A check with the oscilloscope on the main clock signal of then CPU board showed that is starts up does 8 cycles, the stops for a couple micro seconds then does three more cycles, yet another stop and the three cycles and then nothing.</p><p><span><img alt="Zooma in (verklig storlek: 1200 x 961)" src="http://elektronikforumet.com/forum/images/spacer.gif" title="Zooma in (verklig storlek: 1200 x 961)"></span></p><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/O3QASBs.png" imageanchor="1"><img alt="8 micro cycles" src="http://i.imgur.com/O3QASBs.png"></a></p><br>From the picture above one can deduce that the cycle time is closer to 250 ns rather than 260 ns&nbsp; specified in "Computer Engineering". However using a delay line in a feedback loop may not be that accurate. 4 MHz is a quite impressive speed at least in the mid seventies. </span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">Further than this is probably not possible using an oscilloscope only. For that purpose I have gotten this little USB connected tool:<br></span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">But to cover the entire machine with address and data bus one would need four of these. Luckily at this point in time I was offered to buy a HP1664A logic analyser at an affordable price!<br></span></p><div><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif"><b>Logic&nbsp;analyser&nbsp;fault tracing</b></span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">After some initial problems which was caused by mixed-up signals and also forgetting that the machine is active low I got some good traces from the analyser:<br></span></p><div><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif"><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/SPIxi1B.png" imageanchor="1"><img alt="micro code" src="http://i.imgur.com/SPIxi1B.png"></a></p><p>The picture above shows the output of the micro address pipeline register. So it actually shows the second micro step as the first micro-step. But this is actually the correct sequence comparing to this <a href="http://vaxhaven.com/images/1/11/EK-KD11D-TM-PRE.pdf">document</a>. </p><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/vCoTm8v.png" imageanchor="1"><img alt="Address bus and databus" src="http://i.imgur.com/vCoTm8v.png"></a></p><br>The interesting with this trace is that the CPU output addresses 24 and the 26 on the address bus. On the data bus it then receives 165020 which is the to be PC to start execution at after power fail, this is also the first address of the diagnostics program of the M9312. But looking at the address the CPU subsequently outputs on the address bus it is 167020. For some reason bit 10 has became high! Measuring more closely on a bus receiver chip, DS8641 shows that even though the input is at 3.31 V the output is a 3.78 V! This seems to be wrong!</span></p><p><span><span face="verdana, sans-serif">It is alive</span></span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif"><b><br></b>This is the little evil thing:<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/XojS9FU.png" imageanchor="1"><img alt="DS8641" height="320" src="http://i.imgur.com/XojS9FU.png" width="319"></a></p><br>Unfortunately DS8641 is not a very common IC. It is especially adapted to Digital open collector buses. I ordered some from a seller on Ebay located in China but since the delivery time is quite long I resorted to desoldered an IC from another board and replaced the faulty chip on the CPU board.<p>This time the result was much better:</p></span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif"><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/soZUSxo.png" imageanchor="1"><img alt="Waiting for TX ready" src="http://i.imgur.com/soZUSxo.png"></a></p><br>However it ends up spinning waiting for TX ready bit of the console serial port to become ready.

I used the <a href="http://www.dbit.com/putr/">PUTR</a>&nbsp;tool to extract them from the image. Please make sure to copy them as binary otherwise you end up like me scratching my head for hours...

It needed just a few modifications to the serial port code to compile cleanly.</span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">Then I started the work to get a bootable TU58 image for my TU58 emulator. It is far simpler to use an emulator to all this kind of work. I used&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dbit.com/">E11</a>&nbsp;to do all this. First I tried XXDP 2.6 which I found an image for on bitsavers:</span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">Unfortunately it required more memory than my machine had so it won't be possible to run this version. Besides the GKAB diagnostics doesn't run at all on the emulated PDP-11/04 for some reason!</span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">I then spent some time to make a TU58 image for XXDP+, an earlier version of the XXDP suite.</span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">This is how I did that using E11:</span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">Running GKAAA0.BIC under XXDP+ on the real machine works fine.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
								
<p>Ever since .Net v4, in all versions including the last classic .Net version v4.8, the built-in browser detection accessible in the Request.Browser (a HttpBrowserCapabilities object) has a serious flaw which will bite you as soon as your site gets several visitors per minute.</p>



<p>What happens, if you rely on this object, is that users will randomly report having their browser mis-identified.</p>



<p>This post shows why it happens and how to solve it. The issue is also easy to reproduce locally, worth a few fun minutes. If you are so inclined, the problem also lends itself to a DoS attack.</p>



<p>Even though this problem seems only to affect classic .Net (not .Net Core), there is a huge number of running web apps out there, and still new being developed, on this framework.</p>



<p>We have a website relying on some of the later browser features, so we are using browser detection to tell users with older browsers to upgrade, since we absolutely need these features. It works fine for a while, then randomly, users with recent browser versions are suddenly told they need to upgrade. Once this occures it typically lasts for the rest of the day.</p>



<p>To reproduce, create an asp.net project (web forms, MVC, doesn’t really matter) with this code in a .aspx file:</p>



<pre><code>&lt;script language="c#" runat="server"&gt;
public void Page_Load(){
    Response.Write(Request.Browser.Browser 
    + " v" + Request.Browser.MajorVersion);
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>



<p>Visit this page, locally or on a server, and you get for instance <code>Chrome v88</code>. So far, so good.</p>



<p>The browser is classified from the User-Agent HTTP header. My Chrome sends this: <code>Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/88.0.4324.104 Safari/537.36</code></p>



<p>Now, quickly change the <code>Chrome/88</code> in the middle of the string to <code>Chrome/86</code> (or any other number) and retry. For instance in Curl:</p>



<pre><code>curl http://localhost:58571 -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/86.0.4324.104 Safari/537.36"</code></pre>



<p>Still v88? How strange… Let’s refresh a few times. Still v88. Let’s think for a minute…hmm…refresh again. Gone! Now, at last, it shows v86! </p>



<p>I had to look into the <a href="https://referencesource.microsoft.com/System.Web/Configuration/HttpCapabilitiesEvaluator.cs.html#https://referencesource.microsoft.com/System.Web/Configuration/HttpCapabilitiesEvaluator.cs.html,3774a0750f8cc853,references">offending source code</a> from the .Net framework.</p>



<p>What happens is, for performance, the result of the browser classification is stored in a hash-table with the User-Agent string as the key. But not the entire string, no, that would have saved us a lot of headache, no, the key is just the first 64 characters (source line 46).</p>



<p>The Chrome version number is located at position 90 and thus not part of the key at all. To add to the frustration, the cache has a sliding-window (source line 247,304, 369) 1 minute expiry (source line 147). This means: as long as the cache key is read at least once a minute, it stays. Hilarity ensues.</p>



<p>The fix is straight-forward, put this in your <code>web.config</code></p>



<pre><code>&lt;configuration&gt;
    &lt;system.web&gt;
        &lt;browserCaps userAgentCacheKeyLength="512" /&gt;
    &lt;/system.web&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;</code></pre>



<p>Why 512? It turns out that .Net caps the User-Agent string at 512 characters  to avoid resource attacks (source line 188). I imagine someone at Microsoft deciding that 512 characters ought to be enough for anybody.</p>



<h2>Denial-of-Service implication</h2>



<p>Without this line in your web.config, your site is also vulnerable to a DoS attack if you, like us, rely on browser identification to enable some functionality. An attacker would wait for low-traffic hours, typically the middle of the night, to issue requests with the first 64 bytes looking like the most commonly used User-Agents on the web, but the rest of the string tweaked with low version numbers or other content to lead the browser capabilities to think “it’s an older browser, sir, but it checks out”.</p>



<p>As long as one request per User Agent is issued per minute, these are permanently mis-identified. An exceptionally low-cost and low-effort DoS attack.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, it was announced that <a href="http://www.ashfordstpeters.nhs.uk/latest-news/2610-covid-busting-nasal-spray-begins-uk-trials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UK trials were beginning of a nasal spray proven to kill 99.9% of the coronavirus</a> that causes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19</a>. The idea, broadly, is that you’d use the spray first thing in the morning, during the day after social interactions, and then again in the evening — and it would prevent the virus from taking hold and making you ill.</p>
<p>Awesome, right? Simple, cheap, portable. Sort of like cleaning your teeth regularly: prevention rather than cure. Combined with a <a href="https://wellcome.org/news/what-different-types-covid-19-vaccine-are-there" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccine</a>, particularly for anyone at high risk such as those in healthcare settings, it could put a stop to the whole thing — and might also turn out to be effective on other, less deadly but still annoying, viruses.</p>
<p>But, I hear you ask, what is it? Because if I’m going to squirt something up my nose several times a day, I have questions…</p>

<p>Fair enough. It’s actually, mostly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nitric oxide</a>, which has the chemical formula NO.</p>
<p>Yes, there are plenty of wordplay options here. The researchers have already jammed the letters NO into their company name, and done the acronym thing, to get <a href="https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/news/sanotize-trials-nasal-spray/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SaNOtize Nitric Oxide Nasal Spray</a> (NONS). If the trials are successful, it’s probably only a matter of time before we get: “Say NO to coronavirus!” marketing. (Any ad agencies reading this, I’m claiming copyright.)</p>
<p>But that aside, unless you’re a chemist you might be thinking about some half-remembered chemical names and frowning at this point. Isn’t that… used in rocket fuel? Or… wait… isn’t that… the nasty smoggy stuff that causes lung problems?</p>
<p>Ah, well, there are several nitrogen oxides. Let me summarise:</p>
<ul>
<li>NO is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nitrogen monoxide or nitric oxide</a> — that’s what we’re talking about here.</li>
<li>NO<sub>2</sub> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_dioxide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nitrogen dioxide</a> — forms when combustion happens in air, and it’s the one that’s brown and smells horrible, and is probably most associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smog#Photochemical_smog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">photochemical smog&nbsp;</a>(although atmospheric NO has a significant role there, too).</li>
<li>N<sub>2</sub>O is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nitrous oxide</a>, sometimes just “nitrous” — that’s the one that’s also called laughing gas and is used as an anaesthetic, and “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_use_of_nitrous_oxide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recreationally</a>,” as well as being used to increase the power output of engines.</li>
<li>NO<sub>3</sub> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrate_radical" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nitrogen trioxide</a> — this is a radical, with an unpaired electron. It’s unstable, but it is important in ozone chemistry.</li>
<li>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinitrogen_tetroxide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nitrogen tetroxide or dinitrogen tetroxide</a> — this is important because it forms <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinitrogen_tetroxide#Structure_and_properties" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an equilibrium with NO<sub>2</sub></a> so the two can be thought of an interconvertible, and also because it’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinitrogen_tetroxide#Use_as_a_rocket_propellant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used as a rocket propellent</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_oxide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other nitrogen oxides</a>, not to mention ions — but let’s not spend all day on this. Nitrogen forms this confusing hodgepodge of oxides because it has five electrons in its outermost shell (it’s in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/nitrogen-group-element" target="_blank" rel="noopener">group 15</a> of the periodic table) and because there’s not much difference in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronegativity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electronegativities</a> of oxygen and nitrogen. So essentially, it can share electrons with oxygen to form bonds in a number of different ways to obtain a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_configuration#Noble_gas_configuration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stable, full outer shell</a>.</p>
<p>For any students reading this, I’m sorry. You… pretty much just have to remember these. Yes, I know. That’s why experienced chemists so often use the shorthand <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NOx </a>— we just can’t be bothered keeping all the names straight. (Okay, before someone shouts at me, actually NOx is handy because we’re often talking about more than one oxide at a time, and it allows us to easily express that.)</p>
<p>Back to NO. It’s a colourless gas, and it has an unpaired electron, which makes it a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free radical</a>. And… here we go again. Aren’t we supposed to eat lots of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">antioxidant-</a>rich fruit and vegetables to mop up free radicals? They’re bad, aren’t they?</p>

<p>Yes and no. Free radicals are reactive species which damage cells and can cause illness and ageing. Too much exposure to free radicals causes something <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oxidative stress</a>, which is definitely bad. But. It turns out that nitrogen oxide is an important <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaseous_signaling_molecule" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signalling molecule</a>, that is, a molecule which is the body uses to send chemical signals from one place to another. In particular, nitrogen oxide “tells” the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide#Biological_functions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smooth muscle around blood vessels to relax</a>, causing those blood vessels to dilate, and increasing blood flow. Viagra (aka <a title="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sildenafil">Sildenafil</a>) uses the nitric oxide pathway, and I think we all know what that does, don’t we? Good.</p>
<p>Nitric oxide has also been shown to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17170603/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce blood pressure</a>, which is generally considered a good thing — <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/low-blood-pressure-hypotension/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up to a point, obviously</a>. This is why you can buy lots of so-called <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326381" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nitric oxide supplements</a>, which, since nitrogen oxide is a gas at room temperature, don’t actually contain nitric oxide on its own. Rather, they’re a mixture of amino acids and other things that supposedly help the body to <em>make</em> NO. But it might be cheaper, and healthier, to eat plenty of beetroot or drink beetroot juice, since there’s evidence that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29370244/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">does the same sort of thing</a>.</p>
<p>As always, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dose_makes_the_poison" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the dose makes the poison</a>. Too <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide#Occupational_safety_and_health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much nitric oxide is definitely problematic</a>, but administered in the right way and in appropriate doses, it’s extremely safe.</p>
<p>It’s suggested that the nitric oxide in the <a href="https://sanotize.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SaNOtize</a> nasal spray destroys the virus and also helps to stop viral replication within cells. Plus, it <a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-the-ace2-receptor-how-is-it-connected-to-coronavirus-and-why-might-it-be-key-to-treating-covid-19-the-experts-explain-136928" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocks the receptors</a> that the virus uses to enter cells in the first place. Essentially, it locks the doors and rains down fire on the potential intruders — nice work.</p>
<p>You only need to use the spray occasionally, because developing a COVID-19 infection isn’t instant. First the virus gets into your nose, then it attaches to cells, then it replicates, and <em>then</em> it sheds into your lungs. There are timescales involved here — so long as the spray is used every so often it should do the trick.</p>
<p>Another advantage is that this should, theoretically, work on other strains — where the current vaccines may not. So it could provide a very important stopgap when vaccination isn’t immediately available.</p>

<p>All sounds fabulous, doesn’t it? It might be, but, we’re in the early stages with this. Clinical trials <a href="http://www.ashfordstpeters.nhs.uk/latest-news/2610-covid-busting-nasal-spray-begins-uk-trials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have now started in the UK</a>, are already in <a href="https://sanotize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SaNOtize_HC_USU_release_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phase II in Canada</a> and have been approved to start in the USA. Researchers are hopeful, but we need to wait for the evidence.</p>
<p>So in the meantime, <a href="https://twitter.com/chronicleflask/status/1283015334732103682" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wear a mask</a>, <a href="https://chronicleflask.com/2020/03/26/cleaning-chemistry-awesome-soap/">wash your hands,</a> and take a vaccine if you’re offered one. Stay safe out there!</p>

<p>Many tools come and go as our software and devices change - or we get bored and want to try something new and shiny. One of the few exceptions for me has been the <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim text editor</a>, which I use for programming, emails, and writing every day. In this post I want to share why Vim is remarkable but more generally why learning a text editor is a great investment.</p>

        <p>It may not be obvious why text editors are useful tools. Many programs, like web browsers, email clients, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">integrated development environments (IDEs)</a>, have built-in text editing functionality. Why use a separate text editor? Text editors go deep. They are much more powerful than text boxes in browsers and email clients while being more general than IDEs. While IDEs often have excellent programming language-specific functionality, they are rarely used for other text editing tasks like writing emails or documents because they are specialized tools. Text editors strike a good balance of powerful editing and support for programming without being boxed into a narrow use-case.</p>

        <p>Getting started with a text editor is easy. Vim implements the arcane <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi">vi editor</a> user interface but has many <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcTu2VkAIIWzD2kicFNHN2c35XQCeZdsv">videos</a>, <a href="http://vimsheet.com/">cheatsheets</a>, and <a href="https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorial">tutorials</a> that make it fun to try. Really getting familiar with the features and customizing the editor to your own needs takes time though. This is true for any popular text editor because the number of settings, extensions, or plugins available can be huge. However, once you are familiar with a text editor you will have a powerful tool that can be used for most tasks involving writing or manipulating text. The time investment will pay off as you use the editor for todo lists, emails, documentation, programming, configuration files, and more.</p>

        <p>This explains why I've found Vim a useful and enduring tool that I use daily. But what makes it a particularly strong text editor compared to the other options? Text editors go in and out of fashion all the time. I remember many that attracted attention for a time but then faded away. Vim has remained popular and I think there are a few reasons for that.</p>

            <p><b>Powerful text editing plus IDE-like functionality.</b> The vi user interface is actually a language of text editing operators. The keys you press aren't just keyboard shortcuts, they are like a bytecode (!) for a text manipulation CPU that is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_complete">Turing-complete</a>. Years ago I wrote vi macros that solve the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem">stable marriage problem</a> to demonstrate this. For many geeks this alone might be enough to convince you to learn Vim! But on top of this crazy text editing power Vim also has IDE-like functionality including syntax highlighting, completion, code search and navigation, compiler error navigation, and diffing. There is a large collection of plugins and scripts if you want to extend Vim's functionality even further.</p>

  <p><b>Vim is ubiquitous.</b> It runs on all major operating systems but furthermore it is found on devices from tiny Wi-Fi routers to the largest servers. It has a GUI but also a terminal interface if you are connecting to a remote machine over SSH. I always find it strange when I see people use their editor of choice on their laptop but then use another, less-familiar editor when connecting to remote machines. Learn Vim and you can use it everywhere!</p>

  <p><b>Keyboard-friendly.</b> Constantly moving my hand between the mouse and keyboard is tiring and distracting. Vim has excellent keyboard support and many things can be done without leaving the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_row#Home_row">home row</a> on the keyboard, including navigating, inserting, and deleting text. I find there is no need to use the arrow keys, mouse, or anything that is hard to reach.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a powerful text editor that you can use for many years then I recommend Vim. It's also worth looking at Emacs, which has a different angle but is also a good time investment. Looking back on 17 years of using Vim, I'm happy I stopped switching between language-specific IDEs and instead found a text editor capable of handling all tasks.</p>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id="hosting">Hosting</h3><p>Your stuff needs a home (yes, even in the "serverless" world. LOL). My personal preferences are <a href="https://azure.com/">Azure</a>, <a href="https://m.do.co/c/c844c6492d23">Digital Ocean</a> <em>(affiliate link)</em>, or <a href="https://scaleway.com/">Scaleway</a>. They each offer enough compute, networking options, storage, and basic services to build out proofs-of-concept or whatever you might need.</p><p>Another honorable mention here is <a href="https://hetzner.com/">Hetzner</a>. They offer a good level of hardware, service and price.</p><h3 id="the-virtual-machines">The Virtual Machines</h3><p>For those side projects and many enterprise applications, <strong>scale is not an issue</strong>. That means that I will not serve thousands of simultaneous users or handling terabytes of data. Therefore I can get by on the smaller offerings – usually under $20/month. Even Azure (the most expensive of the three) offer their burstable VMs. Generally I like to go with <a href="https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/development/">Scaleway's Developer line of servers</a>.</p><p><em><strong>Notice that Kubernetes is missing from my stack? When scale is not an issue then you don't need Kubernetes.</strong></em></p><h3 id="docker-just-plain-docker-">Docker. Just plain Docker.</h3><p>I do not rely on the OS vendor (Ubuntu) to make sure that I run the latest Docker on new VMs. Therefore I use the nice little <code>curl|bash</code> technique.</p><pre><code>curl -s https://get.docker.com | sudo bash</code></pre><p>This cure one-liner will get the best and most recent version for your machine running.</p><h3 id="traefik-for-reverse-proxy">Traefik for Reverse Proxy</h3><p>Traefik has been a God-send since I found it. Nginx is great, but it was not built for the Docker universe. Traefik has two killer features that have saved me hours upon hours:</p><ol><li>Automatic TLS with LetsEncrypt. Literally set-it-and-forget-it. With the right API keys and DNS provider you can also do verification with DNS.</li><li>Automatic no-reload configuration using docker labels. When you spin up new services Traefik will pickup the changes automatically because it listens to all Docker-related events. This makes it incredibly convenient to add, remove, or merge services as needed without any hassle.</li></ol><p>My only comment on Traefik is that there is a bit of a learning curve. You have to decide how you want to configure it (config file, command line options, yaml, or docker labels, or use a combination!)</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Another note here: I have already <a href="https://www.simplecto.com/traefik-2-0-docker-and-letsencrypt/" title="Traefik 2 production ready configurations">published my production configuations for Traefik</a> here.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="postgres-for-database">Postgres for Database</h3><p>Tried and True, PostgreSQL has never let me down. I usually attach one of these containers to a project that needs it without any difficulty. I simply spin up the container, bind the ports, and then bind the data volume to my host disk. Done and Done.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h3 id="dockercomposeyml">docker-compose.yml</h3>
<pre><code>version: '3.1'

services:

  db:
    container_name: postgres
    hostname: postgres
    image: postgres:11
    restart: always
    environment:

    volumes:

</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id="dockerized-django-for-web">Dockerized Django for Web</h3><p>Docker deploys nicely in a container, and I have been doing it for a few years now. The benefits of matching your development environment to your production one cannot be overstated, and I have Docker to thank for that.</p><p>Edit: 2021, I've got a reference Django project up that I use as my template for new projects: <a href="https://github.com/simplecto/django-reference-implementation">https://github.com/simplecto/django-reference-implementation</a></p><h3 id="django-commands-for-asynchronous-tasks">Django commands for Asynchronous tasks</h3><p>Also, for asynchronous tasks I simply use <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/howto/custom-management-commands/">custom Django commands</a> which are a part of the standard framework. The pattern here is a simple <code>while</code> loop with a <code>sleep()</code> period. It polls the database for relevant actions and then does it's thing. &nbsp;</p><p>Edit: 2021 - This has paid off in a big way. I have been running a website screenshot project for over a year now with this pattern. It takes about 1500 website screenshots per day. All of it is scheduled and managed by a Django command.</p><p>That project lives here: https://github.com/simplecto/screenshots</p><h3 id="intercoolerjs-because-who-needs-the-complexity">IntercoolerJS, because who needs the complexity?</h3><p>I have a lot to say about this, but that will have to go into a series of posts. The tldr; here that I use this lovely little javascript library along with jQuery (<em>yeah, it is 2020, and I still use jQuery</em>) to make parts of my applications <em>feel</em> like single-page-apps but not really.</p><p>IntercoolerJS keeps that old-school "Ajax" (remember that word) goodness and allows me to update the DOM with HTML from the backend. It is seamless, smooth, and really convenient for things like logins and small form updates.</p><p>I strongly suggest you check it out: <a href="https://intercoolerjs.org/">Learn more about IntercoolerJS</a></p><p>Edit 2021: The creator has released <a href="https://htmx.org/">HTMX</a>, the successor to IntercoolerJS.</p><h3 id="sentry-to-catch-production-errors">Sentry to catch production errors</h3><p>I make mistakes. Lots of mistakes--but there is no need to show them to my users, right? Sentry gives me an easy and convenient way to capture production bugs as they happen. Some cool things about them:</p><ol><li>Open source-ish (<a href="https://blog.sentry.io/2019/11/06/relicensing-sentry">relicensed here</a>), so you can host yourself if that is your thing.</li><li>Easy few lines added to your <code>settings.py</code> file in Django and that is it.</li><li>Tight integration to your Git repos and Issue tracking systems for full production defect traceability.</li></ol><p>Another nice thing is that you can disable it for development.</p><p><a href="https://sentry.io/">Check out Sentry here</a>.</p><h3 id="bitbucket-pipelines-for-ci-cd">Bitbucket Pipelines for CI/CD</h3><p>Edit: 2021 - I no longer use CI/CD for deployment of my one-man projects. It is too much tooling and complexity. I simply run tests with PyCharm and ship directly to production from my development machine.</p><p>There are so many CI/CD offerings out there today, but I have been happy with Bitbucket's offering called Pipelines. They offer you a few hundred minutes free every month with the option to top-up as needed for a small fee. I have rarely had problems, and I really enjoy their YAML configuraiton / directive files. </p><p>Using the <code>bitbucket-pipelines.yml</code> file I have been able to do full end-to-end testing by spinning up multiple docker containers, loading the databases, and running hundreds of test in just a few minutes. This was key in speeding things up in our team and enabling 5+ pushes to production per day.</p><p><a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Checkout Bitbucket here</a>.</p><h3 id="zerotier-for-vpn-control-plane">ZeroTier for VPN/Control Plane</h3><p>Finally, we come to the bit of tech that is largely optional but nice to have. &nbsp;Zerotier is a unique kind of network/VPN that I use to link all my personal machines. It works though firewalls (at home, in office) and offers an easy 1 minute setup.</p><p>Using ZeroTier in my last company we were able to remove the SSH Jump Servers which caused a headache in terms of key management and shared bandwidth on a single machine.</p><p>Zerotier work on Linux, Mac, Windows, Android, and iPhone, so you are pretty much covered.</p><p>The one downside to ZeroTier is that I don't entirely understand how it works. It is a lot like MacOS or iPhone in that it "just works" as expected and I rarely (never) have problems. That is a strength from a user experience perspective but a WTF? from a CTO perspective. </p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>Hopefully this deeper-dive will prompt some interest and curiosity about Docker, Django, Traefik, and especially IntercoolerJS. It is simple, easy to work with, and allows you to grow out of it when the time comes.</p><p>Edit 2021 - As you can see not a lot has changed. I've been able to add more code to my public repositories that flesh out the ideas expressed here over a year ago.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong><span>:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>One way that some states are combating emissions is by selling a fixed number of pollution permits to power plants. Currently, governments reduce the number or pollution permits by 3% each year to force power plants to find cleaner ways to operate (more efficient power plants, renewable energy, etc.)&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Kotoo allows individuals to help lower emissions faster because permits Kotoo buys become unavailable to power plants, forcing them to reduce their emissions.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Imagine the government has a concert venue and it’s throwing a renewable energy benefit concert by a band called Carbon Dioxide (CO2). All the power plants have attended the CO2 concert for decades. Some people want power plants to attend a concert by a new band called Renewable Energy so they buy and shred the tickets to the CO2 concert so that the power plants can’t attend. Since the power plants can’t do without music - they go to the Renewable Energy concert instead. They learn that Renewable Energy is so good (it’s cheaper!) that they never go back to the Carbon Dioxide concert. Eventually all the seats in Carbon Dioxide concert are empty so the band stops playing and shredding tickets is no longer needed.</span></p>

<p><span>While the Renewable Energy fans could just go to the RE concert - buying out the CO2 tickets still builds renewable energy since it’s a benefit concert while also preventing CO2 from being emitted. It ultimately converts old CO2 enthusiasts rather than waiting for Renewable Energy to become so dominant it overtakes CO2.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><a href="https://info.kotoo.earth/hc/en-us/articles/360058439833" target="_self">Why powerplants are the key to climate change</a></span></p>


<p><strong>Details</strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>Another way to think about emissions is by thinking about fuel because emissions are directly related to fuel burned.* But some powerplants get more electricity out of a given amount of fuel - just like how different cars go different distances on the same amount of fuel. So we can think about power plant emissions just like how you might think about gas mileage - some go further than others but the ones that are more efficient are more expensive.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Let’s say that there was a fixed amount of fuel available every three months. Every three months, everyone shows up to buy the fuel but there's only a set amount available. Since people want more fuel than is available - the government sets up an auction and sells it to the highest bidders.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>People who have less efficient, and therefore cheaper, equipment have more money for fuel but they need to buy more of it. And those that have more efficient equipment need less and may save money even though their equipment cost them more up front.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Over time, the amount of fuel available decreases so if the amount of fuel people require doesn’t change, then the fuel gets more expensive. However, the more expensive the fuel, the more it makes sense for people to upgrade to more efficient machines to save money on fuel or run the risk of not being able to operate.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The beauty of this is that everyone can choose an upgrade system that works for them on a time horizon that makes sense for them regardless of what type of fuel they need. And there is more than one option, here are a few:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>they can stop making electricity</span></li>
<li><span>they can operate their power plant more efficiently with the fuel they have</span></li>
<li><span>they can pay for upgrades to their plant to make their fuel go further. This costs money up front but saves them money when they have to buy less fuel.</span></li>
<li><span>they can build a fuel free power plant (aka renewable energy) which also costs money but saves them money on fuel</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>Lastly, while all this is happening, the money raised from the auction are spent building new fuel free powerplants and helping people use less electricity - so those that need the fuel are also building a future in which no fuel is needed.</span></p>

<p><span>Kotoo allows individual people to drive this change faster by showing up to the auction and buying permits that we don’t plan to use. This makes less fuel available and increases the price. As prices increase, power plants will save more and more money by making one of the 4 choices above. And as prices increase more and more money is available to build fuel free powerplants.</span></p>

<p><span>*For a certain type of fuel, it is mostly true that a gallon of that fuel will always make the same emissions. Combustion nerds (aka the author) know that it is possible to burn fuels in dirty and clean ways but the analogy holds because technology to burn fuel more cleanly usually costs more money because it is newer. It is also true that different types of fuels create dramatically different amounts of emissions (coal is twice as dirty as natural gas) but more fuel always means more emissions and outside of this analogy, the price is set by emissions so it’s robust to how fuel is burned and what type of fuel is being burned</span></p>

<a href="#comments">17 comments</a></p><p>I start each of my <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/weekly/">weekly reviews</a> by re-reading one of my favorite essays of life advice—a different one each week. It’s useful for a few different reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It helps me get into the right reflective frame of mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The best essays are dense enough with useful advice that I find new interesting bits every time I read them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Much good advice is <a href="https://tjcx.me/posts/defense-self-help/" target="_blank">easy to understand, but hard to implement</a>. So to get the most benefit from it, you should find whatever version of it most resonates you and then <em>re-read it frequently</em> to keep yourself on track.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve collected my favorite essays for re-reading below. I’ll keep this updated as I find more great essays, and I’d welcome other contributions—please suggest your own favorites in the comments!</p>
<p>There's a lot of essays here! If you'd like, I can email you one essay every weekend, so you can read it before your weekly review:

<p>Paul Graham, <a href="http://paulgraham.com/vb.html" target="_blank">Life is Short</a>. Inspire yourself never to waste time on bullshit again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having kids showed me how to convert a continuous quantity, time, into discrete quantities. You only get 52 weekends with your 2 year old. If Christmas-as-magic lasts from say ages 3 to 10, you only get to watch your child experience it 8 times. And while it’s impossible to say what is a lot or a little of a continuous quantity like time, 8 is not a lot of something. If you had a handful of 8 peanuts, or a shelf of 8 books to choose from, the quantity would definitely seem limited, no matter what your lifespan was.</p>
<p>Ok, so life actually is short. Does it make any difference to know that?</p>
<p>It has for me. It means arguments of the form “Life is too short for x” have great force. It’s not just a figure of speech to say that life is too short for something. It’s not just a synonym for annoying. If you find yourself thinking that life is too short for something, you should try to eliminate it if you can.</p>
<p>When I ask myself what I’ve found life is too short for, the word that pops into my head is “bullshit.” I realize that answer is somewhat tautological. It’s almost the definition of bullshit that it’s the stuff that life is too short for. And yet bullshit does have a distinctive character. There’s something fake about it. It’s the junk food of experience. [1]</p>
<p>If you ask yourself what you spend your time on that’s bullshit, you probably already know the answer. Unnecessary meetings, pointless disputes, bureaucracy, posturing, dealing with other people’s mistakes, traffic jams, addictive but unrewarding pastimes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve found that unless I’m vigilant, the amount of bullshit in my life only ever increases. Rereading <em>Life is Short</em> every so often gives me a kick in the pants to figure out what <em>really</em> matters and how to get the bullshit levels back down.</p>

<p>Derek Sivers, <a href="https://sivers.org/kimo" target="_blank">There is no speed limit</a>, in which he learns a semester’s worth of music theory in an afternoon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Within a minute, he started quizzing me. “If the 5-chord with the flat-7 has that tri-tone, then so does another flat-7 chord. Which one?”</p>
<p>“Uh… the flat-2 chord?”</p>
<p>“Right! So that’s a substitute chord. Any flat-7 chord can be substituted with the other flat-7 that shares the same tri-tone. So reharmonize all the chords you can in this chart. Go.”</p>
<p>The pace was intense, and I loved it. Finally, someone was challenging me — keeping me in over my head — encouraging and expecting me to pull myself up quickly. I was learning so fast, it felt like the adrenaline rush you get while playing a video game. He tossed every fact at me and made me prove that I got it.</p>
<p>In our three-hour lesson that morning, he taught me a full semester of Berklee’s harmony courses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was one of the major inspirations for <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/impatient/">Be impatient</a>. Every time I reread it, I think of at least one thing where I’m setting myself a speed limit for no reason!</p>
<hr>
<p>Sam Altman, <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful" target="_blank">How To Be Successful</a>. Sam might have observed more successful people more closely than anyone else on the planet, and the advice is as good as you’d expect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Focus is a force multiplier on work.</p>
<p>Almost everyone I’ve ever met would be well-served by spending more time thinking about what to focus on. It is much more important to work on the right thing than it is to work many hours. Most people waste most of their time on stuff that doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>Once you have figured out what to do, be unstoppable about getting your small handful of priorities accomplished quickly. I have yet to meet a slow-moving person who is very successful.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Almost always, the people who say “I am going to keep going until this works, and no matter what the challenges are I’m going to figure them out”, and mean it, go on to succeed. They are persistent long enough to give themselves a chance for luck to go their way.</p>
<p>… To be willful, you have to be optimistic—hopefully this is a personality trait that can be improved with practice. I have never met a very successful pessimistic person.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are lots of different points here, so this one especially bears rereading!</p>
<hr>
<p>R. W. Hamming, <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/dahlin/bookshelf/hamming.html" target="_blank">You and your research</a>. Hamming observed almost as many great scientists as Sam Altman did founders. He had some interesting conclusions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At first I asked what were the important problems in chemistry, then what important problems they were working on, or problems that might lead to important results. One day I asked, “if what they were working on was not important, and was not likely to lead to important things, they why were they working on them?” After that I had to eat with the engineers!</p>
<p>About four months later, my friend stopped me in the hall and remarked that my question had bothered him. He had spent the summer thinking about the important problems in his area, and while had had not changed his research he thought it was well worth the effort. I thanked him and kept walking. A few weeks later I noticed that he was made head of the department. Many years later he became a member of the National Academy of Engineering. The one person who could hear the question went on to do important things and all the others—so far as I know—did not do anything worth public attention.</p>
<p>… Some people work with their doors open in clear view of those who pass by, while others carefully protect themselves from interruptions. Those with the door open get less work done each day, but those with their door closed tend not know what to work on, nor are they apt to hear the clues to the missing piece to one of their “list” problems. I cannot prove that the open door produces the open mind, or the other way around. I only can observe the correlation. I suspect that each reinforces the other, that an open door will more likely lead you and important problems than will a closed door.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>There is another trait that took me many years to notice, and that is the ability to tolerate ambiguity. Most people want to believe what they learn is the truth: there are a few people who doubt everything. If you believe too much then you are not likely to find the essentially new view that transforms a field, and if you doubt too much you will not be able to do much at all. It is a fine balance between believing what you learn and at the same time doubting things. Great steps forward usually involve a change of viewpoint to outside the standard ones in the field.</p>
<p>While you are leaning things you need to think about them and examine them from many sides. By connecting them in many ways with what you already know…. you can later retrieve them in unusual situations. It took me a long time to realize that each time I learned something I should put “hooks” on it. This is another face of the extra effort, the studying more deeply, the going the extra mile, that seems to be characteristic of great scientists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hamming is an unusual combination of (a) a great scientist himself, (b) curious and thoughtful about what makes others great, and (c) honest and open about his observations (it seems).</p>

<p>Anonymous, <a href="https://autotranslucence.wordpress.com/2018/03/30/becoming-a-magician/" target="_blank">Becoming a Magician</a>—on how to become a person that your current self would perceive as magical:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The description was about five or six handwritten pages long, and at the time, it was a manifestation of desperate longing to be somewhere other than where I was, someone who felt free and cared for. At the time I saw that description as basically an impossibility; my life could never be so amazing in reality.</p>
<p>Fast forward about seven or ten years and I rediscovered the description when I was moving old notebooks and journals from one dusty storage spot to another. As I read through it, I discovered that 90% of the statements I had made in that description were true (or true in spirit). … It was incredible to me, despite all the changes that had happened in my life since when I wrote the passage, that I had basically become the person whose life I had dreamed of living as a teenager.</p>
<p>That’s pretty fucking cool.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>And then came Sanatan Dinda. An Indian visual artist from Kolkata, he didn’t even make the finals the first year he competed, and the next year he placed second with a style that broke half a dozen of the implicit rules of ‘good artwork’ at the competition. … [T]he third year he came he won the entire competition by something like ten percent of the total awarded points over the next artist in second place.</p>
<p>… The thing that confused me though was this – I could not work out how he did it. Like, I had zero mental model of how he created that piece in the same timeframe we all had; how he came up with it, designed it, practiced it. Even though he placed first and I placed fifth and logically we both existed on a scale of ‘competence at bodypainting’ it seemed like the skills required were completely different.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The exercise they suggest is a really useful activity for weekly (or monthly or yearly) reviews. Highly recommended!</p>
<hr>
<p>Dan Luu, <a href="https://danluu.com/p95-skill/" target="_blank">95th percentile isn’t that good</a>. Great for cultivating self-improvement mindset by reminding you how easy (in some sense) it is to make huge improvements at something:</p>

		<p>Philosophically, Replit and Rails are incredibly aligned. We both exist to remove excessive configuration and complexity that stands in the way of building things. However, for a long time, it bothered me that Replit didn't work well with Rails because we focus on small and lightweight projects. Recently, our infrastructure has gotten much more powerful, and I decided to give Rails another spin. It turns out it's not only possible to do Rails on Replit; it's quite a delightful experience. It takes less than 30 seconds from starting a project to seeing the welcome screen:</p>

<p>There is no magic under the hood. You can view the <a href="https://repl.it/@templates/Rails">template here</a>. I merely followed the getting started guide on the rails site and had to do only a couple of modifications to make the development website show up in the iframe on Replit (detailed in the readme file).</p>
<p>Give it a spin, and let me know what you think!</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<div><p>The first batch of the repaired Raspberry Pi’s have been sold! If you missed out on this, don’t worry! There are more to come as I repair them. </p><p>I sold a total of 27 Raspberry Pi’s, 3 people cancelled their orders as they somehow thought these were Raspberry Pi 4’s?! I will relist these  during the week along with a few freshly repaired devices with upgraded SD card slots.</p></div>



<p>After ebay fees and P&amp;P the total was £400 which I have donated to the Raspberry Pi Foundation as can be seen below, more will be coming in a future post to show what this money will go towards. </p>

<h2>Replacing and Upgrading Damaged SD Card Slots</h2>



<p>A large amount of the Pi’s had damaged SD card slots, the original slots are made of plastic which was fairly brittle in 2012 when they were released and they really haven’t aged well! </p>

<p>As can be seen on this image the slots have crumbled meaning they no longer hold an SD card. I managed to source the original SD card slots although the seller wanted £2 each for them which just wasn’t worthwhile. I managed to source upgraded metal SD card slots for £0.14p each on aliexpress here: <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33012711993.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33012711993.html</a></p>



<div><p>Removing the old SD card slot was easy, using a pair of snips I cut as much of the plastic away as possible leaving only the pins to remove.

<p>Overall this was a very easy repair, I will post some detailed guides or maybe even videos on the repairs once I get through some of the backlog so don’t worry if this repair wasn’t in-depth enough for you. </p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<div><p>This SD card slots arriving from China allows me to repair a further 30 of the damaged Raspberry Pi’s which will be for sale soon – Remember that the profits from these sales goes to the Raspberry Pi Foundation. </p><p>The pace will be slowing down a little once this batch of repairs are complete as I have some upcoming hardware reviews I need to prepare for which will be showcased in future posts. </p></div>



<p>As always please leave a comment and share your thoughts on the repair process. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/xiaomi">Xiaomi</a> has taken a step further to prosecute the US government on the investment ban which resists Americans from investing in the Chinese smartphone maker.</p>
<p>The U.S. Defense and Treasury Departments, is making move to take out the Xiaomi from a list of companies having affiliation with China’s military.</p>
<p>Early in the January, former US President, Donald Trump, had included the company on the Pentagon blacklist which prevents Americans from investing in the tech company. Trump had accused Xiaomi that it has strong ties with the Chinese military. This allegation was later denied. Xiaomi had tried to convince that it is not a “Communist Chinese Military Company”.</p>
<p>Now, in spite of the fact that Trump has been relieved of his office as the president, the investment ban still continues.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-xiaomi-complaint/chinas-xiaomi-files-legal-complaint-against-u-s-defense-treasury-ban-idUSKBN29Z01A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuter</a>, in the complaint, which was addressed to the new Defense Secretary, Lloyd Austin, and the Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, Xiaomi has expressed their grief by calling the judgment “unlawful and unconstitutional” and stressed that the company was not being controlled by the China army.</p>
<p>Challenging the ban, Xiaomi has taken the step to sue the US government. An application has now been in the bid to reverse the ban order.</p>
<p>Xiaomi had stressed, in their court filling, should the ban continues the company will face “imminent, severe, and irreparable harm”.</p>
<p>The court filing read:<br>
<em>“This action has challenges the Trump Administration’s unlawful designation on January 14, 2021, of Plaintiff Xiaomi, a consumer electronics company, as a Communist Chinese military company (“CCMC”) subject to Executive Order 13959. As a result of that designation, U.S. persons will no longer be able to purchase publicly traded Xiaomi securities or derivatives of those securities as of March 15, 2021, and must divest their holdings by January 14, 2022. As explained below, the designation of Xiaomi as a CCMC (the “Designation”) is unlawful and should be enjoined. By failing to provide a reasoned explanation for the Designation, and by making a designation decision that necessarily runs counter to any accurate evidence before the agencies, the Departments of Defense and Treasury engaged in arbitrary and capricious decision making, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”),”&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>“As relevant here, the Order prohibits transactions by any U.S. persons in publicly traded securities of certain companies that the Department of Defense, in consultation with the Department of the Treasury, designates as a “Communist Chinese military company.” President Trump amended Executive Order 13959 on January 13, 2021. Exec. Order No. 13974, 86 Fed. Reg. 4875 (Jan. 13, 2021) (attached as Ex. B). As amended, the Order provides that the prohibitions on transactions of CCMC securities or derivatives of those securities by U.S. persons take effect 60 days after a company is designated,”</em></p>
<p>Xiaomi had earlier disclosed that it been complying with US law and made a confirmation that it’s not owned, controlled or in affiliation with the Chinese military.</p>
<p>More than 70% of the Xiaomi’s voting rights, were held by the co-founders, Lin Bin and Lei Jun, and not owned or controlled by any individual or entity associated with the military.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this article, I will attempt to convince you that 'awk' is a great tool to learn for solving one-off text manipulation and analysis problems. &nbsp;After learning awk, you'll immediately be accepted into the "10x engineer's club" and be cured of your imposter syndrome. &nbsp;From now on, your typical team meetings will go something like this:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Manager</strong>: &nbsp;"Hey, let's make a well-informed data-driven decision about which product to focus on selling. &nbsp;Do we have any numbers on which product(s) make the most profit in total?".</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>All 1x Engineers in the room</strong> (<em>speaking together in a synchronized monotone voice</em>): "Nah, we'd have to write an ETL job to import the .csv files and write many Java Classes. &nbsp;It would take at least 4 weeks.".</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>You</strong>: "I just spent 30 seconds writing an awk one-liner to calculate the profit for each product. &nbsp;Here is the list sorted from highest to lowest."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Manager</strong>: "Thanks. I value your expertise, and have a great appreciation for your contributions to this company."</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awk is a command-line tool that can be used for processing text files line by line. &nbsp;The 'awk' command could be compared to the 'grep' or 'sed' commands. &nbsp;In fact, many of the basic use cases for 'grep' or 'sed' can actually be solved in a nearly identically way by awk. &nbsp;Therefore, an important question worth asking is: &nbsp;If some of the use cases for awk are replicated by 'sed' or 'grep', why would you ever want to use awk? &nbsp;The answer is that awk is a fully-fledged programming language. &nbsp;The 'grep' command is specifically designed for searching, and the 'sed' command is specifically designed for replacing. &nbsp;Awk is able to do both at the same time, but even more importantly, 'awk' gives you access to things that a 'real' programming language has, like math or logic operations, formatted printing, arrays, etc.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, you may wonder, if 'awk' acts like a 'real' programming language, why not stick to another established 'real' programming language like Python? &nbsp;The answer is that 'awk' was specifically designed to serve in this middle-ground area of 'sort of command-line' and 'sort of programming language'. &nbsp;It's definitely possible to insert Python into the middle of a shell pipe (with python -c), but it quickly gets pretty messy. &nbsp;Awk, on the other hand, is much better suited for the task, and it includes a <em>lot</em> of default assumptions that make it very terse (but also intimidating to beginners).</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's a specific example of a problem that 'awk' can solve, but 'grep' or 'sed' can't. &nbsp;The following file 'temps.csv' contains a list of temperature values:</p>

<p><code><pre>temp	unit
26.1	C
78.1	F
23.1	C
25.7	C
76.3	F
77.3	F
24.2	C
79.3	F
27.9	C
75.1	F
25.9	C
79.0	F
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these temperature values are stated in Celsius, while other are stated in Fahrenheit. &nbsp;In a case like this, you might want to normalize these values to use the same unit so that you can graph them, or compute an average etc. &nbsp;You can do exactly that with the following 'awk' command:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>'</span><span>NR==1; NR&gt;1{print ($2=="F" ? ($1-32) / 1.8 : $1)"\tC"}</span><span>'</span> temps.csv
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which gives the following output:</p>

<p><code><pre>temp	unit
26.1	C
25.6111	C
23.1	C
25.7	C
24.6111	C
25.1667	C
24.2	C
26.2778	C
27.9	C
23.9444	C
25.9	C
26.1111	C
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To understand how this awk command works, let's work on re-building it from scratch. &nbsp;Here is a much simpler awk command that shows how it will automatically parse and split up the two columns for us so we can work with them separately:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>'</span><span>{print "First column item: " $1 " Second column item: " $2 }</span><span>'</span> temps.csv
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which gives the following output:</p>

<p><code><pre>First column item: temp Second column item: unit
First column item: 26.1 Second column item: C
First column item: 78.1 Second column item: F
First column item: 23.1 Second column item: C
First column item: 25.7 Second column item: C
First column item: 76.3 Second column item: F
First column item: 77.3 Second column item: F
First column item: 24.2 Second column item: C
First column item: 79.3 Second column item: F
First column item: 27.9 Second column item: C
First column item: 75.1 Second column item: F
First column item: 25.9 Second column item: C
First column item: 79.0 Second column item: F
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the columns in the original file are separated by white-space, the awk command will automatically split up the 'columns' and make them accessible inside the '$1' and '$2' variables. &nbsp;As you can see, our last example simply prints these out without doing any kind of logic on them. &nbsp;This stuff inside the {...} characters is called the 'action' statement.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By default (on my machine), awk will attempt to run every single 'action' statement on every line of the file. &nbsp;In our case, we don't actually want our special print statement to run on every line of the file. &nbsp;In particular, we don't want to make changes to the first line, since it's just the list of column headers. &nbsp;We can add the requirement that our special print statement should only occur on 'record number greater than 1', or 'NR&gt;1'. &nbsp;'NR' stands for Number of Record:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>'</span><span>NR&gt;1{print "First column item: " $1 " Second column item: " $2 }</span><span>'</span> temps.csv
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this won't print out the header <em>at all</em>. &nbsp;To print out the first line without changing it, we can add the statement 'NR==1;' to our awk command. &nbsp;The 'NR==1' part means "Only do this on the record #1", and the ';' part is an empty statement which defaults to printing out the current line without changing it:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>'</span><span>NR==1; NR&gt;1{print "First column item: " $1 " Second column item: " $2 }</span><span>'</span> temps.csv
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is the output from this command:</p>

<p><code><pre>temp unit
First column item: 26.1 Second column item: C
First column item: 78.1 Second column item: F
First column item: 23.1 Second column item: C
First column item: 25.7 Second column item: C
First column item: 76.3 Second column item: F
First column item: 77.3 Second column item: F
First column item: 24.2 Second column item: C
First column item: 79.3 Second column item: F
First column item: 27.9 Second column item: C
First column item: 75.1 Second column item: F
First column item: 25.9 Second column item: C
First column item: 79.0 Second column item: F
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now we're almost back at the full command that we started off with. &nbsp;We just need to add the temperature normalizing part. &nbsp;The logic/math for normalizing to Celsius units would look something like this:</p>

<p><code><pre>if<span>(</span><span>$2</span><span>==</span><span>"</span><span>F</span><span>"</span><span>)</span><span>{</span>
  <span>print</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>$1</span>-32<span>)</span> / <span>1</span>.<span>8</span> 
<span>}</span><span>else</span><span>{</span>
  <span>print</span><span> </span><span>$1</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or, we could re-write this using the ternary operator as the following:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>print</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>$2</span><span>==</span><span>"</span><span>F</span><span>"</span><span> ? </span><span>(</span><span>$1</span><span>-32</span><span>)</span><span> / </span><span>1</span><span>.</span><span>8</span><span> : </span><span>$1</span><span>)</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Substituting this back into our print statement gives us the full solution that was introduced previously:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>'</span><span>NR==1; NR&gt;1{print ($2=="F" ? ($1-32) / 1.8 : $1)"\tC"}</span><span>'</span> temps.csv
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final output that was shown before was not very nice to look at since most of the converted Fahrenheit values had way too many digits after the decimal place. &nbsp;To fix this, we can use the more sophisticated 'printf' to do a formatted print operation and make the output look even better:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>'</span><span>NR==1; NR&gt;1{printf("%.1f\t%c\n",($2=="F" ? ($1-32) / 1.8 : $1),"C")}</span><span>'</span> temps.csv
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which outputs the following:</p>

<p><code><pre>temp	unit
26.1	C
25.6	C
23.1	C
25.7	C
24.6	C
25.2	C
24.2	C
26.3	C
27.9	C
23.9	C
25.9	C
26.1	C
</pre></code></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to split up the columns in each line, awk needs to know what the 'field separator' is. &nbsp;The default field separator can be different on different systems or different implementations of awk, but you can often assume it to be 'white-space' for some definition of white-space. &nbsp;You can also explicitly specify it using the '-F' flag. &nbsp;For example, here is the same awk command we just used, but using a comma for the field separator:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>-F</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span>'</span> <span>'</span><span>NR==1; NR&gt;1{printf("%.1f,%c\n",($2=="F" ? ($1-32) / 1.8 : $1),"C")}</span><span>'</span> temps.csv
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and here it is again with an explicitly specified tab character:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>-F</span><span>'</span><span>\t</span><span>'</span> <span>'</span><span>NR==1; NR&gt;1{printf("%.1f\t%c\n",($2=="F" ? ($1-32) / 1.8 : $1),"C")}</span><span>'</span> temps.csv
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Field separators can even be regular expressions:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>col1-481-col2-981-col3</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| awk <span>-F</span><span>'</span><span>-[0-9]{3}-</span><span>'</span> <span>'</span><span>{print $1" "$2" "$3}</span><span>'</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outputs the following:</p>

<p><code><pre>col1 col2 col3
</pre></code></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>False.</strong> &nbsp;Awk is extremely <em>easy</em> to learn. &nbsp;The reason that it <em>seems</em> so hard to learn is because awk has so many implicit defaults, but nobody ever seems to explain this fact.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can think of every awk command as a collection of 'if statements' that run against every line in the file. &nbsp;The syntax of every awk command looks pretty close to something like this:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>'</span><span>if(PATTERN1){...print something...} if(PATTERN2){...print something...} ...</span><span>'</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the one exception beging that the 'if' keyword is never actually written out since it's assumed to be there by default (if you do write it, you'll get a syntax error). &nbsp;Therefore, the overall syntax for every awk command (that doesn't rely on defaults) is pretty much this:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>'</span><span>(PATTERN1){...Action 1...} (PATTERN2){...Action 2...} ...</span><span>'</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the above command, the 'PATTERN1' or 'PATTERN2' is the trigger you want to cause the stuff inside the '{' '}' characters to actually execute. &nbsp;Here are a few examples of commonly used patterns:</p>

<p><code><pre>
<span>echo</span><span> -e </span><span>"</span><span>hello</span><span>\n</span><span>world</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| awk <span>'</span><span>(NR==2){print $0}</span><span>'</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will output:</p>

<p><code><pre>world
</pre></code>


<code><pre>

<span>echo</span><span> -e </span><span>"</span><span>hello</span><span>\n</span><span>there</span><span>\n</span><span>world</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| awk <span>'</span><span>($0 ~ /l/){print $0}</span><span>'</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will output:</p>

<p><code><pre>hello
world
</pre></code>


<code><pre>
<span>echo</span><span> -e </span><span>"</span><span>acb def</span><span>\n</span><span>something else</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| awk <span>'</span><span>(length($1) &gt; 5){print $2}</span><span>'</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will output:</p>

<p><code><pre>else
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This provides some context on what you can do in the 'pattern' part, but what about the 'action' part? &nbsp;Well, you can use your imagination since that's where awk becomes a fully fledged programming language. &nbsp;Here is an example awk command that will iterate over every character in the 3rd column on the 4th line and print out each character on a different line:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>echo</span><span> -e </span><span>"</span><span>a a a a</span><span>\n</span><span>a a a a</span><span>\n</span><span>a a a a</span><span>\n</span><span>a a hello_there a</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| awk <span>'</span><span>(NR==4){</span>
<span>  n_chrs = split($3, individual_characters, "")</span>
<span>  for (i=1; i &lt;= n_chrs; i++){</span>
<span>    printf("Here is character number %d : %c\n", i, …</span></pre></code></p></div></div></div>

			<p><em>In this piece, author Jessica Flanigan makes the case that UBI is a better solution than raising the minimum wage, because UBI reaches all workers, paid and unpaid, and would also provide all workers the bargaining power to better choose where and how they want to work. — Scott Santens, Editor, BIT</em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm?source=post_page---------------------------">latest jobs report from the BLS</a> reports a sudden acceleration of an ongoing trend of job growth, and unemployment in the US is now around 3.7 percent. Despite these impressive job numbers, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2018/10/04/if-real-wages-arent-rising-how-is-household-income-going-up/?source=post_page---------------------------">real wages remain low</a> for American workers. Perhaps in light of this, The U.S. House of Representatives passed the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-democratic-push-to-raise-minimum-wage-opens-rift-over-amount-of-hike/2019/04/12/05711400-5d2d-11e9-98d4-844088d135f2_story.html?utm_term=.70a79b170fa0&amp;source=post_page---------------------------">Raise the Wage Act</a> this week, which reflects the goal of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_for_$15?source=post_page---------------------------">Fight for $15</a> campaign: increase the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 an hour.</p>
<p>The idea polls well. A <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/426780-poll-a-majority-of-voters-want-a-15-minimum-wage?source=post_page---------------------------">majority of voters</a> support raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour as well. And most <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/2020-democratic-candidates-embrace-a-15-minimum-wage?source=post_page---------------------------">2020 Democratic presidential candidates</a>, including Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders, support a $15 federal minimum wage too.</p>
<p>And it may seem that conditions are perfect for changing the federal minimum wage — unemployment is low, and the idea has a lot of support. But it’s worth thinking about proposals for a $15 federal minimum wage not only in light of Americans’ current economic circumstances but also in light of projected changes to the workforce going forward.</p>
<blockquote><p>A higher minimum wage may benefit people who have jobs, but it doesn’t make life easier for people who aren’t workers. This is what makes the idea of a Universal Basic Income or Negative Income Tax a more promising route. Essentially, if we are interested in helping those most in need, we should focus on policies that put cash in all people’s pockets instead of just the pockets of hourly employees.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, the advantage of these programs over a $15 minimum wage is that they benefit all citizens and do not disproportionately benefit workers and burden employers. And unlike other costly redistributive policies such as student loan forgiveness and universal healthcare, UBI is better suited to reflect each person’s distinctive circumstances, preferences, and personal values. Below, I outline several reasons why more people should consider the UBI as a viable public policy.</p>
<p>Considering the UBI over the Fight for $15</p>
<p>Overall, the UBI does not rely on maintaining our current economic order in the way that policies that focus on benefiting workers do. This is an advantage because the economy is very likely going to change radically in the next century. Though today’s workers are <a href="http://rh-us.mediaroom.com/2019-06-05-49-Of-Workers-Believe-AI-And-Automation-Will-Have-No-Impact-On-Their-Job?source=post_page---------------------------">not very concerned</a> about automation, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/2/17524822/robot-automation-job-threat-what-happens-next?source=post_page---------------------------">economists</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/06/automation-destroy-millions-jobs-change?source=post_page---------------------------">policy experts</a> argue that they should be.</p>
<p>Even if new technology does not cause significant job losses, workplace transformations associated with new technology are likely to have significant <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2018/04/18/will-robots-and-ai-take-your-job-the-economic-and-political-consequences-of-automation/?source=post_page---------------------------">political and economic consequences</a>. Tying the provision of public benefits to participation in the workforce needlessly raises the stakes of any policy that could change the composition of the workforce, and therefore increases the political and economic risks associated with automation. Moreover, the UBI doesn’t limit its benefits to people who are engaged in paid employment. This has four benefits that a higher minimum wage does not.</p>
<p>First, a UBI would benefit people who do valuable unpaid labor, such as childcare and eldercare, as well as people who are employees.</p>
<p>Second, a UBI would not interfere with workers’ and employers’ freedom to set the terms and conditions of their labor. If it is possible to benefit low-income Americans without restricting their freedom to negotiate the terms and conditions of their employment relationships, officials should favor the less restrictive policies.</p>
<p>Third, a UBI would not tie people to their employers. This means that a basic income would potentially enable more economic mobility, enhance workers’ bargaining power, and enable people to stop working if they need to leave the workforce due to disability or caregiving obligations.</p>
<p>Fourth, policies that do not tie assistance to employment would not disproportionately burden employers. The debate over minimum wage increases is often framed as if employers are failing to benefit workers sufficiently. But low-wage work often helps low-skill workers more than anyone else. Without these employment opportunities, they would be even less capable of meeting their basic needs. If the justification for a higher minimum wage is that everyone should be able to support themselves, why should employers bear the full cost of meeting that goal? In contrast, a basic income enables citizens to share the cost of supporting a social safety net rather than treating employers as the only way to achieve it.</p>
<p>A significant benefit of a UBI, in contrast to other recent entitlement reforms such as student loan forgiveness and universal healthcare, is that it doesn’t tell people how to spend it. People have different values, but in-kind benefits assume that all people have the same interest in healthcare or being debt-free. This may be broadly true, but there are tradeoffs. Given the cost of these programs, it’s fair to ask whether people would be better off if we just gave them the money instead. But evidence from developing countries suggests that<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/opinion/let-them-eat-cash.html?source=post_page---------------------------"> cash does help people better than alternatives</a>.</p>
<p>As I see it, the main challenge to a Basic Income proposal is affordability. Estimates vary, and some argue that a UBI would be <a href="https://socialprotection-humanrights.org/resource/universal-basic-income-proposals-in-light-of-ilo-standards-key-issues-and-global-costing-ess-%e2%94%80-working-paper-no-62/?source=post_page---------------------------">catastrophically</a> <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2015/05/23/basically-unaffordable?source=post_page---------------------------">expensive</a> whereas others suggest that it is “<a href="https://medium.com/basic-income/basic-income-is-easily-affordable-8389995528b3?source=post_page---------------------------">easily affordable</a>.” Plausibly, while a UBI would save on administrative costs, it does seem that funding sustainable UBI could require making some <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/06/04/of-course-we-can-afford-a-universal-basic-income-do-we-want-one-though/?source=post_page---------------------------#50c7d99f323c">hard choices</a> about other social programs such as healthcare, education, and defense.</p>
<p>The UBI and Social Security</p>
<p>UBI may seem like a radical idea, but there’s a precedent for it in America. Elderly people already receive what is effectively a basic income through Social Security. Some of them continue to work, while others use their basic income (and retirement savings) to pay their bills so that they can focus on spending time with loved ones or pursuing new hobbies. Some elderly people are disabled, and Social Security enables them to leave the workforce.</p>
<p>Yet older voters <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/435278-poll-most-voters-oppose-a-universal-basic-income-programs?source=post_page---------------------------">consistently</a> <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/375587-gallup-poll-americans-split-on-giving-a-universal-basic-income-to-workers?source=post_page---------------------------">oppose</a> Universal Basic Income proposals while younger voters are in favor of it. Even more curiously, older voters <a href="https://www.pollingreport.com/social.htm?source=post_page---------------------------">consistently</a> <a href="https://socialsecurityworks.org/2019/03/26/social-security-polling/?source=post_page---------------------------">oppose</a> cuts to their basic income, Social Security. The difficult position for older voters is that the reasons for opposing a basic income are also reasons to oppose social security. And those who support Social Security should support a basic income as well. Those who oppose the UBI should rethink their support for Social Security. If anything, the case for a UBI is stronger than the case for Social Security because as it is currently structured, <a href="https://www.nber.org/digest/may00/w7520.html?source=post_page---------------------------">Social Security may be a slightly regressive policy</a>, in part <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-mortality-social-security-20180912-story.html?source=post_page---------------------------">because wealthy people live longer.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/2014/09/political-authority-and-the-basic-income/?source=post_page---------------------------">Elsewhere</a>, I have argued in favor of a basic income because it is a kind of compensation for the injustices associated with our existing property system. In contrast, minimum wage requirements only compound the injustices of the current system by doubling down on the idea that elevates paid employment over other kinds of potentially valuable work, discourages opportunities for low-skilled workers, and leaves non-workers out of the social safety net. A basic income is more respectful of people’s freedom, more sensitive to recipients’ values, and better suited for a rapidly changing economy.</p>

                            <div>
                                
<p><strong>Note: </strong>The original version of this post highlighted the disadvantages of using a fixed key frame interval. I’ve since learned that this problem can be avoided using intra refresh in the H264 stream.</p>



<p>Streaming media. specifically video, is a fickle beast. This will be a short post, but it will cover everything you need to know to stream media using FFmpeg to WebRTC clients. This technique has many applications, such as streaming synchronized videos to users. </p>



<h2>Setting up the input</h2>



<p>Before inputting a file into FFmpeg, we need to pass a few flags:</p>



<pre><code>&gt; ffmpeg \
  -v info \
  -fflags +genpts \
  -protocol_whitelist pipe,tls,file,http,https,tcp,rtp \</code></pre>



<p>These flags set the log level to info, generate pts if they’re missing, and sets up the protocols we can use. Next we need to provide the input to FFmpeg.</p>



<pre><code>-i in.mp4</code></pre>



<p>In this example, a file name <code>in.mp4</code> is used, but a http(s) URL could also be used. This command starts playback at the beginning of the input file. If you want to start playback in the middle of the input file, then you can add the <code>-ss &lt;time in secs&gt;</code> flag <strong>before</strong> <code>-i</code>.</p>



<h2>Video arguments</h2>



<p>Now the video needs to be converted to an appropriate format for streaming. The format is specific to the application, but common codecs are H264, VP8, and VP9. This example uses H264 due to its ubiquitous support.</p>



<pre><code>-vf realtime,scale=w=min(iw\,1280):h=-2 \
-map 0:v:0 \
-c:v libx264 \
-x264-params intra-refresh=1,fast-pskip=0
-threads 3 \
-profile:v baseline \
-level:v 3.1 \
-pix_fmt yuv420p \
-tune zerolatency \
-minrate 500K \
-maxrate 1.3M \
-bufsize 500K \</code></pre>



<p><code>-vf</code> specifies the video filters to apply. Here, two filters are applied. The first is <code>realtime</code>, which causes playback to happen in real time, which is necessary for streaming. This filter is similar to the <code>-re</code> flag, but works much better with the start time flag (<code>-ss</code>). The second filter scales the video width to a maximum of 1280 pixels while maintaining the aspect ratio. This is important to keep the bitrate appropriate for real time streaming. </p>



<p>The <code>intra-refresh</code> parameter allows users to consume the video stream mid-way through by providing enough metadata over multiple inter frames to decode a full frame. The <code>fast-pskip=0</code>is required for <code>intra-refresh</code> to work if the source video files contains very few frames, which can happen if the video displays static images for long periods of time. There may be another way around this, but I’m not aware of it. </p>



<p>Another important parameter is the <code>-threads 3</code> flag. FFmpeg will use many threads by the default. Normally, this is good because it produces the final result as fast as possible. For real time encoding, however, using a large number of threads has some overhead that can slow down real time output. Using many threads is also a bad idea if you’re running multiple instances of FFmpeg concurrently.</p>



<p>The next two parametrs <code>-profile:v</code> and <code>-level:v</code> specify the profile and level to use for the encoding. These are specific to H264. WebRTC clients can only decode certain profiles and levels, so these need to match the specific configuration of the application. These roughly correspond to the profile-level-id of <code>42e01f</code>. </p>



<p>The pixel format is set to <code>yuv420p</code> using the <code>-pix_fmt</code> flag. This is required as this is the only pixel format supported by WebRTC. <code>-tune zerolatency</code> tunes the encoder for low latency streaming.</p>



<p>Next up are the bitrate parameters. When streaming media, the bitrate should be as low as possible while maintaining the desired quality. This ensures all clients can consume the video in real time. Omitting the <code>-minrate</code> parameter can cause FFmpeg to produce output with an unnecessarily high bitrate. Setting the <code>-maxrate</code> is equally important. A DSL connection can only pull down around 2 Mbps. In order for users to watch the video, they must be able to download it in real time, so the maximum bitrate has to be lower than the slowest connection among your users. Another consideration is that the streaming video might not be the only bandwidth consuming task on the user’s network.</p>



<h2>Audio arguments</h2>



<p>The audio arguments are much simpler.</p>



<pre><code>-af arealtime \
-map 0:a:0 \
-c:a libopus \
-ab 128k \
-ac 2 \
-ar 48000 \</code></pre>



<p>The main thing to note here is that the <code>arealtime</code> filter is used, which is similar to the <code>realtime</code> filter, but for audio.</p>



<h2>Output arguments</h2>



<p>The output can be piped to an RTP endpoint using the <code>tee</code> psuedomuxer. Unfortunately, FFmpeg does not support multiplexing over RTP, so you’ll need two separate RTP endpoints, one for the video stream and one for the audio stream. </p>



<pre><code>-f tee \
[select=a:f=rtp:ssrc=1111:payload_type=&lt;audio-payload_type&gt;]rtp://&lt;audio-ip&gt;:&lt;audio-port&gt;?rtcpport=&lt;audio-rtcpport&gt;|[select=v:f=rtp:ssrc=2222:payload_type=&lt;video-payload_type&gt;]rtp://&lt;video-ip&gt;:&lt;video-port&gt;?rtcpport=&lt;video-rtcpport&gt;</code></pre>



<p>Now you can stream video over RTP! The full command is</p>



<pre><code>&gt; ffmpeg \
  -v info \
  -fflags +genpts \
  -protocol_whitelist pipe,tls,file,http,https,tcp,rtp \
  -i in.mp4
  -vf realtime,scale=w=min(iw\,1280):h=-2 \
  -map 0:v:0 \
  -c:v libx264 \
  -x264-params intra-refresh=1,fast-pskip=0
  -threads 3 \
  -profile:v baseline \
  -level:v 3.1 \
  -pix_fmt yuv420p \
  -tune zerolatency \
  -minrate 500K \
  -maxrate 1.3M \
  -bufsize 500K \
  -af arealtime \
  -map 0:a:0 \
  -c:a libopus \
  -ab 128k \
  -ac 2 \
  -ar 48000 \
  -f tee \
  [select=a:f=rtp:ssrc=1111:payload_type=&lt;payload_type&gt;]rtp://&lt;ip&gt;:&lt;port&gt;?rtcpport=&lt;rtcpport&gt;|[select=v:f=rtp:ssrc=2222:payload_type=&lt;payload_type&gt;]rtp://&lt;ip&gt;:&lt;port&gt;?rtcpport=&lt;rtcpport&gt;</code></pre>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>I recently switched my home office to a 2-by-4K HiDPI setup, like so:</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/hidpi-setup.jpg"><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/hidpi-setup.jpg" alt="A picture of my home office."></a></p>

<p>As part of that switch, I needed to configure parts of my Linux environment (which was originally
stock Ubuntu, but is now <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a> with a heavily customized userspace) to function
correctly on HiDPI displays.</p>

<p>This post will document most of the changes I applied. Hopefully others will find it useful for
their own HiDPI setups.</p>

<h2 id="90-of-the-way-x11-resources">90% of the way: X11 resources</h2>

<p>As it turns out, there’s a (nearly) one-stop location for configuring the default DPI for
X11 applications: the <code>Xft.dpi</code> setting.</p>

<p>There are lots of ways to configure X11, but I personally use an <code>~/.Xresources</code> file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>Xft</span>.<span>dpi</span>: <span>163</span>
<span># not used directly; more on this later
</span><span>janus</span>.<span>fractionalDpi</span>: <span>1</span>.<span>63</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Where <code>163</code> and <code>1.63</code> are my DPI and its fractional form, respectively.</p>

<p>On my system, <code>~/.Xresources</code> gets loaded into the X resource database automatically by some
magic that I never configured. However, if yours doesn’t (or you use a different resource file),
you can always tell i3 (or your WM of choice) to load it explicitly with <code>xrdb</code>.</p>

<p>For example, in <code>~/.config/i3/config</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre><span>exec</span> <span>--no-startup-id</span> xrdb ~/.Xresources
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>With just this, about 90% of my applications (including GTK based ones, like Firefox) scaled
correctly and were usable without any font or custom scaling changes. Not bad for a single line!</p>

<h2 id="per-application-fixes">Per-application fixes</h2>

<h3 id="spotify">Spotify</h3>

<p>Spotify’s Linux application is a <a href="https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/src/master/">CEF</a>
shell. For reasons that are unclear to me, it doesn’t respect <code>Xft.dpi</code> while normal Chromium
(via <code>snap</code> or <code>apt</code>) does.</p>

<p>To get it to scale correctly, I needed to pass <code>--force-device-scale-factor=1.63</code> to it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>spotify <span>--force-device-scale-factor</span><span>=</span>1.63
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point, it became clear to me that the fractional form of my DPI would be nice to set in
as few places as possible, to avoid duplication. Hence the <code>janus.fractionalDpi</code><sup id="fnref:hostname" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hostname">1</a></sup> above,
and
<a href="https://github.com/woodruffw/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/spotify">this little <code>spotify</code> wrapper</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="sublime-text">Sublime Text</h3>

<p>I use <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text 3</a> as my primary editor. As far as I can tell
it doesn’t use either GTK or Qt (or any other open-source GUI framework), which is probably why
it doesn’t respect <code>Xft.dpi</code>.</p>

<p>To get Sublime Text to scale correctly, I had to set <code>ui_scale</code> to the appropriate fractional DPI
in my user preferences (<code>~/.config/sublime-text-3/Preferences.sublime-settings</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"ui_scale"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1.63</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Some lingering pain points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Sublime Text’s input is noticeably laggy when the UI is scaled. It’s not so laggy as to be
unusable, but it’s definitely noticeable even if you aren’t sensitive to latencies (I’m not).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mousing between Sublime Text and other windows causes noticeable stutter/hiccuping during
video playback. I haven’t dug into the X events yet, but my guess is that it’s got some kind
of pessimistic (and serial) <code>XFlush</code> or <code>XSync</code> that takes a decent bit of time on a larger window
buffer. It doesn’t happen with smaller windows (either floating or fixed).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="open-broadcaster-software-obs">Open Broadcaster Software (OBS)</h3>

<p>I haven’t used it recently, but I used to use <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a> to stream myself
working on open source projects.</p>

<p>When I switched monitors, I noticed that the embedded preview window for my scenes had stopped
working. OBS <em>itself</em> was still fully functional and the <em>separate</em> preview window still worked,
but the embedded preview was always filled in with black pixels.</p>

<p>After a decent bit of hair-pulling, I found a Qt environment variable that “fixed” it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre><span>QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR</span><span>=</span>0 obs
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I still don’t understand why that fixed it, but now my OBS is scaled correctly <strong>and</strong> has a
functional preview embed. I also posted this fix to the
<a href="https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/bug-fix-black-preview-embed-window-on-linux-w-hidpi-monitors.135041/">OBS forum</a>.</p>

<h3 id="feh">feh</h3>

<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/derf/feh"><code>feh</code></a> as my image viewer. By default, it seems to use
a bitmap font that’s incredibly small on HiDPI displays.</p>

<p>To fix it, I modified by default theme to use my distro supplied Ubuntu Roman-face font in
14pt.</p>

<p>In <code>~/.config/feh/themes</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>feh <span>--borderless</span> <span>--scale-down</span> <span>--conversion-timeout</span> 1 <span>\</span>
  <span>--fontpath</span> /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ubuntu <span>--menu-font</span> Ubuntu-R/14
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>One thing I haven’t figured out: when I open some higher-resolution images in <code>feh</code>, they’re
occasionally shifted to the right with transparent pixels where some of the image should be.
Clicking and dragging inside the image window causes it to re-render correctly, as does
resizing the window. Not a huge deal, but slightly annoying.</p>

<h3 id="dunst">dunst</h3>

<p>I use <a href="https://dunst-project.org/"><code>dunst</code></a> as my notification daemon.</p>

<p>It didn’t <strong>need</strong> any HiDPI-specific configuration, but I took the opportunity to make its
notifications slightly more readable on these newer displays.</p>

<p>In <code>~/.config/dunst/dunstrc</code> (among many other settings):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
</pre></td><td><pre><span>monitor</span> = <span>0</span>
<span>follow</span> = <span>mouse</span>
<span>geometry</span> = <span>"600x120-30+20"</span>
<span>icon_position</span> = <span>left</span>
<span>max_icon_size</span> = <span>64</span>
<span>icon_path</span> = /<span>usr</span>/<span>share</span>/<span>icons</span>/<span>gnome</span>/<span>64</span><span>x64</span>/<span>status</span>/:/<span>usr</span>/<span>share</span>/<span>icons</span>/<span>gnome</span>/<span>64</span><span>x64</span>/<span>devices</span>/
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="other-bits">Other bits</h2>

<h3 id="mouse-acceleration">Mouse acceleration</h3>

<p>My new displays are individually larger and significantly more dense than my previous ones, making
my mouse feel sluggish. I originally configured my mouse acceleration with
<a href="https://www.x.org/archive/X11R7.5/doc/man/man1/xset.1.html"><code>xset</code></a>, but at some point my
system switched to <code>libinput</code> and <code>libinput</code>-based inputs apparently don’t respect <code>xset</code> anymore
(or never did?). Sigh.</p>

<p>The fix is to use <code>xinput</code> instead, with either symbolic names or XIDs for the device and setting
being controlled. For example, this is what I use to set my mouse’s acceleration to the maximum
(<code>1.0</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>xinput <span>--set-prop</span> <span>"USB Optical Mouse"</span> <span>"libinput Accel Speed"</span> 1.0
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Your device and setting names may vary, of course, as may their value ranges (mine happened to be
<code>0.0</code> to <code>1.0</code>). You can use <code>xinput</code> on its own to list the names and XIDs of your devices;
<code>xinput list-props &lt;XID-or-name&gt;</code> can be used to dump a particular device’s properties and
their current values.</p>

<h3 id="i3-workspaces">i3 workspaces</h3>

<p>I use i3’s <a href="https://i3wm.org/docs/layout-saving.html">layout saving/restoring</a> functionality
to automatically load all of my workspaces and their applications when I log in.</p>

<p>Those layouts are stored in a (relaxed) JSON format via <code>i3-save-tree</code>, and contain hardcoded
coordinates. To update them for my new monitors, I just had to recreate each of my workspaces
once on my new monitors and dump them:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre><span># for each workspace (1A, 1B, ...)</span>
i3-save-tree <span>--workspace</span> 1A <span>&gt;</span> ~/.config/i3/workspaces/1A.json
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>…and then fix them up manually to enable the appropriate application swallowing rules.</p>

<h3 id="hexchat">HexChat</h3>

<p>I use <a href="https://hexchat.github.io/index.html">HexChat</a> for IRC.</p>

<p>HexChat’s config file includes individual offsets for each of the sub-panes in the GUI,
which means that it breaks badly if you change your monitor dimensions. I couldn’t figure out
how to fix them, so I ended up deleting my main <code>~/.config/hexchat/hexchat.conf</code> entirely and
recreating my preferred layout from memory. YMMV.</p>

<h3 id="system-icons">System icons</h3>

<p>I didn’t have to make any changes with respect to my system icon sizes, which is <em>probably</em>
because I actually see very few icons during normal i3 usage. Once again, YMMV.</p>

<h2 id="wrapup">Wrapup</h2>

<p>Switching from a set of 3 FHD monitors to two 4K HiDPI ones was <em>relatively</em> painless. The
problems that I had, unsurprisingly, were primarily with the few proprietary applications I use
needing to be spoon-feed DPI information in their own ways — every other problem was
either a bug (OBS + Qt) or a matter of more general reconfiguration.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody" role="main"><p>A reflection on Ram Dass’ 1971 classic, <em>Be Here Now</em>, and the book’s connection to information and our state of being.</p>

<p>Like many who walk the hallways of elite institutions, Ram Dass’ life intersected with influential mid-century thinkers and doers. His most famous collaborator might have been Timothy Leary in the early 1960s. Their landmark studies of psychedelic drugs lead to his dismissal from Harvard in 1963.</p>
<p>Ram Dass’ association with David Padwa is of more immediate interest to me. Padwa established a company called Basic Systems and became a millionaire by the time he met the young author in the late 1960s.<span><label for="sn-0"></label><span>From David Padwa’s <a href="http://www.cuke.com/people/padwa.htm">Curriculum Vitae</a>: “1960-1965. Founder and CEO of Basic Systems Inc.&nbsp;Principal offices in Cambridge, New York, Chicago, Pasadena, and Washington, DC. Firm specialized in educational and curricular technologies as well as the provision of systems integration services in education and training markets. In 1964 Xerox Corporation acquired Basic Systems; continued as division executive at Xerox and Director of Planning for educational markets.”</span></span> Basic Systems automated employee training and student education, often integrating into an institution’s existing computer infrastructure.</p>
<p>The company caught the eye of Xerox Corporation and was soon acquired. It fit nicely with Xerox’s growing digital portfolio. As the copier company sought to establish the office of the future, it would soon acquire the influential minicomputer manufacturer <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/minicomputers/11/340">Scientific Data Systems</a> and establish the legendary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)">Xerox PARC</a>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://schmud.de/img/2020-12-16-be-here-now/karateka-2.png" alt="Karateka Atari 7800 (1988)"> <em>Karateka</em> Atari 7800 (1988) <i></i> <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/images/thing/77183/karateka-1984">Board Game Geek</a>
</figure>
<p>Padwa founded Basic Systems with the influential psychologist Francis Mechner. I was first exposed to Francis Mechner as a child playing <em>Karateka</em> (1984) on my Atari 7800<span><label for="sn-1"></label><span>The original version was written by Jordan Mechner and published by Broderbund in 1984. The Atari 7800 version was written by Jack Sandberg, Sr.&nbsp;at Ibid Inc.&nbsp;and published by Atari in 1987.</span></span> and then later <em>Prince of Persia</em> (1989) on my family’s PC. Francis Mechner was the composer for these games, both written by his son <a href="http://jordanmechner.com/">Jordan Mechner</a>. The elder Mechner is something of a renaissance man: starting several successful businesses, speaking five languages, publishing cross-disciplinary theoretical insights, performing as a concert pianist, and achieving a 5-dan rating in Go.<span><label for="sn-2"></label><span>Padwa and Mechner’s company also published the <a href="https://books.google.it/books?id=TnVYAAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y">original edition</a> of “Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess” in 1966. The best-selling book is still in print today.</span></span></p>
<p>These characters provide a sampling of the environment that nurtured Ram Dass. He would soon leave these comforts to join Padwa and his Land Rover on a road trip from Tehran to India in search of a spiritual awakening.</p>
<p>Ram Dass ultimately stayed in India for some time (as did Padwa’s Land Rover), leading to the insights that birthed the book <em>Be Here Now</em>. This book’s influence is without question. It was a significant contributor to the American counterculture movement and a starting point for many Western practitioners of Buddhism and Yoga.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://schmud.de/img/2020-12-16-be-here-now/be-here-now.webp" alt="Be Here Now by Ram Dass (1971)"> <em>Be Here Now</em> by Ram Dass (1971) <i></i> <a href="https://www.gardenfairyco.com/product/be-here-now-ram-dass">Garden Fairy Co.</a>
</figure>
<p>Ram Dass spends the first part of the book describing his journey. It involves a dive into the world of psychedelic drugs and their benefits and limitations. His experience essentially opens him up to Eastern mysticism. He finds surprisingly few charlatans on the road through Central Asia and India. The book’s pivotal guru broadens Ram Dass’ mind through a process of “no teaching” because “his lessons aroused in me just affirmation… as if I knew it all already.”</p>
<p>The author strikes an important difference between <em>teacher</em> and <em>guru</em>. “A teacher points the way” while “a guru is the way.” Ram Dass’ awakening, and this book, is the result of the guru’s care.</p>
<p>This leads to a beautifully illustrated but overtly dogmatic section where Ram Dass attempts wake the reader up. The writer’s intention is rooted in Buddhism’s long practice of shifting the practitioner’s habitual and unquestioned perception of the world.<span><label for="sn-3"></label><span>The guru offers a few clever turns of phrases in this effort, “If a pickpocket meets a saint, he sees only his pockets” and “If you wear shoe leather, the whole earth is covered with leather.”</span></span> Ram Dass’ spiritual youth feels most pronounced here. He doesn’t have the language of a guru or a teacher; it is the voice of an enthusiastic lecturer who is convinced that he has uncovered the Truth.</p>
<p>The final section of the book is a collection of quotes and techniques divided into various “ingredients for a sacred life” such as <em>Sleeping</em>, <em>Truth</em>, <em>Time and Space</em>, <em>Pranayam</em>, etc…. It is pleasant reading.</p>
<p>Ram Dass makes it clear that there can be no <em>knower</em> if one truly wants to <em>know</em> the wisdom contained in <em>Be Here Now</em>; the rational mind that separates <em>subject</em> from <em>object</em> is an illusion.<span><label for="sn-4"></label><span>(Loc. 4594, 4613)</span></span> This illusion is driven by an attachment to the self as special and wholly separate from everything else.</p>

<figure>

</figure>
<p>Deep within the cartridge of <em>Karateka</em> on the Atari 7800 are a list of instructions that drive the machine. But the programmer did mix in one human-readable message with the computer code: “Mommy and Me Are One.” This bizarre statement is unique to the Atari 7800 cartridge. It does not appear in other versions. It never appears on screen. It is only visible to those who are looking at the code contained within.<span><label for="sn-5"></label><span>“<a href="https://www.digitpress.com/eastereggs/78karateka.htm">Digital Press Easter Eggs: Karateka</a>”, <em>digitpress.com</em>, 2010.</span></span></p>
<p>The phrase is almost certainly related to a paper published by Lloyd Silverman and Joel Weinberger in a 1985 edition of <em>American Psychologist</em> entitled “<a href="https://content.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0003-066X.40.12.1296">Mommy and I Are One: Implications For Psychotherapy</a>”. The authors assert that the titular message can help motivate people even when stated subliminally.</p>
<p>Countless studies have attempted to demonstrate the benefits of “oneness.” In the case of the mother, oneness is self-evident. We were all physically connected at one point. And deep within us exists a DNA code that has been directly passed from mother to child for millennia. This is the ancient information that sets the foundation for consciousness.</p>
<p>The reality of a consciousness larger than ourselves is at the root of <em>Be Here Now.</em> But rather than establish a God or a single methodology, Ram Dass continually asserts that the ego blinds us to the grand web of connections that pervade our everyday experience. The way to lift the veil is to simply practice living in the moment. Or as Suzuki Roshi is quoted, “a Zen student must learn to waste time conscientiously.”<span><label for="sn-6"></label><span>(Loc. 4728)</span></span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/russia">Russia</a>‘s parliament, is looking at placing fines on individuals and companies in the country who use Western-based satellite Internet services. The bill, if passed into law, is to avoid access to the Internet using <a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/spacex">SpaceX</a>‘s Starlink service, OneWeb, or other network means aside Russian satellite constellations under development.</p>
<p>in the Russian edition of Popular Mechanics</p>
<p>According to a recent report , the proposed fines is ranging from 10-30 thousand rubles ($135-$405) for ordinary users, and from 500 thousand to 1 million rubles ($6,750 to $13,500) for companies who make use of the Western satellite services.</p>
<p>In response to the news, Elon Musk has responded to the tweet with “We’re just trying to get people to Mars. Help would be appreciated”</p>
<p>Members of the Duma believe that accessing the Internet freely would skip the country’s System of Operational Search Measures, which is monitoring Internet usage and mobile communications..<br>
Being part of the Russia’s strict control on media and communications, all Russian Internet traffic are compelled to navigate via a Russian communications provider.</p>
<p>Russia may, over time, however, block Starlink service. Dmitry Rogozin, Russia;s Space chief sees SpaceX as a chief competitor in spaceflight.</p>
<p>Starlink, Rogozin had said in August 2020 that it’s part of “a rather marauding, strong, high-technology policy of the United States, which makes use of Shock and Awe so as to improve, ahead of other, their military interests.</p>
<p>The ban on OneWeb is rather funny, with the notion that the company uses the Russian Soyuz rocket to launch almost all of its fist constellation into orbit. Every month, OneWeb satellite launches are planned, mainly from spaceports in Baikonur, Kazahkstan, and Vostochny, Russia. OneWeb is effectively assisting to shore the striving Russian launch industry in a period when SpaceX is undersell the country on commercial launch agreements.</p>
<p>Russia has it in plan to design its own satellite internet constellation, Sfera. While its affordability is yet to stand, it is most likely to be launched in 2024, according to IntelliNews. Expected cost of the project is about 1.5 trillion rubles (around $20 billion), it would supposedly allow the Russia to effectively monitor domestic internet traffic,</p>

            <p>PostgreSQL comes with a plethora of configuration options, but changing the
default settings of some of these options drastically improves the observability
of your PostgreSQL server. You’ll want to set and configure these options before
issues crop up in production, as they can provide information essential to
understanding and resolving those issues.</p>

<p>Read on to learn more about the settings and extensions that expose metrics and
information about the inner workings of your PostgreSQL server.</p>

<h3 id="log-line-prefix">Log Line Prefix</h3>

<p>The <em>log_line_prefix</em> configuration option determines what PostgreSQL writes at
the beginning of each log line. The default depends on the specific Linux
distribution or managed solution that you’re using, but more often than not it
does not include a few items that can prove very useful in tracking down
misbehaving clients. Try this <em>log_line_prefix</em>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span>log_line_prefix</span> <span>=</span> <span>'%m [%p] %a %u %d %h '</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>It includes the timestamp (<em>%m</em>), the PID of the backend process (<em>%p</em>), the
application name (<em>%a</em>) of the client, the username which the client has connected
with (<em>%u</em>), the database which the client has connected to (<em>%d</em>) and the
hostname or IP where the connection is coming from (<em>%h</em>). This results in log
lines like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="none">2021-01-30 05:06:03.675 UTC [73] psql postgres bench 172.17.0.1 ERROR:  relation "pgbench_akkounts" does not exist at character 15
2021-01-30 05:06:03.675 UTC [73] psql postgres bench 172.17.0.1 STATEMENT:  select * from pgbench_akkounts;</code></pre></figure>

<p>which are much more useful than the default. You can see that a client connected
from <em>172.17.0.1</em> as user <em>postgres</em> to database <em>bench</em>, and the application
was <em>psql</em>. Definitely an improvement over the default option, which shows
only this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">2021-01-30 05:13:22.630 UTC [63] ERROR:  relation "pgbench_akkounts" does not exist at character 15
2021-01-30 05:13:22.630 UTC [63] STATEMENT:  select * from pgbench_akkounts;</code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="logging-slow-queries">Logging Slow Queries</h3>

<p>PostgreSQL can be configured to log queries that take more than a set amount
of time to execute. These go into the same log file; there is no separate
slow query log file as in MySQL.</p>

<p>To log statements that take more than 1 second to execute, use the
<em>log_min_duration_statement</em> option like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span>log_min_duration_statement</span> <span>=</span> <span>1s</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Note that <em>log_min_duration_statement</em> will consider all statements (including
for example, long-running admin statements like <em>REINDEX TABLE</em>) and not just
queries (<em>SELECT</em>). Here are some log entries produced by this option:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">2021-01-30 08:42:57.473 UTC [62] psql postgres postgres 172.17.0.1 LOG:  duration: 1016.283 ms  statement: select pg_sleep(1);
2021-01-30 08:52:00.541 UTC [62] psql postgres postgres 172.17.0.1 LOG:  duration: 1118.277 ms  statement: select pg_sleep(1.1);</code></pre></figure>

<p>If this results in too many logs of similar statements, you can tell Postgres to
log only a percentage of it, using:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span>log_min_duration_statement</span> <span>=</span> <span>-1</span>
<span>log_min_duration_sample</span> <span>=</span> <span>1s</span>
<span>log_statement_sample_rate</span> <span>=</span> <span>0.25</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This logs only 25% of the statements that become eligible for logging (the ones
that took more than 1 second to execute). The log output is the same as before.
There is no way to know how many eligible statements were not logged.</p>

<p>To log all statements, along with the time taken to execute them, use the
<em>log_statement</em> option instead:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span>log_statement</span> <span>=</span> <span>mod</span>
<span>log_duration</span> <span>=</span> <span>on</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The ‘mod’ option tells Postgres to log DDLs and data-modifying statements. This
results in logs like these:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">2021-01-30 08:35:08.985 UTC [64] pgbench postgres bench 172.17.0.1 LOG:  statement: insert into pgbench_tellers(tid,bid,tbalance) values (10,1,0)
2021-01-30 08:35:08.985 UTC [64] pgbench postgres bench 172.17.0.1 LOG:  duration: 0.241 ms</code></pre></figure>

<p>Be warned that it is <em>not</em> possible to sample statement logging enabled this way,
all statements will be logged, and you’ll end up with tons of log entries.</p>

<h3 id="logging-locks-and-deadlocks">Logging Locks and Deadlocks</h3>

<p>Queries can wait too long to acquire a lock. Typically, an upper limit on how
long to wait is set using the option <em>lock_timeout</em>, usually at the client side.
If a query has been waiting this long to acquire a lock, Postgres will cancel
the execution of this query and log an error:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">2021-01-30 09:35:52.415 UTC [67] psql postgres testdb 172.17.0.1 ERROR:  canceling statement due to lock timeout
2021-01-30 09:35:52.415 UTC [67] psql postgres testdb 172.17.0.1 STATEMENT:  cluster t;</code></pre></figure>

<p>Let’s say you want to set a lock timeout of 1 minute, but log queries that
wait for locks for more than, say 30 seconds. You can do this using:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span>log_lock_waits</span> <span>=</span> <span>on</span>
<span>deadlock_timeout</span> <span>=</span> <span>30s</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This will create logs like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">2021-01-30 09:49:22.331 UTC [70] psql postgres testdb 172.17.0.1 LOG:  process 70 still waiting for ShareLock on transaction 493 after 30009.004 ms
2021-01-30 09:49:22.331 UTC [70] psql postgres testdb 172.17.0.1 DETAIL:  Process holding the lock: 68. Wait queue: 70.
2021-01-30 09:49:22.331 UTC [70] psql postgres testdb 172.17.0.1 CONTEXT:  while locking tuple (0,3) in relation "t"
2021-01-30 09:49:22.331 UTC [70] psql postgres testdb 172.17.0.1 STATEMENT:  select * from t for update;</code></pre></figure>

<p>The use of <em>deadlock_timeout</em> is not a typo: it is the value that the lock wait
logging mechanism uses. Ideally, there should have been something like <em>log_min_duration_lock_wait</em>,
but unfortunately, that is not the case.</p>

<p>In case of actual deadlocks, Postgres will abort the deadlocked transactions
after <em>deadlock_timeout</em> duration, and will log the offending statements. No
explicit configuration is necessary.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">2021-01-30 09:55:37.724 UTC [68] psql postgres testdb 172.17.0.1 LOG:  process 68 detected deadlock while waiting for ShareLock on transaction 496 after 30007.633 ms

<h3 id="logging-autovacuums">Logging Autovacuums</h3>

<p>The autovacuum process kicks in when Postgres determines the data in a table
has changed sufficiently to warrant a vacuum and analyze. To keep an eye on
this process, enable the logging of autovacuum runs:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span>log_autovacuum_min_duration</span> <span>=</span> <span>250ms</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Here is a sample entry that was caused by excessive changes to one table:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">2021-01-30 10:23:33.201 UTC [63]     LOG:  automatic vacuum of table "postgres.public.t": index scans: 0
        pages: 0 removed, 95 remain, 0 skipped due to pins, 0 skipped frozen
        tuples: 8991 removed, 10000 remain, 0 are dead but not yet removable, oldest xmin: 492
        buffer usage: 215 hits, 4 misses, 4 dirtied
        avg read rate: 1.885 MB/s, avg write rate: 1.885 MB/s
        system usage: CPU: user: 0.01 s, system: 0.00 s, elapsed: 0.01 s
        WAL usage: 244 records, 1 full page images, 67984 bytes
2021-01-30 10:23:33.222 UTC [63]     LOG:  automatic analyze of table "postgres.public.t" system usage: CPU: user: 0.01 s, system: 0.00 s, elapsed: 0.01 s</code></pre></figure>

<p>Note that autovacuum will typically trigger an analyze after the vacuum, and
this will also be logged.</p>

<p>These logs will help you figure out how best to tune the autovacuum parameters,
and will help in investigating if and when autovacuum is not being as effective
as you thought it would be.</p>

<h3 id="logging-checkpoints">Logging Checkpoints</h3>

<p>Checkpointing is the process of pushing WAL-logged changes into the actual files
that back tables. Ideally checkpoints should occur at regular-and-not-too-frequent
intervals, as it is a CPU and disk intensive process. For various reasons,
checkpoints are also forced to happen before the next scheduled time, and this
results in reduced query performance.</p>

<p>To keep an eye on checkpoint frequency and efficiency, enable logging of
checkpoints:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span>log_checkpoints</span> <span>=</span> <span>on</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This tells PostgreSQL to log the following whenever a checkpoint occurs:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">2021-01-30 10:05:57.085 UTC [56]     LOG:  checkpoint starting: immediate force wait
2021-01-30 10:05:57.159 UTC [56]     LOG:  checkpoint complete: wrote 0 buffers (0.0%); 0 WAL file(s) added, 0 removed, 0 recycled; write=0.000 s, sync=0.000 s, total=0.074 s; sync files=0, longest=0.000 s, average=0.000 s; distance=0 kB, estimate=0 kB</code></pre></figure>

<p>The first line contains the flags that backend passed to the checkpointer. You
can see that the “force” caused a checkpoint even though there were no pending
changes to checkpoint. If “immediate” had not been specified, the checkpointer
would have checkpointed up to <em>checkpoint_completion_target</em>.</p>

<h3 id="other-server-side-settings">Other Server-Side Settings</h3>

<p>There are a couple of other settings that you can turn on in your PostgreSQL
configuration that will help with diagnosing issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>track_io_timing</em> - setting this to <em>on</em> lets you see the time spent in
disk I/O for each query (combined with pg_stat_statements extension
described below). See <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-statistics.html#GUC-TRACK-IO-TIMING">the docs</a>
about a caveat to turning this on, but should be safe on nearly any modern
Linux. Seeing a query’s disk I/O cost is impossible without turning this on.</li>
  <li><em>track_commit_timestamp</em> - setting this to <em>on</em> can be useful in debugging
replication lags and other replication-related …</li></ul></div></div></div></div>

In fact, they are commonly used as the standard approach, despite that they are a perilous area full of dicey pitfalls. Especially regarding how these linear combinations make your algorithm hard to tune.</p><p>Therefore, in this post we hope to lay out the following arguments:</p><ul><li>A lot of problems in machine learning should be treated as multi-objective problems, while they currently are not.</li><li>This lack of multi-objective treatment leads to difficulties in tuning the hyper-parameters for these machine learning algorithms.</li><li>It is nigh on impossible to detect when these problems are occurring, making it tricky to work around them.</li><li>There are methods to solve this which might be slightly involved, but do not require more than a few lines of code. <a href="https://engraved.ghost.io/how-we-can-make-machine-learning-algorithms-tunable">One of these methods is laid out in a follow-up blog post.</a></li></ul><p>Nothing of this article is novel. You might already be aware of everything we wanted to say. However, we have the impression that most machine learning curricula do not discuss optimisation methods very well (I know mine did not), and consequently, gradient descent is being treated as the one method to solve all problems. And the general message is that if an algorithm does not work for your problem, you need to spend more time tuning the hyper-parameters to your problem. </p><p><a href="https://engraved.ghost.io/how-we-can-make-machine-learning-algorithms-tunable">In the next blog post, a solution is introduced</a>, based on the NIPS’88 paper which introduced the Modified Differential Method of Multipliers.</p><p>So we hope that this blogpost can remove some confusion on how to handle this issue in a more foundational and principled way. And hey, maybe it can make you spend less time tuning your algorithms, and more time making research progress.</p><h2 id="linear-combinations-of-losses-are-everywhere">Linear combinations of losses are everywhere</h2><p>While there are single-objective problems, it is common for these objectives to be given additional regularisation. We have picked a selection of such optimisation objectives from across the field of machine learning field.</p><p>First off, we have the regularisers, weight decay and lasso. It is obvious that when you add these regularisations, you effectively have created a multi-objective loss for your problem. After all, what you really care about, is that both the original loss \(L_0\) and the regulariser loss are kept low. And you will tune the balance between the two using a \(\lambda\) parameter.</p><p>$$ L(\theta) = L_0(\theta) + \lambda \sum \left| \theta \right| $$</p><p>$$ L(\theta) = L_0(\theta) + \lambda \sum \theta^2 $$</p><p>As a consequence, losses found in e.g. VAE’s are effectively multi-objective, with a first objective to maximally cover the data, and a second objective to stay close to the prior distribution. In this case, occasionally KL annealing is used to introduce a tunable parameter \(\beta\) to help handle the multi-objectiveness of this loss.</p><p>$$ L(\theta) =\mathbb{E}_{q_{\phi}(z | x )} \left[ \log p_\theta ( x | z) \right] &nbsp;- \beta D_{KL} \left( q_\phi ( z | x) \| p(z) \right) $$</p><p>Also in reinforcement learning, you can see this multi-objectiveness. Not only is it common for many environments to simply sum rewards received for obtaining partial goals. The policy loss is usually also a linear combination of losses. Take as an example here the losses on the policy for PPO, SAC and MPO, entropy regularized methods with their tunable parameter <strong><em>α</em></strong>.</p><p>$$ L(\pi) = - \sum_t \mathbb{E}_{(s_t, a_t)} \left[ r(s_t, a_t) + \alpha \mathcal{H}(\cdot , s_t)\right]$$</p><p>$$ L(\pi) = - \sum_t \mathbb{E}_{(s_t, a_t)} \left[ \mathbb{E}_\pi\left(Q(s_t, a_t)\right) - \alpha D_{KL} \left( q \| \pi \right) \right]$$</p><p>Finally, the GAN-loss is of course a sum between the discriminator and the generator loss:</p><p>$$ L(\theta) = - \mathbb{E}_x \left[ \log D_\theta(x)\right] - \mathbb{E}_z \left[ \log ( 1- D_\theta(G_\theta(z))\right]$$</p><p>All of these losses have something in common, they are effectively trying to optimise for multiple objectives simultaneously, and argue that the optimum is found in balancing these often contradicting forces. In some cases, the sum is more ad hoc and a hyper-parameter is introduced to weigh the parts against each other. In some cases, there are clear theoretical foundations on why the losses are combined this way, and no hyper-parameter is used for tuning the balance between the parts. </p><blockquote>In this post, we hope to show you this approach of combining losses may sound appealing, but that this linear combination is actually precarious and treacherous. The balancing act is often more like a tightrope walk.</blockquote><p>Let us consider a simple case, where we are trying to optimise for such a linear combination of losses. We take the approach of optimising the total loss, which is a sum of losses. We optimise this with gradient descent, and we observe the following behaviour.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/953U2daXgDAO_97ugiYVEKnbK69gZVKUmlY9hNpCqtYlTso-XFw8WQ-dWRcBNeNtx7KNvXi1bM5mB8cfmnjXUMg4gU6fp5LvADys1WtoWIW-mqiJt1Uzu-Lw8VceNfQeLLQa9IZa" alt=""></figure><p>Our code in Jax would look something like this:</p><pre><code>def loss(θ):
  return loss_1(θ) + loss_2(θ)
loss_derivative = grad(loss)
for gradient_step in range(200):
  gradient = loss_derivative(θ)
  θ = θ - 0.02 * gradient</code></pre><p>As is usually the case, we are not immediately happy about the tradeoff between the two losses. So we introduce a scaling coefficient <strong><em>α</em></strong> on the second loss and run the following code:</p><pre><code>def loss(θ, α):
  return loss_1(θ) + α*loss_2(θ)
loss_derivative = grad(loss)
for gradient_step in range(200):
  gradient = loss_derivative(θ, α=0.5)
  θ = θ - 0.02 * gradient
</code></pre><p>The behaviour we hope to see is that when tuning this <strong><em>α</em></strong>, we can choose the trade-off between the two losses and select the point we are most happy with for our application. We effectively will go on a hyper-parameter tuning loop, manually select an <strong><em>α</em></strong>, run the optimisation process, decide we would like the second loss to be lower, tune our <strong><em>α</em></strong> up accordingly and repeat the whole optimisation process. After several iterations, we settle for the solution we found and continue writing our papers.</p><p>However, that is not what is always happening. The actual behaviour we sometimes observe for our problem looks like the one below.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/iZlk4MRVx7JYgLbaqIv-jH8zZGSc78Jj-aqk_YWy5e80tf_hgMMaBn41yRFR2rpRFGE8vuRGWjljGZ6Ri8XbyDhZbAQbSCX-putykGEpxgmcuPTmrQH1VHKpaKfjra3AG4u-x9K7" alt=""></figure><blockquote>It seems that no matter how we finetune our <strong><em>α</em></strong>-parameter, we cannot make a good trade-off between our two losses. </blockquote><p>We see two clusters of solutions, one where the first loss is ignored, and one where the second loss is ignored. However, both of these solutions are not useful for most applications. Most of the time, a point where the two losses were more balanced is a more preferred solution.</p><p>In fact, this diagram of the two losses over the course of training is barely ever plotted, so the dynamics illustrated in this figure often goes unobserved. We just look at the training curve plotting the total loss, and we might conclude that this hyper-parameter needs more time tuning, as it seems to be really sensitive. Alternatively, we could settle for an approach of early stopping to make the numbers in the paper work. After all, reviewers love data efficiency.</p><p>Where did it go wrong though? <strong>Why does this method sometimes work, and why does it sometimes fail to give you a tunable parameter?</strong> For that, we need to look deeper into the difference between the two figures.</p><p>Both figures are generated for the same problem, using the same losses and are optimising these losses using the same optimisation method. So none of these aspects are to blame for the difference. The thing which has changed between these problems is the model. In other words, the effect the model parameters <strong><em>θ</em></strong> have on the output of the model is different.</p><p>Therefore, let us <em>cheat</em> and visualise something which is normally not visualisable, the Pareto front for both of our optimisations. This is the set of all solutions achievable by our model, which are not dominated by any other solution. In other words, it is the set of achievable losses, where there is no point where <em>all</em> of the losses are better. No matter how you choose to trade off between the two losses, your preferred solution always lies on the Pareto front. By tuning the hyper-parameter of your loss, you usually hope to merely find a different point on that same front.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6qA_NcRMUK8mWT3j3-t_bPl-oZkwg5Q9lWcOgBn9IB3qF_yQ7p1dyH6eq_DtKpTGeACMsLE-YfiIY9DH3yhF7swsmMFGMjNwI_oHdKKbNTuO0M8a_oDZQTUhKGcEuAfTpomqHX-M" alt=""></figure><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/kVqsudO8-j48MEsdlaZgDgc22jMO9myzwdbTTWQ-KufWjuXqIr9gNHKrgV-fRzTb5gMgDnO-sFp1z_lS3UhX3wjwXHRowiaO7Vp04ZaYEAthw7y6wyN3zltH3o0wgB5ZbTDjRuRb" alt=""></figure><p>The difference between the two Pareto fronts is what is causing the tuning to turn out well for the first case, but to fail horribly after changing our model. It turns out that when the Pareto front is convex, we can achieve all possible trade-offs by tuning our <strong><em>α</em></strong>-parameter. However, when the Pareto front is concave, that approach does not seem to work well anymore.</p><h2 id="why-does-gradient-descent-optimisation-fail-for-concave-pareto-fronts">Why does gradient descent optimisation fail for concave Pareto fronts?</h2><p>We can illustrate why that is the case, by looking at the total loss in the third dimension, the loss which is actually optimised with gradient descent. In the following figure, we visualise the plane of total loss in relation to each of the losses. While we actually descend on this plane using the gradient with respect to the parameters, each gradient descent step we take will also necessarily go downwards on this plane. You can imagine the gradient descent optimisation process as putting a spherical pebble on that plane, letting it wobble down under gravity and wait until it comes to a halt.</p><p>The point where the optimisation process halts is the result of the optimisation process, here indicated by a star. As you can see in the following figure, no matter how you wobble down the plane, you will always end up in the optimum.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/U43_rJCiufKMSZ4gtci5kTQ2DRIH_r8WyvFi0aFV0wjpxXTNSFnMzR8a9DHvBc_ONbi0rEIBfXRQXUSxAcriZDGBNWVRhMQ-ifaIXdgeNf1K6cEIeXzMjYZUk94EWMH_bOBzvhOa" alt=""></figure><p>By tuning <strong><em>α</em></strong>, this space stays a plane. After all, by changing <strong><em>α</em></strong>, we are only changing the tilt of this plane. As you can see, &nbsp;in the convex case any solution on the Pareto curve can be achieved by tuning <strong><em>α</em></strong>. A little more <strong><em>α</em></strong> pulls the star to the left, a little less <strong><em>α</em></strong> pushes the star to the right. Every starting point of the optimisation process will converge on the same solution, and that is true for all values of <strong><em>α</em></strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://engraved.ghost.io/content/images/2021/01/visualising_the_convex_case.mp4.hq.gif" alt=""></figure><p>However, if we take a look at the differently modeled problem with a concave Pareto front, it becomes apparent where …</p></div></section></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Microsoft has for the past years done a great job at hardening the Windows lockscreen, but after <a href="https://secret.club/author/jonas-l">Jonas</a> published <a href="https://secret.club/2021/01/15/bitlocker-bypass.html">CVE-2020-1398</a>, I put effort into weaponizing an old bug I had found in Windows Touch devices.</p><p>These exploits rely on the fundamental design of the Windows Lockscreen, where the instance that prompts the user for password runs with SYSTEM privileges. This means that even though most of the UI is blocked, you can always find a way to do some damage when there are options like “Reset password”</p><p><img src="https://secret.club/assets/touchbypass/1.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Clicking this button will result in a new user being created with the name of defaultuser1, defaultuser100000, defaultuser100001 (et cetera), and a new instance of <em>WWAHost</em> asking for user account credentials will be spawned. If everything is in order, it will ask you for a new pin, otherwise you will be stuck in this instance.</p><ul><li>Connect a physical keyboard</li><li>Enable the narrator</li><li>Select “I have forgotten my password.” and “Text &lt;phonenumber&gt;”</li><li>Change the size of the on-screen keyboard and open keyboard settings</li><li>Interact with the hidden settings window to execute our payload</li></ul><h2 id="constraints"> <a href="#constraints">Constraints</a></h2><p>To exploit this vulnerability, you will need:</p><ol><li>A surface touchscreen device. I used a surface book 2 15’ (Running up-to-date Windows 10 20H2 with BitLocker enabled)</li><li>A external keyboard</li><li>A flash drive containing your payload.</li></ol><h2 id="keyboard-confusion"> <a href="#keyboard-confusion">Keyboard confusion</a></h2><p>By connecting a external keyboard to our Surface device, we have the capability using both the on-screen and the physical keyboard. This is necessary to abuse certain functionality that allows us to bypass the lockscreen.</p><h2 id="narration"> <a href="#narration">Narration</a></h2><p>Windows includes various accessibility features such as narration. This functionality allows us to operate on hidden UI elements, as the narrator will read any selected element out loud, visible or not. Turn it on by clicking Windows+U and selecting “Enable narrator”</p><h2 id="i-forgot-my-password"> <a href="#i-forgot-my-password">I forgot my password</a></h2><p>A Forgotten password is one of the few cases you would ever do anything but login on the Windows lockscreen. The first part of our bypass requires you to select “I have forgotten my password.” on the login screen. This will open up a Microsoft Account login form, where you can choose to recover your password by texting a certain phone number. Selecting this opens up a text bar where you would normally type in the full recovery phone number, but in our case that is not the point. By opening this text bar, we can make the touch device display an on screen keyboard, which was the goal all along. With this software keyboard, you can change the size of the keyboard by hitting the options button in the top left, choose the largest keyboard available.</p><p><img src="https://secret.club/assets/touchbypass/2.png" alt=""></p><p>Now you should have a large software keyboard where you can open the settings menu:</p><p><img src="https://secret.club/assets/touchbypass/3.png" alt=""></p><p>After initialising the launch of keyboard settings, there is a small time frame where you can double click on this grey area here:</p><p><img src="https://secret.club/assets/touchbypass/4.jpg" alt=""></p><p>If you did this successfully, the narrator should explicitly say “Settings window”</p><h2 id="navigating-settings"> <a href="#navigating-settings">Navigating settings</a></h2><p>You wouldn’t think you could much with a hidden settings window on a locked Windows device, but you can actually navigate said window with a external keyboard. While holding down the Caps Lock key, the arrow keys and the tab key can be used to navigate UI elements.</p><p>One weaponization of this is going to <code>Autoplay</code> -&gt; <code>Removable drives</code> -&gt; <code>Open folder to view files</code>. This launches File Explorer, where you can execute windows binaries from a usb thumb-drive.</p><h2 id="disclosure"> <a href="#disclosure">Disclosure</a></h2><p>I reported the issue to MSRC, but they ignored the bug report citing a need of PoC, which I had already provided, they had also expressed disbelief towards the exploitability of this bug.</p><h2 id="demonstration"> <a href="#demonstration">Demonstration</a></h2><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JAVRAeSJGwg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Before and during FOSDEM 2020, I agreed with the people (developers, supporters, managers) of the UBports Foundation to package the Unity8 Operating Environment for Debian. Since 27th Feb 2020, Unity8 has now become Lomiri.</p>

<p>Things got delayed a little recently as my main developer contact on the upstream side was on sick leave for a while. Fortunately, he has now fully recovered and work is getting back on track.</p>

<h3>Recent Uploads to Debian related to Lomiri</h3>

<p>Over the past 3 months I worked on the following bits and pieces regarding Lomiri in Debian:</p>

<ul>
<li>Work on DEB package qtmir.</li>
<li>Revisit upstream status of lomiri-ui-toolkit (and remind upstream on open issues to be resolved).</li>
<li>Debug googletest / cmake-extras build failures in qtmir DEB package.</li>
<li>Prepare MR!2 für cmake-extras upstream, upload cmake-extras 1.5-3 to Debian unstable.</li>
<li>Upload qtmir to unstable/NEW, submit patches upstream.</li>
<li>Upload to unstable as NEW: ayatana-indicator-bluetooth.</li>
<li>Upload to unstable: qtmir 0.6.1-2.</li>
<li>Upload to unstable: cmake-extras 1.5-5.</li>
<li>More debugging on googletest / cmake-extras.</li>
<li>Qt5.15 transition in Debian, various uploads.</li>
<li>Upload unstable: cmake-extras 1.5-6.</li>
<li>Debug and fix libqtdbustest / libqtdbusmock failures in Debian.</li>
<li>Get in touch with RAOF (on IRC, from the Mir Team) on possible fixes of Mir FTBFS in Debian (after a Mesa upload).</li>
<li>Upload to unstable: mir 1.8.0+dfsg1-11 (fix FTBFS).</li>
<li>Fix dbus-cpp autopkgtests.</li>
<li>Fix Mir FTBFS after Boost 1.74 transition.</li>
<li>Fix FTBFS in unit tests in lomiri-url-dispatcher.</li>
<li>Drop autopilot dependency from DEB package qtmir.</li>
<li>Heads-Up Meeting with Marius Gripsgard (discussion next steps).</li>
</ul>

<p>The next projects / packages ahead are lomiri-ui-toolkit, integrating changes required for Lomiri into Ayatana Indicators and then moving on with several other, smaller packages.</p>

<h3>Credits</h3>

<p>Many big thanks go to Marius and Dalton for their work on the UBports project and being always available for questions, feedback, etc.</p>

<p>Thanks to Florian Leeber for being my point of contact for topcis regarding my cooperation with the UBports Foundation.</p> </div></div>]]>

    <div>
      
      <div><p>Hi all,</p><p>At 2021-01-29 at 21:35 UTC Google suspended Element from the Play Store without warning or notification. &nbsp;We submitted an appeal asking for clarification at 23:18, and at 05:31 received a generic update from the Google Play Policy team citing that the app has been removed due to content which contravenes their terms of use, and asking us to “make the necessary changes to [our] app” and “upload a new app using a new package name and a new app name”.</p><p>As of 11:44 UTC we’ve submitted a detailed appeal to reiterate that Element is a generic chat app for connecting to the global Matrix communication network, just as Chrome is a generic web browser for connecting to the Web - and just as Google does not control the content on the Web, Element does not control the content on Matrix.</p><p>We have also explained that the Matrix servers that we <em>do</em> run as Element (including the default Matrix.org homeserver, which we run on behalf of <a href="https://matrix.org/foundation">The Matrix.org Foundation</a>) have <a href="https://matrix.org/legal/terms-and-conditions#6-play-nice-clauses">strict Terms of Use</a> which we actively enforce. We abhor abuse, and Element is not an app that caters to abusive content.</p><p>In order to enforce our terms of use on the Matrix servers we run as Element, we have a formal Trust and Safety team hired full-time who are dedicated to investigating and tracking abuse reports sent to <a href="https://element.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e48586919781a4898590968d9cca8b9683"><span data-cfemail="d3b2b1a6a0b693beb2a7a1baabfdbca1b4">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> or reported from the app. &nbsp;The team takes appropriate action on a ticket by ticket basis - deactivating abusive accounts and blocking chatrooms from our servers which contravene our terms of use, and building tooling to help enforce the terms of use on the servers we run.</p><p>Managing abuse is an ongoing activity, and <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/element-whatsapp-exodus/">Matrix is expanding massively at the moment</a>. We are expanding Element’s Trust and Safety team to match that growth, focusing on improving our anti-abuse mechanisms, and we are also constantly expanding the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/guides/moderation/">moderation tools</a> we provide to the community.</p><p>Meanwhile, we’re also continuing to work on decentralised reputation as a <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors/">scalable solution to empower other users to combat abuse</a> for the wider Matrix network - effectively bringing control back to users and empowering communities to remain safe online.</p><p>Element and Matrix are used by the French, German, UK and US governments, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/01/29/this-week-in-matrix-2021-01-29#dept-of-status-of-matrix-%EF%B8%8F">countless universities</a>, thousands of businesses and millions of people across the world - we can only apologise for the disruption caused by the app disappearing like this.</p><p>We’re currently waiting for an update to Google and will keep this blog post updated as the situation develops. &nbsp;We look forward to resolving the problem and getting the app back in the store shortly.</p><p>-- The Element Team</p><p>Update: reminder that in the interim you can download a (slightly outdated) version of Element Android from F-Droid at <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/im.vector.app/">https://f-droid.org/en/packages/im.vector.app</a>. &nbsp;We're also looking into running our own F-Droid repository going forwards so the most recent build is always available there.</p><p>UPDATE: At 2021-01-30 23:17 UTC we received a call from a VP at Google who apologised for the bad communication from Google and explained the situation, which related to some extremely abusive content which was accessible on the default matrix.org homeserver. &nbsp;Our Trust and Safety team had already identified and acted on this content to enforce the server's terms of use, and so we've explained how Element and Matrix works, established a channel for communication over any future moderation concerns, and expect the app to be restored shortly.</p><p>UPDATE: The app is restored as of 2021-01-31 00:30 UTC. &nbsp;Huge thanks to everyone for your patience and support while we sorted this out, and to the wider Element team who spent their Saturday on this. &nbsp;Thanks also to Google for being transparent and apologetic and the rapid resolution once we'd established contact.</p></div>

the project with:</p><p>I suggest that you commit this code to a git repository, so you should
start with a <code>.gitignore</code> file.</p><div><div data-language="bash"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>touch</span><span> .gitignore</span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"# Project dependencies</span></p><p><span>4</span><span>.cache</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>node_modules</span></p><p><span>6</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span># Build directory</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>public</span></p><p><span>9</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span># Other</span></p><p><span>11</span><span>.DS_Store</span></p><p><span>12</span><span>yarn-error.log"</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span> .gitignore</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Ok now is a good time to do a <code>git init</code> and if you’re using VSCode
you’ll see the changes reflected in the sidebar.</p><h3 id="basic-hello-world"><a href="#basic-hello-world" aria-label="basic hello world permalink"></a>basic hello world</h3><p>Ok a Gatsby hello world, get started with the bare minimum! Install
the following:</p><div><div data-language="bash"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>yarn</span><span> </span><span>add</span><span> gatsby react react-dom</span></p></pre></div></div><p>You’re going to need to create a pages directory and add an index
file. You can do that in the terminal by typing the following:</p><div><div data-language="bash"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span><span>mkdir</span><span> -p src/pages</span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>touch</span><span> src/pages/index.js</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Ok, now you can commence the hello word incantation! In the newly
created <code>index.js</code> enter the following:</p><div><div data-language="jsx"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>import</span><span> React </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'react'</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Hello World</span><span>!</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Now you need to add the Gatsby develop script to the <code>package.json</code>
file, <code>-p</code> specifies what port you want to run the project on and <code>-o</code>
opens a new tab on your default browser, so in this case
<code>localhost:9988</code>:</p><div><div data-language="json"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>"dev"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"gatsby develop -p 9988 -o"</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Ok it’s time to run the code! From the terminal type the npm script
command you just created:</p><blockquote><p>Note I’m using Yarn for installing all my dependencies and running
scripts, if you prefer you can use npm just bear in mind that the
content on here uses yarn, so swap out commands where needed</p></blockquote><p>And with that the “Hello World” incantation is complete 🧙!</p><h2 id="add-content"><a href="#add-content" aria-label="add content permalink"></a>Add content</h2><p>Ok, now you have the base your blog you’re going to want to add some
content, first up we’re going to get the convention out of the way.
For this how-to, the date format will be a logical way, the most
logical way for a date format is <strong>YYYYMMDD</strong>, fight me!</p><p>So you’re going to structure your posts content in years, in each one
of those you’re going to have another folder relating to the post with
the (correct) date format for the beginning of the file followed by
the title of the post. You could drill into this further if you like
by separating out months and days depending on the volume of posts
going this may be a good approach. In this case and in the examples
provided the convention detailed will be used.</p><div><div data-language="bash"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span><span>mkdir</span><span> -p posts/2019/</span><span>{</span><span>2019</span><span>-06-01-hello-world,2019-06-10-second-post,2019-06-20-third-post</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>touch</span><span> posts/2019/2019-06-01-hello-world/index.mdx</span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>touch</span><span> posts/2019/2019-06-10-second-post/index.mdx</span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>touch</span><span> posts/2019/2019-06-20-third-post/index.mdx</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Ok that’s your posts set up now you need to add some content to them,
each file you have in here should have frontmatter. Frontmatter is a
way to assign properties to the contents, in this case a <code>title</code>,
published <code>date</code> and a <code>published</code> flag (<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>).</p><div><div data-language="md"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>---</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>title: Hello World - from mdx!</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>date: 2019-06-01</span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>published: true</span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>---</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span></span><span>#</span><span> h1 Heading</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span>My first post!!</span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span></span><span>##</span><span> h2 Heading</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span></span><span>###</span><span> h3 Heading</span></p></pre></div></div><div><div data-language="md"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>---</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>title: Second Post!</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>date: 2019-06-10</span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>published: true</span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>---</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>This is my second post!</span></p><p><span>8</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span></span><span>####</span><span> h4 Heading</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span></span><span>#####</span><span> h5 Heading</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span></span><span>######</span><span> h6 Heading</span></p></pre></div></div><div><div data-language="md"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>---</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>title: Third Post!</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>date: 2019-06-20</span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>published: true</span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>---</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>This is my third post!</span></p><p><span>8</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span></span><span>&gt;</span><span> with a block quote!</span></p></pre></div></div><h2 id="gatsby-config-api"><a href="#gatsby-config-api" aria-label="gatsby config api permalink"></a>Gatsby config API</h2><p>Ok, now you’re going to configure Gatsby so that it can read your
super awesome content you just created. So, first up you need to
create a <code>gatsby-config.js</code> file, in the terminal create the file:</p><h2 id="plugins"><a href="#plugins" aria-label="plugins permalink"></a>Plugins</h2><p>And now you can add the plugins Gatsby needs to use for sourcing and
displaying the the files you just created.</p><h3 id="gatsby-source-filesystem"><a href="#gatsby-source-filesystem" aria-label="gatsby source filesystem permalink"></a>Gatsby source filesystem</h3><p>The <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-filesystem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gatsby-source-filesystem</a> collects the files on the local

our Markdown documents and the heart of how the content is displayed
in the blog.</p><p>Now is a good time to also add in dependent packages for the Gatsby
plugin MDX which are <code>@mdx-js/mdx</code> and <code>@mdx-js/react</code>.</p><p>In the terminal install the dependencies:</p><div><div data-language="bash"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>yarn</span><span> </span><span>add</span><span> gatsby-plugin-mdx @mdx-js/mdx @mdx-js/react gatsby-source-filesystem</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Now its time to configure <code>gatsby-config.js</code>:</p><div><div data-language="js"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>module</span><span>.</span><span>exports</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  siteMetadata</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>    title</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>The Localhost Blog</span><span>`</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>    description</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>This is my coding blog where I write about my coding journey.</span><span>`</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>  plugins</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>    </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>      resolve</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>gatsby-plugin-mdx</span><span>`</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span>      options</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span>        extensions</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>`</span><span>.mdx</span><span>`</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>.md</span><span>`</span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span>      </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span>    </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>14</span><span>      resolve</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>gatsby-source-filesystem</span><span>`</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>15</span><span>      options</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>16</span><span>        path</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>${</span><span>__dirname</span><span>}</span><span>/posts</span><span>`</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>17</span><span>        name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>posts</span><span>`</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>18</span><span>      </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>19</span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>20</span><span>  </span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>21</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></div><h2 id="query-data-from-graphql"><a href="#query-data-from-graphql" aria-label="query data from graphql permalink"></a>Query data from GraphQL</h2><p>Ok now you can see what the <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-filesystem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gatsby-source-filesystem</a> and
<a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gatsby-plugin-mdx</a> have done for us. You can now go to the Gatsby
GraphQL GraphiQL explorer and check out the data:</p><div><div data-language="graphql"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  allMdx </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>    nodes </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>      frontmatter </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>        title</span></p><p><span>6</span><span>        date</span></p><p><span>7</span><span>      </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></div><h2 id="site-metadata"><a href="#site-metadata" aria-label="site metadata permalink"></a>Site Metadata</h2><p>When you want to reuse common pieces of data across the site (for
example, your site title), you can store that data in <code>siteMetadata</code>,
you touched on this when defining the <code>gatsby-config.js</code>, now you’re
going to separate this out from the <code>module.exports</code>, why? It will be
nicer to reason about once the config is filled with plugins. At the
top of <code>gatsby-config.js</code> add a new object variable for the site
metadata:</p><div><div data-language="js"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>const</span><span> siteMetadata </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  title</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>The Localhost Blog</span><span>`</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>  description</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>This is my coding blog where I write about my coding journey.</span><span>`</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Now query the Site Metadata with GraphQL.</p><div><div data-language="graphql"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  site </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>    siteMetadata </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>      title</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>      description</span></p><p><span>6</span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></div><h2 id="site-metadata-hook"><a href="#site-metadata-hook" aria-label="site metadata hook permalink"></a>Site metadata hook</h2><p>Ok, so, that’s cool n’ all but how am I meant to use it? Well do some
of the code stuff and make a React hook so you can get your site data
in any component you need it.</p><p>Create a folder to keep all your hooks in and create a file for our
hook, in the terminal do:</p><div><div data-language="bash"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>mkdir</span><span> src/hooks</span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span><span>touch</span><span> src/hooks/useSiteMetadata.js</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Ok, and in your newly created file were going to use the Gatsby

                Do you get annoyed every time your roommate slams the doors?
                Does it wake you up every morning? How can you avoid this?
              </h5>
              <h3>First thing to do</h3>
              <p>
                 Try to talk with your roommate and explain to him that this bothers you.
                 Talk to him without tension and in a clear and calm way. It is
                 recommended to catch your roommate in a good mood. if he is sad
                 or has had a hard day he is more likely to take the problem more personally
                 and not understand that it is actually a small thing that bothers you.
                 If you are different in personality, take a step back and try to take it
                as nicely as possible and explain it without getting upset. He may not know
                that he is doing this and he will realize that it is an annoying thing that
                he is not consciously doing.
              </p>
              <p>
                <i></i>Try to avoid phrases like:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>It is very annoying that you are slamming the door!</li>
                <li>if I woke you up every day knocking on the door, would you like it !?</li>
                <li>I don't know how you can slam the doors like that!</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                 <i></i> Try to approach your roommate with a phrase like:
              </p>

              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  Hi! I had such a hard day, how was yours?
                  I know you woke up at 6 that I heard when you closed the door.
                  I thought it sounded really loud and I woke up instantly.
                  Maybe we should put some sticky pads on the furniture to make it
                  less noisy or trying to close it more carefully not to wake up each other.

<p>
"Luck Surface Area" is a turn of phrase that popped out my mouth during a discussion
episode of <a href="http://www.techzinglive.com/">TechZing</a> a few months back and
is something I've been meaning to write
about ever since but never got around to actually doing. However, thanks to
<a href="http://page99test.wordpress.com/about/">Lance Jones</a>
who referenced the concept in a recent <a href="http://page99test.wordpress.com/2010/11/07/making-the-front-page-of-hn-without-even-trying/">blog post</a> I have finally been spurred into
action.
</p>
<p>
If there's one thing I've discovered in recent years it's this. The amount of
serendipity that will occur in your life, your Luck Surface Area, is directly
proportional to the degree to which you do something you're passionate about
combined with the total number of people to whom this is effectively communicated.
It's a simple concept, but an extremely powerful one because what it implies is
that you can directly control the amount of luck you receive. In other words,
you make your own luck.
</p>
<p>
Here's how it works. When you pour energy into a passion, you develop an expertise
and an expertise of any kind is valuable. But quite often that value can actually
be magnified by the number people who are made aware of it. The reason is that
when people become aware of your expertise, some percentage of them will take
action to capture that value, but quite often it will be in a way you would never
have predicted. Maybe they'll want to hire you, or partner with you, or invest in
you, or who knows what. But in whatever way it happens, it will be serendipitous.
</p>
<p>
But it's not just the expertise that's important, the very passion that created
the expertise has value in its own right. This is because people want to be excited
about things and passion is infectious. When you do something you're excited about
you will naturally pull others into your orbit. And the more people with whom you
share your passion, the more who will be pulled into your orbit.
</p>
<p>
To satisfy my mathematically oriented brain I've gone one step further and formalized
the concept into the equation L = D * T, where L is luck, D is doing and T is telling.
This demonstrates clearly that the more you do and the more people you tell about it,
the larger your Luck Surface Area will become. And while I like equations, it's the
graphical representation that really brings the concept home.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Stories, not people, rule our world. We’re always telling ourselves a story about how the world works, and this makes stories very powerful.</p>

<p>For example, consider this story:</p>

<blockquote>
  <div><p>An American couple crash their car, die, and ascend to Heaven. God meets them, and they ask “What were the real results of the 2020 election, and who was behind the fraud?”
</p><p>
God says, “There was no fraud, my children. Biden won fair and square.” After a few seconds of stunned silence, the husband turns to the wife and whispers, “This goes higher up than we thought.”</p></div>
</blockquote>

<p>Why does the couple’s political belief supercede God?</p>

<p>Somewhere down the line, what was an entertaining story became something people believed in. This matters because the stories we tell ourselves change how we view the world.</p>

<p>The unreasonable impact of stories confused me. How can a story have so much power?! For the past year, I’ve explored this question, and stumbled upon some surprising connections.</p>

<p>This post explores these connections and what they mean for you: from how stories create beliefs, to lessons from master storytellers about what to be wary of, ending with four powerful stories that have shaped humanity.</p>

<p>Along the way, we’ll also figure out why our couple in Heaven think as they do.</p>

<h2 id="the-belief-hypothesis-spectrum-of-stories">The Belief-Hypothesis Spectrum of Stories</h2>

<p>Consider two stories. Story One is about the economy - how we’re doing great, or not so great, this year. Story Two is about Alice, a rabbit, and a rabbithole.</p>

<p>Which story are you more likely to believe?</p>

<p>Ask young kids, and they’ll probably connect with Alice and the rabbit. The economy? That’s too abstract - sounds like someone created it out of thin air.</p>

<p>While you might believe the story of the economy more, little kids might believe the story of Alice in Wonderland more.</p>

<p>So, we believe in some stories more than others. This degree of belief changes the nature of stories so much so that each kind of story has its own name:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stories we believe in are beliefs</li>
  <li>Stories we don’t believe in are lies, or fiction</li>
  <li>Stories we’re not sure about are hypotheses</li>
</ul>

<p>An interesting question to ask here is ‘How do we start believing in stories? How does a story move from fiction to belief?’</p>

<p>Everything starts as a story created by someone. Some call it fiction, others call it lies, some others call it belief, and a small minority calls it a hypothesis.</p>

<p>For many of us, an oft-repeated story, spoken by people we love or admire, becomes a belief.</p>

<p>However, a small minority believes a different story. Their story says not to believe any story just because someone we love or admire said it. Evidence reigns supreme. This is the story of science and rationality.</p>

<p>Sometimes, stories materialise a little too easily. If a boss is scolding an employee, others can make up stories - hypotheses - about why this might be the case. When they finally hear from the employee, some, or maybe all stories become false, and the current story, as told by the employee, becomes the leading belief.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The most common way of creating new stories though, is using templates we’ve heard before. More familiar stories give us more confidence in what’s going on.</p>

<p>For example, in the above example, consider three colleagues making up the story of what happened.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Colleague 1: “He talked to aliens without reporting them”</li>
  <li>Colleague 2: “He banged the bosses’ wife”</li>
  <li>Colleague 3: “He made a mistake on the report”.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first colleague’s story is wildly imaginative (and hard for us to take seriously), while the second and third  are templates we’ve seen before. Given the boss isn’t going bat-shit crazy, it’s probably the second colleague’s story, and not the third’s.</p>

<p>Stories might have seemed invisible beforehand, but they’re our primary sense-making tool to understand the world.</p>

<h2 id="mental-models-are-stories">Mental Models are Stories</h2>

<p><a href="https://neilkakkar.com/A-Simplistic-explanation-to-Mental-Models.html">Mental models</a> are frameworks and heuristics that help explain the world. Sound familiar? They are stories we repeatedly tell ourselves.</p>

<p>This gives a second dimension to stories. If the X axis is degree of belief, the Y axis is degree of explaining-power.</p>

<p>Remember how we prefer stories we’ve heard before, fitting them into templates? The templates are our mental models. They are things we’ve seen happen.</p>

<p>All models are necessarily a simplification of real life - the map isn’t the territory, which means you lose some information when you create the model. The quality of the model depends on what kind of information you lose.</p>

<p>If a map of roads in your country removes all information about trees and their varieties, you’ll probably still find the map useful. However, if you’re a forester, this map is all but useless for you.</p>

<p>Hence, all models are wrong, yet some remain useful.</p>

<p>Stories are also a simplification of real life. Further, simple stories are easy to tell, easy to understand, and easy to spread. Complicated stories don’t go too far.</p>

<p>Bill Gates, on the story of his success, echoes the same sentiment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Steve [Jobs] and I will always get more credit than we deserve, because otherwise the story gets too complicated.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remember our couple in Heaven contesting the election results? They have a single story in their mind with no room for alternatives: The elections were rigged. They don’t have a story to help them test out new stories. They stick to their own story, until they find a new more powerful story to replace it.</p>

<p>Since mental models are stories, meta-mental models apply to stories too. This leads to interesting implications.</p>

<p>For example, a famous meta-mental model goes: “to the man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail.” Applied to stories, “to a man with a single story, everything fits into the same story.”</p>

<p>What can our couple in Heaven do about this?</p>

<p>The above example hints at another interesting implication: we can use stories to counteract other stories.</p>

<p>Cognitive biases are stories about human psychology. In the face of pressure, poor mental hygiene, or a great sounding story, we end up making catastrophic mistakes.</p>

<p>For example, availability bias is a story professing that what comes to mind first is usually not the complete picture.</p>

<p>This story is counteracting other stories.</p>

<p>It’s  fighting simple stories that are top of mind. It’s a story telling you to beware of stories that have been designed to be so simple (and thus necessarily wrong) that they stay on top of your mind.</p>

<p>If the biases are cancer, learning the story to beware of them is chemotherapy.</p>

<h2 id="stories-are-a-vehicle-for-change">Stories are a Vehicle for Change</h2>

<p>A big question we haven’t yet touched upon is ‘Why do we tell stories?’</p>

<p>Stories move people. A story that moves us, compels us to change. It may not be enough to effect change, but it’s a necessary ingredient.</p>

<p>For example, people donate more to charity when they hear a story about one death, instead of a statistic about how many people died.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic.” - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifiable_victim_effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Identifiable Victim Effect</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Telling new stories isn’t just for generating new hypotheses, but for eventually changing your mind, and forming new beliefs.</p>

<p>This third dimension of stories is how effective they are at driving action.</p>

<p>Because of this potency, advertising leads with stories instead of raw facts.</p>

<p>Not just advertisers - news channels do this too. A lot of news is telling new stories for you to believe. Depending on the news channel, there can be zero, or a lot of evidence supporting their stories. And, without a story to counteract these stories, you’ll either believe what they’re saying, without checking the evidence, or completely discard it, based on who is telling the story.</p>

<p>That’s exactly why kids believe everything they’re told when they’re small. They haven’t learned a story that says “Judge for yourself what is true - other people often tell lies to further their own agendas.”</p>

<p>There are three ways to counteract a new story that we’ve already seen:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The Story of Science - the hunt for evidence</li>
  <li>The power of believing in only a single story - or the man with a hammer</li>
  <li>Learning about cognitive biases</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most effective statisticians are the ones who aren’t afraid to tell a story.  - <a href="https://seths.blog/2019/04/an-anecdote-and-a-statistical-analysis-walk-into-a-bar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seth Godin</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The third meta-story has lots of heuristics, and lots of literature to explore.</p>

<p>Specific to advertisers, salesmen, and news channels telling you a story, one good way to counter their story is learning why you’re being told a story. If the storyteller has something to gain, and they’re a master storyteller, they’ll be able to move you to action quickly. Beware their motives for telling you a story.</p>

<p>All the warnings aside, if you can harness this power yourself - you can tell yourself compelling stories - then you can effect change in yourself. That’s something we’ll explore soon, too.</p>

<h2 id="stories-create-blindspots">Stories Create Blindspots</h2>

<p>Just like how all models are wrong, and some are useful; all stories are wrong, some are useful. It’s very easy to make useless stories sound useful.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://seths.blog/2020/07/our-top-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seth Godin</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you talk about your last job, your last vacation, the things that happened when you were 12…<br>
What do you lead with?<br>
Do you lead with, “I broke my ankle that summer and rarely got out” or is it, “I stuck with my reading regimen and read all of Shakespeare.”<br>
Because both are true.<br>
The top story is the one that informs our narrative, and our narrative changes our future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A story is a lens that is prone to framing: how you frame the story changes its focus. This creates blindspots.</p>

<p>Stories are never going to be the …</p></div></div>

<p>The following presents a fast algorithm for volume computation of a simple, closed, triangulated 3D mesh. This assumption is a consequence of the divergence theorem. Further extensions may generalise to other meshes as well, although that is presently out of scope.</p>
<p>We begin with the definition of volume as the triple integral over a region of the constant one:</p>
<p><math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>V</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mo>∭</mo><mi>R</mi></msub><mn>1</mn><mstyle mathvariant="normal"><mi>d</mi></mstyle><mi>V</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">V = \iiint_R 1 \mathrm{d}V</annotation></semantics></math></p>
<p>Let <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mstyle mathvariant="bold"><mi>𝐅</mi></mstyle><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{F}</annotation></semantics></math> be a function in <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mstyle mathvariant="double-struck"><mi>ℝ</mi></mstyle><mn>3</mn></msup><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{R}^3</annotation></semantics></math> such that its divergence is equal to one. For the purposes of this paper, we choose:</p>
<p><math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mstyle mathvariant="bold"><mi>𝐅</mi></mstyle><mo stretchy="false" form="prefix">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>z</mi><mo stretchy="false" form="postfix">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mo>&lt;</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>,</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>&gt;</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{F}(x, y, z) = &lt;x, 0, 0&gt;</annotation></semantics></math></p>
<p>It can easily be verified that</p>
<p><math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mstyle mathvariant="normal"><mi>d</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>v</mi></mstyle><mstyle mathvariant="bold"><mi>𝐅</mi></mstyle><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>∂</mi><mi>F</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>∂</mi><mi>x</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>∂</mi><mi>F</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>∂</mi><mi>y</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>∂</mi><mi>F</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>∂</mi><mi>z</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{div} \mathbf{F} = \frac{\partial F}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial F}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial F}{\partial z} = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1</annotation></semantics></math></p>
<p>Therefore,</p>
<p><math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>V</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mo>∭</mo><mi>R</mi></msub><mn>1</mn><mi>d</mi><mi>V</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mo>∭</mo><mi>R</mi></msub><mstyle mathvariant="normal"><mi>d</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>v</mi></mstyle><mstyle mathvariant="bold"><mi>𝐅</mi></mstyle><mo stretchy="false" form="prefix">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>z</mi><mo stretchy="false" form="postfix">)</mo><mstyle mathvariant="normal"><mi>d</mi></mstyle><mi>V</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">V = \iiint_R 1 dV = \iiint_R \mathrm{div} \mathbf{F}(x, y, z) \mathrm{d}V</annotation></semantics></math></p>
<p>By the Divergence Theorem, this is equal to the surface integral:</p>

<p>This surface integral, defined over the surface S of the 3D mesh, is equal to the sum of its piecewise triangle parts.

Each individual triangle <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi>T</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T_i</annotation></semantics></math> may thus be parametrised as:</p>
<p><math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mstyle mathvariant="bold"><mi>𝐫</mi></mstyle><mo stretchy="false" form="prefix">(</mo><mi>u</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>v</mi><mo stretchy="false" form="postfix">)</mo><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>T</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub><mo>+</mo><mi>u</mi><msub><mi>Δ</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><mi>v</mi><msub><mi>Δ</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{r}(u, v) = T_{i0} + u\Delta_1 + v\Delta_2</annotation></semantics></math></p>
<p>Then, simple differentiation yields:</p>

<p>Therefore,</p>

<p>Thus, the surface integral can be rewritten in terms of this parametrisation, substituting in the definition of <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mstyle mathvariant="bold"><mi>𝐅</mi></mstyle><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{F}</annotation></semantics></math> as needed:</p>

<p>This cross product is constant throughout the triangle and easy to calculate from the vertex data. Only the X component of the cross product should be calculated; the others are equal to zero due to the dot product with the zero components of <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mstyle mathvariant="bold"><mi>𝐅</mi></mstyle><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{F}</annotation></semantics></math>. <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>V</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">V</annotation></semantics></math> can be thus be rewritten as:</p>

<p>We now focus on the surface integral <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mo>∬</mo><msub><mi>T</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></msub><mi>x</mi><mi>d</mi><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\iint_{T_i} x dA</annotation></semantics></math>.

<h2 id="performance-analysis">Performance analysis</h2>
<p>The final algorithm contains no numerical integration nor differentiation. In contrast to common naive algorithms for volume, which are equivalent to rendering the mesh and then sampling the render, an expensive operation, there is only a single loop in this algorithm, over the triangles. Thus, this algorithm for volume computation is O(n) to the number of the triangles. Furthermore, the per-triangle calculation is similarly efficient: given the natural expansion of the cross product, the inner part contains seven additions and three multiplications. On the outside of the loop is only a single multiplication. Thus, for a mesh of <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>n</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math> triangles, the algorithm requires <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>8</mn><mi>n</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">8n - 1</annotation></semantics></math> additions and <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>3</mn><mi>n</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">3n + 1</annotation></semantics></math> multiplications, or <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>11</mn><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">11n</annotation></semantics></math> floating point operations. This is <em>very</em> fast.</p>
<p>For a ballpark number, if volume needs to be calculated every frame in a high-performance 60 frames per second application, without the aid of a GPU, only using the CPU capabilities of a <a href="https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/55862/what-is-the-performance-and-the-performance-per-watt-of-raspberry-pi-3-in-gflops">$35 Raspberry Pi</a>, around 30 million triangles could be measured every frame.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>The vector calculus exam is soon, and I need to study. Plus, who doesn’t love 3D graphics?!</p>
<p><del>I would be (pleasantly) surprised if the algorithm is novel.</del> Further research <em>after</em> posting reveals the paper <a href="http://chenlab.ece.cornell.edu/Publication/Cha/icip01_Cha.pdf">Efficient Feature Extraction for 2D/3D Objects in Mesh Representation</a> by Cha Zheng and Tsuhan Chen, which appears to describe the same algorithm, although the derivation is different. It was fun while it lasted!</p>

<h2>Status Update</h2>



<p>It's been a bit since I've posted, but things are chugging along! I keep the Roadmap/Changelog pretty up to date as things are merged into the next release, so keep an eye on those pages if you're curious where we are and haven't seen a post in a while.</p>



<p>I am happy to say that since my last post we have solved a lot of content/client side challenges and have either a working proof of concept or framework in place to handle the following:</p>



<ul><li>Support for non humanoid NPCs</li><li>Ability to switch between zone servers (I.e. "zoning" into a new location) while keeping your character state synchronized in the world.</li><li>Shared wardrobe models that can be used by most, if not all humanoids. These can be mapped to NPCs statically or dynamically rendered based on the equipment being worn.</li></ul>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.funkhouse.games/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.funkhouse.games/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image.png 397w, https://www.funkhouse.games/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-208x300.png 208w" sizes="(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px"><figcaption>Preview of the wardrobe system. In this case, a matching robe &amp; coif are equipped by my player.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In the near future I am planning on releasing a simplified version of our framework which handles the mapping/rendering of armor as it is equipped/removed, as well as a way to define an entire wardrobe collection for NPCs regardless of what they have equipped.</p>



<p>Given that we're abstracting the Unity Multipurpose Avatar (a free) plugin, the hope is to share some code that others could copy/reuse to jump start their wardrobe/equipment system. This won't actually integrate with a database, but will give a clear picture on how you could manage/scale for an MMORPG.</p>



<p>I should have the above example ready in just a couple weeks here, but in the meantime.. I'm going to post a quick overview of the challenges we faced when getting a character to switch between zones.</p>



<h2>Synchronization Challenges</h2>



<p>So lets dig into the process of moving a player between zones. If you have been following along with our other posts, you should be aware that the world state is hosted/maintained by a single server.  Then, each zone is hosted by its own independent server, maintaining its own state separate from the world. Therefore, certain state changes which occur on the zone need to be propagated up to the world and vice versa.</p>



<p><em>For the sake of clarity, when referring to the "bind" location of the player, that is the zone, position, and direction they load upon dying (or can teleport to if they are a spell caster).</em></p>



<p>Before this change we did implement one aspect of zoning: reloading upon death. If your character died, the current zone server would persist your bind location as your current location in the database. Then, the character would (in a hard-coded manner) load the same exact zone, but upon load would use the new position which had been persisted by the zone just moments before.</p>



<p>We had built the death event in this way last year in preparation for changing zones. By handling deaths as an actual zone change, we'd hopefully have most of the code ready for when we get to changing between different zones. However, after we tried fitting in movement between two different zones... the issues with our previous design began to show.</p>



<h4>Previous Implementation</h4>



<ol><li>Player dies in the zone</li><li>Zone server creates a corpse and moves all player items/coins to said corpse. Updates position/direction/zone of the player to his or her bind location. These are persisted in the database. </li><li>Zone server alerts connected clients, letting them know of the death</li><li>Player who died contacts zone server to "leave" the zone</li><li>Zone server unloads the player, saving their state in the database.<ul><li>(Alternatively) if the player disconnected, they will be unloaded after a few minutes. At which point, their new state is persisted.</li></ul></li><li>Player requests a new "Zone Change" token from the world server. The <strong>player</strong> was specifying the zone they wanted to connect to in this case. (The zone in which they had died in, because we did not support changing zones yet)</li><li>Player requests to enter the zone for their bind, providing the "Zone Change" token.</li><li>Zone server calls the world server to validate the above token. If valid, the player is loaded from the database into the zone's memory.</li><li>Zone informs all of the connected clients that a player has entered the zone</li><li>Player continues process for loading the zone (terrain/audio/weather assets, each character individually from the zone server, etc.) </li></ol>



<p>Now there are a boatload of issues with the above. To list a few:</p>



<ul><li>The player is specifying the zone they want to go to, rather than simply being told.</li><li>World server wasn't validating whether a zone change is valid for a player. For example, a player who is far away from a portal shouldn't be able to use it to zone. A player shouldn't be able to "hop" 5-6 zones at once unless they happened to be bound there (or were teleported by a wizard/druid).</li><li>The player would leave the current zone before seeing if they could get a "Zone Change" token from the world server. This is OK for deaths, but does not work for normal zone changes. What if the target zone server is down for an extended period? Well, you've already disconnected from your current zone -- and with no zone left to connect to you would crash.</li></ul>



<h4>New Implementation</h4>



<p>So how does the zone change flow actually look like now? Lets look at the death case.</p>



<ol><li>Player dies in a zone</li><li>Zone server creates a corpse and moves all player items/coins to said corpse. Updates position/direction/zone of the player to his or her bind location. These are persisted in the database in case the player crashes.</li><li>Zone server informs the <strong>world server</strong> that the player has died.</li><li>Zone server alerts connected player clients/authoritative client, letting them know of the death.</li><li>Player who died contacts the <strong>world server</strong> first this time, informing the world server that it is requesting a zone change token for a particular reason of death.</li><li>World server checks whether the player is in fact dead (which it learned of in step 3). If true, the world creates a "Simple Zone Change" token and <strong>caches it</strong> locally, along with the player's target zone/location. The target zone host is returned to the player client, so they know which socket servers to connect to next.</li><li>Player calls the <strong>current zone</strong> they're in with the "Simple Zone Change" token to inform them that they're disconnecting.</li><li><strong>Current zone</strong> calls the world server, providing the zone change token, to inform them that the player is now leaving. </li><li>World server uses the zone change token provided from the zone server to lookup the player's target zone / location. The player's state is updated in the world at this point (required for the non death case).</li><li>World server returns back to the zone server an <strong>"Upgraded Zone Change"</strong> token.</li><li>Unless there was a failure validating the token, the zone will finally unload the player -- persisting all changes (except for their zone/position) in the database. Note that this step is required for the <strong>non death case</strong>. Death persistence happens in step 2.</li><li>Zone server returns the "Upgraded Zone Change" token to the player client.</li><li>Player client finally connects to the target zone host that it was provided in step 6, this time providing the "Upgraded Zone Change" token.</li><li>Target zone server calls the world server with the upgraded token. If valid, the world server will inform the player's party/guild members of the zone update, remove the token, and update their state as no longer dead.</li><li>If the target zone server receives back a success from the world, the player is loaded from the database into the zone's memory.</li><li>Zone informs all of the connected clients that a player has entered the zone </li><li>Player continues process for loading the zone (terrain/audio/weather assets, each character individually from the zone server, etc.)</li></ol>



<p>Although this process became a lot more intricate, I was really motivated after seeing cheating programs for EverQuest which would allow you to  instantly zone from any position, as long as the target zone was connected (including bind locations, for example). I wanted to be sure our game servers could authoritatively check that the player is entering a new zone legally, as best I could.</p>



<p>Note that I've primarily discussed the death case, but how do we generically change zones in an authoritative manner?</p>



<p>For this we created a new entity to track throughout servers/clients: "ZoneLinks". A zone link is really just the definition between two zones that are connected, including the position in the world where the links are located as well as other metadata to represent how the player's direction will be calculated after zoning.</p>



<p>Finally, on step 5 of the new flow -- rather than the player requesting a zone change token from the world for a reason of death, the player will request the zone change token for a reason of "ZoneLink". Additionally, the player only provides the zone link ID they are triggering. This allows for the server to decide/enforce which target zone the player will go to, as well as to lookup and see whether the player is truly within range of the zone boundary.</p>



<p>Although not important to the flow, we currently support "Proximity" link triggers on the client and "Clickable" link triggers on the client. A clickable link trigger can be assigned to a GameObject in unity so that whenever clicked it will trigger, whereas a proximity link trigger is simply an invisible game object w/ a collider (triggering when a player walks through it).</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.funkhouse.games/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/proximity-zone-link.gif" alt=""><figcaption> Proof of concept / demonstration of proximity based zone links working. (These two zones wont really have a connection) </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>If you look closely in the above, you should be able to see most of the new features we've added since the last post. For example, the NPCs are wearing armor -- and in this case it is a static wardrobe collection for that type of NPC -- whereas the sword they are wielding is coming from is actually equipped.</p>



<p>And with that.. I'll leave you guys until the next update.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features<a href="#features" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>This library hosts a couple of models that you can play with.</p>
<h3 id="interactive-drawings">Interactive Drawings<a href="#interactive-drawings" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>This tool allows you to draw over your datasets. These drawings can later
be converted to models or to preprocessing tools.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://koaning.github.io/human-learn/draw-gif.gif"></p>
<h3 id="classification-models">Classification Models<a href="#classification-models" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<h4 id="functionclassifier">FunctionClassifier<a href="#functionclassifier" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>This allows you to define a function that can make classification predictions. It's
constructed in such a way that you can use the arguments of the function as a parameter
that you can benchmark in a grid-search.</p>
<h4 id="interactiveclassifier">InteractiveClassifier<a href="#interactiveclassifier" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>This allows you to draw decision boundaries in interactive charts to create a
model. You can create charts interactively in the notebook and export it as a
scikit-learn compatible model.</p>
<h3 id="regression-models">Regression Models<a href="#regression-models" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<h4 id="functionregressor">FunctionRegressor<a href="#functionregressor" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>This allows you to define a function that can make regression predictions. It's
constructed in such a way that you can use the arguments of the function as a parameter
that you can benchmark in a grid-search.</p>
<h3 id="outlier-detection-models">Outlier Detection Models<a href="#outlier-detection-models" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<h4 id="functionoutlierdetector">FunctionOutlierDetector<a href="#functionoutlierdetector" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>This allows you to define a function that can declare outliers. It's constructed in
such a way that you can use the arguments of the function as a parameter that you
can benchmark in a grid-search.</p>
<h4 id="interactiveoutlierdetector">InteractiveOutlierDetector<a href="#interactiveoutlierdetector" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>This allows you to draw decision boundaries in interactive charts to create a
model. If a point falls outside of these boundaries we might be able to declare
it an outlier. There's a threshold parameter for how strict you might want to be.</p>
<h3 id="preprocessing-models">Preprocessing Models<a href="#preprocessing-models" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<h4 id="pipetransformer">PipeTransformer<a href="#pipetransformer" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>This allows you to define a function that can make handle preprocessing. It's
constructed in such a way that you can use the arguments of the function as a parameter
that you can benchmark in a grid-search. This is especially powerful in combination
with the pandas <code>.pipe</code> method. If you're unfamiliar with this amazing feature, you
may appreciate <a href="https://calmcode.io/pandas-pipe/introduction.html">this tutorial</a>.</p>
<h4 id="interactivepreprocessor">InteractivePreprocessor<a href="#interactivepreprocessor" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>This allows you to draw features that you'd like to add to your dataset or
your machine learning pipeline. You can use it via <code>tfm.fit(df).transform(df)</code> and
<code>df.pipe(tfm)</code>.</p>
<h3 id="datasets">Datasets<a href="#datasets" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<h4 id="titanic">Titanic<a href="#titanic" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>This library hosts the popular titanic survivor dataset for demo purposes. The goal of
this dataset is to predict who might have survived the titanic disaster.</p>
<h4 id="fish">Fish<a href="#fish" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>The fish market dataset is also hosted in this library. The goal of this dataset
is to predict the weight of fish. However, it can also be turned into a classification problem
by predicting the species.</p>

<p><span><b>TL;DR</b></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Here’s the game. Flip a coin. You win 50% of your net worth on heads, but only lose 40% on tails. How many times should you play?</li>
<li>Despite the apparently favourable odds, chances are you’ll eventually go bust. Why?</li>
<li>This is because of the path-dependency of time. Because of the fallacious ergodicity assumption.</li>
<li>Ergodicity is when the ensemble-average equals the time-average. For instance, when 10 people doing something once produces the same result as 1 person doing it 10 times.</li>
<li>Essentially, ergodicity lets you conveniently convert time into a space equivalent.&nbsp;</li>
<li>For non-ergodic systems, the aggregate’s performance is a misleading indicator of individual performance. As a whole, the average might look like it’s winning, despite majority of individuals losing.</li>
<li>The Kelly criterion allows us to optimize our bet size to maximize long-term winnings.</li>
<li>While most financial systems are non-ergodic, the foundations of classical economic theory rests on fallacious ergodic assumptions – from DCF valuations to the way we measure GDP growth.</li>
<li>Putting these ergodicity concepts to practical use, I’ve now increased the weighting I give to non-recoverable risks.</li>

<p>You’re probably familiar with these common mistakes in interpreting data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Looking at <strong>average</strong> when you should be looking at <strong>median.</strong> <span>e.g. for personal income distributions</span></li>
<li>Looking at <strong>aggregates</strong> rather than more <strong>granular</strong> <strong>segments.</strong> <span>e.g. sales increased 10% this year, but all of it came from a new business line, while the core businesses remained flat</span></li>
<li>Mistaking <strong>non-linear</strong> outcomes to be <strong>linear</strong> ones <span>e.g. cumulative number of COVID-19 cases</span></li>
</ul>
<p>But you’re probably less familiar with the <strong>ergodicity assumption</strong>.</p>
<p>Surprisingly prevalent in systems, but generally poorly understood and barely known.</p>
<p>Much like Black Swans, <a href="https://neurabites.com/antifragility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">antifragility, non-linearity, and optionality</a>, it’s another concept that Nassim Taleb has raised his voice on. But this one has received far less attention than others.</p>
<p>And hence I write this post in parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Going bust despite favourable odds</strong>: A gambling example, ergodic vs non-ergodic, and the Kelly criterion</li>
<li><strong>Ergodocity economics: </strong>Prevalence and dangers of the ergodic assumption in modern portfolio theory, DCF models, and GDP</li>

<h3><span><strong>1. Going bust despite favourable odds</strong></span></h3>
<p><span><b>1.1. Definition</b></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A process is said to be <strong>ergodic</strong>&nbsp;if the <strong>ensemble</strong>-average and <strong>time</strong>-average is <strong>equivalent</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A more formal definition from Ole Peters from his <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-019-0732-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dec-19 Nature journal article</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ergodic hypothesis is a key analytical device of equilibrium statistical mechanics. It underlies the assumption that the <strong>time</strong> <strong>average</strong> and the <strong>expectation</strong> <strong>value</strong> of an observable are the same. Where it is valid, dynamical descriptions can often be replaced with much simpler probabilistic ones — time is essentially eliminated from the models.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A mouthful right? Let’s park the definition here for now, and take baby steps with a more digestible example.</p>

<p><span><b>1.2. Rigged coin flip game</b></span></p>
<p>Flip a coin. If heads, your net wealth is <strong>increased by 50%</strong>. If tails, your net wealth is <strong>decreased by 40%</strong>.</p>
<p>Would you play? If so, how many times?</p>
<p>At first glance it seems like the game is rigged in your favour. We expect an equal number of heads and tails in the long run. Given you are paid more from each head than you are penalised for on each tail, you should just play as many times as possible right? Besides, even if you end up on a losing streak, you don’t ever lose all your money, you only lose 40% of whatever you were on. You can win it back with the favourable payoffs. Right?</p>
<p>Well, here’s a simulation of what could happen if you played 50 times.</p>

<ul>
<li>Horizontal axis is time.</li>
<li>Vertical axis is net worth, a function of time.</li>
<li>N=1 means we’re looking at the outcome for 1 individual.</li>
</ul>
<p>There doesn’t seem to be a trend here. We were expecting an upward gradient given the favourable odds. But we end up at a loss. Strange. Maybe this guy was unlucky?</p>
<p>Let’s extend the simulation for this one individual into 1,000 rounds.</p>

<p>Looks like they’re stuck at zero. This is surprisingly given the favourable odds. We expected the math to offset the unlucky first 50 rounds. Is this guy just really unlucky?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well here’s the same chart as above but with a logarithmic axis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Remember they never go completely bust – since a loss is 40% of their current wealth. Now, the downward trend is rather apparent.</p>

<p>This was a simulation for 1 individual over 50 rounds.</p>
<p>Now, let’s run simulations for 100 individuals playing concurrently over 50 rounds, and show the average results (wealth) at each point in time in one image.</p>

<p>The green line shows the <strong>average</strong> y-values (wealth) for 100 players at each x-value (time). Again, no clear trend.</p>
<p>Simulate for 10,000 players (red line) and we start to see a trend. On average, this group of 10,000 players is sitting on a nice ~10x profit.</p>
<p>Simulate a million concurrent players, and the trend is more apparent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, a logarithmic axis shows this more clearly.</p>

<p>The average wealth of a million people increases exponentially as they play this game. <span>(Recall from all the March COVID-19 graphs that a linear increase on logarithmic axis means exponential growth. It’s a neat trick to distinguish exponential growth from mere very fast growth.)</span></p>
<p>This trend persists as we extend time to 1,000 rounds and so on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But wait. This doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p>Earlier, we showed that for an <strong>individual</strong> player, wealth trends to <strong>zero&nbsp;</strong>over time.</p>
<p>But for the <strong>aggregate</strong> of individuals, wealth trends <strong>exponentially upwards</strong> over time.</p>
<p>How can many things that trend to zero sum up to exponential growth?</p>
<p>Answer: <strong>there’s a few really lucky bastards that distort the average.</strong></p>
<p>A more technical answer: <strong>ergodicity</strong>. Or more specifically, a false assumption of ergodicity for this non-ergodic game.</p>

<p>Let’s take a deeper dive and explore some scenarios for an individual starting with $100.</p>
<p><strong>Round 1</strong>: 2 scenarios</p>
<ul>
<li><span>H: $100 x 1.5 = $150 (up $50)</span></li>
<li><span>T: $100 x 0.6 = $60 (down $40)</span></li>
<li><span>Outcomes: 1 up, 1 down <strong><span>50% of outcomes are up.</span></strong></span></li>
<li><span>Average after 1 round: <strong><span>$105</span></strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Round 2</strong>: 4 scenarios</p>
<ul>
<li><span>HH: $100 x 1.5 x 1.5 = $225 (up $125)</span></li>
<li><span>HT: $100 x 1.5 x 0.6 = $90 (down $10)</span></li>
<li><span>TH: $100 x 0.6 x 1.5 = $90 (down $10)</span></li>
<li><span>TT: $100 x 0.6 x 0.6 = $36 (down $64)</span></li>
<li><span>Outcomes: 1 up, 3 down. <strong><span>25% of outcomes are up.</span></strong></span></li>
<li><span>Average after 2 rounds: <span><strong>$110.3</strong></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Round 3</strong>: 8 scenarios</p>
<ul>
<li><span>HHH: $100 x 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.5&nbsp; = $337.5 (up $237.5)</span></li>
<li><span>HTH: $100 x 1.5 x 0.6 x 1.5 = $135 (up $35)</span></li>
<li><span>THH: $100 x 0.6 x 1.5 x 1.5 = $135 (up $35)</span></li>
<li><span>TTH: $100 x 0.6 x 0.6 x 1.5 = $54 (down $66)</span></li>
<li><span>HHT: $100 x 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.6 = $135 (up $35)</span></li>
<li><span>HTT: $100 x 1.5 x 0.6 x 0.6 = $54 (down $66)</span></li>
<li><span>THT: $100 x 0.6 x 1.5 x 0.6 = $54 (down $66)</span></li>
<li><span>TTT: $100 x 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.6 = $21.6 (down $78.4)</span></li>
<li><span>Outcomes: 4 up, 4 down.</span> <strong><span>50% of outcomes are up.</span></strong></li>
<li><span>Average after 3 rounds:</span> <span><strong>$115.8</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, we repeat this logic for even more rounds with the help of binomial probability distributions in Excel.</p>
<p><strong>Round 10</strong>: 1,024 scenarios</p>
<ul>
<li><span>H 10 times: $100 x 1.5<sup>10 </sup>= $5,767</span></li>
<li><span>H 5 times, T 5 times (order doesn’t matter here): $100 x 1.5<sup>5 </sup>x 0.6<sup>5 </sup>= $59</span></li>
<li><span>T 10 times: $100 x 0.6<sup>10 </sup>= $0.6</span></li>
<li><span>Outcomes: 386 up, 638 down. <strong><span>38% of outcomes are up..</span></strong></span></li>
<li><span>Average after 10 rounds: <strong><span>$163</span> <span>($100 x 1.05<sup>10</sup>).</span></strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Round 100</strong>: 2<sup>100 </sup>scenarios</p>
<ul>
<li><span>H 100 times: $100 x 1.5<sup>100 </sup>= $4.1 x 10<sup>19</sup></span></li>
<li><span>H 50 times, T 50 times (order doesn’t matter here): $100 x 1.5<sup>50 </sup>x 0.6<sup>5 </sup>= $0.5</span></li>
<li><span>T 100 times: $100 x 0.6<sup>100 </sup>= $6.5 x 10<sup>-21</sup></span></li>
<li><span>Outcomes: 1.7 x 10<sup>29 </sup>up, 1.1 x 10<sup>30 </sup>down. <strong><span>14% of outcomes are up.</span></strong></span></li>
<li><span>Average after 100 rounds: <strong><span>$13,150 ($100 x 1.05<sup>100</sup>)</span></strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p>Some observations.</p>
<p>(i) In aggregate, payout is favourable to the players since average wealth is consistently above starting value of $100. This is the ensemble-average.</p>
<p>(ii) But this asymmetric payoff is only favourable on the <strong>ensemble dimension</strong> (taking the aggregate and dividing it by number of players). The pay-off structure is not favourable to an individual on the <strong>temporal </strong>(time) <strong>dimension</strong>. On an individual level, people are actually more likely to lose the longer they play. Gambler’s ruin. Thus, looking at ensemble returns is a poor indicator of individual returns.</p>
<p>So as the game goes on: the house loses money as they’re paying out more than they receive, while more people become losers, and just a lucky few get obscenely rich. <span>(For context, the winnings from 100 consecutive heads, $4.1 x 10<sup>19</sup> is taking the global GDP of ~$100t and multiplying it by 400k years. So all of the wealth we’re creating today multiplied by longer than Homo sapiens’ existence. The probability of 1 in 2<sup>100 </sup>is even more ludicrous.)</span></p>
<p>There’s many variations to the example we explored: e.g. a triple-or-nothing coin flip. We get similar results except instead of decaying to zero, people go completely bust and end the game there, while some extremely lucky get fanatically rich.</p>

<p><span><b>1.3. Back to ergodicity</b></span></p>
<p>Recall:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A process is said to be <strong>ergodic</strong>&nbsp;if the <strong>ensemble</strong>-average and <strong>time</strong>-average is <strong>equivalent</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly, simulating an individual playing 10,000 rounds gives a drastically different result to simulating 10,000 individuals playing 1 round.</p>
<p>The trajectory of an individual over a long time (time-average) gives a different result to the aggregate of many individual’s trajectories at an instant in time (ensemble-average, aka. space-average).<span>&nbsp;(Note: we can substitute ‘average’ in this statement with expectation value/outcome/probability/pay-off.)</span></p>
<p>What accounts for this difference is the <strong>path-dependent property of time</strong>. This distinction between the ensemble …</p></div></div>

		A running tally of how the pandemic has been increasing inequity at a fantastic rate.	</p><div>
		
<p><strong>By Chuck Collins</strong> /<a href="https://inequality.org/great-divide/updates-billionaire-pandemic/"> Inequality.org</a></p>



<p>The collective wealth of all U.S. billionaires has increased over $1.1 trillion since mid-March 2020, a nearly 40% leap during the past 10 months of national emergency. This wealth windfall could pay for all the relief for working families contained in the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-to-propose-1-9-trillion-covid-19-package-11610661977" target="_blank">$1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package</a>&nbsp;proposed by President Biden, while leaving the nation’s richest households no worse off than they were before COVID-19 hit.</p>



<p>The combined fortune of the nation’s 660 billionaires as of Monday, January 18, 2021 was $4.1 trillion, up 38.6% from their collective net worth of just under $3 trillion on March 18, 2020, the rough start of the pandemic, based on&nbsp;<em>Forbes</em>&nbsp;data compiled in&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LGeUxuE-Z2OyNKu54JQIffS1v588iUvV6yd6D2vH6Vc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this report&nbsp;</a>by the Americans for Tax Fairness (ATF) and the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS). There have been 46 newly minted billionaires since the beginning of the pandemic, when&nbsp;<a href="https://americansfortaxfairness.org/issue/tale-two-crises-billionaires-gain-workers-feel-pandemic-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there were 614</a>.</p>



<p>At $4.1 trillion, the total wealth of America’s 660 billionaires is two-thirds higher than the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/dfa/distribute/chart/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$2.4 trillion in total wealth</a>&nbsp;held by the bottom half of the population,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.census.gov/popclock/embed.php?component=counter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">165 million Americans</a>.</p>



<p>March 18 is used as the unofficial beginning of the pandemic because by then most<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/13/politics/states-coronavirus-fema/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;federal</a>&nbsp;and<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/what-states-have-declared-coronavirus-emergencies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;state</a>&nbsp;economic restrictions responding to the virus were in place. Moreover, March 18 was also the publication date of Forbes’ annual billionaires report in 2020. It provided a detailed baseline that ATF and IPS have been comparing periodically with real-time data from the&nbsp;<em>Forbes</em>&nbsp;website. This methodology has been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/12/joe-biden/biden-says-billionaires-gained-800-billion-study-l/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">favorably reviewed by PolitiFact</a>.</p>

<p>Because of long-standing racial and gender disparities,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/11/16/new-but-narrow-job-pathways-for-americas-unemployed-and-low-wage-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">low-wage workers</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/09/23/914427907/as-pandemic-deaths-add-up-racial-disparities-persist-and-in-some-cases-worsen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">people of color</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/09/covid-19-gender-inequality-jobs-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">women</a>&nbsp;have suffered disproportionately in the combined medical and economic crises of 2020. Latinos are more likely to&nbsp;<a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#demographics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">become infected with Covid-19</a>&nbsp;and Blacks to die from the disease than are white people. Billionaires are overwhelmingly white men.</p>



<p>The stock market surge and lock-down economy have been a boon to tech monopolies and helped create multiple U.S. “centi-billionaires.” Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates were each worth more than $100 billion on Jan. 18. Prior to this year, Bezos had been the only U.S. centi-billionaire, reaching that peak in 2018. Bezos and other billionaires have seen particularly astonishing increases in wealth over the past 10 months:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Elon Musk’s</strong>&nbsp;wealth grew by over $154 billion, from $24.6 billion on March 18 to $179.2 billion on Jan. 18, a nearly eight-fold increase, boosted by his&nbsp;<strong>Tesla</strong>&nbsp;The boost in wealth of the SpaceX founder over the past 10 months is more than twice that of any other billionaire. That $154 billion growth in wealth is also about seven times NASA’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.planetary.org/space-policy/nasas-fy-2020-budget#:~:text=NASA%27s%20budget%20in%20fiscal%20year%20%28FY%29%202020%20is,by%20a%20supplemental%20budget%20request%20on%2013%20May." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$22.6 billion budget in FY2020</a>, the federal agency Musk has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/05/26/spacex-how-elon-musk-took-idea-cusp-history/5257977002/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">credited with saving his company</a>&nbsp;with a big federal contract when the firm’s rockets were failing and it faced bankruptcy.</li><li><strong>Jeff Bezos’s&nbsp;</strong>wealth grew from $113 billion on March 18 to $182 billion, an increase of 61%. Adding in his ex-wife MacKenzie Scott’s wealth of $55 billion on Jan. 18, the two had a combined wealth of almost a quarter of a trillion dollars thanks to their&nbsp;<strong>Amazon</strong>&nbsp;If Bezos’s $68.6 billion growth in wealth was distributed to all his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/27/technology/pushed-by-pandemic-amazon-goes-on-a-hiring-spree-without-equal.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">810,000 U.S. employees</a>, each would get a windfall bonus of almost $85,000 and Bezos would not be any “poorer” than he was 10 months ago.</li><li><strong>Mark Zuckerberg’s&nbsp;</strong>wealth grew from $54.7 billion on March 18 to $92 billion, an increase of over two-thirds fueled by his&nbsp;<strong>Facebook</strong></li></ul>



<p>Tax reform that ensures the wealthy pay their fair share—the principle&nbsp;<a href="https://americansfortaxfairness.org/issue/joe-bidens-tax-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Biden tax plan</a>&nbsp;is built on—would transform a good chunk of those huge billionaire gains into public revenue to help heal a hurting nation. But getting at that big boost in billionaire fortunes is not as simple as raising tax rates: tax rules let the rich delay, diminish and even ultimately avoid any tax on the growth in their wealth. What’s needed is structural change to how wealth is taxed.</p>



<p>The most direct approach is an annual wealth tax on the biggest fortunes, proposed by Senators&nbsp;<a href="https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/ultra-millionaire-tax" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elizabeth Warren</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/tax-extreme-wealth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bernie Sanders</a>, among others. Another option is the annual taxation of investment gains on stocks and other tradable assets, an idea advanced by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/ranking-members-news/wyden-unveils-proposal-to-fix-broken-tax-code-equalize-treatment-of-wages-and-wealth-protect-social-security-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Senate Finance Committee chair, Ron Wyden</a>. Even under the current discounted tax rates for investment income, if Wyden’s plan had been in effect in 2020, America’s billionaires would be paying hundreds of billions of dollars in extra taxes this spring thanks to their gargantuan pandemic profits last year.</p>

<h4><strong>December 9, 2020 Update</strong></h4>



<p>According to a&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qLbVmE3QyBh06GFFYkUv7eEWvz8DInZam4dx5vyLtT8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new report</a>&nbsp;by the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) and Americans for Tax Fairness (ATF), the collective wealth of America’s 651 billionaires has jumped by over $1 trillion since roughly the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to a total of $4 trillion at market close on Monday, December 7, 2020. Combined, just the top 10 billionaires are now worth more than $1 trillion.</p>



<p>Their wealth growth since March is more than the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/12/03/what-is-in-congressional-bailout-deal-stimulus-checks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$908 billion in pandemic relief</a>&nbsp;proposed by a bipartisan group of members of Congress, which is likely to be the package that moves forward for a vote in the next week, but has been stalled over Republican concerns that it is too costly.</p>



<p>The total net worth of the nation’s 651 billionaires rose from $2.95 trillion on March 18—the rough start of the pandemic shutdowns—to $4.01 trillion on Dec. 7, a leap of 36%, based on an analysis of&nbsp;<em>Forbes</em>&nbsp;magazines research on billionaires. By around March 18 most&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/13/politics/states-coronavirus-fema/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">federal</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/what-states-have-declared-coronavirus-emergencies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">state</a>&nbsp;economic restrictions in response to the virus were in place.</p>



<p>Forbes’ annual global billionaires report was published March 18, and ATF and IPS collected the real-time data on Dec. 7 from the&nbsp;<em>Forbes</em>&nbsp;website. The methodology of this analysis has been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/12/joe-biden/biden-says-billionaires-gained-800-billion-study-l/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">favorably reviewed by PolitiFact</a>. The ATF-IPS analysis also looks at wealth growth since February 2019—the date of Forbes’ immediately previous annual billionaires report published well before the start of the pandemic and resulting market gyrations.</p>



<p><strong>The $1 trillion wealth gain by 651 U.S. billionaires since mid-March is:</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="background"><a href="#background">→</a>Background</h2><p>I recently got the chance to completely reset my Windows 10 machine, and took advantage of the
opportunity to create a dev environment I would love. These were my high-level goals:</p><ul><li>Make WSL my primary dev environment</li><li>Use VSCode as my primary editor</li><li>Have a beautiful terminal</li></ul><h2 id="wsl-%26-vscode"><a href="#wsl-%26-vscode">→</a>WSL &amp; VSCode</h2><p>To achieve this, I started by installing WSL 2. I went with an Ubuntu distro because that's what
I've had the most experience with in the past. You can find instructions on installing WSL and/or
upgrading it to WSL 2 in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">official
docs</a>.</p><p>Next I installed <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a>, and the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack">Remote Development extension
pack</a>
which is where things start to get fun. With this extension pack installed, you can edit files in
the WSL filesystem seamlessly with VSCode.</p><h2 id="windows-terminal"><a href="#windows-terminal">→</a>Windows Terminal</h2><p>To get my beautiful terminal going, I installed <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-terminal-1-0/">Windows
Terminal</a> (WT), which is an
awesome new terminal experience for Windows from Microsoft.</p><p>Although I wanted WSL to be my primary dev environment, I still wanted working in Windows to be a
nice experience as well, so I wanted to make sure my PowerShell terminal was great too. To get that
going, I also installed the latest <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/announcing-powershell-7-0/">PowerShell
7</a>.</p><p>Now it was time to setup my WT profiles. By default, WT creates a profile for WSL, PowerShell, cmd,
and Azure Cloud Shell. I'm not interested in using cmd or Azure Cloud Shell, and I'm going to be
using PowerShell 7 instead of PowerShell, so I disabled all but the WSL shell. To do this, simply
add the <code>"hidden": true</code> property to the profiles in the WT settings file (click the dropdown in the
header bar and then Settings or <span><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>,</kbd></span>).</p><h3 id="powershell-wt-profile"><a href="#powershell-wt-profile">→</a>PowerShell WT Profile</h3><p>Now to create my PowerShell 7 profile, I added the following object to the profiles array:</p><pre data-language="json" data-index="0"><code><span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>"guid"</span><span>: </span><span>"</span><span>{346d54ee-6282-41c7-846a-0a2fa38ff66b}</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>"name"</span><span>: </span><span>"</span><span>PowerShell</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>"commandline"</span><span>: </span><span>"</span><span>pwsh.exe</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>"icon"</span><span>: </span><span>"</span><span>%SystemRoot%</span><span>\\</span><span>Installer</span><span>\\</span><span>{8B844F39-E6EE-486B-BE85-96A485AE2B96}</span><span>\\</span><span>PowerShellExe.ico</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>"startingDirectory"</span><span>: </span><span>"</span><span>D:</span><span>\\</span><span>code</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>A few things to note:</p><ul><li>To generate a GUID, you can use the <a href="https://www.guidgenerator.com/online-guid-generator.aspx">Online GUID
Generator</a> website</li><li>I am using the <code>pwsh.exe</code> command instead of <code>powershell.exe</code> to use PowerShell 7</li><li>Follow these steps to find the icon path on your system:<ol><li>Open your Start menu and search for PowerShell 7</li><li>Right click on the app and click "Open file location"</li><li>In the file explorer that opens, right click the shortcut and click "Properties"</li><li>On the "Shortcut" tab, click the "Change Icon..." button and copy the file path</li></ol></li><li>I like to set the starting directory to be where I keep all my projects, and ideally this is near
the root of a drive to keep file paths as short as possible</li></ul><h3 id="ubuntu-wt-profile"><a href="#ubuntu-wt-profile">→</a>Ubuntu WT Profile</h3><p>Since I want to make WSL my primary environment, I moved its profile object to the top of the list
so that it will appear first in the new tab dropdown. Then I replaced the top-level <code>defaultProfile</code>
property with the WSL profile's <code>guid</code> property to make it the profile that is opened automatically
when WT launches.</p><p>Similarly to PowerShell, I wanted the starting directory to be <code>~/code</code>. If you try setting that
directly in the WT configuration, you'll find it doesn't work because WT doesn't know how to resolve
it. You can use an absolute path to get there instead, and you need to use a Windows file path that
WT can understand. You can access a WSL distro's file system from Windows using <code>\\wsl$\&lt;distro&gt;</code>, so, I added this property to the Ubuntu profile object: <code>"startingDirectory": "\\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu\\home\\blake\\code"</code> (where <code>Ubuntu</code> should be replaced with the name of your WSL
distro and <code>blake</code> with your WSL username).</p><h3 id="wt-theme"><a href="#wt-theme">→</a>WT Theme</h3><p>Finally, I wanted to get a new theme for my WT. I decided I would like to use the same colour scheme
as I was using for VSCode at the time, which was the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl">Night
Owl</a> theme. So (naturally), <a href="https://chimerical.ca/posts/generate-windows-terminal-scheme">I
created</a> a <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=blake-mealey.generate-wt-scheme">VSCode
plugin</a> to
automatically generate a WT theme.</p><p>Here's what my terminal looks like with the Night Owl theme:</p><p><span>

  </a>
    </span></p><h2 id="shell-profiles"><a href="#shell-profiles">→</a>Shell Profiles</h2><p>Next up I wanted to get my shell profiles started. We'll iterate on these more later on. Your shell
profile is a script that gets run when the terminal starts which can be used to configure the
current environment. For PowerShell, this will be a PowerShell script and for WSL it will be a bash
script.</p><h3 id="powershell-profile"><a href="#powershell-profile">→</a>PowerShell Profile</h3><p>Let's start with PowerShell again. You can run <code>echo $PROFILE</code> to see if a profile script already
exists. For me it did, and it was located at
<code>C:\Users\blake\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1</code>. If it doesn't exist for you,
it's not a big deal. It seems that PowerShell looks in a <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/scripting/understanding-the-six-powershell-profiles/">variety of
places</a> and you
can just create a script in the appropriate place and it should work. Here's what I added to my
profile script:</p><pre data-language="ps1" data-index="1"><code><span><span>#</span><span> C:\Users\blake\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Set-Alias</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>Name editor </span><span>-</span><span>Value nano</span></span>
<span><span>Set-Alias</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>Name edit </span><span>-</span><span>Value editor</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>profile_alias</span><span> { editor $PROFILE }</span></span>
<span><span>Set-Alias</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>Name profile </span><span>-</span><span>Value profile_alias</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>reload_alias</span><span> { </span><span>&amp;</span><span> $PROFILE }</span></span>
<span><span>Set-Alias</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>Name reload </span><span>-</span><span>Value reload_alias</span></span></code></pre><p>Let's break this down a bit. First of all, I am creating a couple aliases (<code>editor</code> and <code>edit</code>) for
my in-terminal editor. I prefer to use a terminal editor instead of a GUI editor because it reduces
context switching when working in the terminal, and is much faster to load the file to make a quick
edit. That said, if you wanted to use VSCode, you could replace <code>nano</code> with <code>code</code>.</p><p>The reason I create an alias for my editor command is so that I can change the editor at any time
and not have to change my muscle memory to use the new command. It also means I can create more
aliases that open the editor without having to change all of them if I change my editor.</p><p>Next, I add the <code>profile</code> alias which opens the profile script in my editor (the <code>editor</code> alias is
already coming in handy!). This is great because now I don't need to remember where my profile is
ever again, I can just run <code>profile</code> and can start editing it right away. I also add a <code>reload</code>
alias which simply reloads the shell using the profile script. This lets me use my changes to the
profile script without having to create a new terminal instance.</p><h3 id="bash-profile"><a href="#bash-profile">→</a>Bash Profile</h3><p>Now let's do the same thing for bash. In bash, the profile is a bash script located at <code>~/.bashrc</code>.
By default it contains a lot of stuff already, so I like to add my changes to the bottom of the
script. Here's what I added:</p><pre data-language="bash" data-index="2"><code><span><span>#</span><span> ~/.bashrc</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>export</span><span> EDITOR=</span><span>"</span><span>nano</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>alias</span><span> editor=</span><span>"</span><span>$EDITOR</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>alias</span><span> edit=</span><span>"</span><span>editor</span><span>"</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>export</span><span> PROFILE=</span><span>"</span><span>~/.bashrc</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>alias</span><span> profile=</span><span>"</span><span>editor </span><span>$PROFILE</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>alias</span><span> reload=</span><span>"</span><span>source </span><span>$PROFILE</span><span>"</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>alias</span><span> explorer=</span><span>"</span><span>explorer.exe</span><span>"</span></span></code></pre><p>This is very similar to the PowerShell script. First, we create an <code>EDITOR</code> environment variable.
Some Linux programs respect the <code>EDITOR</code> variable, so it's a good idea to set it if you want more
programs to know which editor you want to use. Then we use <code>EDITOR</code> to create our <code>editor</code> and
<code>edit</code> aliases just like before.</p><p>Then, I add the same <code>profile</code> and <code>reload</code> aliases to edit and reload the profile script.</p><p>Finally, I added another alias which maps <code>explorer</code> to <code>explorer.exe</code> which makes it the same
command for opening the Windows File Explorer in WSL as in PowerShell.</p><h2 id="terminal-editor"><a href="#terminal-editor">→</a>Terminal Editor</h2><p>Let's revisit our terminal editor. I started with nano because it's a pretty intuitive and easy to
use editor for terminals. I don't have a lot of terminal editor experience, so I'm not very handy
with Vim, and even nano can be a bit awkward to use.</p><p>So, I did a bit of research to see if there were any editors that had more similar keyboard
shortcuts and navigation to a modern GUI text editor, like VSCode. I found
<a href="https://micro-editor.github.io/">micro</a> which is available cross-platform, which is perfect!</p><h3 id="powershell-editor"><a href="#powershell-editor">→</a>PowerShell Editor</h3><p>Let's install it. In PowerShell, it's most easily installed via <a href="https://scoop.sh/">scoop</a> or
<a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a>. If you don't have either installed yet I'd highly recommend
you do, as it makes installing programs in Windows a much easier experience. I'm going to use scoop
for the purposes of this guide. With scoop installed, simply run <code>scoop install micro</code>. Now you can
run <code>micro</code> to edit your files.</p><p>Let's update our profile script to use it:</p><pre data-language="ps1" data-index="3"><code><span><span>#</span><span> C:\Users\blake\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Set-Alias</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>Name editor </span><span>-</span><span>Value micro</span></span></code></pre><h3 id="ubuntu-editor"><a href="#ubuntu-editor">→</a>Ubuntu Editor</h3><p>To install on Ubuntu, we can run the install script from the micro website:</p><pre data-language="bash" data-index="4"><code><span><span>curl https://getmic.ro </span><span>|</span><span> bash</span></span></code></pre><p>Now we can update our bash profile to use it:</p><pre data-language="bash" data-index="5"><code><span><span>#</span><span> ~/.bashrc</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>export</span><span> EDITOR=</span><span>"</span><span>micro</span><span>"</span></span></code></pre><h3 id="micro-theme"><a href="#micro-theme">→</a>Micro Theme</h3><p>One issue you might notice once you start editing in micro is that it's theme clashes with your WT
theme. One option could be to port your WT theme to micro, but this is quite a bit of work. I found
using the built-in <code>simple</code> theme uses your terminal theme's background colour and seems to fit
quite well for me.</p><p>To do this, you'll have to configure micro for PowerShell and WSL separately. To configure it, open
micro, press <span><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd></span> to open the command prompt, then enter the command <code>set colorscheme simple</code>.</p><h2 id="terminal-prompt"><a href="#terminal-prompt">→</a>Terminal Prompt</h2><p>Finally, to make our terminal really pretty, we need to customize the prompt. There's lots of
options out there for this, but the most popular one seems to be
<a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh">ohmyzsh</a> for Bash and
<a href="https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh">oh-my-posh</a> for PowerShell. I'm not a huge fan of
these because in my experience they slow down the terminal to a point which makes me frustrated to
use them, and since they are separate solutions for each environment they must be configured separately.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://starship.rs/">Starship</a>, a "blazing-fast," cross-platform alternative with a
delightfully simple prompt and some awesome customization (with the promise of even more coming in
future releases). Since WSL and PowerShell both have access to the Windows filesystem, we can even
store the Starship configuration in a central place and have both pull from it.</p><h3 id="powershell-starship"><a href="#powershell-starship">→</a>PowerShell Starship</h3><p>To install Starship for PowerShell, we can again use scoop: <code>scoop install starship</code>. To load
starship, we again need to edit our profile (now with our snazzy editor and single-command alias):</p><pre data-language="ps1" data-index="6"><code><span><span>#</span><span> C:\Users\blake\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Invoke-Expression</span><span> (</span><span>&amp;</span><span>starship init powershell)</span></span></code></pre><p>Now we can run our <code>reload</code> alias and see the beautiful prompt immediately.</p><h3 id="bash-starship"><a href="#bash-starship">→</a>Bash Starship</h3><p>Installing Starship for …</p></div></div>

Tomorrow, I start building it.</p>— Sahil Lavingia (@shl) <a href="https://twitter.com/shl/status/54072049395712000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 2, 2011</a></blockquote> <p>I thought Gumroad would become a billion-dollar company, with hundreds of employees. It would IPO, and I would work on it until I died. Something like that.</p><p>Needless to say, that didn’t happen.</p><p>Now, it may look like I am in an enviable position, running a profitable, growing, low-maintenance software business serving adoring customers. But for years, I considered myself a failure. At my lowest point, I had to lay off 75 percent of my company, including many of my best friends. I had failed.</p><p>It took me years to realize I was misguided from the outset. I no longer feel shame in the path I took to get to where I am today — but for a long time, I did. This is my journey, from the beginning.</p><h2>A weekend project turned VC-backed startup</h2><p>The idea behind Gumroad was simple: Creators and others should be able to sell their products directly to their audiences with quick, simple links. No need for a storefront.</p><p>I built Gumroad the weekend I thought up the idea, and launched it early Monday morning on Hacker News. The reaction exceeded my grandest aspirations. Over 52,000 people checked it out on the first day.</p><p>Later that year, I left my job as the second employee at Pinterest — before I vested any of my stock — to turn Gumroad into what I thought would become my life’s work.</p><p>Almost immediately, I raised $1.1M from an all-star cast of angel investors and venture capital firms, including Max Levchin, Chris Sacca, Ron Conway, Naval Ravikant, Collaborative Fund, Accel Partners, and First Round Capital. A few months later, in May 2012, we raised $7M more. Mike Abbott from Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers (KPCB), a top-tier VC firm, led the round.</p><p>I was on top of the world. I was just 19, a solo founder, with over $8M in the bank and three employees. The world was starting to take note.</p><p>We grew the team. We stayed focused on our product. The monthly numbers started to climb. And then, at some point, they didn’t.</p><p>To keep the product alive, I laid off 75 percent of my company — including many of my best friends. It really sucked. But I told myself things would be fine: The product would continue to grow and no one far from the company would ever find out.</p><p>Then, TechCrunch got wind of the layoffs and published “Layoffs Hit Gumroad As The E-Commerce Startup Restructures.” All of a sudden, my failure was public. I spent the week ignoring my support network and answering our customers’ concerns, many of whom relied on us to power their businesses. They wanted to know if they should look for alternative products. Some of our favorite, most successful creators left. This hurt, but I don’t blame them for trying to minimize the risk in their own businesses.</p><p>So what exactly went wrong, and when?</p><h2>Failing in style</h2><p>Let’s start with the numbers. This is our monthly processed volume, until the layoffs:</p><p><img src="https://sahillavingia.com/0_z7tBf5i6wH-HbLhU.png"></p><p>It doesn’t look too bad, right? It’s going in the right direction: up.</p><p>But we were venture-funded, which was like playing a game of double-or-nothing. It’s euphoric when things are going your way — and suffocating when they’re not. And we weren’t doubling fast enough to raise the $15M+ Series B (the second major round of funding) we were looking for to grow the team.</p><p>For the type of business we were trying to build, every month of less than 20 percent growth should have been a red flag.</p><p>But at the time, I thought it was okay. We had money in the bank and product-market fit. We would continue to ship product and things would work out. The online creator movement was still nascent; the slow growth wasn’t our fault. It always looked like change was right around the corner.</p><p>But now, I realize: It doesn’t matter whose “fault” it is; we hit a peak in November 2014 and stalled. A lot of creators absolutely loved us, but there weren’t enough of them who needed our specific product offering. Product-market fit is great, but we needed to find a new, larger fit to justify raising more money (and then do it again and again, until acquisition or IPO).</p><p>In January 2015, after our final double-or-nothing hail-mary, our bank balance dipped below 18 months of runway. I told my 20-person team the road ahead would be a tough one. We didn’t have the numbers to raise a Series B, and we would have to work really hard over the next nine months to get even close. To that end, we deprioritized everything except features that would directly move the needle. Many were not core to our business, but we needed to try everything we could to get our monthly processed volume to where it needed to be.</p><p>If we succeeded, we would raise money from a top-tier VC again, hire more people, and pick up the journey where we’d left off. If we didn’t, we would have to drastically downsize the company.</p><p>In those nine months, when the whole team knew we were fighting for our company’s life, not a single person left Gumroad. From “this is gonna be hard,” to “yep, turns out it was,” every single person worked harder than ever.</p><p>We launched a “Small Product Lab” to teach new creators how to grow and sell. We shipped a ton of features, including weekly payouts, payouts to debit cards, payouts to the U.K., Australia, and Canada, various additions to our email features, product recommendations and search, analytics to see how customers are reading/watching/downloading the products they’ve purchased, and add-to-cart functionality. And that was just between August and November.</p><p>Unfortunately, we didn’t hit the numbers we needed.</p><h2>Slim down or shut down?</h2><p>Looking back, I’m glad we didn’t hit those numbers. If we’d doubled down, raised more money, and appeared in the headlines again, there would have been a very real possibility of even more spectacular failure.</p><p>With that off the table, our options were:</p><p>Shut down the business, return the remaining money to investors, and try something new.</p><p>Continue with a slimmed-down version of the company to aim for sustainability.</p><p>Position the company for an acquihire.</p><p>Some of my investors wanted me to shut down the business. They tried to convince me that my time was worth more than trying to keep a small business like Gumroad afloat, and I should try to build another billion-dollar company armed with all of my learnings — and their money.</p><p>I tended to agree with them, to be honest. But I was accountable to our creators, our employees, and our investors — in that order. We helped thousands of creators get paid, every month. About $2,500,000 was going to go into the pockets of creators — for rent checks and mortgages, for student loans and kids’ college funds. And it was only growing! Could I really just turn that faucet off?</p><p>If I sold the company, it would be mostly for our stellar team — and I would no longer be able to control the destiny of the product. There were too many acquisition stories of companies promising exciting journeys and amazing synergies to come — and ending with a deprecated product a year later.</p><p>Selling was certainly tempting. I could say I sold my first company, raise more money, and do this all again with a new idea. But that didn’t sit right with me. We were responsible to our creators first. That’s what I told every new hire and every investor. I didn’t want to become a serial entrepreneur and risk disappointing yet another customer base.</p><p>We decided to become profitable at any cost. The next year was not fun: I shrunk the company from twenty employees to five. We struggled to find a new tenant for our $25,000/month office. We focused all of our remaining resources on launching a premium service.</p><p>In June 2015, a few months before our layoffs, our financials looked like this:</p><ul><li>Revenue: $89,000 for the month</li><li>Gross profit: $17,000</li><li>Operating expenses: $364,000</li><li><strong>Net profit: -$351,000</strong></li></ul><p>A year later, in June 2016, our monthly numbers looked like this:</p><ul><li>Revenue: $176,000 for the month</li><li>Gross profit: $42,000</li><li>Operating expenses: $32,000</li><li><strong>Net profit: +$10,000</strong></li></ul><p>It hurt, but it meant creators would keep getting paid. It also meant that we were in control of our own destiny.</p><h2>From skeleton crew to lifestyle business</h2><p>It got worse from there.</p><p>Gumroad was no longer the venture-funded, fast-growing startup our investors and employees signed up for. As everyone else found other opportunities, the skeleton crew fizzled from five to one.</p><p>I was basically alone. I didn’t have a team, nor an office. And San Francisco was full of startups raising gobs of money, building amazing teams, and shipping great products. Some of my friends became billionaires. Meanwhile, I was running a “measly” lifestyle business. It wasn’t what I wanted to do, but I had to keep the ship from sinking.</p><p>Now, I understand some people would dream to be in that position. But at the time, I just felt trapped. I couldn’t stop, but there was only so much I could do as an army of one.</p><p>For years, my only metric of success was building a billion-dollar company. Now, I realize that was a terrible goal.</p><p>I shut off the rest of the world. I didn’t tell my mom about the layoffs — she had to read the article and tweets herself to find out. My friends were worried, but I assured them I was neither depressed nor suicidal. I left San Francisco for long stretches at a time, thinking that some travel would give me adequate distance. It only made me more lonely.</p><p>Every day, I woke up and took care of all of Gumroad’s support queries. I tried to fix all of the bugs I could. Often, I had to ask for help from former Gumroad engineers. They were all employed by then, but they always found time to help. Once all things Gumroad were taken care of, I tried to go to the gym, and if I had the willpower, work on a side project (a fantasy novel). Most days, I failed.</p><p>To me, happiness is about an expectation of positive change. Every year before 2016, there …</p></div></div>

<p>When most people hear Apple in a sentence, their next thought is likely the color. This is because color has always played an exciting role in Apple’s history: from the original Mac to the iMac, from the G3 to the Cube, from Bondi Blue to Snow White. The introduction of color played a vital part in these products' success as it helped create strong visual brand recognition.</p>
<p>The prominent use of color no doubt stems from Steve Jobs obsessing over the smallest details. For instance, there was a time when Steve spent 30 minutes picking the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-jobs-attention-to-detail-2011-10">perfect shade of gray for the restroom signs</a>! and another time <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-jobs-attention-to-detail-2011-10#he-insisted-on-making-the-circuit-board-inside-the-mac-look-great-2">when he insisted on making the circuit board inside the Mac look great</a>. An engineer told him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The only thing that matters is how well it works. Nobody is going to see the PC board.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jobs response was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I want it to be as beautiful as possible, even if it’s inside the box. A great carpenter isn’t going to use lousy wood for the back of a cabinet, even though nobody’s going to see it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For as long as we’ve had TVs, color has been an important metric to judge the display’s quality. We’ve witnessed technologies such as CRT, Plasma, and LCD compete to display the most life-like color. The newest technology to enter this fray is High Dynamic Range, aka HDR. The aim remains the same i.e. to recreate an image closer to that seen by the human eye. Traditionally, every video has been delivered in an 8-bit specification known as Rec. 709, displaying up to millions of shades of colors. HDR improves upon this by stepping up to 10 or 12-bit standard known as Rec. 2020 or BT.2020, representing 60 times more color combinations with smoother shade gradations aka “Billions of colors”.</p>
<p>Apple has generally been at the forefront of adopting the latest display technology. Some notable examples include - introducing high-resolution Retina Displays when 1366x768 was a very common resolution for Windows laptops, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-10-30-apple-imac-5k-el-capitan-billions-colors.html">Shipping 2015 Retina iMacs</a> with 10-bit displays i.e. “Billions of colors”, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/09/apple-tv-4k-brings-home-the-magic-of-cinema-with-4k-and-hdr/">Apple TV 4K, which was one of the first consumer devices to support Dolby Vision HDR in 2017</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/09/apple-tv-4k-brings-home-the-magic-of-cinema-with-4k-and-hdr/">automatic upgrades of HD titles to Dolby Vision</a> for iTunes users - a move that is still unrivaled, iPhone 12 which is the first smartphone to be able to <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/10/apple-introduces-iphone-12-pro-and-iphone-12-pro-max-with-5g/">record videos in the Dolby Vision HDR format</a>. Apple also sells <a href="https://www.apple.com/pro-display-xdr/">Pro Display XDR</a>, that costs upward of ~$5000 and ticks all the right boxes for any professional doing color-accurate work.</p>
<p>Therefore, with Apple’s color pedigree, it was surprising to see that on the M1 device specification page, there is <strong>no mention of whether M1 devices can output “Billions of colors”</strong>. In contrast, the Intel-based devices clearly outline this support.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: 1/25/21</strong> - Adding specs for Mac Mini as that’s what was tested. The MacBook spec comparison was for apples-to-apples similar device class purposes.</p>

<p>Even the trusty method of viewing the value in <code>"About this mac" -&gt; "System Report" -&gt; "Graphics/Displays"</code> doesn’t show anything. Usually, this would list a value of 30-bit here (<em>i.e. 10-bit per RGB channel</em>). On M1 devices, the below is what you see when connected to an HDR capable display i.e. no mention of whether the M1 Mini is outputting a 10-bit video signal.</p>

<p><strong>So I set about testing 10-bit output support myself.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>TV</strong> - 2017 Vizio M65-E0 (<a href="https://www.displayspecifications.com/en/model/dd6cb89">Display Specifications</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Monitor</strong> - Philips Brilliance P272P7VU 4K UHD 27" (<a href="https://www.displayspecifications.com/en/model/8e9287b">Display Specifications</a>)</li>
<li><strong>2020 Mac Mini M1</strong> connected through a HDMI cable</li>
</ul>

<p>For this test, I used my trusty 2017 Vizio M65-E0 TV that has a 10-bit panel. I connected the Mac Mini to my Denon AVR-X1300 receiver. The “Displays” settings on Mac OS immediately gave me an option of enabling HDR.</p>

<p>At this point, it’s clear that the Mac Mini can output an HDR10 signal when connected to an HDR capable display. Next, I explored if it can output a 10-bit signal / Billions of colors to a non-HDR 10-bit display. This was done by connecting to the Philips Brilliance P272P7VU monitor.</p>
<h3 id="10-bit-psd-test">10-bit PSD test</h3>
<p>The first test was done by displaying a 10-bit PSD file in “Preview”, which supports 10-bit files. <strong>If the M1 outputs a 10-bit signal, then the gradients in the file would be smooth.</strong> Opening the file in “Preview” confirmed the 10-bit output as the test pattern was completely smooth. I also opened the same file in another image viewer called “Pixea” and observed banding which most likely is because “Pixea” doesn’t support 10-bit files. In the image below, the same file is open in “Preview” on the left and “Pixea” on the right.</p>
<p>NOTE: <em>You might not observe the difference between the two images below as during the upload and publishing this image might get converted to 8-bit. On my machine the left image is completely smooth while the right displays banding.</em></p>

January 29, 2021 | https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2020/10/03/go-create-silly-small-programs/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2020/10/03/go-create-silly-small-programs/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the summer, I developed a couple of small, sort of silly programs.
One, <a href="https://jakemccrary.com/experiments/photo-fit/">Photo Fit</a>, is a little tool that runs in a web browser and resizes photos to fit as your phone’s background.
The other, <a href="https://default-equipment.herokuapp.com/">Default Equipment</a>, runs on Heroku and automates changing the “bike” of my Strava-tracked e-bike rides to be my <a href="https://onewheel.com/">onewheel</a>.</p>

<p>These weren’t created to solve large problems in the world.
There is no plan to make any money with them.
As of October 2020, Default Equipment doesn’t even work for other people (though it could, send me a message if you’d like to use it and I’ll get around to it).</p>

<p>Each was created to fix a minor annoyance in my life and, because these tools can live on the Internet, they can fix the same minor annoyance in other lives.</p>

<p>With an increasing amount of software in the world, being able to write software is nearly sorcery<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.
As a developer, you can identify a problem in the world and then change the world to remove that problem.
And, depending on the problem, you can remove it for everyone else.</p>

<p>Software developers aren’t alone in being able to identify problems and remove them through creation.
Carpenters can build shelves for their books.
Cooks can prepare food to remove hunger.
You can come up with nearly an infinite number of other examples.</p>

<p>The difference is that a solo developer can solve problems for an unknown number of other folks.
This is enabled by the Internet enabled ease of distribution.
This is very powerful.</p>

<p>Developers can expose their solution to others through a web application.
Desktop or mobile applications can be distributed through various app stores or made available as a download.
Source code can be made available for others to run.
Being able to distribute easily and cheaply is a game changer.</p>

<p>A developer’s change to the world might be a minor improvement.
Photo Fit might never be used by anyone besides me.
But it is still out there, making the world slightly better.
It is available for someone to stumble upon when they are also annoyed by the same problem.</p>

<p>It felt good to write these tiny, useful programs.
If you scope them small enough, there is a definitive ending point<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.
This lets you feel that finishing-a-project satisfaction quickly.
The small size also allows you experiment with new techniques and tools without committing to a large and ongoing commitment.</p>

<p>I wrote both Photo Fit and Default Equipment in TypeScript.
Before the beginning of summer, I didn’t know TypeScript and had little exposure to Node.js.
Now I have some experience with both and gained that while making small improvements to my life and potentially the lives of others.</p>

<p>If you haven’t developed software to solve a small problem recently, I’d recommend doing it.
Don’t hesitate to remove a problem that feels silly.
Removing those problems can still make your life slightly better and gives you an opportunity to learn.
It feels good to remove an annoyance from your life.
If you can, make that software available to others so their lives are improved as well.
Take advantage of the power of easy distribution to improve the world and not just your tiny slice of it.</p>

<p>In late November, von der Leyen gushed about the contracts the European Union had signed with various producers, saying it meant that Europeans would have "access to the most promising future vaccines under development" against the coronavirus. When it became clear in December that the first people in the EU would be vaccinated soon after Christmas, she even injected a bit of pathos, tweeting "It's Europe's moment." When the vaccinations then began, she wrote of a "touching moment of unity" and a "European success story."</p><p>These days, though, von der Leyen is noticeably quieter – a silence that could have to do with the fact that the erstwhile "success story" might ultimately turn out to be the greatest disaster of her entire political career.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Europe is facing a vaccine disaster. Whereas countries like Israel, Britain and the United States. are quickly moving ahead with vaccinations, the EU is reeling from a string of setbacks. First, U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech informed Brussels that it would be delivering far less vaccine than planned in the coming weeks. Then, the company AstraZeneca said it would only be delivering 31 million doses of its vaccine by the end of March instead of the 80 million Europe had been expecting. And again, the Commission was caught completely off guard.</p><p>Since then, frustration and anger has been growing across the EU. Europe, one of the most affluent regions in the world, is proving to be unable to quickly protect its citizens from a deadly disease, while other countries are showing how it is done.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>And the boss is nowhere to be found.</p><p>The louder the criticism has grown, the less has been heard from the erstwhile loquacious Commission president. She has, at times, been like the phantom of Brussels. Requests for comment from the press have been systematically blocked by her communications department and she has essentially gone into hiding. This week, though, at the World Economic Forum, she wasn't able to entirely avoid the issue. "Now, the companies must deliver," she said. In other words, the companies are to blame, not us. Not me.</p><p>It is, to put it bluntly, a pattern that has occurred frequently throughout her career.</p>

<p>Whenever von der Leyen, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDIU), has taken on a new leadership position, she has never just been the new minister. She has always acted as though she would do everything different – better – than her predecessor. It has frequently sounded as though von der Leyen planned to reinvent whatever department or ministry she had just assumed control of, making it more functional and more glamorous at the same time. But by the time it became necessary to dive into the sordid details, she had usually moved on.</p><h3>Posing as the Mother of the Nation</h3><p>When von der Leyen was appointed family minister in 2005, she introduced a generous federally funded program for parental leave and expanded daycare offerings, essentially revolutionizing her party's family-policy image in the process. But when it came to addressing the difficulties associated with opening a huge number of new daycare facilities – that was left to her successor.</p><p>When she became minister of labor and social affairs in 2009, she promised a hot lunch for every child. The result, though, was a confusing collection of regulations. "Ursula von der Leyen was excellent at posing as the mother of the nation and launching illusory programs for the poor," says Ulrich Schneider, head of the federation of German welfare associations.</p>

<p>And at the Defense Ministry? The bureau is still trying to clean up the messes that its former boss left behind.</p><p>In each instance, von der Leyen's departure was perfectly timed. Just as the time had come for evaluations, she had already climbed up to the next rung on her career ladder.</p><p>Which is why she is now faced with a real problem. First of all, there isn't really anywhere left to go from her current post in Europe's top position. And second, the pandemic has hit the fast-forward button on political developments, with the consequences of political decisions taking mere weeks to manifest themselves instead of several years. "I am absolutely stunned by how negligent Ursula von der Leyen has been in overseeing the start of vaccinations in recent months," says Lars Klingbeil, general secretary of Germany's Social Democrats (SPD).</p><p>Indeed, von der Leyen finds herself in an extremely difficult situation. The next several weeks could decide her political future.</p><p>On Tuesday of this week, she delivered a video address to the World Economic Forum, where she spoke about Donald Trump, the storming of the Capitol and the question as to whether democracy has been damaged in the last four years. She spoke about climate change, biodiversity, artificial intelligence and digitalization.</p><p>In the first several minutes of her talk, she only briefly mentioned the coronavirus pandemic, and it was fully 15 minutes before she even said the word "vaccine." Only to say things like: "We know that in a pandemic there is no time to lose."</p><h3>Bazaar Bargaining</h3><p>Initially, of course, things looked quite good on the vaccine front. Back in summer, nobody was willing to predict that the first vaccine would be approved in the EU as early as December and that vaccinations would begin. Nor that a second vaccine would quickly follow in January. Von der Leyen was also able to claim a significant success when the EU agreed on a joint vaccination strategy in June, despite the fact that the bloc's 27 member states had always defended sovereignty when it came to health care policy. For the Commission president, it represented a gain of both prestige and power. Fleetingly, at least.</p><p>The problems began soon thereafter. Negotiations with vaccine producers bogged down, and it wasn't until November that the EU was able to reach a purchase agreement with BioNTech/Pfizer and with Moderna, the manufacturers of the two most successful vaccines thus far introduced. The EU negotiating team, according to people familiar with the talks, was intent on pushing down the price. There was also allegedly an extended disagreement on liability issues, particularly with Pfizer.</p><p>While others simply acted with expedience and placed huge orders, the EU – right in the middle of the worst pandemic in a century – decided to bargain like they were at the bazaar. Von der Leyen, of course, didn't lead these negotiations personally. But she is the boss, and carries the political responsibility.</p><p>After a year of the pandemic, hundreds of millions of Europeans are tired, frustrated and desperate for an appointment to finally get vaccinated. No other issue is as important at the moment – for the economy, for society and for politics. And the time will come to assign blame for the missteps that have been made. The search for where to place that blame won't start down below among the army of EU bureaucrats. It will start at the top.</p>
</div>
<section>

</section>
<div>
<p>Given that truth, von der Leyen's press department has been energetic in its defense of the Commissions actions. After all, the EU has secured rights to 2.3 billion doses of vaccine, they have pointed out, with 760 million of them from BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna.</p><p>But what use is that when the availability of the vaccine will remain so limited for the foreseeable future? When the producers are unable to deliver what they have agreed to – or can only deliver much later?</p><p>And what, actually, is in those contracts, which have thus far remained confidential? Are the deliveries promised by the producers legally binding? Or did the Commission agree to flimsy fine print such that it has no leverage against the producers?</p><p>Thus far, only the contract with the German company Curevac has been made public. It says that the producer will make "reasonable best efforts" to deliver the agreed upon number of doses within the negotiated time frame. Pascal Soriot, the head of AstraZeneca, is now claiming the same thing. The Curevac contract also says that the producer must inform purchasers as quickly as possible of possible delays, explain the causes for those delays and present a revised timeline for delivery. That, though, is all.</p><p>Should the AstraZeneca contract contain the same language, it would be politically explosive. Tiemo Wölken, a member of European Parliament with Germany's Social Democrats, believes the contract is similar in that regard. "The wording of the delivery requirement for Curevac is supposedly similar," he says. "As such, what Soriot is saying doesn't sound implausible."</p><p>That would be a huge embarrassment for von der Leyen, but it would come as welcome news for a man who isn't yet out of the firing line himself: German Health Minister Jens Spahn. At home, Spahn has been the subject of scathing critique for the flubbed beginning of the vaccination campaign. Spahn, who just recently warned the country that "10 difficult weeks" were still to come, is now able to deflect some of the criticism to Brussels – onto the shoulders of fellow CDU member Ursula von der Leyen.</p><h3>Moving Too Slowly</h3><p>There is a history to their vaccine-related relationship. In mid-June, Spahn pushed ahead with his counterparts from France, the Netherlands and Italy, reaching an initial agreement with AstraZeneca. They planned to share the order with all EU member states. But that's not how things worked out.</p><p>Several countries intervened, the Chancellery in Berlin got involved and, in late June, Spahn and the others handed over responsibility for the negotiations to the European Commission. Thereafter, say people involved in the process, the …</p></div></div></div>

		<p>Another day, another post telling me to do something, or not do something, or adopt some technology, or not adopt some technology, or whatever it is that they want me to do, because it makes it easier to “reason about the code”.</p>
<p>It’s a scam.</p>
<p>More precisely, it’s a thought-terminating cliche. Ironic, as the phrase “reason about” is used as a highfalutin synonym for “think about”. The idea is that there’s nowhere to go from here. I want to do things one way, some random on medium dot com wants me to do things another way, their way makes it easier to reason about the code, therefore that’s the better approach.</p>
<p>It’s a scam.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the fact that people don’t think—sorry, reason—about things the same way. If we did, then there’d be little point to things like film review sites, code style guides, or democracy. We don’t know precisely <em>what</em> influences different people to think in different ways about different things, but we have some ideas. Some of the ideas just raise other questions: like if you say “it’s a cultural difference” then we have to ask “well, why is it normal for all of the people in that culture to think this way, and all of the people in this culture to think that way?”</p>
<p>This difference between modes of thought arises in computing. We know, for example, that you can basically use any programming language for basically any purpose, because back in the days when there were intellectual giants in computering they demonstrated that all of these languages are interchangeable. They did so before we’d designed the languages. So choice of programming language is arbitrary, unless motivated by external circumstances like which vendor your CTO plays squash with or whether you are by nature populist or contrarian.</p>
<p>Such differences arise elsewhere than in choice of language. Comprehension of paradigms, for example: the Smalltalk folks noticed it was easier to teach object-oriented programming to children than to professional programmers, because the professional programmers already had mental toolkits for comprehending programming that didn’t integrate with the object model. It’s easier for them to “reason about” imperative code than objects.</p>
<p>OK, so when someone says that something makes it easier to “reason about” the code, what they mean is that <em>that person</em> find it easier to think about code in the presence of this property. I mean, assuming they <em>do</em>, and are not disingenuously proposing a suggestion that you do something when they’ve run out of reasons you should do it but still think it’d be a good idea.  But wait.</p>
<p>It’s a scam.</p>
<p>Code is a particular representation of, at best, <em>yesterday’s</em> understanding of the problem you’re trying to solve. “Reasoning about code” is by necessity accidental complexity: it’s reflecting on and trying to understand a historical solution of the problem as you once thought it was. That’s effort that could better be focussed on checking whether your understanding of the problem is indeed correct, or needs updating. Or on capturing a solution to an up-to-the-minute model of the problem in executable form.</p>
<p>This points to a need for code to be <em>deletable</em> way faster than it needs to be thought about.</p>
<p>Reasoning about code is a scam.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of FPGA development boards out there, and I don’t dare to count but I must own a
considerable fraction of them. Most of these are designed deliberately for development purposes, 
but a few are not, and yet they can sometimes be a good match.</p>

<p>One board that falls in this category is the 
<a href="https://www.colorlight-led.com/product/colorlight-i5-led-display-receiver-card.html">Colorlight i5</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/colorlight_i5/colorlight_i5.jpg" alt="Colorlight i5"></p>

<p>Like other members of the Colorlight family (the <a href="https://github.com/q3k/chubby75">Colorlight 5A-75B</a> 
comes to mind), the i5 is ‘real’ product that is designed for one specific purpose: it is a 
controller for large LED video panels. And that’s a huge plus, because in FPGA land, high volume means 
low cost, usually much lower than buying individual components on Digikey or Mouser.</p>

<p>The Colorlight i5 is especially attractive because it’s a plug-in card, with a reappropriated DDR SODIMM 
connector. Even better is that nothing about this module seems to be tailored specifically for LED panels. 
Unlike the 5A-75B, there are no unidirectional 3V3 to 5V level shifters: FPGA GPIO pins are routed straight to the 
SODIMM connector and can be used any way you want: input or output, LVCMOS or LVDS or any configuration
that’s supported by the FPGA.</p>

<p>The Colorlight i5 uses a Lattice ECP5U-25, an FPGA that’s supported by the Yosys/NextPNR open source
tool flow, an extra bonus.</p>

<p>That said, there’s still a hurdle to using this board as development platform: you need a way to power it,
there are no easy usable GPIO connectors (such as PMOD connectors), and while are easily accessible
test JTAG points to program the FPGA, you still need an external JTAG programmer and solder a bunch
of wires to make things work.</p>

<p>Or…</p>

<p>you could go to the <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001686186007.html">AliExpress webstore</a> of
<a href="https://www.muselab-tech.com/">Muse Lab</a> and buy their Colorlight i5 development board.</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/colorlight_i5/development_board.jpg" alt="Colorlight i5 Development Board"></p>

<p>I bought their Colorlight i5 module + development board combo for $50 and gave it a try.</p>



<p><em>Skip to <a href="#from-unboxing-to-blinky">From Unboxing to Blinky</a> if you want to get your hands dirty ASAP.</em></p>

<p>Let’s first go over characterstics of the module itself:</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/colorlight_i5/i5-top-annotated.jpg" alt="Colorlight i5 Top Annotated"></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Low Cost: $30 and up</p>

    <p>I’ve seen these modules for $18.50, but with a $25 shipping fee, which makes it only attractive if you’re
  buying at least 3. For $35, you can get them with free shipping on AliExpress. That’s
  still a fantastic deal for what you get.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lattice ECP5 LFE5U-25F FPGA</p>

    <p>Specifications:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>24K LUTs</li>
      <li>56x sysMEM block RAMs (of 18Kb each), good for up to 126KByte of on-chip RAM</li>
      <li>194Kb of distributed RAM</li>
      <li>28x DSPs with 18x18 multiplier and 36-bit accumulator</li>
      <li>2 PLLs, 2 DLLs</li>
      <li>0 SERDES</li>
      <li>381 caBGA package</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The -25 version is one of the smaller versions in the ECP5 family, but it’s still enough
  for many applications. You can comfortably fit a VexRiscv-based Linux SOC in there.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>EtronTech EM638325-6H 2M x 32bit SDRAM, 166MHz</p>

    <p>Single data rate SDRAM is ancient and slow now, but sufficient for most hobby projects. It’s also 
  easier to use because there’s usually no trickery required with complex PLL/DLL configurations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2x Broadcom B50612D 1Gb Ethernet Transceivers</p>

    <p>That’s right, not one but two. You could make your own firewall with this thing.</p>

    <p>The PHYs are using an RGMII MAC interface.</p>

    <p>The module only contains the transceivers, not the Ethernet transformers or 
  RJ45 connectors. The 2x 4 differentials pairs are routed to the SODIMM pins.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>GD25B16C 16Mbit Quad SPI Serial Flash</p>

    <p>According to the <a href="http://www.latticesemi.com/~/media/LatticeSemi/Documents/ApplicationNotes/EH/TN1260.pdf">Lattice ECP5 sysCONFIG Usage Guide</a>,
  the FPGA has a maximum uncompressed bitstream size of 5.42Mb. That leaves more than 11Mb or ~1.4MByte for
  user applications.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>25MHz Oscillator</p>

    <p>The Ethernet transceivers require a 25MHz oscillator. It also goes to the FPGA as its only external clock
  input.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2 LEDs</p>

    <p>A red LED seems to be connected to power and is always on, but the green LED is controlled
  by the FPGA: a strict requirement to get that blinky going!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>JTAG Interface</p>

    <p>4 JTAG test points are not marked as such but they are easy to solder and accessible.</p>

    <p>3x Mystery CD4051B 8 Channel Analog Multiplexer/Demultiplexer</p>

    <p>These are only present on V7.0 of the board, not on V6.0. Its functionality hasn’t been
  reverse engineered yet, but some of the demultiplexed ports are going to the SODIMM pins.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>DDR-SODIMM Connector</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>3V3 to 6V power rail</p>

        <p>There are voltage regulators on the module, but there are no pins back to
  the connector with regulated voltage.</p>

      <li>2x 4 differential Ethernet pairs</li>
      <li>106x general purpose GPIO pins</li>
      <li>
        <p>2 mystery <code>RCV_BK1</code>/<code>RCV_BK2</code> pins</p>

        <p>These have something to do with receiver backup power. Unknown how they are connected
  on the module.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>21 mystery pins</p>

        <p>Related to the 8 channel analog multiplexers.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A heat sink</p>

    <p>Not exactly a heavy duty one, but a piece of metal that squeezes against the FPGA and
  the two Ethernet transceivers. Much better than nothing!</p>

    <p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/colorlight_i5/heatsink_removed.jpg" alt="Board and Heatsink"></p>

    <p>The heat sink is pretty easy to remove without damaging the board.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There’s a lot to work with here. What’s even better is the potential for future
upgrades: Colorlight has i6, i9, and i9+ modules with the same SODIMM pinout as the i5, but
with larger FPGAs: the i9 board has a Lattice ECP5-45. The i9+ a Xilinx Artix A50T.</p>

<p>For the i5 board, V6.0 and V7.0 are pinout compatible too, with the exception of the mystery pins.</p>



<p>As I wrote earlier, the development board can be <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001686186007.html">bought on AliExpress</a>, 
but only as a package deal: $50 for the development board and the i5 module, with free shipping.</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/colorlight_i5/development_board-annotated.jpg" alt="Development Board Annotated"></p>

<p>It has the following features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>DDR-SODIMM socket for the i5 module</li>
  <li>
    <p>1x 30-pin connector for Ethernet (purple)</p>

    <p>This connector has the 2x 4 differential Ethernet pairs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>4x 30-pin connectors for generic GPIOs (yellow)</p>

    <p>Each connector has 20 GPIOs, ground, 3V3, and 5V pins. The
  pins are smartly organized so that the connector is also compatible
  with 2 side-by-side PMOD connectors.</p>

    <p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/colorlight_i5/board_with_double_PMOD.jpg" alt="Board with double PMOD"></p>

    <p>In this case, the center pins can’t be used and the number of usable GPIOs 
  per 30-pin connector drops to 16, 8 for each PMOD.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1x 30-pin mixed-use connector for generic GPIOs + special functions (orange)</p>

    <p>Just like the 4 earlier connectors, there are 20 GPIOs on this connector,
  in the same configuration, but 6 of the GPIOs have been assigned
  a special meaning: UART and SPI.</p>

    <p>The UART and SPI pins are also routed to the microcontroller to be used as
  a potential FPGA debug console, and, presumably to progam the SPI
  flash on the board.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>HDMI connector - video out only</p>

    <p>This one is a surprise, since the FPGA on the module does not support
  high speed SERDES IOs. Instead, the pins are connected to generic
  IOs that can be configured as differential pairs inside the FPGA.</p>

    <p>I doubt that these IOs meet the strict electrical requirements that are
  set by the HDMI standard specification, but meeting these requirements is 
  not necessary to drive an image that can be decoded by most monitors.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, the I2C, HOTPLUG and CEC pins of the HDMI connector
  are not connected. The lack of HOTPLUG makes it impossible to use
  the HDMI connector for video input.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>USB C Port</p>

    <p>A USB C port is used to power the board, to program the FPGA, and to
  send FPGA UART console traffic from and to a host PC.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller (MCU)</p>

    <p>This STM32 MCU is identical to the one used on the dirt cheap and popular 
  <a href="https://stm32-base.org/boards/STM32F103C8T6-Blue-Pill.html">Blue Pill development boards</a>.</p>

    <p>The MCU on this development board is used as programming and debug
  interface only. On one side, it has a USB 1.1 interface to connect to a host
  PC. On the other, it controls JTAG, UART, and SPI pins to the Colorlight
  module. It also controls 2 LEDs.</p>

    <p>The user is not supposed to reflash the MCU with custom firmware, but if
  you’re so inclined, the SWD pins to do so are located underneath the
  USB connector (on the other side of the PCB.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>USB 5V -&gt; 3.3V voltage regulator</p>

    <p>An AMS1117-3.3V that’s used to convert the USB 5V to 3V3 to power the MCU and the
  3v3 pins of the PMOD ports, but NOT the Colorlight module (which is powered by USB 5V rail 
  and has its own voltage regulators.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2 LEDs</p>

    <p>Not to be confused with the 2 bright LEDs on the module itself, two tiny and faint LEDs 
  are controlled by the MCU. The red LED flickers when there’s USB traffic. A blue
  LED seems to be always on and is hidden entirely underneath the module.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Power Button</p>

    <p>When pressed, this button interrupts power to Colorlight module, but not to the MCU. If you
  want to power off the MCU, you must unplug the USB cable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>JTAG Pogo Pins</p>

    <p>While the i5 module has easy accessible JTAG test points, they are not connected to the SODIMM
  connector. The development board makes the connection with the test points with 4 pogo pins.
  It’s an elegant solution that removes the need for any soldering.</p>
  </li>
</ul>



<p>The package arrived with the i5 module (V7.0), the development board, a USB C cable, and 6 30-pin
connectors that you need to solder yourself.</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/colorlight_i5/box_contents.jpg" alt="Box Contents"></p>

<p>I’m not well qualified to judge the quality of the PCB, but it looks well made to me.</p>

<p>After inserting the 30-pin connectors into the PCB (it’s a bit of a hassle that requires
wiggling slightly bent pins in the right hole), I noticed a minor issue: my HDMI cable doesn’t fit between the 2 30-pin connectors
that surround the HDMI connector. As a result, the cable can’t be plugged in completely:</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/colorlight_i5/hdmi_doesnt_fit.jpg" alt="HDMI doesn't fit"></p>

<p>You need a HDMI cable with a narrow connector to make things work, or don’t solder connectors
P2 and P3, which is what I did.</p>

<p>The box doesn’t contain any documentation, not even a leaflet with a URL. You have …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	  <p>Like many people, I’ve been entertaining myself at home by baking a ton and talking about my sourdough starter as if it were a real person. I’m pretty good at following recipes, but I decided I wanted to take things one step further and understand the science behind what differentiates a cake from a bread or a cookie. I also like machine learning so I thought: what if I could combine it with baking??!</p>

<p>I’ll start by explaining why baking presents an interesting ML problem. Then I’ll show you how I collected my own dataset, trained a simple model, deployed it, built a little app to get predictions, and used the model to invent a new recipe. If you’re only here for the recipe, I suppose you can <a href="#recipe">skip ahead</a>.</p>

<p>Are videos more your thing? Here’s me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4saaQZSmBw">speaking about</a> how I built this.</p>

<h2 id="why-would-you-use-machine-learning-for-baking">Why would you use machine learning for baking?</h2>

<p>Maybe you’re thinking, couldn’t you just read a book or even a <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-free-yourself-from-recipes-with-a-few-golden-coo-1450617561" target="_blank">blog post</a> that explains the sugar, fat, and flour ratios that make up different baked goods? Sure, I could do that. But my attention span has been pretty short these days, and that approach doesn’t really scale. If I learn enough to start inventing my own recipes, that only directly benefits the people who can eat them, which is currently not many.</p>

<p>Now maybe you’re thinking, couldn’t we solve this with traditional programming? For example, if the typical flour:liquid ratio for bread is 5:3, I could write a program like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>ratio</span> <span>=</span> <span>flour_amt</span> <span>/</span> <span>water_amt</span>

<span>if</span> <span>ratio</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>1.5</span> <span>and</span> <span>ratio</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>2</span><span>:</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"It's bread!"</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>That <em>kind of</em> works, but it’ll quickly get unwieldy. What if the flour:water ratio is close, but not exactly 5:3? What if I want to predict more than just bread? And what if I don’t feel like converting ingredient amounts into ratios? I am lazy (in certain ways) and I want to input my ingredient amounts without doing any math, and then have something magically tell me what it thinks it is.</p>

<p>Enter 🌟 machine learning 🌟</p>

<p>This is a great fit for ML because I can gather recipe data and train a model to identify patterns in that data. Since a lot of people have written about baking ratios, I’m going to assume there are some high-level patterns about them that I can teach a model to learn.</p>

<p>Hopefully by now I’ve convinced you that this will be a fun problem to solve with machine learning. But maybe you’re <em>still</em> skeptical, and you’re wondering: what’s the point of this? Don’t you already know what you’re baking when you follow a recipe? It seems silly to have a model tell you what you already know. All of that is true if I simply input an existing recipe into my model and ask it for a prediction. Remember, though, that the whole reason I’m doing this is to learn things like what makes a cake a cake, and not a cookie. Then I can experiment with different ratios to create a new recipe. Maybe I want to invent something that my model thinks is 50% cake, 50% cookie.</p>

<h2 id="creating-the-dataset">Creating the dataset</h2>

<p>I couldn’t find an existing dataset of basic baking ingredients, so I decided to create my own very small one. Luckily there is no shortage of recipes on the internet, and I found 33 recipes each of breads, cakes, and cookies to make a dataset with 99 total recipes. To keep this problem relatively simple, I looked only at the following ingredients:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flour: If a recipe called for different types of flour, I counted it it all towards the flour amount</li>
  <li>Sugar: I also combined different sugars (granulated, brown, etc.) as one amount</li>
  <li>Sourdough starter: If you know, you know</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
  <li>Yeast</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
  <li>Water</li>
  <li>Oil</li>
  <li>Eggs</li>
  <li>Baking powder</li>
  <li>Baking soda</li>
  <li>Butter</li>
</ul>

<p>I tracked it all in a spreadsheet that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://sararobinson.dev/assets/media/spreadsheet.png" alt="Baking spreadsheet dataset"></p>

<p>I know, I’m using cups and teaspoons and not something more universal like grams. If my little model becomes a smash hit, I will try to add metric system support.</p>

<p>While collecting the data, I did my best to include various types of breads, cakes, and cookies so that the model could handle a diverse repertoire of baked goods.</p>

<h2 id="processing-data">Processing data</h2>

<p>I went into this thinking I could feed my ingredient inputs directly into my machine model, since ML model inputs need to be numeric. Not quite. There are a few problems with the data in its current form.</p>

<p>First, my spreadsheet has a mix of units: I’m using cups for some ingredients, teaspoons for others, and eggs are just eggs. I don’t want my model to think that 1 unit of flour is the same as 1 unit of yeast (can you imagine what would happen there?). Since the majority of my data is in cups, I decided to convert everything else to cups. For teaspoons, this was fairly straightforward since 1 teaspoon is around .02 cups. For eggs, after some research I settled on 1 egg being approximately .2 cups. It’s not perfect, but now everything is in the same units.</p>

<p>Next I needed a way to scale the data. Some recipes make 2 giant cakes, while others make a small loaf of bread. Converting all ingredient amounts to the same scale will ensure my model doesn’t give more weight to bigger recipes. I decided to scale amounts by converting each ingredient to a percentage of the total recipe. To do this I took the sum of each row, and then divided each ingredient by the sum to get its percentage. The bread recipe in the screenshot above becomes:</p>

<p><img src="https://sararobinson.dev/assets/media/scaled_inputs.png" alt="Scaled recipe inputs"></p>

<p>With my 99 recipes all converted to the same unit and scaled to percentages, it’s time to build and train a model.</p>

<h2 id="building-a-tensorflow-model">Building a TensorFlow model</h2>

<p>I’m going to use TensorFlow’s <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras" target="_blank">Keras API</a> for this model, which makes the model code pretty short:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>model</span> <span>=</span> <span>tf</span><span>.</span><span>keras</span><span>.</span><span>Sequential</span><span>([</span>
  <span>tf</span><span>.</span><span>keras</span><span>.</span><span>layers</span><span>.</span><span>Dense</span><span>(</span><span>16</span><span>,</span> <span>input_shape</span><span>=</span><span>(</span><span>num_ingredients</span><span>,)),</span>
  <span>tf</span><span>.</span><span>keras</span><span>.</span><span>layers</span><span>.</span><span>Dense</span><span>(</span><span>16</span><span>,</span> <span>activation</span><span>=</span><span>'relu'</span><span>),</span>
  <span>tf</span><span>.</span><span>keras</span><span>.</span><span>layers</span><span>.</span><span>Dense</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>activation</span><span>=</span><span>'softmax'</span><span>)</span>                
<span>])</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>My model output is a softmax array, which means it’ll output the probability a particular recipe is a bread, cake, or cookie (in that order). Softmax means that all the probabilities will add to 1. So a 97% confident bread prediction would look like the following:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>[</span><span>.97</span><span>,</span> <span>.02</span><span>,</span> <span>.01</span><span>]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>After training, my model has reached 90% accuracy. Pretty cool! But can I trust it, or is it overfitting the training data?</p>

<p>🚨This is definitely not an ML best practice, but I will be testing my model on real-world, production data. Mostly because I got tired of copying enough recipes into my spreadsheet to make a test set. Do not try this at home 🚨</p>

<p>To test the model, I made up the following recipe:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flour: 1 c</li>
  <li>Sugar: 1 c</li>
  <li>Salt: ½ tsp</li>
  <li>Eggs: 1</li>
  <li>Butter: 1 c</li>
</ul>

<p>The model predicts cookies with 84% confidence. Sounds reasonable. What about an edge case, like a bread without yeast or sourdough starter? Let’s try:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flour: 4 c</li>
  <li>Salt: ½ tsp</li>
  <li>Water: 1.2 c</li>
  <li>Oil: 3 tsp</li>
  <li>Baking powder: 2 tsp</li>
</ul>

<p>My model says bread with 99% confidence, nice! If I instead wrote a series of if statements to handle that edge case, you can see how it would quickly get very long.</p>

<h2 id="deploying-the-model-to-ai-platform">Deploying the model to AI Platform</h2>

<p>I don’t want to be the only one who gets to use this model, so it’s time to deploy it. I’m going to deploy it to Google Cloud <a href="https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/prediction/docs" target="_blank">AI Platform Prediction</a>. In order to do that, I need to use the TensorFlow <code>model.save()</code> method to save my model assets to a Cloud Storage Bucket. Then I can use gcloud to deploy my model from the command line, pointing it at the bucket path of my saved model.</p>

<p>When you save your TensorFlow model, you can pass it a local filepath or a Cloud Storage bucket. Here I’ll pass it my GCS bucket directly:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>model</span><span>.</span><span>save</span><span>(</span><span>'gs://my_gcs_bucket/path'</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>With that, I’m ready to deploy using gcloud (you can also deploy via the UI or the API):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>!</span><span>gcloud</span> <span>ai</span><span>-</span><span>platform</span> <span>versions</span> <span>create</span> <span>'v1'</span> \
<span>--</span><span>model</span> <span>'baking'</span> \
<span>--</span><span>origin</span> <span>'gs://path/to/saved/model'</span> \
<span>--</span><span>runtime</span><span>-</span><span>version</span> <span>2.1</span> \
<span>--</span><span>framework</span> <span>TENSORFLOW</span> \
<span>--</span><span>python</span><span>-</span><span>version</span> <span>3.7</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>When your model has deployed, you’ll see it in your cloud console like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://sararobinson.dev/assets/media/caip-prediction.png" alt="Cloud AI Prediction UI"></p>

<h2 id="building-a-web-app">Building a web app</h2>

<p>🙏 <em>Shout out to my teammate <a href="https://twitter.com/_davideast" target="_blank">David</a> for his help on the web app</em> 🙏</p>

<p>It would be fun if I had a basic web app to get predictions on my model. That way I could quickly experiment with different ingredient ratios. Remember that my model needs the ingredient inputs all converted to cups and then scaled as percentages of the total recipe. It would be mean if I made people do those calculations on their own, so this should probably be handled server side – a great use for <a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions" target="_blank">Cloud Functions</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://sararobinson.dev/assets/media/arch-diagram.png" alt="Architecture diagram"></p>

<p>I’ll use the Python runtime and write a function that takes the ingredient inputs in their user-friendly units and converts them to cups and then to percentages. From the same function I can send that scaled input to my model and return a nice, readable prediction to the web app. A snippet of the function is below, and you can find it all in <a href="https://gist.github.com/sararob/1fb9fb132a93bdda95f7a71d2afd38ad" target="_blank">this gist</a>.</p>

<p>And here’s the app! I will preface this by saying that I’m lucky to work with amazingly talented people. I <a href="https://twitter.com/SRobTweets/status/1255213096718786568" target="_blank">tweeted</a> an early version of this web app and <a href="https://twitter.com/_davideast" target="_blank">David</a> volunteered to make it look, well, a lot better:</p>

<p><a href="https://whatareyoubaking.com/" target="_blank"><img src="https://sararobinson.dev/assets/media/bakeml.gif"></a></p>

<p>If you want to play around with it yourself, <strong><a href="https://whatareyoubaking.com/" target="_blank">it’s here</a></strong>. I’m sure you’ll try to do something weird with it (this is the internet after all), just keep in mind that the model has been trained on minimal data and it only knows about 3 things: bread, cake, and cookies. So if you enter the ingredients for a brownie or anything else, it’ll do its best to slot it into the only 3 categories it knows about. Think of it …</p></div></div>

<h2 id="problem-1-no-semantics">Problem 1: no semantics</h2>

<p>The fundamental problem with enums is that they don’t have a semantic meaning for the left and right side. Let’s look at an example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Fruits</span><span>(</span><span>Enum</span><span>):</span>
    <span>apple</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Apple'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s not at all clear why the cases of <code>apple</code> and <code>Apple</code> are different here, and what does the difference in case mean? Which of those two do we store in the database for example? Which do we show to the user?</p>

<p>Our experience over the years has made us believe that naming things helps, but subtle names help very little. We’ve tried naming the user facing string <code>label</code> and <code>title</code>. Both those are no good and are frequently misunderstood. We’ve settled for <code>display_name</code> as hard to misunderstand.</p>

<p>The example above written with tri.tokens becomes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Fruits</span><span>(</span><span>TokenContainer</span><span>):</span>
    <span>apple</span> <span>=</span> <span>Token</span><span>(</span><span>display_name</span><span>=</span><span>'Apple'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The only problem here is that the word <code>apple</code> still has no name associated with it. We think this is an ok trade off, and we call this string the “name”, or sometimes “code name”. This is the string that goes into the database. Never anything else!</p>

<h2 id="problem-2-hard-to-add-data">Problem 2: Hard to add data</h2>

<p>With python enums it’s difficult to add additional data for the cases. You can use tuples but it has the same problem of no semantics but it gets worse the bigger the tuple is. This is an example from the official documentation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Planet</span><span>(</span><span>Enum</span><span>):</span>
    <span>MERCURY</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>3.303e+23</span><span>,</span> <span>2.4397e6</span><span>)</span>
    <span>VENUS</span>   <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>4.869e+24</span><span>,</span> <span>6.0518e6</span><span>)</span>
    <span>EARTH</span>   <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>5.976e+24</span><span>,</span> <span>6.37814e6</span><span>)</span>
    <span>MARS</span>    <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>6.421e+23</span><span>,</span> <span>3.3972e6</span><span>)</span>
    <span>JUPITER</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>1.9e+27</span><span>,</span>   <span>7.1492e7</span><span>)</span>
    <span>SATURN</span>  <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>5.688e+26</span><span>,</span> <span>6.0268e7</span><span>)</span>
    <span>URANUS</span>  <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>8.686e+25</span><span>,</span> <span>2.5559e7</span><span>)</span>
    <span>NEPTUNE</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>1.024e+26</span><span>,</span> <span>2.4746e7</span><span>)</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>mass</span><span>,</span> <span>radius</span><span>):</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>mass</span> <span>=</span> <span>mass</span>       <span># in kilograms
</span>        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>radius</span> <span>=</span> <span>radius</span>   <span># in meters
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s impossible to understand the definition of the data without reading the constructor (and the constructor is a bit weird too as <code>self</code> here are the cases, not the <code>Planet</code> class!). The constructor then changes this positional chaos to the named members <code>mass</code> and <code>radius</code>. In <a href="https://tritoken.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">tri.token</a> this would be:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Planet</span><span>(</span><span>Token</span><span>):</span>
    <span>mass</span> <span>=</span> <span>TokenAttribute</span><span>()</span>
    <span>radius</span> <span>=</span> <span>TokenAttribute</span><span>()</span>


<span>class</span> <span>Planets</span><span>(</span><span>TokenContainer</span><span>):</span>
    <span>MERCURY</span> <span>=</span> <span>Planet</span><span>(</span><span>mass</span><span>=</span><span>3.303e+23</span><span>,</span> <span>radius</span><span>=</span><span>2.4397e6</span><span>)</span>
    <span>VENUS</span>   <span>=</span> <span>Planet</span><span>(</span><span>mass</span><span>=</span><span>4.869e+24</span><span>,</span> <span>radius</span><span>=</span><span>6.0518e6</span><span>)</span>
    <span>EARTH</span>   <span>=</span> <span>Planet</span><span>(</span><span>mass</span><span>=</span><span>5.976e+24</span><span>,</span> <span>radius</span><span>=</span><span>6.37814e6</span><span>)</span>
    <span>MARS</span>    <span>=</span> <span>Planet</span><span>(</span><span>mass</span><span>=</span><span>6.421e+23</span><span>,</span> <span>radius</span><span>=</span><span>3.3972e6</span><span>)</span>
    <span>JUPITER</span> <span>=</span> <span>Planet</span><span>(</span><span>mass</span><span>=</span><span>1.9e+27</span><span>,</span>   <span>radius</span><span>=</span><span>7.1492e7</span><span>)</span>
    <span>SATURN</span>  <span>=</span> <span>Planet</span><span>(</span><span>mass</span><span>=</span><span>5.688e+26</span><span>,</span> <span>radius</span><span>=</span><span>6.0268e7</span><span>)</span>
    <span>URANUS</span>  <span>=</span> <span>Planet</span><span>(</span><span>mass</span><span>=</span><span>8.686e+25</span><span>,</span> <span>radius</span><span>=</span><span>2.5559e7</span><span>)</span>
    <span>NEPTUNE</span> <span>=</span> <span>Planet</span><span>(</span><span>mass</span><span>=</span><span>1.024e+26</span><span>,</span> <span>radius</span><span>=</span><span>2.4746e7</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This has clear semantics for each row and removes the need for the constructor on the Enum class.</p>

<p>Another common solution to the problem above is to have the data for mass and radius somewhere else. This results in several dicts you need to reconcile and validate.</p>

<h2 id="problem-3-scales-badly-for-sparse-data">Problem 3: scales badly for sparse data</h2>

<p>We have many cases with sparse data. This is what it would look with enums:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Fields</span><span>(</span><span>Enum</span><span>):</span>
    <span>party_group_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>default</span><span>,</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>'rec_party'</span><span>,</span> <span>default</span><span>,</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>None</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>None</code> here means it doesn’t exist and the sentinel <code>default</code> means to automatically generate the default. In tri.token this would be:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Fields</span><span>(</span><span>TokenContainer</span><span>):</span>
    <span>party_group_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>Field</span><span>(</span><span>total_download_name</span><span>,</span> <span>dw_name</span><span>=</span><span>"rec_party"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>total_download_name</code> here is a special sentinel value so we can shorten <code>total_download_name=default</code> to just <code>total_download_name</code>.</p>

<p>This problem grows with each case of the enum. As of this writing the <code>Fields</code> container from this example has 486 cases, making the sparse data issue much worse.</p>

<h2 id="problem-4-dangerous-to-work-around-these-problems">Problem 4: dangerous to work around these problems</h2>

<p>One could make all the cases for an Enum into dicts:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Fields</span><span>(</span><span>Enum</span><span>):</span>
    <span>party_group_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>dict</span><span>(</span>
        <span>total_download_name</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>,</span> 
        <span>dw_name</span><span>=</span><span>"rec_party"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>)</span>
    
    <span>instrument_type</span> <span>=</span> <span>dict</span><span>()</span>
    <span>agreement_curr</span> <span>=</span> <span>dict</span><span>(</span>
        <span>file_column</span>
    <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This doesn’t work though because all empty dicts are the same so if you add <code>avg_mtm_diff_usd = dict()</code> now data is thrown away silently.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Python native enums are great for what they were designed to do, but we’ve found that they are limited and don’t allow you to grow the complexity and usage in a sane way. We developed tri.token before python enums and were hoping we could throw away tri.token and replace it with enums, but unfortunately this wasn’t the case.</p>

<p>THE EUROPEAN UNION'S VACCINATION EFFORT came under fire just as it was beginning to deliver.</p>



<p>Heralded for months as the flagship of European solidarity during the coronavirus pandemic, the European Commission’s strategy of joint vaccine procurement is now being accused by national leaders of being too bureaucratic, too limiting to its members, too slow.</p>



<p>Specifically, the bloc’s decisions to prioritize process over speed and to put solidarity between EU countries ahead of giving individual governments more room to maneuver have been criticized for holding back the coronavirus response.</p>



<p>This account is based on dozens of interviews with diplomats, Commission officials, pharma industry representatives and national government aides. It details how the European Commission overcame a disorganized start to lead reluctant member countries in a successful effort to reserve an arsenal of vaccines that’s the envy of the world when it comes to cost and the diversification of smart bets.</p>



<p>It also shows how a vaccine strategy that was supposed to be a forceful show of European solidarity, an assertion of the single market’s buying power and a moral stand against Trumpian “vaccine nationalism” resulted in a rollout that has left the EU lagging behind the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>

<p>EU countries stuck together even as the U.S. and the U.K. bought, approved and began injecting vaccines at a faster clip. The result: lower prices, with higher accountability for drugmakers, and shots for the whole of the EU — but also delays in delivery and rising tensions among EU member countries resentful about the tradeoffs.</p>



<p>Over the past 10 months of the global vaccine race, the EU was often a step or two behind: Its move to secure doses came only after warnings that the U.S. might monopolize supply. Its deliberative approach to regulatory approval has left EU citizens lagging behind the U.S. and the U.K. when it comes to getting access to vaccines — at a moment when delays are counted in lost lives.</p>



<p>The blame game playing out in public is a boiling over of mistrust that has undermined the EU’s ambitions to vaccinate its citizens in concert. As the EU has discovered, wielding the market power and moral authority of 27 sovereign nations — with different budgets and perspectives on risk — means moving more slowly than the one-and-done competition. For the bloc’s wealthier countries, especially, the question is whether domestic voters will decide the solidarity is worth the delay.</p>



<h3><strong>‘Large sums of money’</strong></h3>



<p>THE EU'S PUSH INTO VACCINE PROCUREMENT began with a meeting far across the Atlantic — between then U.S. President Donald Trump, his coronavirus task force and a heavy-hitting group of pharmaceutical executives.</p>



<p>The March 2 gathering in the White House Cabinet room made waves in Europe, in particular in Berlin, where journalists zeroed in on the pitch reportedly made to Trump by Daniel Menichella, CEO of CureVac, a German biotech firm.</p>



<p>Curevac had developed an experimental rabies vaccine using a new mRNA technology that instructs the body's cells to train the immune system to fight off a virus. The company’s jab, Menichella said, could be reengineered to fight the novel coronavirus in<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/02/1993888/0/en/CureVac-CEO-Daniel-Menichella-Discusses-Coronavirus-Vaccine-Development-with-U-S-President-Donald-Trump-and-Members-of-Coronavirus-Task-Force.html" target="_blank"> just a few months</a>.</p>



<p>“<a href="https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/plus206563595/Trump-will-deutsche-Impfstoff-Firma-CureVac-Traumatische-Erfahrung.html" target="_blank">Trump wants German vaccine company CureVac: Traumatic experience,”</a> blared a headline in Die Welt on March 15. It quoted German health ministry officials alarmed that the U.S. president had offered CureVac “large sums of money” in exchange for exclusive dibs on its as-yet-nonexistent coronavirus vaccine.</p>



<p>A day after the article’s publication, March 16, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Ambroise Fayolle, the European Investment Bank’s vice president for innovation, held a virtual face to face with CureVac’s management.</p>



<p>The company and the White House denied any attempt by the U.S. to monopolize the potential vaccine. But von der Leyen and Fayolle were sufficiently spooked. They announced plans to offer CureVac up to €80 million in loans to test and manufacture its vaccine in the EU — even though the EIB hadn’t even started assessing the business case.</p>



<p>“Their home is here,” von der Leyen<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_474" target="_blank"> said</a> in a press release. “But their vaccines will benefit everyone, in Europe and beyond.”</p>



<p>Fears that the U.S. would monopolize coronavirus remedies dominated the discussion at the European Council the next day, as EU leaders <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-european-leaders-to-hold-videoconference/">met</a> for one of their first COVID-era videoconferences. At a press conference afterward, von der Leyen crowed about convincing CureVac to stay in Europe, bragging that it was the “front-runner in the research.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, the company was well behind American, British and even European competitors like another medium-sized German firm named BioNTech. Normally focused on cancer, <a href="https://investors.pfizer.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2020/Pfizer-and-BioNTech-to-Co-Develop-Potential-COVID-19-Vaccine/default.aspx" target="_blank">BioNTech announced it would team up</a> with the American behemoth Pfizer to manufacture its mRNA coronavirus vaccine, if it worked.</p>



<p>Behind von der Leyen’s overstatement lay a startling truth: Europe was already losing the race to secure a coronavirus vaccine. As early as mid-February, while the U.S. president was downplaying the virus, his government was making connections with Big Pharma. The U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority had teamed up with<a href="https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-collaboration-with-u-s-department-of-health-human-services-to-accelerate-development-of-a-potential-novel-coronavirus-vaccine" target="_blank"> Johnson &amp; Johnson</a> to look for vaccines on February 11, and a collaboration with the French crown jewel Sanofi had been<a href="https://www.sanofi.com/en/media-room/press-releases/2020/2020-02-18-16-00-00" target="_blank"> announced</a> a week after that.</p>

<p>The CureVac crisis — the “traumatic experience” narrowly averted — became a rallying cry for Europe, and an opportunity for moral leadership for von der Leyen.</p>



<p>When it came to vaccines, von der Leyen was quick to draw a sharp contrast with the U.S., casting “Team Europe” as a communal medicine cabinet, prepared to work together to inoculate not just citizens in every EU country, but the entire world.</p>



<p>Weeks later, after Trump had announced a freeze on U.S. funding for the World Health Organization, von der Leyen<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/world-leaders-pledge-to-fight-coronavirus/"> hosted a May 4 fundraiser</a> with the U.N. health body and other big philanthropy players. It garnered almost $8 billion, loosely earmarked for research on treatments, tests and vaccines.</p>



<p>The U.S. blew that event off. Instead, Trump formally launched a $10 billion “Operation Warp Speed” on May 15. The goal: invest in experimental vaccines and produce enough to deliver 300 million doses to Americans by January 2021.</p>



<p>The race was just beginning.</p>



<h3><strong>Fear of missing out</strong></h3>



<p>WHEN IT CAME TO WORKING TOGETHER to procure medical supplies during the coronavirus pandemic, the EU did not have a great track record. During the early days of the crisis, EU countries had unilaterally closed their borders and accused each other of hoarding personal protective equipment.</p>



<p>Brussels' response was a system to wield the purchasing power of 37 countries — the EU27 and 10 of their neighbors — to buy masks and ventilators. But as talks turned to vaccines, the program had yet to deliver a single item.</p>



<p>The problem was bureaucracy. Before it could place an order, the Commission had to wait for each EU country to sign the contract. Some countries, fed up with the endless back and forth, simply purchased the items on their own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vaccine procurement presented an even more formidable challenge, with a bewildering array of vaccination candidates and pharma companies — none of which had produced a deliverable product.</p>



<p>Some firms appeared to take a page from the CureVac playbook: capitalize on the FOMO. The U.S.’s early investment in Sanofi’s inoculation would translate into priority access for Americans, Sanofi CEO Paul Hudson told<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-13/u-s-to-get-sanofi-covid-vaccine-first-if-it-succeeds-ceo-says" target="_blank"> Bloomberg</a> in mid-May. French lawmakers<a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1365453"> accused Hudson of “blackmail</a>,” but his strategy seemed to have paid off. Paris and Berlin <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1372904">started direct negotiations</a> about aid and supplies with Sanofi in May.</p>



<p>In the public view, a front-runner in the vaccine race was emerging: Oxford researcher Sarah Gilbert told <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/coronavirus-vaccine-could-be-ready-by-september-flmwl257x" target="_blank">the Times on April 11</a> that the vaccine she was developing with AstraZeneca could be ready by September. She was “80 percent confident” it would work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bureaucrats tried to keep score at home. “Every vaccine nerd in the Commission and the individual member states would've had their Excel sheet of, here are the interesting vaccines, here's the 100-plus candidates, here's where they all are,” said a Commission official, interviewed on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly about the negotiations.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, EU countries weren’t waiting for the Commission to start to strike deals. France and Spain separately began talks with Moderna, according to the Commission official. By mid-April, Paris and Berlin started negotiating together to buy vaccines, according to an Elysée official.</p>



<p>EU27 health ministers signed off on a Commission plan to buy on their behalf on June 12. But the Franco-German initiative continued to press forward, having invited the Netherlands and Italy to join their buyers’ club. On June 13, the quartet — known as the “Inclusive Vaccine Alliance” — announced a deal for between 300 million and 400 million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab.</p>



<p>The agreement with AstraZeneca has been described as little more than a one-page term sheet between the companies and health ministers<strong>. </strong>But it was politically significant. It showed that the four countries — representing four of five largest EU economies and roughly a third of the bloc’s population — were not afraid to use their significant buying power and leverage their powerhouse pharma industries, even as the Commission was still searching for its footing.</p>



<p>The Alliance said it would talk to the Commission about working together “where possible” and that other countries could join in — but “the four countries just realized at one point, there's no time to wait until everyone is on board,” said one senior EU diplomat from an alliance country. “Let's just give it a …</p></div></div>

January 29, 2021 | https://blog.zaita.com/mingw64-compiler-bug/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.zaita.com/mingw64-compiler-bug/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>There are approximately 7.5x10^18 grains of sand on Earth. This story is about finding changes in an equation that has a difference of approximately 1e-18 out of hundreds of billions of calculations. That is 7 grains of sand that are different to what we expect across the entire planet Earth.</p>
<p>After spending days generating gigabytes of debug logs and GDB breakpoints, I finally discovered a very peculiar bug in the compiler. I thought this would be an interesting story to tell.</p>
<p><strong>Update: Thanks to gus_massa and wiml @ HackerNews for pointing out I had used associative instead of commutative</strong></p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Back in 2008 I started developing a scientific modelling platform called the <a href="https://niwa.co.nz/fisheries/tools-resources/spatial-population-modelling">Spatial Population Model (SPM)</a>. This software is designed to model or simulate and ocean environments to approximate the health of fish stocks. The output of SPM is used to create scientific reports that are given to Governments for the setting of commercial fishing quota. </p>
<p>Due to the political nature of these reports, reproducibility and integrity of results is crucial. Scientists from around the world will use the software to re-run models across different Operating Systems and compilers to validate results.</p>
<p>Since it was 2008, it was decided that SPM would not be multi-threaded. This is because of: no C++ standard threading, average computer had 2 cores, incompatibility with auto-differentiation libraries) </p>
<p>Fast forward to 2020/21 where many-core systems are commonplace. I had recently acquired for myself an AMD 5950X 16c/32t CPU and was keen to apply it to some modelling work. SPM is still in use as a world leading spatial modelling platform and has received continual updates. I’ve had a long interest in bringing concurrency to SPM to invent new methods of scientific modelling that evolve the underlying mathematics. As a proof of concept, I wanted to start working through threading the internal gradient calculation. Models in SPM are user defined and can be enormous (&gt;100k lines of input text) so we’re unable to analytically determine the gradient function through auto-differentiation. We use an iterative approach tweaking model parameters to calculate the gradient. These tweaks are independent and therefore can be parallelised. </p>
<p>This seemed like a relatively straight forward piece of work. I would need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Move all of the classes to be children of a new Model class</li>
<li>Remove all singletons</li>
<li>Keep the floating-point operations in the exact same order when calculate on the main thread (IEEE-754)</li>
<li>Support an arbitrary number of threads</li>
<li>Produce identical results regardless of the number of threads, Operating System or compiler</li>
</ol>
<h2>IEEE-754 or the floating-point nightmare</h2>
<p>The development of scientific modelling platforms like SPM requires a significant amount of thought and effort around reproducibility. Given the same input files, any user must be able to re-run your model and get the exact same answer out. This seems incredibly obvious, but it’s not…</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754">IEEE-754</a> is the standard for floating-point arithmetic. Floating point math in computers is an approximation. Whenever you see a floating point value it is highly unlikely to be completely accurate. Floating-point arithmetic is commutative, but not associative. So for floating-point numbers,
A + B = B + A always, but
A + (B + C) != (A + B) + C in many cases.
The order in which operations occur within your model will influence the output. While this is inconsequential for small programs or games; this continual adding of errors for scientific models where the number of operations is in the hundreds of billions is consequential. </p>
<p>Every thread we spawn must run the same operations in the exact same order. When the threads give their results back to the main thread, they must do so in a way that ensures that all future operations happen in the exact same order. This is regardless of the number of threads or number of parameters in the model.</p>
<p><em>Side Note: Within scientific models, we use double precision numbers (double) and not single precision (float). Single precision does not have enough precision to handle the number of calculations required. At the end of a model the error added by the approximation of floating-point math is very significant. This limits us to using CPUs over GPUs as the double precision performance of GPUs is not that much better than a modern CPU when you have to factor in the added complexity of writing GPU specific code.</em></p>
<h2>The first signs of trouble</h2>
<p>With my task list ready, I started to work through re-factoring the code. Everything was modified to use a central model class as the parent for the system. This allows me to spawn as many model classes as threads. Everything was compiling and running without crashes. Time to check the output..</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>1999.818926297566804 // original score running no threads
1999.8189264475995515 // my new score running 32 threads</code></pre></div>
<p>A slight difference, nothing to be concerned about as I had probably changed the order of execution for some of the equations by threading them. I was testing with a small model that ran in &lt;5 seconds, so working through each of the instantiated classes to check the code won’t take too long. Another day down and nothing obvious was found. Time to run the application through GDB and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AddressSanitizer">Sanitizers</a> looking for issues… nope nothing there either.</p>
<p>A simple model will have recruitment/breeding, ageing and death. I started to reduce and simplify the processes in the model to see if I could identify any key process or parameter. I removed the random number generate and commented out a large amount of complex math… but still no luck.</p>
<h2>Down the rabbit hole of debug logging and GDB</h2>
<p>After three days of trying to find the issue, I had added a LARGE amount of debug logging and had resorted to doing step throughs in GDB looking for a point at which I would notice a change in the result. The log files were 20MBs+ and the model would only show issues after a few iterations… why not immediately?</p>
<p>Was I calling a function later in the model that had the issue? Or was the issue starting earlier but at a greater precision that I was printing. I was printing my debug output with a <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/manip/setprecision">precision</a> of 15. Time to increase the precision to 20. This is basically the maximum amount of precision you can print from a double with accuracy. I did a few more model runs and saw that the variation in results had moved to much earlier in the model… almost immediately.</p>
<p>The model would load the configuration file, then construct all of the user defined objects in memory. As part of constructing these objects a bunch of calculations would be run to build caches. To save on moving data between threads each thread would repeat the same process. Every new thread would get the configuration file that had been loaded, create all of the objects and run the initial calculations. GDB showed that even these initial calculates were having different results.</p>
<p>My working folder was littered with files named “fuck”, “fuck1” and “fuckN” each with more than 20MBs of debug output for a small model run. Diff was run across files to see where changes were occurring and how small they were… But still no luck.. everything was going wrong almost immediately but I had no idea why.</p>
<h2>Surely it’s not a compiler bug?</h2>
<p>SPM uses the GCC and MinGW64 compilers. This allows us to have near-identical code for Windows and Linux with common makefiles. I have always preferred <a href="https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/">TDM-GCC</a> as this has a current release. In this instance, TDM-GCC 9.2.0 from March 2020. Running the sanitizers was done on OpenSuSe Tumbleweed Linux using GCC 10.2.1. These are both very modern versions of the GCC compiler suite. I have never been one to blame tools for a bug in my code.</p>
<p>At this point, I am way down the rabbit hole trying to find the cause of this bug. Some testing had shown me that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The original binary would produce the same result on every run</li>
<li>My new binary would produce the same result on every run, but different to the original</li>
<li>My new binary would produce the same result regardless of the number of threads.. from 1 to 100</li>
</ul>
<p>That last observation made me curious. Why did my new code produce a different result when I ran it with only one thread? What would make it different from the original binary. Having only 1 thread that was executing would eliminate any race conditions.</p>
<p>In the original binary, we do not create any threads. We load the model, build and run it. In the new code, even with one thread we create that thread, load the model, build and run it. What was I doing during the thread creation process that would cause this issue? Time for GBs of log files and GDB.</p>
<p>Stepping through every operation to validate the output lead me into what we call a selectivity. This is a static piece of code that takes an input, calls a standard simple piece of math and returns an output. These few lines of code had returned different results in a thread and not. Time to analyse the following code:</p>
<div data-language="c++"><pre><code>double CLogisticSelectivity::calculateResult(int Age) {
    double dRet = 0.0;
    double dTemp = (dA50-Age)/dAto95;

    if(dTemp &gt; 5.0)
      dRet = 0.0;
    else if (dTemp &lt; -5.0)
      dRet = dAlpha;
    else
      dRet  = dAlpha/(1.0+pow(19.0,dTemp));

    return dRet;
}</code></pre></div>
<p>If I gave the code Age = 1 then ran it I got the following results:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Local  = 0.0010370292068795884059
Thread = 0.0010370292068795879722</code></pre></div>
<p>What gives? There is nothing in here that should be different in a thread. I am not passing in anything but an int with the value of 1. I edited the code to make dA50 and dAto95 local variables to remove any potential race conditions or thread wonkiness and still had the same error in output. Everything was initialized within the same function and the only external value was an Integer. Weird…</p>
<h2>Compiler bug? But how…</h2>
<p>Looking at the code, the only things that could create the bug were the operators and pow() call. These are part of the C++ standard offering so it’s highly unlikely that either of these would have an error. What next?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			<p>Last summer the Go team announced an updated <a href="https://blog.golang.org/generics-next-step">design
draft</a> for adding generics to the
language. Included in the announcement was a new experimentation tool, named
<code>go2go</code>, for developers to compile, test, and run code written using the
generics feature described in the latest design draft. This blog post documents
my experience using the <code>go2go</code> tool to add support for generics to an existing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">PubSub</a>
package.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>tl;dr: <a href="https://github.com/benburkert/pubsub/commit/73593d5f0ef07eebf04379244d5446224c793dcb">here is the code
diff</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="go2go">go2go</h2>
<p>The <code>go2go</code> tool is a working prototype. It can parse the new language syntax
and transform it to a sort of “intermediate” Go 1 code, which can then be fed
to the standard Go compiler and executed. I have read that it relies on
monomorphization to transform code, but I can’t say that I understand what that
means.</p>
<p>You can install the <code>go2go</code> tool now by fetching &amp; building the latest version
of the <code>dev.go2go</code> branch of the <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/go">Go project’s source
repository</a>. There is also an online version at
<a href="https://go2goplay.golang.org/">The go2go Playground</a>.</p>
<h2 id="generic-pubsub">Generic PubSub</h2>
<p>There are many ways generics can be useful in a codebase, but I am particularly
interested in how they can be applied to “container” code. That is, code that
typically implements a specialized algorithm or data structure unrelated to the
structure of the objects it holds.</p>
<p>PubSub is a good fit for generics for a few reasons. The need for high
performance (either low latency or high throughput) meshes well with compiler
optimizations that generics enable. And it is typically used in highly
concurrent programs where correctness checks are critical to avoiding data
races and memory bugs. Generics can lift these checks from runtime to compile
time, which helps the implementer build a correct PubSub implementation.</p>
<p>But, (in my opinion) the most important benefit is the elimination of “book
keeping” code that simplifies the API surface area for consumers of the PubSub
library. It’s a particularly tricky pattern to use correctly as a developer, so
any reductions in API complexity can be a major boon to them.</p>
<h2 id="githubcombenburkertpubsubhttpspkggodevgithubcombenburkertpubsub"><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/benburkert/pubsub">github.com/benburkert/pubsub</a></h2>
<p>The package I’ve chosen to analyze is a pretty bare bones PubSub
implementation I wrote a while ago. It allows package users to publish and/or
subscribe to a single stream of objects, via a function call/callback or
channel send/receive. The objects can be of any type and are internally tracked
as empty interface instances. There is a complicated API for adding type safe
publishers and subscribers (enforced at runtime), which works with both
<a href="https://github.com/benburkert/pubsub/blob/master/example/typedfunc/main.go">functions</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/benburkert/pubsub/blob/master/example/typedchan/main.go">channels</a>.</p>
<p>Under the hood, it is broken down into two major components: a fixed size ring
buffer with a max number of readers/writers, and a PubSub layer that sits over
the underlying buffer. The basic API is quite simple, but the API for typed
functions and channels is not: the user has to manipulate the underlying buffer
at times. It’s a leaky abstraction that I wish did not exist.</p>
<p>It has already shown to be quite reliable and performant in production
environments, but (im)proving correctness is always a good thing. Likewise for
removing potential runtime panics.</p>
<h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2>
<p>At the moment, I’m only interested in how generics can improve the correctness
of this package, its APIs, and programs that consume them. As mentioned above,
<code>go2go</code> is only a prototype, and I don’t expect it to produce a faster or
smaller binary, so I’ve skipped that analysis entirely. There will most
certainly be impacts on performance (both good and bad!), but any investigation
would be pure speculation until generics support moves beyond the prototype
phase.</p>
<p>The <code>go2go</code> tool itself is still rough around the edges: error messages can be
confusing and un-googlable. And it may require code changes to get around
limitations of the tool. The <code>go2go</code> playground is a better place to start
exploring with generics; I don’t recommend the <code>go2go</code> tool route unless you
are working on an existing, multi-file package.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>I spent two Sunday afternoons on this project, or about 10 hours total. I
hadn’t kept up closely with the state of the generics language feature, so this
included reading parts of the proposal and getting up to speed with the new
tooling and syntax.</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://github.com/benburkert/pubsub/commit/73593d5f0ef07eebf04379244d5446224c793dcb">changes</a>
clocked in at a little over 500 LOC, with about 100 lines of added code. Almost
all of the added code was in additional tests.</p>
<p>I started by updating the <code>Buffer</code> type, next the <code>PubSub</code> type, and finally
the <code>Publisher</code>, <code>Subscriber</code>, and <code>Context</code> types. Nothing else required changes.</p>
<h2 id="buffer"><code>Buffer</code></h2>
<p>The major change to the <code>Buffer</code> type was swapping out the underlying storage slice,
changing it from an empty interface slice (<code>data []interface{}</code>) to a slice of
<code>T</code>s, where <code>T</code> is a <code>comparable</code> type parameter on <code>Buffer</code>. The <code>comprable</code>
trait was needed because the buffer uses an equality check (<code>==</code>) to test if
the next position to read is marked empty (i.e. unwritten). Previously the
package used a typed byte value to mark the initial data slice items as empty.
But because the type of <code>T</code> is now a type parameter, the global empty marker
trick no longer works.</p>
<p>To compensate, an empty value parameter was added to the <code>NewBuffer</code> func and
an <code>empty T</code> field added to <code>Buffer</code>. The new <code>data</code> slice of <code>T</code>s is set to
the empty value instead of the zero value for <code>T</code>. Careful: the empty value
cannot be written to the buffer, so using the <code>T</code>'s zero value may have very
bad consequences if the zero value of <code>T</code> can be written by the program (i.e.
<code>int(0)</code>). In practice, this shouldn’t be an issue because the <code>PubSub</code> type
uses its own trick to avoid having the empty value of <code>T</code> conflict with user
values.</p>
<p>After this small but cardinal set of changes, the rest was mostly swapping out
empty interfaces for type parameters, and adding additional <code>Buffer</code> tests.
Since writing the latest version of this package, I have picked up the habit
of mostly writing <a href="https://dave.cheney.net/2019/05/07/prefer-table-driven-tests">table style
tests</a>. The added
tests were done in this fashion, and they are structured pretty much the same
as non-generic table style tests. It feels like generics could improve these
table style tests further, but it’s not immediately obvious to me. Perhaps
there are improvements lurking around the corner, but for now it’s only a hope.</p>
<h2 id="pubsub"><code>PubSub</code></h2>
<p>Next up was the <code>PubSub</code> type. Unlike the <code>Buffer</code> type, it was important that
the <code>PubSub</code> type be able to work on any type <code>T</code>, not just comparable types
(i.e. <code>[T any]</code> vs <code>[T comparable]</code>). Otherwise, maps and slices would be
unsupported type parameters. This requirement introduced a catch: reusing the
<code>T</code> type parameter on <code>PubSub</code> for <code>Buffer[T]</code> would lift that constraint,
meaning the type for <code>Buffer</code> would have to be comparable.</p>
<p>To get around this, I relied on the comparability of pointers: <a href="https://go2goplay.golang.org/p/Y2XuSbTbbt5">a pointer to a
type with an <code>any</code> type parameter is always
comparable.</a> This meant adding a
layer of indirection via a <code>cell</code> struct, which the underlying <code>Buffer</code> holds a
slice of instead of the <code>T</code>s to <code>PubSub</code>. It might seem unfortunate that the
solution required this extra indirection, but in actuality it doesn’t introduce
any extra overhead compared to the previous version. That is because the <code>cell</code>
type is not much different than the empty interface type that <code>Buffer</code> used
prior. And it also provided a way of reimplementing the unsubscribe mechanism.</p>
<p>The API allows for the function and channel subscribers to unsubscribe by
calling a function or closing a channel, respectively. In both these cases, the
subscriber can signal to the callback/receiver handler to close the
subscription. So each subscriber must have their own way of being signaled for
shutdown.</p>
<p>This signal is implemented as an instance of an empty struct chan. Because
channels have the property of being comparable and equal only to the same
instance of itself, these channels can be used as for both a per-subscriber
marker and for signal delivery. Instead of pushing these channels directly into
the buffer, the <code>cell</code> type added a <code>ch</code> field for these channels. These
“control” <code>cell</code> values can be differentiated from “data” <code>cell</code> values by
setting a non-nil <code>ch</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>PubSub</code> methods were then updated to drop the empty interfaces for type
parameters. The only real behavioral change to a method was in <code>PubSlice</code>: the
<code>[]T</code> argument had to be copied into an equivalent <code>[]cell[T]</code> before being
written to the <code>Buffer</code>. While it is additional overhead, that overhead was
likely already being performed by users, because their typed slice would have
to be copied to an empty interface slice prior to calling the old <code>PubSlice</code>.
If anything, it’s an improvement because it eliminates more book-keeping for
the user. Typically the conversion to <code>interface{}</code> parameters is handled by
the compiler/runtime, but not for a slice of empty interfaces.</p>
<h2 id="publisher-subscriber--context"><code>Publisher</code>, <code>Subscriber</code>, &amp; <code>Context</code></h2>
<p>With the move to type parameters for the <code>PubSub</code> type, there is no longer a
need for the old “type safe” API: the basic API now supports compile time type
safety. It’s a big improvement over the old API. The <code>Publisher</code> &amp; <code>Subscriber</code>
interfaces were deleted, along with the <code>Context</code> interface.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>n.b. <code>Context</code> was unfortunately named due to being written before the
<code>context</code> package was part of the standard library.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think I can understate how gratifying it is to see this sort of
improvement naturally fall out from a new language feature. Deleting code
always feels good, but that hardly compares to removing leaky abstractions. At
this point the <code>Buffer</code> type could be unexported, but I held off for the sake
of keeping the diff readable.</p>
<p>The “unusable empty value” <code>Buffer</code> problem mentioned above is solved rather
trivially: because the <code>Buffer</code> of a <code>PubSub</code> is no longer exposed via the API
to users, a nil <code>cell</code> value can safely be used as the empty value,
because there is no other opportunity for a nil <code>cell</code> to be written to the
<code>Buffer</code>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I struggled to grasp generics at the outset of this experiment. They are
complex in a way that I haven’t encountered in a while with Go: I wasn’t sure
when to reach for them and when to use another feature of Go. I didn’t have a
firm understanding of “what” needed to be done until I started using the
<code>go2go</code> tool. It was difficult, but …</p></section></div>

		<p>The other day I was thinking about what do HTML tags give us out of the box and made this list:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hierarchy</strong></li>
</ol>
<pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;</span><span>luke-im-your-father</span><span>&gt;

	&lt;</span><span>nooo-thats-impossible</span><span>&gt;&lt;/</span><span>nooo-thats-impossible</span><span>&gt;

&lt;/</span><span>luke-im-your-father</span><span>&gt;

<ol start="2">

</span></code></pre>
<ol start="3">

&lt;/</span><span>q</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Functionality</strong></li>
</ol>
<pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;</span><span>video </span><span>controls width</span><span>="</span><span>250</span><span>"&gt;

    Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.

</span></code></pre>
<p>This list is by no means exhaustive. There are likely many more things that HTML tags give us (like headaches, reactjs, and some money at the end of the month if we are lucky).</p>
<p>With the Shadow DOM it is possible to compose all of the features above and hide them away inside custom tags.</p>
<p>I want to use Shadow DOM like a rug that I can sweep tags under it. A particular DOM root that cannot be seen and that is under the control of a tag.</p>

<li><strong>Encapsulation</strong></li>
</ol>
<pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;</span><span>nevermind-the-backend-this-is-where-the-dragons-are</span><span>&gt;

</span><span>&lt;!-- there is nothing to see here because this tag has a Shadow root --&gt;

</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>nevermind-the-backend-this-is-where-the-dragons-are</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>This DOM root inception made me wonder: <em>"What is the default visibility behavior of the Shadow DOM? could it be reversed?"</em></p>

<h2 id="hmm-that-sounds-stupid-but-how-would-it-work">Hmm, that sounds stupid, but how would it work?</h2>
<p>When a Web Component has no shadow root, it will happily render all its children:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;&lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;

&lt;</span><span>simple-web-component</span><span>&gt;
    &lt;</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;Hello world! I am not inside the shadow root.&lt;/</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>simple-web-component</span><span>&gt;

&lt;</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;

</span><span>customElements</span><span>.</span><span>define</span><span>("</span><span>simple-web-component</span><span>",
</span><span>// What follows is the the &lt;simple-web-component&gt; code:
</span><span>class extends </span><span>HTMLElement </span><span>{
    </span><span>initialize</span><span>() {
      </span><span>// Nothing for now... just a simple component
    </span><span>}

    </span><span>// Call initialize when added to a parent node
    </span><span>connectedCallback</span><span>() { </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>initialize</span><span>(); }
}</span><span>);

&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;

&lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>The code above creates the functionality for the <code>&lt;simple-web-component&gt;</code> tag. Which gets rendered as expected:</p>
<p><img src="https://hugodaniel.com/images/no-shadow-dom.png" alt="A portion of a browser window, showing the following text in black letters &quot;Hello world! I am not inside the shadow root&quot;, in a white background." title="In direct sunlight"></p>
<p>However, this is not how it behaves when a shadow root is added to it.</p>
<h3 id="adding-a-bare-shadow-root">Adding a bare shadow root</h3>
<p>The code inside the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag needs to be slightly adjusted to add a shadow root.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>customElements</span><span>.</span><span>define</span><span>("</span><span>simple-web-component</span><span>",

</span><span>// The &lt;simple-web-component&gt; code:
</span><span>class extends </span><span>HTMLElement </span><span>{
    
    </span><span>root </span><span>= </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>attachShadow</span><span>({mode: </span><span>'</span><span>open</span><span>'</span><span>})
    
    </span><span>initialize</span><span>() </span><span>{
        </span><span>const </span><span>p </span><span>= </span><span>document.</span><span>createElement</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>p</span><span>"</span><span>);
        </span><span>p</span><span>.</span><span>textContent </span><span>= "</span><span>In the shadow!</span><span>"</span><span>;
        </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>root</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>p</span><span>);
    }

    </span><span>// Call initialize when added to a parent node
    </span><span>connectedCallback</span><span>() </span><span>{ </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>initialize</span><span>(); }
}</span><span>);

</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>&lt;simple-web-component&gt;</code> class now has a <code>root</code> attribute <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/attachShadow">set with its shadow root</a>. Then a simple <code>&lt;p&gt;In the shadow!&lt;/p&gt;</code> is placed inside it by the <code>initialize()</code> function.</p>
<p>This simple shadow root will affect the display of the component.</p>
<p>The previous <code>&lt;p&gt;Hello world! I am not inside the shadow root.&lt;/p&gt;</code> will no longer be shown since it is outside the shadow root, and now only the shadow root contents are being displayed.</p>
<p><img src="https://hugodaniel.com/images/with-shadow-dom.png" alt="A portion of a browser window, showing the following text in black letters &quot;In the shadow!&quot; in a white background." title="Shaded"></p>
<p>However, the inspector tools shows how the tag is really juggling the shadow dom:</p>
<p><img src="https://hugodaniel.com/images/shadow-dom-inspector.png" alt="The hierarchy of tags as seen by the inspector tools. Under the &quot;simple-web-component&quot; tag, there is a &quot;#shadow-root&quot; tag with a single &quot;p&quot; tag with the text &quot;In the shadow!&quot;. Also, under the &quot;simple-web-component&quot; another &quot;p&quot; tag can be seen with the content &quot;Hello world! I am not inside the shadow root.&quot;" title="This shadow is not for everyone"></p>
<p>Looking at the above hierarchy it is worth noting that the original <code>&lt;p&gt;Hello World!..&lt;/p&gt;</code> is still there, but <em>why is it not visible?</em></p>
<p>Once a shadow root is added to a tag, it becomes the thing that will get rendered. Shadow DOM is the authority, everything else is discarded, and only the stuff inside the shadow root gets displayed.</p>
<p><em>Why?</em></p>
<p>Because the idea was that whatever children a custom tag would have could get rendered with ninja tricks inside the shadow. Thus giving the impression that the custom tag was getting its input from its visible children and then performing hidden layout and style foojitsu on that input (such tricks would occur inside the shadow dom - hidden from the written HTML).</p>
<p>Nobody cares. In fact, let me revert this logic.</p>
<h2 id="you-wouldn-t-download-a-car">You wouldn't download a car</h2>
<p>The first step to revert the Shadow DOM is to copy all the custom components' children into its shadow root.</p>
<p>This will allow HTML to be rendered as expected while maintaining the Shadow DOM's encapsulation features.</p>
<p>Luckily the Web Components spec provides just the feature for this, through the <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> tag.</p>
<h3 id="i-m-such-a-slot">I'm such a <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code></h3>
<p>This tag is used mainly in HTML <code>&lt;template&gt;</code>'s. It is the way that <code>&lt;template&gt;</code>'s have to tell which parts can be set by outsiders. Typically <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code>'s have a name attribute to be used as the reference to where the content will go. (You can see an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot#attributes">example of it here</a>, but it is not necessary, I won't be using it.)</p>
<p>The cool thing is that if there is no <code>name</code> specified on the <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code>, then it becomes the default <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> where all unspecified content will go in.</p>
<p>This is perfect. It means that if a <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> is placed inside the shadow root (without a <code>name="..."</code> attribute), then all of the custom element children will automatically be copied into it.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;&lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;

&lt;</span><span>simple-web-component</span><span>&gt;
    &lt;</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;Hello world! I am not inside the shadow root.&lt;/</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>simple-web-component</span><span>&gt;

&lt;</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;
</span><span>customElements</span><span>.</span><span>define</span><span>("</span><span>simple-web-component</span><span>",

</span><span>// The &lt;simple-web-component&gt; code:
</span><span>class extends </span><span>HTMLElement </span><span>{
    
    </span><span>root </span><span>= </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>attachShadow</span><span>({mode: </span><span>'</span><span>open</span><span>'</span><span>})
    
    </span><span>initialize</span><span>() {
        </span><span>const </span><span>p </span><span>= </span><span>document.</span><span>createElement</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>p</span><span>"</span><span>);
        </span><span>p</span><span>.textContent </span><span>= "</span><span>In the shadow!</span><span>"</span><span>;

        </span><span>this</span><span>.root.</span><span>append</span><span>(
          </span><span>p</span><span>,
          document.</span><span>createElement</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>slot</span><span>"</span><span>)
        );
    }

    </span><span>// Call initialize when added to a parent node
    </span><span>connectedCallback</span><span>() { </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>initialize</span><span>(); }
}</span><span>);
&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;

&lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>The Shadow Root above will contain a single <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> tag. This makes the <code>&lt;p&gt;Hello world! I am not inside the shadow root.&lt;/p&gt;</code> show up when the tag is rendered.</p>
<p><img src="https://hugodaniel.com/images/with-slot.png" alt="A portion of a browser window, showing two lines of text. The first one has the phrase &quot;In the shadow!&quot; and the second line has the phrase &quot;Hello world! I am not inside the shadow root.&quot;. Both of them have black letters on a white background." title="Both visible"></p>
<h2 id="don-t-ask-don-t-tell">Don't ask, don't tell</h2>
<p>The second step to revert the Shadow DOM display is to only show the children of the element.</p>
<p>Hide everything that is outside the <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code>. Only the tag's original children must be visible, while all the other shadow root contents must be hidden.</p>
<p>To achieve it, the following CSS is added to the Shadow DOM:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="css"><span>:</span><span>not(slot) </span><span>{
    display: none;
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The common practice is to create a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag, place the above content inside it and then append the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag to the Shadow DOM:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>    </span><span>initialize</span><span>() {
        </span><span>const </span><span>p </span><span>= document.</span><span>createElement</span><span>("</span><span>p</span><span>");
        </span><span>p</span><span>.</span><span>textContent </span><span>= "</span><span>In the shadow!</span><span>";

        </span><span>const </span><span>style </span><span>= document.</span><span>createElement</span><span>("</span><span>style</span><span>");
        </span><span>style</span><span>.</span><span>textContent </span><span>= `
</span><span>        :not(slot) {
          display: none;
        }</span><span>`;

        </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>root</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(
          </span><span>style</span><span>,
          </span><span>p</span><span>,
          document.</span><span>createElement</span><span>("</span><span>slot</span><span>")
        );
    }
</span></code></pre>
<p>And just like that, the actual behavior of the Shadow DOM is reversed. The Shadow DOM contents are hidden by default, while the original custom tag children get rendered by default.</p>
<p><img src="https://hugodaniel.com/images/reversed-shadow-dom.png" alt="A portion of a browser window, showing one line of text with the phrase &quot;Hello world! I am not inside the shadow root.&quot;. This text line has black letters on a white background." title="Only the child paragraph is visible"></p>
<p>No "In the shadow!" text is visible.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It is possible to sweep all kinds of useless trash under the Shadow DOM.</p>
<p>However, it might require reversing the Shadow DOM's visibility (which is rendered by default).</p>
<p>To achieve it, a full copy of the custom element original children is made into the Shadow DOM (through the default <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> tag). The next step is to hide everything inside the Shadow DOM that does not belong to the original children.</p>
<p>With these two moves, the element's original children become visible while leaving all the other shadow DOM contents invisible.</p>

The capital, in the northeast, is Port-aux-Français,&nbsp;which has&nbsp;a scientific base&nbsp;of&nbsp;about 80 people. The colony of black-browed albatrosses is 30-40 km away, so we flew there by helicopter.</p><p>It’s a sub-Antarctic island so there are no trees and, above 200-300 metres, no vegetation, only rock. The explorer Captain James Cook called it Desolation Island. There’s a lot of rain and wind and some snow, although it wasn’t very cold. Temperatures ranged from zero to about six degrees.</p><p>I enjoyed it there. We had a nice hut in a small valley along a river.</p><p>Every day we woke at 6am and walked for three quarters of an hour to the colony.</p><p>Black-browed albatrosses nest in cliffs so we had to use a rope to get from the plateau to 200 metres down. We were then in the cliff, on a ledge about two by ten metres with about 200 nests below us. They were part of a larger colony of a thousand pairs.</p><figure data-orig-width="4056" data-orig-height="3040" data-orig-src="https://horizon-media.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/IMCEUpload/encode_-_the_coast_with_the_colony_on_the_back_ground.jpg"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/ff1288620f391a2806bf00531fbdab46/0240891bbfec1ec5-a6/s1280x1920/d7f27f9d9f4e21c03eabd3f246ed4a29099c1c22.jpg" alt="The three researchers flew by helicopter to a sub-Antarctic island which is home to black-browed albatrosses perched on cliffs.

When the partner comes back it takes over the egg and the other one goes. We wanted to attach loggers to the birds at the time they were departing, so we had to wait for changeovers.</p><p>Each time there was a changeover we went further down with a rope to reach that nest. It took three of us – one to capture and hold the bird, one to attach the logger and the third to take notes and weigh the bird.</p><p>They are very tame so you can come very close without any problem.

And&nbsp;the site&nbsp;is very beautiful – it’s a&nbsp;spectacular cliff, you have the very rough sea and you have all the albatrosses flying around. Sometimes when it’s snowing it’s a bit cold, but otherwise it’s a very nice spot. It’s not difficult work so long as you don’t&nbsp;get vertigo in&nbsp;these steep cliffs.</p><p>After about eight days we had&nbsp;equipped&nbsp;40 albatrosses with our new loggers.

That’s why we had to retrieve them.</p><p>Each day at 6pm we had to contact our base (in Port-aux-Français) using a satellite phone to tell them that we were safely on the way back to the hut. They were nervous about our safety. That one minute on the sat phone was our only connection to the outside world. But it was quite nice because we had no information – nothing about COVID and all the problems.</p><p>In the evening we downloaded the data from the loggers onto our computers.</p><p>When the month was finished, to get back to the base we had to walk four hours and take a small boat for four hours across the bay.

If they switch them off they are probably doing illegal fishing. While we were on Kerguelen I had someone downloading all the movements of declared vessels in the southwestern Indian Ocean from their AIS (Automatic Identification System) transmissions. When I return to France, we will be able to tell whether the boats that were detected by the albatrosses had an AIS signal. If they don’t, then they were illegal if they were found in a national economic zone.</p><p>In our previous work we found that at a third of the boats were not using their transponders. We detected some sectors where there are a lot of illegal boats, for example around the Prince Edward Islands which are in South African waters.</p><p>This time we will have information from a different species, one that is even more attracted by fishing vessels. So we are expecting to have detected even more boats around Kerguelen. We are discussing (our findings) with the French authorities. This information will be used in the future for surveillance.</p><p>We are also interested in understanding whether the birds (that hang around) vessels gain more mass than birds foraging naturally. The question of mass gain is important when studying seabird-fisheries interactions. On the one hand there is a risk of being ensnared in on the lines, but there might be an advantage of gathering easy food.</p><figure data-orig-width="1080" data-orig-height="1080" data-orig-src="https://horizon-media.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/IMCEUpload/map-kerguelen6.jpg"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/318663e9508fcfe6ed579b04bc49665e/0240891bbfec1ec5-2a/s1280x1920/51326a411eb8990166edaf8cac0c6cbf781cecba.jpg" alt="It takes 15 days to travel by supply ship from the Indian Ocean island of Réunion to the Kerguelen Islands.

<p>Oh no….

<p>The keyword guiding IKEA’s history is <em>innovation.</em></p>



<p>Ever since its start in 1943, the name IKEA has been synonymous with minimal, cheap furniture that can be bought and assembled in one’s own home. Its first innovation is also its most famous one – the flatpack furniture. By introducing this concept, and moving furniture assembly onto the user – contrary to what other furniture stores were doing – it allowed the company to reduce costs. This concept made IKEA the world’s biggest furniture store, with no real worldwide competition. This enviable position, allowed it to focus on other innovations and products that could improve the IKEA brand and allow the company to enter new markets.</p>



<p>There were, of course, a number of high profile <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-ikea-tv-reviewed-worse-than-assembling-100-bookshe-5919216">mistakes</a>, but how else would a company from Sweden make €12.4 billion profit, if not for continuously making mistakes and learning from them along the way? The IKEA furniture made in the 1950s might not be fitting for today or appropriate in 10 years, while the food sold by the company 20 years ago might not respect the increasing sustainable lifestyle of many of its customers. The creation of <a href="https://space10.com/">SPACE10</a>, IKEA’s very own <a href="https://x.company/">‘X</a>’, the former Google X, has helped the company to experiment with new concepts and projects to address these challenges and keep the company on the forefront to new challenges. IKEA is changing how customers live, eat, and work, and its future will have a bigger role in our everyday lives.</p>



<p>There are four main areas where I believe IKEA is spearheading new concepts, new technology, and better practices:</p>



<ol><li>Food</li><li>Housing</li><li>the Smart Home</li><li>Augmented Reality</li></ol>



<p>I’ll delve deeper into each category and explain how IKEA is expected to be innovating in each, and then we’ll briefly look at how IKEA has the potential to rival Amazon, as it makes the jump from a furniture store to the everyday store.</p>



<h3>1. Food</h3>



<p>A few years after the flatpack furniture was invented, IKEA started opening IKEA Bistros and food markets, in its out-of-town stores.</p>



<p><em>“It’s difficult to do business with someone on an empty stomach.”</em></p>



<p>These were the words of IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad, who wanted to start serving food to the people spending whole days at IKEA stores out of the city. What better way to keep customers at your store than to offer them cheap AND good food?</p>



<p>The meatball remains an IKEA favourite, and the word itself has become as synonyms to IKEA as the flatpack furniture. With millions of IKEA meatballs sold each year, you would think the company would not want to upset the cart by changing recipes and adding new items to the menu. However IKEA did just that, and in mid-2020 it rolled out its ‘<a href="https://www.ikea.com/kr/en/p/allemansraetten-vegetable-balls-frozen-100-vegetables-40346434/">veggie balls</a>’ and the ‘<a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/this-is-ikea/sustainable-everyday/veggie-hot-dog-plant-based-goodness-pub166a3131">veggie hotdog</a>’ for public consumption. Two of the most famous IKEA food staples now have their vegetarian version, with the veggie balls producing around 15 to 20 times less carbon footprint than the meatballs. IKEA also joined forces with other organisations to buy sustainably farmed <a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/this-is-ikea/sustainable-everyday/patar-special-edition-from-uganda-with-love-a-very-special-single-origin-100-arabica-coffee-pub1e423691">coffee</a>, and <a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/this-is-ikea/sustainable-everyday/egentid-good-for-you-the-farmers-and-the-planet-pub561f3b31">tea</a> and created the ‘IKEA Food <a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/this-is-ikea/sustainable-everyday/ikea-food-better-chicken-pub4fcff351">Better Chicken</a>’ programme which seeks to source chicken under strict animal welfare criteria.</p>



<div id="w-node-0c78ba3acc40"><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9dc8a1a036811f1b6788fb/5f9eb99db1a0428adda3ed5a_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F0d586b7c-d38b-4215-84a6-c66fc5f76825_1200x800.jpeg?w=640&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Like other companies in the food sector, IKEA recognises the increasing number of individuals becoming aware of the carbon footprint needed to sustain the current consumption pattern. SPACE10 has been trying to build on the meatball’s legacy by creating new concepts which leave a much smaller carbon footprint, like meatballs made from artificial meat and those made from insects, which are not unconventional ideas in 2020, even if they have yet to enter the mainstream markets. The Lab also has a concept of a 3D printed meatball, which is more of an aesthetical project rather than a ready-to-serve meatball, however, this goes to show how SPACE10 is seeking to broaden the perspective of both IKEA itself, as well as its customers, to future possibilities in the food sector.</p>



<h3>2. Housing</h3>



<p>In the early 1990s, IKEA realised that the <a href="https://data.oecd.org/price/housing-prices.htm">increase in residential property prices</a> is making it harder and harder for certain sections of the population looking to buy a home without having to break the bank. <a href="https://www.boklok.com/">BoKlok</a> was born from an agreement between Swedish construction giants, Skanska, and IKEA, to build and design low-cost housing, complete with, of course, IKEA furnishing. Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland have been the first beneficiaries of this project, while the <a href="https://www.archpaper.com/2020/05/ikea-modular-boklok-development-offshoot-manufacturer/">United Kingdom</a> will be the first country to host BoKlok housing outside of the Nordics.</p>



<p>BoKlok, which was also called ‘<a href="https://medium.com/@bartholomewhearn/the-flat-pack-taken-to-the-next-level-the-boklok-concept-26078e433b3f">the flatpack taken to the next level</a>’, prides itself in using as limited and as sustainable resources as possible. The design and materials used for the pre-fabricated blocks make the houses’ energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable. This modular housing technique, allows BoKlok to build up to 80% of the houses in a factory and then transport and assemble them to the construction site itself.</p>



<div id="w-node-e435fd46d758"><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9dc8a1a036811f1b6788fb/5f9eb99da95d27563a12bf17_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252Fe876dbf1-6044-4545-9c0c-99bb6e96fb3c_1200x630.jpeg?w=640&amp;ssl=1" alt="BoKlok UK achieves planning acceptance on first UK development |  www.skanska.co.uk" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>With BoKlok, IKEA has managed to infiltrate the housing market, and as housing prices continue to rise above median wages, the company will continue to find a market for low-cost housing. What made BoKlok successful, and continues to do so, is the cost-cutting every step of the way, with profits then being passed on to the consumer. A combination of cheap land, a single standard design, and large-volume manufacturing allows IKEA to create entire housing estates while eliminating brokers and their fees. Buying a flat with BoKlok is also as simple as buying a new bed frame from IKEA – you just have to register at the nearest IKEA store for available housing units.</p>



<p>While this is already disruptive in the current housing market, IKEA, or rather IKEA’s SPACE10 has already come up with a BoKlok on steroids – a new concept for future housing and working environment. ‘<a href="https://www.urbanvillageproject.com/">The Urban Village Project</a>’ shares the same aims of BoKlok, that of creating a sustainable and affordable way of living, but it also aims higher – to completely transform the housing market, by “bypassing the interests of short-term investors”. What this means is that the Project looks for financing by collaborating with “pension funds, future-oriented companies and municipalities” in order to drive down costs, and combine the project with co-operative structures to keep housing within the community. All managed through a neat-looking app.</p>



<div id="w-node-2227ad890b79"><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9dc8a1a036811f1b6788fb/5f9eb99d234ed0583a59caba_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F21b99d3b-2ea6-47b7-b930-5c8a9f0856ff_1200x675.jpeg?w=640&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Related to this, is IKEA’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/4/18652178/ikea-rognan-robot-murphy-bed-furniture-ori-living-democratic-design-days">announcement</a> that it will start to create robotic furniture for small spaces. Rolling out in places like Hong Kong and Japan, micro-apartments will be the first to feel the benefits of the Rognan furniture, which transforms easily depending on what you need to use at the time. The idea is that one will not use a certain section of the place while busy doing something else, like not using the bed if you’re on the sofa – and Rognan helps to maximise space accordingly.</p>



<div id="w-node-cb2d728635af"><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9dc8a1a036811f1b6788fb/5f9eb99ed5fd03adadf17e70_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F29718baf-50d5-4c9d-917e-55d18b183521_1000x563.gif?w=640&amp;ssl=1" alt="New IKEA collaboration features robotic furniture for small space living |  6sqft" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>In the near future, I would also see IKEA getting into the workspaces sector, providing low-cost offices for freelancers and even startups looking to cut costs. Coworking is expected to grow to an estimated <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-coworking-spaces-market-2020-2030---covid-19-growth-deviations-trends--developments-competitive-landscape-analysis-301078785.html">$11.52 billion in 2023</a>, with Europe, IKEA’s home territory, leading the way, which makes it easier for the company to integrate this sector into its current BoKlok partnership with Skanska.</p>



<h3>3. the Smart Home</h3>



<p>In more recent years, IKEA added smart home products in its catalogue. While the company was relatively late to the party, today the IKEA customer has a number of functional smart products to choose from and which can be easily connected through the IKEA Home smart app, as well as other third-party applications. In typical IKEA fashion, its mantra of ‘making not using space’, the company did not just copy other smart appliances – IKEA’s wireless chargers can be integrated into furniture, and a SONOS Bluetooth speaker is produced either as a bookshelf or as a lamp, and both work with Google Assistant, Alexa, and Siri voice assistants. This is certainly an area were IKEA will be looking to improve on. By creating its own smart technology as an integrated part of its furniture, the company would be able to get a better understanding of how its products are being used, for how long, and can even signal to the owner when that furniture needs repairing or replacing.</p>



<div id="w-node-55f2fdd96208"><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9dc8a1a036811f1b6788fb/5f9eb99d04c5930384f862ec_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252Fe8f7e7b8-c1c0-42f4-825c-24b79e539dea_970x646.jpeg?w=640&amp;ssl=1" alt="The Review: Is the New Ikea x Sonos Speaker Worth It? - Western Living  Magazine" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>A series of projects called ‘<a href="https://www.everydayexperiments.com/">Everyday Experiments</a>’, by SPACE10, continue on this trend of making sure that the smart appliances being created are beneficial to the consumer. These experiments recognise the increasing multi-dimensional use of one’s house, from living quarters, to play areas, to work stations. The latter is an increasingly important part of one’s home, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. Smart improvements to the house have to respect the serenity one looks for in a home, making life easier and more comfortable, while avoiding adding further technological distractions. There are also, of course, privacy issues when it comes to smart furniture or appliances, so IKEA would also be wary of further technological intrusiveness on its customers.</p>



<p>Some of these experiments are more likely to be used in everyday situations than others, such as the one using <a href="https://www.everydayexperiments.com/light-gestures">hand gestures</a> to control a light fitting, making it easier for someone to switch on/off or dim the lights without having to move.</p>

<p>While IKEA might need to collaborate with other technological companies, such as SONOS, and depend on Google, Amazon, and Apple for voice assistants in order to grow its smart ecosystem in the short term, its better understanding of the home and what tenants want from it, allow IKEA to be in a position to create superior, practical smart appliances, than other companies in the field. Björn Block, Business Leader at IKEA Home Smart, himself <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/18/21024497/ikea-smart-home-tech-sweden-furniture-sonos-meatballs-bjorn-block">said that</a>:</p>



<p>“We’re (<em>IKEA</em>) definitely into the tech space, we’re into the digital space, and we really want to be here and really play this because I think that we can also make a difference.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div><p>The 250 US federal agencies and businesses that fell victim to the recent cyber attack had one thing in common – they all used software provided by SolarWinds Worldwide, LLC (“SolarWinds”).&nbsp; TermScout – a software contract rating company –&nbsp; looked at the standard customer contract that SolarWinds customers are asked to sign – the <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/-/media/solarwinds/swdcv2/legal/legal-documents/solarwinds-software-services-agreement.ashx?la=en&amp;hash=C9D4ACDBAE48680890EF52C6E4663B0C9208F341">Software Services Agreement</a> (“SSA”).&nbsp; In this article, we explore what the SSA says about how risk is allocated between SolarWinds and its customers in this type of event, assuming a customer is able to prove that SolarWinds is liable, under breach of contract or some other theory.</p><p><span>[TermScout is not commenting on whether or not SolarWinds is liable or responsible for this breach.&nbsp; This article is purely a hypothetical analysis that analyzes how the SSA purports to allocate risk on such matters.]</span></p><h2>Overall</h2><p>While the SSA does commit SolarWinds to basic data security standards (see Data Security Commitments below), the limits on SolarWinds’ liability will likely keep most customers from recovering any or all of their damages, even if they’re able to prove that SolarWinds breached the agreement or otherwise would be liable (i.e. under another theory such as tort).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>SolarWinds’ total liability for direct damages is capped at the amount paid or payable by the customer in the last 12 months, and SolarWinds is not liable for any type of indirect damages.&nbsp; Notably, there are no exceptions to these limits on SolarWinds’ liability.&nbsp; This means that even if a customer that signed the SSA can prove that SolarWinds is liable for damages the customer suffers as a result of this breach, it is unlikely to recover more than 12 months’ worth of fees.</p><p>While capping liability at 12 months’ fees is very common (<a href="https://termscout.com/contract-comparison/incident-management-software">all 3 companies TermScout has reviewed in the Incident Management Software category</a> (“IMS”) do this), failing to carve out any exceptions from the limits is uncommon, and is one of many red flags that TermScout tracks.&nbsp; The other 2 IMS companies reviewed carve out liabilities related to third party IP infringement, but none carve out liabilities related to data security or data breach issues. &nbsp; While this approach is not uncommon, we are seeing more and more companies accept increased liability for violating their data security commitments.&nbsp; <a href="https://termscout.com/contract-review/cloud-platform-as-a-service-paas-software/snowflake">Snowflake</a>, for example, doubles the amount a customer can recover for data security-related issues – to 2 times 12 months’ fees [12(c), <span><a href="https://1amiydhcmj36tz3733v94f15-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/2019Aug23-Snowflake-Terms-of-Service-eo.pdf">Snowflake’s TOS</a>]</span>.</p><p>Taking into account the above factors and a number of other considerations, <a href="https://termscout.com/contract-review/primary-comparison/solarwinds#methodology">SolarWinds’ SSA earned the TermScout overall rating of <strong>Extremely</strong> <strong>Unfavorable</strong></a> – the worst of the 3 IMS companies we have reviewed.</p><h2>Data Security Commitments</h2><p>For every software contract TermScout looks at, it answers the data-security questions shown in the table below, among others.&nbsp; This data, along with similar data from 17 other contractual topics (e.g., limits on liability, indemnification, etc.), is used to calculate overall contract favorability so that TermScout customers can quickly understand the level of risk they take on when signing new contracts (<span>Learn more about TermScout’s methodology </span><a href="https://pages.termscout.com/methodology/"><span>here</span></a>).</p><p>TermScout considers the following to be basic minimum requirements that customers look for in contracts – customers with leverage or heightened data risks may seek stronger protections.</p><table id="tablepress-2"><thead><tr><th>Question</th><th>SolarWinds SSA</th><th>Citation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Does the vendor make any contractually binding commitments with respect to its data security standards or practices?</td><td>Yes, to “maintain appropriate administrative, physical, technical and organizational measures that ensure an appropriate level of security for Confidential Information and Personal Data.”</td><td>7.2, SSA</td></tr><tr><td>Which third party data security audits, standards, or certifications does the vendor commit to?</td><td>EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework</td><td>Privacy Shield, Privacy Notice (1)</td></tr><tr><td>Does the contract provide a list of subprocessors?</td><td>Yes</td><td>5.2, DPA (2)</td></tr><tr><td>Does the vendor commit to ensuring that its sub-processors will be bound by the same or similar data or privacy commitments as those contained in the contract?</td><td>Yes</td><td>5.2, DPA</td></tr><tr><td>Does the vendor commit to any form of data breach notification policy?</td><td>Yes</td><td>7, DPA</td></tr><tr><td>Are claims related to any form of data security issues excluded from the limits on Vendor’s liability?</td><td>No</td><td>11, SSA</td></tr></tbody></table><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://pages.termscout.com/wp-content/uploads/Solarwind-Footnotes.png" alt="" width="777" height="64" srcset="https://pages.termscout.com/wp-content/uploads/Solarwind-Footnotes.png 777w, https://pages.termscout.com/wp-content/uploads/Solarwind-Footnotes-480x40.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 777px, 100vw"></p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Customers that signed the SolarWinds standard SSA will have limited rights of recovery.&nbsp; Many companies still sign software agreements and other click-throughs without any form of review, rolling the dice with unknown risks and granting vendors carte blanche to write the rules of engagement unchecked.</p><p>TermScout helps companies quickly assess risk in contracts so that customers can easily understand what they’re signing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>By: Otto Hanson, Founder &amp;

<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://outlookzen.com/2015/05/25/avoiding-the-next-financial-meltdown/" target="_blank">In past articles</a>, we have discussed how big-corporations, particularly in the financial industry, put at risk our economy and financial system. Recent events around Gamestop trading, have served as a perfect illustration of the risks and dangers inherent to Big Banks.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Context:</strong> There has recently been <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze" target="_blank">a frenzy of trading activity in shares of Gamestop</a>. Once languishing in the doldrums, its shares attracted large numbers of short-sellers from institutional investors, particularly hedge funds. At some point, mom-and-pop retail investors realized that they had a big opportunity in front of them. First, they argued that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZTr1-Gp74U&amp;ab_channel=RoaringKitty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the fundamentals of the business were being underestimated</a> (just like themselves) by the financial elites. Second, they noticed that with such huge short-sale positions, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/gamestop-mania-explained-how-the-reddit-retail-trading-crowd-ran-over-wall-street-pros.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the short-sellers would be made tremendously vulnerable if the shares were to appreciate in value</a> – which would in turn drive up the share price even more. Championed by a hitherto unknown “Roaring Kitty aka /u/DeepFuckingValue”, these mom-and-pop investors bet big on Gamestop shares, sending the stock price soaring.</p>



<p>As expected, the hedge funds and other financial elites who had made the opposite bet, found themselves in hot water. At the start of trading on Thursday, they faced the prospect of tremendous losses, if Gamestop shares were to continue appreciating. As feared, the shares came roaring out of the gate – jumping from $260 to $468, in the first 30 minutes alone. And that is when rules of the game changed. </p>



<p>Robinhood, the most popular trading platform for mom-and-pop investors, announced right at this critical point, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that its investors would no longer be allowed to buy Gamestop shares</a>. Not even with their own money. Most telling, they were still allowed to sell their shares, but they certainly weren’t allowed to buy any. The upward trajectory was immediately halted, and <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/chart?p=GME#eyJpbnRlcnZhbCI6MSwicGVyaW9kaWNpdHkiOjEsImNhbmRsZVdpZHRoIjozLjU4OTE3MTk3NDUyMjI5Mywidm9sdW1lVW5kZXJsYXkiOnRydWUsImFkaiI6dHJ1ZSwiY3Jvc3NoYWlyIjp0cnVlLCJjaGFydFR5cGUiOiJsaW5lIiwiZXh0ZW5kZWQiOmZhbHNlLCJtYXJrZXRTZXNzaW9ucyI6e30sImFnZ3JlZ2F0aW9uVHlwZSI6Im9obGMiLCJjaGFydFNjYWxlIjoibGluZWFyIiwicGFuZWxzIjp7ImNoYXJ0Ijp7InBlcmNlbnQiOjEsImRpc3BsYXkiOiJHTUUiLCJjaGFydE5hbWUiOiJjaGFydCIsImluZGV4IjowLCJ5QXhpcyI6eyJuYW1lIjoiY2hhcnQiLCJwb3NpdGlvbiI6bnVsbH0sInlheGlzTEhTIjpbXSwieWF4aXNSSFMiOlsiY2hhcnQiLCJ2b2wgdW5kciJdfX0sImxpbmVXaWR0aCI6Miwic3RyaXBlZEJhY2tncm91bmQiOnRydWUsImV2ZW50cyI6dHJ1ZSwiY29sb3IiOiIjMDA4MWYyIiwic3RyaXBlZEJhY2tncm91ZCI6dHJ1ZSwiZXZlbnRNYXAiOnsiY29ycG9yYXRlIjp7ImRpdnMiOnRydWUsInNwbGl0cyI6dHJ1ZX0sInNpZ0RldiI6e319LCJjdXN0b21SYW5nZSI6eyJzdGFydCI6MTYxMTg0NDIwMDAwMCwiZW5kIjoxNjExODY3NTQwMDAwfSwic3ltYm9scyI6W3sic3ltYm9sIjoiR01FIiwic3ltYm9sT2JqZWN0Ijp7InN5bWJvbCI6IkdNRSIsInF1b3RlVHlwZSI6IkVRVUlUWSIsImV4Y2hhbmdlVGltZVpvbmUiOiJBbWVyaWNhL05ld19Zb3JrIn0sInBlcmlvZGljaXR5IjoxLCJpbnRlcnZhbCI6MSwidGltZVVuaXQiOiJtaW51dGUifV0sInN0dWRpZXMiOnsidm9sIHVuZHIiOnsidHlwZSI6InZvbCB1bmRyIiwiaW5wdXRzIjp7ImlkIjoidm9sIHVuZHIiLCJkaXNwbGF5Ijoidm9sIHVuZHIifSwib3V0cHV0cyI6eyJVcCBWb2x1bWUiOiIjMDBiMDYxIiwiRG93biBWb2x1bWUiOiIjRkYzMzNBIn0sInBhbmVsIjoiY2hhcnQiLCJwYXJhbWV0ZXJzIjp7IndpZHRoRmFjdG9yIjowLjQ1LCJjaGFydE5hbWUiOiJjaGFydCIsInBhbmVsTmFtZSI6ImNoYXJ0In19fSwidGltZVVuaXQiOiJtaW51dGUiLCJyYW5nZSI6eyJkdExlZnQiOiIyMDIxLTAxLTI4VDA1OjAwOjAwLjgwNVoiLCJkdFJpZ2h0IjoiMjAyMS0wMS0yOVQwNDo1OTowMC44MDVaIiwicGVyaW9kaWNpdHkiOnsiaW50ZXJ2YWwiOjEsInBlcmlvZCI6MSwidGltZVVuaXQiOiJtaW51dGUifSwicGFkZGluZyI6MH19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the share price collapsed from $468 to $130, within a couple hours</a>.

<p><strong>Within hours</strong>, Robinhood found themselves under a huge magnifying glass. Politicians as divided as AOC, Ted Cruz and <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2021/01/28/elizabeth-warren-gamestop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elizabeth Warren</a>, all protested the flagrant unfairness of what was happening to mom-and-pop investors. There were <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/28/investing/lawsuit-robinhood-gamestop-wallstreetbets/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">countless lawsuits filed</a>, and wide-ranging calls for <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/sec-reviewing-recent-trading-volatility-amid-gamestop-frenzy-vows-to-protect-retail-investors.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the SEC to investigate what had occurred</a>. But this was only the tip of the iceberg. Soon, a more dangerous story emerged.</p>

<p>Apparently, Robinhood’s biggest customer, source of revenue, and the firm that processes a lot of their user’s trades, <strong>is the same firm</strong> that has also bailed out the original Gamestop short seller, manages $35B in investments, and has a financial stake in driving down Gamestop’s share price. With incentives like these, it’s hardly surprising if Robinhood’s restrictions were motivated by Citadel’s larger agenda of depressing the share price, and the levers they have available to pull.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Let me be clear</strong> about one thing. I am not here to convict Citadel or Robinhood of any crimes. At this point, far more investigation is required, before we can reach any conclusions on what exactly happened.</p>



<p>That said, any clear eyed view of the above chain of events, can only reach one conclusion. Our current financial and economic system is dangerously suspect. Imagine a world where your doctor has bet a million dollars on you dying soon. Imagine a world where a criminal suspect’s parent is made lead investigator in the case. Regardless of whether these individuals acted inappropriately, any competent person would realize that the system is dangerously broken.</p>



<p><em>When people repeatedly face conflicts of interest, they will eventually behave unethically to further their own interests</em>. When you have a single firm that takes long-term investment stakes, while simultaneously facilitating retail trading activity as a market-maker and paying retail brokerage firms tens of millions of dollars, unethical behavior will inevitably happen. Trying to plug these leaks as and when they happen, investigating every individual case one-by-one, is simply a never ending game of whack-a-mole.</p>



<p>Our economy is fundamentally rigged in favor of big-corporations, and stop-gap solutions will simply not do. The only way to attack the problem is to go to the very source. <strong>We need to break up the big Corporations</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We need to break them up into discrete businesses. Each with their own independent CEO and board-of-directors. Each pursuing a single line-of-business. Each free from any conflict of interests, and potential for collusion. Each large enough to run their own business successfully and efficiently, but small enough that they don’t have the power to bribe Congress, bully smaller competitors, collude across different market segments, and rewrite the rules of the game. Each operating independently, in a free and competitive market.</p>



<p>Big corporations are fundamentally antithetical to a level playing field. It is time we broke them up.</p>

    <section>
      <p>I’ve long felt the same way about personal computers that Matt Crawford feels about cars: &nbsp;it is important to build your own PC so that you can have more control over a technology that you use every day.</p><p>I have been building my own PCs since the mid-1990s, when I put together my first machine using a NexGen Intel-clone processor. &nbsp;Since then I have not bought a whole PC; when I want better performance, I simply add more memory, put in new hard disks, upgrade the graphics card, or swap out the motherboard and CPU.</p><p>Windows-based computers are not hard to build. &nbsp;You just buy the parts—motherboard, CPU, memory, disk storage, a case, monitor and graphics card, and plug them together. &nbsp;There are a number of little tricks you learn along the way, like properly seating the cooling fan on top of the microprocessor, or inserting the memory sticks into their sockets the right way. &nbsp;But PCs are highly modular and standardized, and the standards don’t shift that often—from SCSI connectors to SATA, or from DDR3 to DDR4, or DVI to DisplayPort to connect the monitor. &nbsp;You just need to keep straight what the current standards are, and buy accordingly.</p><figure><img src="https://www.americanpurpose.com/content/images/2021/01/IMG_4043.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.americanpurpose.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/IMG_4043.jpg 600w, https://www.americanpurpose.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/IMG_4043.jpg 1000w, https://www.americanpurpose.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/IMG_4043.jpg 1600w, https://www.americanpurpose.com/content/images/2021/01/IMG_4043.jpg 2016w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Getting ready for a build</figcaption></figure><p>Building your own machine has quite a number of advantages. &nbsp;You can customize them to exactly the uses you intend. Not everyone is a gamer who requires a humongous 16GB graphics card. &nbsp;You can get away with a rather modest machine if you’re just trying to create a home entertainment system. &nbsp;You can put your computer in a nice case that will fit easily on your desk. Recently I’ve taken to using a $50 Raspberry Pi-based computer to read the newspaper in the morning. &nbsp;In recent years AMD has pulled ahead of Intel in the CPU wars; why not shift over to their chips? &nbsp;Maintenance is much easier: computers, like human beings, seldom fail as complete systems; rather, an individual component goes on the fritz and needs to be replaced. &nbsp;Because something has failed on your motherboard does not mean you need to replace your keyboard, mouse, and monitor. &nbsp;If you have built your own machine, you can usually diagnose a problem down the road. &nbsp;For example, if you don’t hear the little “beep” when you turn it on, you know the machine has failed to post and that there’s something wrong with your BIOS. On the other hand, if it posts but hangs up when loading Windows, you suspect your copy of the operating system has been corrupted and needs to be reinstalled.</p><p>From the standpoint of someone who wants to maximize their technological autonomy, Apple computers are an absolute nightmare. &nbsp;Although I still own an Apple laptop, I seldom use it and definitely do not love my iPhone. &nbsp;Apple products were deliberately designed to prevent their users from modifying them, down to the use of proprietary fasteners that require special Apple-only tools. &nbsp;I tried to get into an old Mac laptop with my sons a few years ago; we ended up with a lot of useless bent metal trying to force our way in. &nbsp;Apple does not want you to be able to fix your own computer—rather, it wants you to visit the “Genius Bar” at the Apple Store and look over all the new products while you wait for someone to fix your machine in the back room. &nbsp;The “genius” refers not to you, the helpless customer, but to the marketing guy who thought up this system.</p><p>Apple is constantly making its users adopt proprietary connectors that you are forced to buy from them. &nbsp;An example is the “lightning” connector that was first introduced on the iPhone 7 and replaced the old 3.5mm headphone jack. &nbsp;Apple claims that this change was made to improve the user experience, but really they just want to force you to buy new headphones or adapters. &nbsp;They’ve similarly changed the plug on their power cords so often that you have to discard one from just a couple of years ago in favor of their most recent model. &nbsp;Landfills around the world are brimming with useless Apple power adapters.</p><p>Microsoft, as I well remember, tried to get away with something like this in the 1990s. &nbsp;The programming language Java had been created as a common, open standard that would operate across a variety of platforms—Macs, PCs, Linux, and so on. &nbsp;Microsoft then tried to “fork” the language and create a version that would only run on its own machines, which it could do because so many people used Windows PCs. &nbsp;This became part of the Justice Department’s decade-long antitrust suit against Microsoft, which in the end forced the latter to stand down.</p><p>You can only get away with this sort of behavior if you hold a near-monopolistic position in the marketplace, and the huge scale of tech companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, and Amazon has become a major challenge for our democracy. Unfortunately, after the Microsoft case, the U.S. stopped trying to enforce antitrust laws against Big Tech. This is a pattern that has only recently been reversed.</p><p>So learning to build your own computer reduces your acquisition costs, keeps down operating expenses, means that you can fix your machine when it breaks down on a weekend, and otherwise gives you the satisfaction of knowing exactly what’s under the hood of your computer. &nbsp;You’ve clawed back a little bit of personal autonomy.</p>

			<p><span>U</span>nder a coral ledge, a day octopus and a brown-marbled grouper meet. The grouper was there first, as if waiting, and they emerge together; the octopus zips ahead, skin turning from deep scarlet to purple-blue, and arrives at a boulder. Beneath the boulder is a hollow, a perfect hiding place for small prey. The octopus’s skin flickers and momentarily resembles the grouper’s own mottled scales before reverting to blue. They converge side-by-side in front of the hollow, seeming to consider it.</p> <p>Again the octopus’ skin mottles, and then again, the second time not much resembling the grouper’s patterns but rather a constellation of lights. The octopus swims to the boulder’s far side and makes a barrier with tentacles now spread flat and turned white. The grouper dives into the hollow, looking for fish whose escape routes have been blocked. Never mind the 500-million-year taxonomic gulf that separates them. Hunger, opportunity, and smarts cross that divide easily, hinting at adaptations that could help these unlikely partners navigate lean years ahead and providing an interspecies union to tickle human imaginations.</p> <p>“Crossing a phylum gap like this is almost like a human talking to a snail,” says Daniel Bayley, a marine biologist at University College London. “It’s amazing to watch.” Bayley and Amelia Rose of Oxford University observed octopuses working with brown-marbled grouper—and with peacock grouper and gold-saddle goatfish, too—in sunlit shallows off atolls in the northern Chagos Archipelago, a remote chain of islands in the Indian Ocean. The incidents caught their attention: While multispecies associations are not uncommon in the animal kingdom, it’s unusual to see such them between such different creatures. What’s more, this was a true collaboration.</p>  <figure><iframe width="733" height="412" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m7Ql6CPiGPw?c frameborder=" 0"="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption><span>Daniel Bayley</span></figcaption></figure> <p>The animals were not merely taking advantage of the other’s activities, as happens when fish follow turtles across the seafloor, snapping up critters scattered by their sediment-disturbing foraging. They actively communicated with one another—not unlike <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2020/02/coyote-badger-video-behavior-friends/" target="_blank">the coyote and badger</a> who starred in a viral video last year, with the coyote making a distinctive canine play bow to invite the badger along. There’s a lot of cognitive sophistication packed into such interactions.</p> <p>That octopuses would be involved is likely no surprise for people attuned to a cephalopod-celebrating <i>zeitgeist</i> inspired by books like Sy Montgomery’s best-selling <i>The Soul of an Octopus</i> and the wildly popular documentary <i>My Octopus Teacher</i>, which showed marvelous behaviors that had yet to be described scientifically: an octopus camouflaging herself with seashells, or playing with schools of fish. Popular footage likewise preceded description with octopus-grouper unions <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5072371/Blue-Planet-fish-octopus-clever-chimps.html" target="_blank">featured in the <i>Blue Planet II</i></a> television series and in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=octopus++and+grouper" target="_blank">a handful of YouTube videos</a>. In the Chagos Archipelago, though, Bayley and Rose had the chance to observe the collaborations in detail.</p><blockquote><p>If you think about it, that’s like us speaking to fish.</p> </blockquote><p><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10236244.2020.1746658?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true" target="_blank">As they recount in a study</a> published in the journal <i>Marine and Freshwater Behaviour and Physiology</i>, the researchers even started to decipher some of the signals. When octopuses preceded the hunt with what Bayley and Rose called a “pounce” gesture, engulfing corals with their mantle and turning white, it was their fish partners who ate. When instead octopuses made a “groping” gesture, inserting tentacles into a crack or crevice, it was their turn to dine. “It was very much a give-and-take scenario,” Bayley said. Other gestures and skin-pattern signals remain uninterpreted. (Bayley and Rose did not observe octopuses&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/12/24/950143025/watch-octopuses-punch-fish-sometimes-for-no-apparent-reason" target="_blank">“punching” their partners</a>, as another team of researchers recently documented in the Red Sea.)<br></p> <p>Asked to review the footage, Culum Brown, a behavioral ecologist at Macquarie University who specializes in fish intelligence, said “they are clearly communicating with one another.” Brown, who agrees that the hunts are planned, is curious how about how they’re initiated. Do octopuses give the go-ahead? Or fish? And how are partners chosen? Brown pointed to research on groupers cooperating with moray eels to hunt. Those fish <a href="https://www.wired.com/?p=1534651" target="_blank">select the most competent eels</a>, demonstrating a collaborative sophistication once thought limited to humans and certain primates. He also noted that, while octopuses seemed to take the lead, the collaborations seen by Bayley and Rose demand quite a bit of intelligence from the fish as well.</p><div>

</div> <p>Bayley’s own specialty is coral reef ecology, and his curiosity is piqued by what the cooperation represents. Though scientists have studied the Chagos Archipelago for decades, he said, no record exists of octopuses and fish hunting together there. He suspects it’s a recent adaptation. In the last several years, climate change-induced coral die-offs have radically disrupted the reefs’ animal populations and changed their very topography. There is much less prey than before; fields of rubble are not ideal for ambush-style hunting tactics that once worked so well.</p> <p>“This could be driving this novel interaction where both fish and octopus are searching for food, but their individual hunting strategies are not best for this flattened environment that’s losing a lot of its structure,” Bayley explained. Partnerships with gold-saddle goatfish are also notable in that they are adapted to find prey buried in sediment. “It’s another skill set to bring in. It’s almost like the octopus is assembling a team with specialist skills,” said Bayley.</p> <p>Another fascinating question, he said, is how knowledge spreads of hunting strategies and mutually understood signals. Perhaps each participating octopus and fish works it out for themselves, through trial and error—or perhaps, following an initial breakthrough, knowledge spreads by observation or even active teaching. That would make it a cultural adaptation, a matter of accumulating knowledge passed between generations, an example of species surviving in a fast-changing world not because of some fortunate genetic mutation but because they are learning. This also suggests a potentially key role for grouper. Unlike day octopuses, who reach a ripe old age at 15 months, brown-marbled and peacock grouper can easily live 40 years or longer. They may be a living library for their short-lived partners.</p> <p>That the Chagos Archipelago is so remote and well-protected—commercial fishing is banned there—may also help these underwater cultures evolve and proliferate, Bayley said. Individuals who would otherwise spread their knowledge don’t end up on a dinner plate. Brown agreed, noting an emerging scientific literature on <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6431/1032.summary" target="_blank">the importance of animal culture to conservation</a> and also the hypothesis that a loss of culture has hindered the recovery of some populations from overfishing. “One of the explanations is that we’ve basically fished out the cultural information about where to forage, where to migrate, where the best breeding grounds are,” he said. “If you’re consistently removing the biggest, the oldest and wisest, from the population, then that information is lost.”</p> <p>That understanding adds new importance to halting overfishing, and also to curbing pollution and excessive underwater noise that can impair learning, in other parts of the ocean—and maybe the sheer wonder of watching octopuses and fish work together can help inspire people to take action. Brown, echoing Bayley, marveled at the cross-phylum communication. “If you think about it, that’s like us speaking to fish,” said Brown, who could not think of an example of humans communicating in such a sophisticated manner with either fish or cephalopods. The closest analogue is people and their dogs. “It’s pretty astonishing,” he said.</p>  <p><i>Brandon Keim (<a href="https://twitter.com/9brandon" target="_blank">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.instagram.com/9brandon/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>) is a science and nature journalist.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><img alt="rails saml abstract" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/4e19e5a1a96df85fc6b0aedeb7ec10a2947d23e7/44b01/img/railssaml.jpg"><h3>SAML Background<a href="#saml-background" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>SAML SSO refers to an authentication mechanism preferred by enterprise companies. The SSO part stands for Single Sign-On. From the enterprise’s perspective, they desire a centralized service where their employees can authenticate, which then provides authenticated access to the applications they use for work. These services are called Identity Providers (IDPs), and they are the <em>Single</em> place where enterprise employees <em>Sign-On.</em> This is an alternative to employees using password-based authentication for each of the various applications they use.</p><p>The SAML part stands for Secure Assertion Markup Language. SAML utilizes a domain-specific flavor of XML that describes an authenticated user, encoded to a string and passed to your application in a query parameter. Your application decodes the <code>SAMLResponse</code> using a key that the enterprise provides to you.</p><p>The details of the SAML Response are less important than understanding the general flow. When a user wants to sign in using SAML, you must send that user to their Identity Provider with a <code>SAMLRequest</code> that identifies your application. The user signs in to their IDP, and is redirected back to you with the <code>SAMLResponse</code>. What makes this a tiny bit complicated for a multi-tenant application is routing the user to the correct IDP, as SAML SSO breaks our common understanding of a login flow.</p><p>A typical login screen might have an email and password field, then a few buttons to sign in with OAuth services, like Google or GitHub. But now, you’ll need to gather something from the user who wants to sign in such that you can send them to the correct IDP instance.  We like to say that SAML is <em>instance based</em>, especially when <a href="https://ossoapp.com/blog/saml-vs-oauth">compared to OAuth</a>, which we can think of as <em>class based</em>. Domain is a common key for this process - you can ask a user for their email, grab the domain, and use that as a key to find the correct IDP instance and redirect the user.</p><h3>Let’s Build and Iterate<a href="#lets-build-and-iterate" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Once you wrap your head around understanding the SAML flow, it’s really not challenging to implement SAML in a Rails app - IDPs themselves offer great open source libraries to help with your integration. You can definitely get very far in a day or two. But like most things in engineering, the last 10% can take 90% of the effort, and while we all love to say “I could build that in a weekend,” we often later eat our words when we realize all of the edge cases, documentation needs, scaling challenges and unknown unknowns that make this or any other project worth doing a bit more involved than a quick weekend hack.</p><p>I’m a co-founder of an open source company Osso - our microservice is a Ruby and React app that allows you to onboard SAML SSO customers, generates custom documentation for each customer to perform their onboarding tasks in their IDP, and allows your Rails app to consume Osso using OAuth - we even provide <code>omniauth-osso</code> to make consuming an Osso instance from your Rails app incredibly simple.</p><p>Osso also offers paid plans, and you can skip right to our <a href="https://ossoapp.com/pricing">pricing page</a> to learn more about hosted Osso if you need SAML yesterday. Or you can jump right in to <a href="https://ossoapp.com/docs/deploy/overview">deploying an open source Osso instance</a> from our GitHub repo. There’s certainly the possibility of using <code>osso-rb</code> in your Rails app directly — you’ll want to mount our 3 rack based apps, pull in migrations, etc. — but this post will focus instead on a microservices approach.</p><p><strong>So</strong>, if you’d like to begin from first principles, follow along here as we build up a production-ready SAML SSO integration, starting with a single tenant approach, then layering in multi-tenancy. Once we have multi-tenant support, we’ll address questions about scalability and serviceability — how can we repeatedly add additional tenants, without spending significant engineering or customer support cycles? I <em>will</em> encourage you to use Osso, and show you exactly how, but will also highlight the things you need to be considering in order to roll out a production ready SAML integration <em>without</em> Osso.</p><p>We’ll use a single Rails app repository throughout this tutorial. The <a href="https://github.com/enterprise-oss/saml-rails" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">main branch</a> is a barebones Rails 6 app with Devise and a User model, and for each of our steps below we’ll move to a feature branch so we can see a full diff. Each step adds more functionality, getting you closer to a production-ready, multi-tenant integration. Each step also uses open source software, where the library used in the previous step is a dependency of the next step’s library. Neat!</p><p>We’ll also make use of Osso’s <a href="https://github.com/enterprise-oss/sinatra-ruby-idp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mock IDP</a> and <a href="https://demo.ossoapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demo instance</a>, especially when we get into multi-tenancy. You’ll still want to register with an IDP for a developer account in order to have access to an IDP for a second tenant - we recommend an <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Okta developer account</a>.</p><h3>Base Rails application<a href="#base-rails-application" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>We’ll use the same Rails 6 application for each step - the source code is available [here] (<a href="https://github.com/enterprise-oss/saml-rails" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/enterprise-oss/saml-rails</a>). The <code>main</code> branch adds Devise with a User model to a brand new Rails app using Postgres as the database. The application doesn’t do anything - there is an index route and a logged in route that will tell you the email for the current user. This guide assumes proficiency with Rails, so it will skip some details. We’ll also use some intentionally naive approaches to demonstrate common challenges of SAML SSO. </p><h3>Single tenant<a href="#single-tenant" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><h4>With ruby-saml and mock IDP<a href="#with-ruby-saml-and-mock-idp" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>My first experience with SAML was working on <a href="https://medium.com/@tsharon/democratizing-ux-670b95fbc07f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internal software at WeWork</a> where one of my Osso co-founders was a teammate. The IT department required us to use SAML SSO, which I at first was awfully annoyed by. Google OAuth was super easy, and could be restricted to domain, so what’s the deal with this OneLogin thing? Fortunately, single-tenant SAML was just as simple to implement, and admittedly did include some better security. This is a common situation — an enterprise company requires SAML, and it might seem silly to you, but them’s the rules.</p><p>Our project was a Rails app, and we used a Ruby gem from OneLogin to handle the actual SAML encoding and decoding. Since we were building this app for WeWork employees, we had a single tenant, and didn’t need to worry about implementing a scalable solution for multiple tenants, documenting how to set SAML up for the app or training our teammates on how it worked. We also didn’t need to change our login form - we knew every user would be sent to the same IDP instance, so we were able to use a simple <em>Sign in With OneLogin</em> button.</p><p>That’s what we’ll do here, and if you’re building internal software this will be a fine approach for your production release! We’ll use Osso’s mock IDP for this single tenant to keep things simple too.</p><p>First lets install the ruby-saml gem. We’ll include it in our Gemfile and run <code>$ bundle install</code>.</p><p>We’ll use this library in two ways:</p><p>First, when a user wishes to sign in with SAML, we use ruby-saml to generate a url with a <code>SAMLRequest</code> - the URL is where we will send the user to sign in, and the <code>SAMLRequest</code> is sent along as a query param in order to identify our application to the IDP.</p><p>When the user signs in to their IDP, they will be sent back to your application with a <code>SAMLResponse</code> query param. We then use ruby-saml to decode and validate the <code>SAMLResponse</code>, allowing us to access information describing the user, such as their email address.</p><p>Lets define a couple of routes and controller actions to handle this flow.</p><p>In the <code>saml_login</code> action, we create a <code>OneLogin::RubySaml::Authrequest</code> and redirect to the return value. Later, in the callback, we validate and decode the response, and will sign the user in and redirect them if valid. Otherwise we’ll raise the validation errors to understand where our SAML config went wrong.</p><p>This callback route will also need to accept a POST request with <code>www-url-form-encoded</code> parameters, so you will need to skip the Rails <code>verify_authenticity_token</code> <code>before_action</code>:</p><div><p>app/controllers/application_controller.rb</p></div><p>Both of these actions depend on what ruby-saml calls <code>settings</code>. These values are created via the configuration you must perform between your application and the Identity Provider. In a real-world example, your application generates a few values which you provide to your customer. The customer uses these to configure your application in their IDP and returns some data generated by the IDP. We’ll discuss this process in more detail later. Since we are using the Osso Mock IDP we can mostly skip this configuration step, but it’s worth understanding what each of these values represents, how it functions and why it might prevent your user from signing in if misconfigured.</p><p>Each of the controller actions above calls a private method <code>saml_settings</code>. Since we are dealing with a single tenant, we will essentially hardcode the SAML configuration values to support this one IDP instance.</p><div><p>app/controllers/application_controller.rb</p></div><p><strong>Values you provide</strong></p><p><strong>ACS URL</strong> - The Assertion Consumer Service URL is where the IDP will send the user with a SAMLResponse when they log in. Similar to a Redirect URI in OAuth, your application will generate this value according to how your routes are set up.</p><p><strong>SP Entity ID</strong>  - Sometimes called the Audience URI, this is a unique identifier for the tenant in your application. This can get hairy! <strong>Google</strong> requires that they be unique for a customer, so you can't just use domain, while <strong>Azure</strong> won't let you use a UUID and <strong>Ping</strong> won't let you use a url. Those are just <em>some</em> of the edge cases we've found!</p><p><strong>Values the IDP provides</strong></p><p><strong>IDP SSO Target URL</strong> - The single sign on target URL tells your application where to send a user with a <code>SAMLRequest</code> in order to sign in.</p><p><strong>IDP Certificate</strong> - An x509 certificate which includes a public key that your application uses to encode and decode the SAML request and response.</p><p>Since we are using the Mock IDP, these values can be found in the Mock IDP’s federated metadata: <a href="https://github.com/enterprise-oss/sinatra-ruby-idp/blob/main/metadata.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/enterprise-oss/sinatra-ruby-idp/blob/main/metadata.xml</a></p><p>To enforce good security practices, we put the certificate in Rails credentials. We won't show you our whole certificate here, but here's part of an …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After the privacy related changes to WhatsApp, a lot of people are fleeing this popular chat application for other more privacy-aware choices. This development, made me consider Signal, again, as a chat service, but my decision to install it and try to move my contacts was <strong>not a privacy related one</strong>.</p><p>In Greece where me and most of my contacts live, WhatsApp isn’t as popular as Facebook’s Messenger, an app that lacks end-to-end encryption and as a result is considerably worse privacy-wise.</p><p>End-to-end encryption is a technical measure, implemented to make eavesdropping on your chat conversations impossible. It encrypts your messages from the moment they leave your device, till the moment they are received by your friend’s phone. In this way, nobody can use your conversations to sell your information to advertisers and no rogue government can read your messages to enforce laws. But for the average person living in a western democracy, who still (knowingly or unknowningly) uses Facebook and other ad-supported, privacy-invasive social networks, this feature is not as important as it seems.</p><p>Messenger, for me, is the best chat app in the world, because it has the only feature I need from a chat app. <strong>My contacts!</strong></p><p>If I want to contact somebody, I know that he will be there receiving my messages. This feature is enough for me to give up the promise of enchanced privacy.</p><p>It’s something different that should be more important.</p><h2 id="but-why-did-i-install-signal">But why did I install Signal?</h2><p>Although we feel that we can choose our chat service, the direct opposite happens. The best feature mainstream chat apps have, our contacts' usage of them, is the reason we are hostages to these applications. If we want to move to another chat application, we need to pursue all of our contacts to move. This is the great power Facebook is using irresponsibly.</p><p>This power is what takes away from us the right to choose who and why is using our data.</p><p>But more importantly, this power hinders innovation and progress. If a better chat application is released, then most people wouldn’t care to use it. That happens because it wouldn’t have the most important feature, their friends. Eventually, if this application is really better than the current offerings, the best features would be copied by the mainstream apps and the vicious cycle will continue.</p><p>Trying to go against this great power, I installed Signal. I chose Signal because it is in a way the direct opposite of what Facebook’s apps are. It is open-source, people can view and contribute to its code and it’s backed by a non-profit. It’s an app that implements changes based to what its community wants, it’s an app that can care about your opinion and your choices.</p><p><img src="https://chrispanag.com/posts/i-didnt-install-signal-for-privacy/signal-icon.jpg" alt="signal icon"></p><p>I immediately invited my closest contacts to join and… people joined, then agreed that this app is nice and afterwards nobody contacted me a second time through Signal. Everybody still used Messenger.</p><p>At the end, I completely understood their choice, or better, their <strong>lack of choice</strong>. If they wanted to keep in touch with their other friends, they still needed to use Messenger, and who wants to complicate their lives with multiple apps?</p><h2 id="at-the-end-what-can-we-do">At the end, what can we do?</h2><p>When the internet started proliferating, choice was one of its biggest advantages. We could choose the software we use, we could choose the services we access. But now, the massive social networks, with the power they have accumulated by our participation, have narrowed down our choices to the bare minimum.</p><p>The only way to change the situation is to force those social networks to use their powers more responsibly. Europe’s GDPR law with its <a href="https://www.privacypolicies.com/blog/gdpr-eight-user-rights/#6_The_Right_To_Data_Portability">right to data portability</a> is a step in the right direction, but it’s not enough. I believe we need more to regain our right to choose what services we use.</p><p>After portability, we need to discuss about <strong>interoperability</strong>, which in this case is the ability to contact people that are are using different chat applications than the one you are using. The way email and SMS already work.</p><p>Although this is still far-fetched, we need to finally start addressing it.</p><h2 id="further-reads">Further reads</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.jeremydormitzer.com/blog/what-is-activitypub.html">What is ActivityPub?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/signal-app-1148147/">Signal: What is it and why is everyone talking about it?</a></li></ul><h2 id="how-do-you-feel-about-the-right-to-choice">How do you feel about the right to choice?</h2><p>I would love to discuss more about it in the comments.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>I’m pleased to say, that M5Stack did it again. They managed to release another ESP32 based product and keep me on my tosies! From incredible small Atom (review pending), through most feature-packed M5StickC (<a href="https://notenoughtech.com/review/m5stickc-plus/">review</a>) to power development Fire Kit Core  (<a href="https://notenoughtech.com/review/this-esp32-is-on-fire-m5stack-core/">review</a>) – each product brought joy to my eyes despite being basically the same: an ESP32 based all-in-one development board. And they did it again thanks to <a href="https://m5stack.com/products/m5paper-esp32-development-kit-960x540-4-7-eink-display-235-ppi">M5Paper</a> – a unique mashup between ESP32 and e-ink displays.</p>



<h2>M5Paper – phone-size wonder</h2>

<p>It’s not the first ESP32 &amp; e-ink display combo, but it’s the first one I really wanted to have. Convincing M5Stack to send me one wasn’t the problem. The device is so high in demand, that I had to wait till Xmas to get mine. It is not just me that likes the concept. M5Paper is in stock right now, but if you are unlucky, it also surfaces on <a href="https://www.banggood.com/custlink/mDvdSKZvLF">Banggood</a> and <a href="https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_Af1yn5">AliExpress</a>.</p>



<p>M5Paper nails the design thanks to 4.7-inch, 940*540 multitouch 16 level grayscale e-ink display. It’s not just an e-ink ESP32 module, it’s a well-thought-through product that deserves everyone’s attention.  The phone form factor feels great in my hand and lightning-fast (for an e-ink) display creates this PDA alike impression. </p>




<h3>Inside M5Paper</h3>



<p>While the device doesn’t make it difficult to peak inside, M5Paper isn’t designed to be opened and tinkered with. You won’t find any hidden pins or ways to interact with the board, but there is enough space to swap the LiPo battery for a bigger one, in case 1150mAh isn’t enough. And you get 3 Grove connectors to plug external sensors and other fun add-ons. </p>

<p>Under the hood, M5Paper comes with a very familiar ESP32 module surrounded by pretty decent hardware – just take a look at the specs:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>SP32-D0WDQ6-V3</td><td>240MHz dual core, 600 DMIPS, 520KB SRAM, Wi-Fi, dual mode Bluetooth</td></tr><tr><td>Flash</td><td>16MB</td></tr><tr><td>PSRAM</td><td>8MB</td></tr><tr><td>Ports</td><td>TypeC*1, HY2.0-4P*3 , TF-card(microSD) slot</td></tr><tr><td>E-Ink Display</td><td>Model Number：EPD_ED047TC1 | 540*960@4.7″ | Grayscale : 16 Levels | Display area : 58.32*103.68mm | Display Driver : IT8951</td></tr><tr><td>Physical Button</td><td>Multi-function button*1 ， Reset Button*1</td></tr><tr><td>RTC</td><td>BM8563</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>It’s a very clever design to include BM8563 Real-Time Clock, as you can save a lot of power by using RTC to trigger the events rather than sleep policies of ESP32. Combined with the e-ink, M5Paper can last ages on a single charge. This is reinforced by the default firmware as well. The power button at the back of the device disables ESP32 when pressed and the “volume” rocker wakes it up when held for a couple of seconds. </p>




<h3>Putting “kindle” into M5Paper</h3>



<p>The device feels like a small-sized phone in the hand. It has just enough screen estate to break the development board impression and appear as intriguing “kindle” alike device. It’s not an e-reader, M5Paper is even more awesome. The display is simply perfect as far as e-inks go. 16 level greyscale enables images and advanced shading while multitouch (2-point) touchscreen is responsive enough, so I don’t hate using the onscreen keyboard. </p>

<p>Navigating through menus is fairly quick, and even though menus take 2-3 screen refresh cycles to fully materialise, you can quickly jump from screen to screen. Frankly speaking, I played with less responsive LCD screens in the past!</p>



<p>Just remember, there is no backlight. The device is perfectly visible in a full sunshine, but completely useless in the dark.</p>




<h3>The “I’m still all-in-one development board”</h3>



<p>It’s not the first take on e-ink display by M5Stack. They merged it before with their Core INK – an e-ink-equipped take on M5Stick series. Unlike <a href="https://m5stack.com/collections/m5-core/products/m5stack-esp32-core-ink-development-kit1-54-elnk-display?variant=37404426174636">Core INK</a>, M5Paper is missing one thing that I really liked – the ability to program the board in the web browser wirelessly. I can only hope that the support will be added soon, as programming M5Stack wirelessly feels like magic.</p>



<p>Update: 23/01/2021: Dev team from M5Stack had confirmed that integration for UIFlow is on the way, we should see M5Paper joining the UIFlow as well soon!</p>

<p>Just like other M5Stack devices, M5Paper supports Arduino IDE &amp; MicroPython. The product is fairly new, so it lacks in community projects, but the documentation explains basics and shows you how to handle an e-ink display with sample projects. Apart from online examples, M5Paper supports M5Stack Burner software. You can try community projects and easily reverse back to the default firmware.</p>

<p>Unless an e-ink is what you really want, I’d pick <a href="https://m5stack.com/collections/m5-core/products/m5stack-esp32-core-ink-development-kit1-54-elnk-display?variant=37404426174636">Core INK</a> series if you are getting started. M5Paper expects customers a bit of knowledge to take the advantage of the ESP32 inside. The demo panel promises interesting features, but to my disappointment, the “Home Automation” panel isn’t released as a source code, and I cannot integrate it with my house appliances. It’s a shame. </p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>I’m a little disappointed that M5Paper isn’t compatible with UIFlow, I hope this will change with time. I do love the device and I’m already thinking about potential projects. If you feel comfortable with Arduino IDE programming, go for it. Hardware-wise, <a href="https://m5stack.com/collections/m5-core/products/m5paper-esp32-development-kit-960x540-4-7-eink-display-235-ppi">M5Paper</a> is an amazing device worth the money spent on it. But if you are getting started, expect a steeper learning curve, limited tutorial materials, perhaps, you would be better off with <a href="https://m5stack.com/collections/m5-core/products/m5stack-core2-esp32-iot-development-kit?variant=35960244109476">M5Stack Core 2 </a>or <a href="https://m5stack.com/collections/m5-core/products/m5stack-esp32-core-ink-development-kit1-54-elnk-display?variant=37404426174636">Core INK</a> instead. I will try to get my hands on both!

                    <p>You know that <a href="https://blog.gitguardian.com/secrets-credentials-api-git/">adding secrets to your git repository</a> (even a private one) is a bad idea, because doing so <strong>risks exposing confidential information to the world</strong>. But mistakes were made, and now you need to figure out how to excise confidential information from your repo. <strong>Because git keeps a history of <em>everything</em>, it’s not often enough to simply remove the secret, commit, and push</strong>: we might need to do a bit of deep cleaning.</p><p><strong>Thankfully, for simpler cases, git provides commands that make cleaning things up easy</strong>. And in more complicated cases, we can use git-filter-repo, a tool recommended by the core git developers for deep cleaning an entire repository.</p><p>First and foremost, if there is reason to think that the secret has escaped into the world, and you can revoke the secret, do so. How to revoke a secret is going to vary quite a lot depending on what the secret protects. If you don’t know how to revoke it, you will need help from the owner of the resource protected by the secret.</p><blockquote>Need to quickly see what scenario applies to you? <br>check out our cheatsheet flow chart below</blockquote><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/da8kiytlc/image/upload/v1611932656/Cheatsheets/RewritingYourGitHistory-Cheatsheet-Final_weq1l2.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/da8kiytlc/image/upload/c_scale,r_6,w_500/v1611932656/Cheatsheets/RewritingYourGitHistory-Cheatsheet-Final_weq1l2.png"></a></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/da8kiytlc/image/upload/v1611932656/Cheatsheets/RewritingYourGitHistory-Cheatsheet-Final_weq1l2.pdf" target="_blank">Download the git history cheatsheet</a></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Now, let’s consider different scenarios to see how to clean things up.</p><h2 id="no">NO</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>No? That’s great. Please don’t push it up just yet.If you have any uncommited work, we can use <code>git stash</code> to save it. This sets your work aside in a temporary “stash” so that we can work with the git repository without losing anything you haven’t committed yet. When we’re done cleaning things up, you can use <code>git stash pop</code> to restore your work.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="yes">YES</h2><p>If you have already pushed a commit containing a secret, or just discovered a secret in your existing history, things get more complicated if there are other people working on this branch. If you work alone, there’s nothing to do at this point, you can skip to the next step. If you work as part of a team, things get more complicated because we need everyone to act in a coordinated way.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>First of all, we need to determine who else is affected by the secret’s presence, because we’ll need to coordinate everyone’s actions. If the secret only appears in the branch you’re working on, you only need to coordinate with anyone else who is always working off of that branch. However, if you found the secret lurking further back in git history, perhaps in your <code>master</code> or <code>main</code> branch, you’ll need to coordinate with everyone working in the repository.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Let the others affected know that a secret was found that needs to be excised from everyone’s git history. When you edit the git history to remove a file, it can cause problems with your teammates’ local clones; moreover, they can end up re-inserting the secret back into the public repository when they push their work. So it is important that everyone affected is in sync for the excision to work. This means that everyone needs to stop what they are doing, close outstanding PRs, and push up work that’s in progress.</p><p>Now, let’s make a fresh clone.</p><ul><li>Delete your existing clone in its entirety.</li><li>Make a fresh clone with `git clone [repository URL]`</li><li>Change into the project directory with `cd [project name]`</li><li>Download the entire repository history: `git pull --all --tags`.</li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The last step will look a little bit familiar. <code>git pull</code> tells git to grab updates from the remote repository, and apply them in the current branch (when it makes sense to do so, that is, when the local branch is set to track a remote branch). But git is smart, it doesn’t pull everything down, only what’s needed. This is where the <code>--all</code> flag comes in. This flag tells git to grab every branch from the remote repository. And the <code>--tags</code> flag tells git to grab every tag as well. So this command tells git to download the entire repository history, a complete and total clone. We have to do this, because it is possible that the commit containing the secret exists in more than one branch or tag. We need to ensure we don’t just scrub our secret from a portion of the repository history. As a result, this command can take a very long time, if the repository is very large.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Move on to the next step.</p><h2 id="the-secret-is-in-the-last-commit-and-there-s-nothing-else-in-the-last-commit">The secret is in the last commit, and there’s nothing else in the last commit</h2><p>In this case, we can drop the last commit in its entirety. We do this with</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>git reset --hard HEAD~1
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>What does this command do? Let’s break it apart a little bit. <code>git reset</code> is how we tell git that we want to undo recent changes. Normally, this command by itself tells git to unstage anything we’ve added with <code>git add</code>, but haven’t committed yet. This version of resetting isn’t sufficient for our purposes. But <code>git reset</code> is more flexible than that. We can tell git to take us back in time to a previous commit as well.We do that by telling git which commit to rewind to. We can use a commit’s identified (it’s “SHA”), or we can use an indirect reference. <code>HEAD</code> is what git calls the most recent commit on the checked out branch. <code>HEAD~1</code> means “the first commit prior to the most recent” (likewise <code>HEAD~2</code> means “two commits prior to the most recent”).<br>
Finally, the <code>--hard</code> tells git to throw away any differences between the current state and the state we’re resetting to. If you leave off the <code>--hard</code> your changes, including the secret, won’t be discarded. With <code>--hard</code>, the differences will be deleted, gone forever (which is precisely what we want!).</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Once you’ve done a hard reset, that’s it! You’re done. Your work has been destructively undone, and you can pick back up where you were.</p><h2 id="the-secret-is-in-the-last-commit-but-there-were-other-changes-too">The secret is in the last commit, but there were other changes too</h2><p>In this case, we don’t want to completely drop the last commit. We want to edit the last commit instead. Edit your code to remove the secrets, and then add your changes as usual. Then, instead of making a new commit, we’ll tell git we want to amend the previous one:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>git add [FILENAME]
git commit --amend
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>We all know <code>git commit</code>, but the <code>--amend</code> flag is our friend here. This tells git that we want to edit the previous commit, rather than creating a new one. We can continue to make changes to the last commit in this way, right up until we’re ready to either push our work, or start on a new commit.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Once you’ve amended the commit, you’re done! The secret’s gone, you can carry on as you were.</p><h2 id="the-secret-is-beyond-the-last-commit">The secret is beyond the last commit</h2><p><strong>It’s complicated</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>If you know you committed a secret, but have since committed other changes, things get trickier quickly. In anything but the simplest cases, we are going to want a more powerful tool to help us do a deep clean of the repository We’re going to use <code>git-filter-repo</code>, a tool recommended by the git maintainers that will help us to rewrite history in a more user-friendly way than the native git tooling.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>A technical aside to those familiar with the concept of rebasing. (If you don’t know what that means, feel free to skip this paragraph.) All of the cases covered below can of course be managed using native git tools, particularly by rebasing. Sometimes rebasing is relatively painless, of course, but in the kinds of scenarios we're presenting here, rebasing is going to be a tedious and deeply error-prone process. This is why I am favoring purpose-built tools like git-filter-repo over rebasing. It is far better to avoid opening the possibility for making mistakes. From my own personal experience, recovering from a botched rebase is extremely time consuming, and often nearly impossible. Better to use the right tool for the job.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>First, install </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>git-filter-repo
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Next, let’s assess the situation to determine which technique is right for your situation. Sometimes secrets are files, and sometimes secrets are lines of code. For example, if you accidentally committed an SSH key or TLS certificate file, these are contained in specialized files that you’ll need to excise. On the other hand, maybe you have a single line of code containing an API key that’s part of a larger source file. In that case, you want to modify one or more lines of a file without deleting it.</p><p>Git-filter-repo can handle both cases, but requires different syntax for each case.</p><h2 id="excise-an-entire-file">Excise an entire file</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>To tell <code>git-filter-repo</code> to excise a file from the git history, we need only a single command:</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>git filter-repo --use-base-name --path [FILENAME] --invert-paths
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The <code>--use-base-name</code> option tells <code>git-filter-repo</code> that we are specifying a filename, and not a full path to a file. You can leave off this option if you would rather specify the full path explicitly.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Normally, <code>git-filter-repo</code> works by ignoring the filenames specified (they are, as the name suggests, filtered out). But we want the inverse behavior, we want <code>git-filter-repo</code> to ignore everything except the specified file. So we must pass <code>--invert-paths</code> to tell it this. If you leave off the <code>--invert-paths</code>, you’ll excise everything except the specified file, which is the exact opposite of what we want, and would likely be disastrous. Please don’t do that.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id="edit-a-file-without-removing-it">Edit a file without removing it</h3><p>If you only need to edit one or more lines in a file without deleting the file, <code>git-filter-repo</code> takes a sequence of search-and-replace commands (optionally using regular expressions).</p><p>First, identify all the lines containing secrets that need to be excised. You’ll also need to work out a plan for how you will replace those lines. Perhaps just deleting them is enough. But perhaps they need to be modified to prevent a runtime crash.<br>Next, create a file containing the search-and-replace commands, called <code>replacements.txt</code>. Make sure it’s in a folder outside of your repo, for example, the parent folder.</p><p>The format of this file is one search-and-replace command per line, using the format:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>ORIGINAL==&gt;REPLACEMENT
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>For example, suppose that you’ve hard-coded an API token into your code, like this:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>AUTH_TOKEN=’123abc’
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Now suppose that you’ve decided that it’s better to load the API token from an environment variable, as such:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>AUTH_TOKEN=ENV[‘AUTH_TOKEN’]
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>We can tell <code>git-filter-repo</code> to search for the hard-coded …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<div>


<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Have you ever felt uncomfortable sharing your opinion on politics — whether online or with friends? If so, you’re not alone. Americans are becoming increasingly cautious about sharing their political opinions. In a recent <a href="https://www.cato.org/publications/survey-reports/poll-62-americans-say-they-have-political-views-theyre-afraid-share#introduction" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>survey</span></a>, 62 percent of Americans described today’s political climate as one that “prevents them from saying things they believe because others might find them offensive.” Further, this was not a sentiment limited to one side of the political spectrum. More than half of liberals and three-quarters of conservatives are <a href="https://www.outsidethebeltway.com/62-of-americans-afraid-to-share-political-views/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>hesitant to share</span></a> some of their political views. Both of these percentages have risen in recent years, in tandem with the rising debate over so-called “cancel culture.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it’s not just everyday Americans that feel limited in their speech. In July 2020, 153 notable academics, authors, journalists, and others published “<a href="https://harpers.org/a-letter-on-justice-and-open-debate/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>A Letter on Justice and Open Debate</span></a>” in <em>Harper’s Magazine</em>. In the letter, signees ranging from liberal philosopher Noam Chomsky to conservative author David Brooks voice their concern over “cancel culture” and the preservation of free speech. While the extent to which “cancel culture” endangers free speech is debated, the letter demonstrates that some academics and media professionals consider it a serious threat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This prompts several key questions: Does the media perpetuate the existence of “cancel culture?” What impact might this have on public discourse? In this week's analysis, The Factual reviews 38 articles from 25 sources across the political spectrum to explore the concept of “cancel culture” and how it is reported in the media.<br><!--more--></p>

<h4><strong>What Is “Cancel Culture?”&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>The definition isn’t simple, partially due to a growing contrast between the term’s literal definition and its use in politics and media. “Cancel culture” can be defined as a campaign of public shaming (conducted via social media, news, or in-person confrontation) such that the subject of the “cancellation” suffers devastating personal, monetary, or political consequences that appear to be disproportionate to the subject's offense.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Often, individuals or businesses will cut ties with the “cancelled” person in rapid succession and across industries. This creates a cascading effect where each person or business that cuts ties with the subject of the cancellation puts more pressure on those who have yet to do so. A person may become a candidate for cancellation if they are alleged to have done something so negative that they should not be afforded an opportunity for redemption. <strong>Central to the debate around “cancel culture” is this subjective threshold for what is worthy of “cancellation.”</strong></p>
<h4><strong>An Uneven Standard </strong></h4>
<p>There is no central authority that issues “cancellations” and oversees appeals. Instead, an amorphous group of internet users, politicians, and media professionals contribute to “cancel culture” on the basis of what happens to be in front of them. This produces a highly stratified environment where backlash is sometimes dispassionately cruel and at other times extremely exaggerated.</p>
<p>The term "cancel culture" has seen renewed debate in response to the Twitter <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ban</a> of former President Trump. <span>However, President Trump’s Twitter ban relates to violations of the platform’s terms of service and requires a more specific examination than the general “cancel culture” phenomenon.</span></p>

<h4><strong>Examples Of “Cancel Culture”</strong></h4>
<p>Legitimate examples of “cancel culture” gone overboard often stem from false inferences. One such <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/07/david-shor-cancel-culture-2020-election-theory-polls.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>example</span></a> occurred when a data scientist, David Shor, <a href="https://twitter.com/jenbrea/status/1271148784316108800" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>retweeted</span></a> a report regarding the effectiveness of various protest methods in regards to achieving policy change. This report was discussed by many as <a href="https://blog.thefactual.com/reforming-police-george-floyd-defund" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>protests</span></a> grew in response to the killing of George Floyd. The data scientist was <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/06/case-for-liberalism-tom-cotton-new-york-times-james-bennet.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>fired</span></a> from his job as some equated his sharing of the report to condemnation of protests taking place. However, the report was originally authored by Omar Wasow, a Black man with a <a href="https://politics.princeton.edu/people/omar-wasow" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>PhD</span></a> in African American Studies. The original <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/136610C8C040C3D92F041BB2EFC3034C/S000305542000009Xa.pdf/agenda_seeding_how_1960s_black_protests_moved_elites_public_opinion_and_voting.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>report</span></a> was an analysis meant to gauge the effectiveness of protest methods in the face of a hostile majority, not to comment on their justifications or level of cost. Jennifer Brea, Omar Wasow’s wife, recently <a href="https://twitter.com/jenbrea/status/1271148784316108800?s=20" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>took to Twitter</span></a> to describe her surprise at what had occurred. A collective perception of offense combined with inadequate fact-checking, resulting in the loss of a person’s livelihood.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another recent example of overzealous cancellation occurred when Lauren Wolfe, a now-former editor for the <em>New York Times</em> tweeted that she had “chills” watching then President-elect Biden’s plane land for inauguration. The backlash, largely from right-leaning outlets such as the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9176225/New-York-Times-cancels-editors-contract-tweeted-chills-watching-Biden.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em><span>Daily Mail</span></em></a>, <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/01/22/ny-times-ousts-editor-who-said-she-had-chills-watching-biden-plane-land/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em><span>New York Post</span></em></a>, and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/new-york-times-lauren-wolfe-biden-i-have-chills" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Fox News</span></a>, resulted in the <em>New York Times</em> cancelling Ms. Wolfe’s contract. Importantly, these outlets did not explicitly call for Wolfe to be fired. Instead, they magnified ridicule of the <em>New York Times</em> and suggested that she was emblematic of the newspaper’s left-leaning bias. While this was not a call for her to lose her job, it did incentivize the paper to end her employment in pursuit of impartiality. Further, Ms. Wolfe has <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/1/24/22247390/lauren-wolfe-new-york-times-tweet-chills" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>stated</span></a> that she has received threats and, due to the loss of her job, is now in a precarious financial position.&nbsp;</p>
<div><p>In this scenario, the pressure from traditionally right-leaning outlets stands in stark contrast to their <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/search?q=cancel%20culture" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>repeated</span></a> condemnation of "cancel culture." Still, it was the left-leaning <em>New York Times</em>, which has published pieces <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/28/style/is-it-canceled.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>minimizing</span></a> the effects of "cancel culture," that ultimately fired her. In this way, Lauren Wolfe became the victim of hypocrisy from media across the political spectrum.</p></div>
<h4><strong>The Politicization Of The Term</strong></h4>
<p>In contrast to the above, some politicians, such as Senator Josh Hawley, have embraced the media as an outlet for his repetitive claims of “cancel culture” occurring.&nbsp; Last year, he was asserting that <a href="https://twitter.com/HawleyMO/status/1275762902285406210" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>the removal</span></a> of Confederate statues was "cancel culture." These days, he <a href="https://abc7news.com/josh-hawley-fist-capitol-police-simon-and-schuster-book-deal/9468139/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>claims</span></a> that he himself is being “cancelled” over his support for contesting President Biden’s electoral victory. In an essay published by the <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/01/24/its-time-to-stand-up-against-the-muzzling-of-america/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em><span>New York Post</span></em></a>, he emulates the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>’s Peggy Noonan in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/get-ready-for-the-struggle-session-11552003346" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>likening</span></a> “cancel culture” to the state of free speech in China. The strength of this comparison is debatable, as the U.S. <a href="https://rsf.org/en/united-states" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>ranks</span></a> 45th in Reporters Without Borders’ press freedom index whereas China <a href="https://rsf.org/en/china" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>ranks</span></a> 177th.&nbsp;</p>
<div><p>More importantly, Senator Hawley still has his job and key committee <a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/committee-assignments" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>assignments</span></a>, a new <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2021-01-18/sen-josh-hawley-book-deal-regnery" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>book deal</span></a>, and access to a <a href="https://twitter.com/HawleyMO" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>platform</span></a> read by millions. Still, articles published in the right-leaning <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9184433/Hawley-claims-hes-canceled-corporate-America-says-wont-muzzled-left.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em><span>Daily Mail</span></em></a> and <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/01/24/its-time-to-stand-up-against-the-muzzling-of-america/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em><span>New York Post </span></em></a>focus on online outrage in response to his actions rather than the lack of actual consequences that seem to be occurring. This selective framing is a key way in which media publications perpetuate a malleable definition of “cancel culture.”</p></div>
<h4><strong>How "Cancel Culture" Is Reported</strong></h4>
<p>Media outlets and publishers that align with the political left or right have palpable differences in how they report incidents of alleged “cancel culture.” Often, however, key perspectives originate from, or are amplified by, elected leaders. For example, Republican Representative Matt Gaetz <a href="https://twitter.com/RepMattGaetz/status/1353772373049282560" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>likened</span></a> the impeachment of former President Trump to “cancel culture.” Across the aisle, Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has minimized fears of "cancel culture" as being <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1281394730232946691" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>overblown</span></a>, citing conservatives' own efforts to get her “cancelled.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the media sphere, this political divide is mirrored by pieces in right-leaning outlets that paint "cancel culture" as a legitimate threat to free speech. <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/06/cancel-cancel-culture/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>There</span></a> <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/01/is-the-wisdom-of-homer-immune-to-cancel-culture/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>are</span></a> <a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/prufrock/dangerous-ideas-and-our-cancel-culture/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>many</span></a> <a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/concentrated-capital-fuels-cancel-culture/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>examples</span></a> <a href="https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/31/obama-is-right-to-criticize-cancel-culture-but-the-left-isnt-listening/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>of</span></a> <a href="https://reason.com/2021/01/07/the-capitol-rioters-were-a-right-wing-cancel-mob/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>such</span></a> <a href="https://reason.com/2020/08/07/cancel-culture-is-a-dangerous-totalitarian-trend/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>pieces</span></a>. In one instance, former Republican Senator Orrin Hatch utilized the <em>Wall Street Journal’s</em> Opinion Section to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/higher-ed-and-the-fragmentation-of-america-11595865575" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>equate</span></a> “cancel culture” to the deadly Spanish Inquisition. Going even further, right-leaning publications sometimes claim that this behavior was <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2019/09/04/rnc-ronna-mcdaniel-cancel-culture-debra-messing-mccormack-frightening/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>deliberately</span></a> unleashed by “the Left” to silence political opposition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the archetypal left-leaning outlet more frequently <a href="https://time.com/5735403/cancel-culture-is-not-real/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>minimizes</span></a> fears over "cancel culture" by suggesting that the incident involves justified repercussions or identifying the ways in which a “cancelled” individual <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/28/style/is-it-canceled.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>maintained</span></a> their fanbase. This <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/155141/cancel-culture-con-dave-chappelle-shane-gillis" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>piece</span></a> published in the left-leaning <em>New Republic</em> minimizes fears over “cancel culture” by regarding it as “ordinary public disfavor voiced by ordinary people.” Similarly, the <em>New Statesman</em> published an <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/2020/07/cancel-culture-does-not-exist" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>article</span></a> bluntly titled “‘Cancel culture’ does not exist.”&nbsp;</p>
<div><p>Indeed, there are few voices who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/17/opinion/sunday/cancel-culture-call-out.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>describe</span></a> "cancel culture" as a legitimate threat to individuals without fame or power but not an existential threat to free speech. One person who promotes this <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/07/09/cancel-culture-is-real-problem-not-people-warning-about-it/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>description</span></a> is Phoebe Maltz Bovy, a signatory of the <em>Harper’s</em> letter. Weeks after signing, she came to realize a central paradox: “the loudest voices on the topic are those with careers as contrarians.” While Ms. Maltz Bovy had signed the letter to protect the everyday author, she later realized she may have also been defending controversial elites.</p></div>
<h4><strong>Striking the Right Balance</strong></h4>
<p>By identifying the haphazard way in which claims of “cancel culture” are promoted in the media, one can more cautiously approach the topic. Readers must demand specific information from stories of this nature and seek out alternate perspectives on the same topic. As the sheer quantity of daily media continues to grow, ensuring <a href="https://blog.thefactual.com/why-is-the-news-biased" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>balance</span></a> and quality in our news diet is essential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As society becomes more <a href="https://knightfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/American-Views-2020-Trust-Media-and-Democracy.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>partisan</span></a>, it's important for all of us to engage in respectful, good-faith discussion across political lines. When moderate Americans are <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/20/in-political-correctness-debate-most-americans-think-too-many-people-are-easily-offended/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>afraid</span></a> to voice their views, it allows those who operate at political extremes<span>—</span>often in bad-faith<span>—</span>to dominate the discussion.</p>

			<p><span>R</span>elief coursed through me last week when I learned my 2-year-old daughter’s daycare provider got her first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. It left her feeling more groggy than she expected, but that was a good thing, suggesting the vaccine was kicking her immune system into gear.</p><p>While I was grateful her vaccination reduced the risk of exposure in my social pod, I was reading about new genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 from the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Brazil. At a recent press conference, Anthony Fauci, chief medical advisor to President Biden, said the current Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, when confronting the new mutations, were still “well above the line of not being effective.” That’s reassuring, of course, until you consider that vaccines, battling mutations, can fall below the line of effectiveness. That’s not the fault of vaccine design, it’s the result of nature’s design. As long as the virus continues to find new human hosts, it will continue to evolve mutations to escape our immune defenses.</p><p>“The more people infected, the more likely that we will see new variants,” Michel Nussenzweig, a Rockefeller University immunologist, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/25/health/coronavirus-moderna-vaccine-variant.html" target="_blank">told</a> <i>The New York Times</i>. “If we give the virus a chance to do its worst, it will.”</p><blockquote><p>Both the U.K and the South Africa coronavirus variants have high escape potential.</p> </blockquote><p>Thankfully, scientists are on the case figuring out what form the virus’ worst may take next. A team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that includes a biological engineer, a computational biologist, and a mathematician, has come up with a novel way of predicting which SARS-CoV-2 mutations can escape the human immune system. Their research could help vaccine makers stay one step ahead of evolution and cut off deadly mutations at the pass. In a new <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6526/284" target="_blank">paper</a>, published in <i>Science</i> with the enticing title, “Learning the language of viral evolution and escape,” the scientists elucidate a promising bridge between ideas about natural language, like grammar and meaning, and how viruses and bacteria, among other things, evolve. “We’re taking steps toward understanding the language of biology,” said Bonnie Berger, one of the paper’s authors.<br></p><p>Berger and coauthors Bryan Bryson and Brian Hie recently joined me on Zoom to explain their research. Their work stems from the thorny—or perhaps I should say “spikey”—ability of viruses to mutate in ways that allow them to evade our immune system. It is, after all, SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein, a <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-virology-110615-042301" target="_blank">multifunctional molecular machine</a>, that helps the virus break into our cells. As a <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(21)00007-4/fulltext" target="_blank">report</a> this month in <i>The Lancet</i> noted, the variant that recently arose in the U.K., which is “rapidly becoming a global threat,” is characterized by “multiple mutations in the spike protein.” The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines work against SARS-CoV-2 by giving our cells <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html" target="_blank">instructions</a> on how to make a harmless piece of the virus’ spike protein; that information sets up our immune system to effectively fight off the virus.&nbsp;When the spike protein changes, however, it can become harder for our immune system to recognize and, ultimately, thwart.</p><p>Berger heads the Computation and Biology group at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab. She explained that mutations in the original Wuhan strand should be investigated for “semantic change,” which “could lead to escape.” A semantic change, or change in meaning, in a protein comes down to its amino-acid sequences, which follow a set of rules. A protein is a polypeptide chain of amino acids, letters in the 20-character protein “alphabet” that code for a particular protein structure and purpose. The sequences of these letters, joined to each other with peptide bonds, are transcribed and translated from DNA and RNA—or, in the case of SARS-CoV-2, just RNA. For the virus’s spike protein to link successfully to our cells, its sequence has to adhere to a syntax. “We think of that as a biological grammar,” said Hie, a doctoral candidate at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab at MIT.</p><div>

</div><p>To escape the immune system’s search-and-destroy cells, Hie said, the virus must camouflage itself. In <i>Science</i>, the authors write, “We identified escape mutations as those that preserve viral infectivity but cause a virus to look different to the immune system, akin to word changes that preserve a sentence’s grammaticality but change its meaning.” This clever rewrite, Berger said, is evolution at work. “Evolution is a language,” she said. “Its language developed like English developed—over time. Protein sequences, or nucleic acid sequences, develop over time.”</p><p>The scientists designed machine-learning algorithms, originally created to work with human languages like English, to identify the new “words” in the virus’ protein sequences. “The same principles used to train a language model on a sequence of English words can train a language model on a sequence of amino acids,” they write. Fundamentally, Hie said, the algorithms work like sentence-completion models, such as the autocorrect and autocomplete functions in the iPhone and Google’s Gmail.</p><blockquote><p>If we give the virus a chance to do its worst, it will.</p> </blockquote><p>They trained their language model on 4,172 spike protein sequences, much less than what was available to work with for proteins associated with other viruses, for which the researchers also created language models to predict viral escape—44,851 sequences of a protein in the influenza A virus, and 57,730 sequences of a protein in the HIV virus. They found that the degree of a protein sequence’s grammatical correctness, according to their language models, was significantly correlated with viral fitness “across all strains and across studies that examined single or combinatorial mutations,” despite the fact that their language models “were not given any explicit fitness-related information.” This suggests that a mutation’s “grammaticality” actually captures information about how fit that mutation is for infecting people. It also, the researchers said, increases the dimensions of scientists’ understanding of how a change in meaning can encode the perturbing of a protein’s purpose.<br></p><p>Bryson is a member of the Ragon Institute at Massachusetts General Hospital and heads his own lab at MIT’s Biological Engineering department. He put it this way: “We’ve blasted the doors open with CSCS in terms of an intellectual paradigm.” CSCS stands for constrained semantic change search. It’s the task of looking for mutations to the spike protein with both high grammaticality and high semantic change. There’s not really an analog for doing this usefully on some body of text in the English language. And that’s the point. “Before, people would just look at grammaticality of English or the meaning, the semantics,” Berger said. “But looking for escape—high grammaticality and high semantic change—you wouldn’t do that for the English language, which is why we came up with a new natural-language processing model. Natural-language processing drove the solving of a biological problem.”<br></p><p>In Bryson’s lab, scientists can now experiment with spike-protein mutants. “We’re saying, ‘OK, we can generate this,’” Bryson said. “In our model, it falls in the 98th percentile.” That means if you compare this mutant’s sequence to previously seen coronavirus sequences, then 98 percent of those previously seen coronavirus sequences have lower semantic change, as predicted by the model, than the mutant. “We can see how well it infects cells,” Bryson said. “We can ask, ‘How well does it bind the receptor ACE2?’—the cellular doorway the spike protein opens to cause COVID-19—‘How well does it survive in the presence of antibodies?’ We now have a little bit more understanding of how semantic changes relate to all of the biological features of infection.”</p><blockquote><p>A mutation’s “grammaticality” actually captures information about how fit that mutation is for infecting people.</p> </blockquote><p>Both the U.K and the South Africa variants have, according to the researchers’ model, high escape potential. The latter scored higher for semantic change than the former. “Those may be prone to escape and may not be targeted by the vaccine, but that needs to be experimentally verified,” Berger said. “We’re just doing quantitative prediction.”</p><p>I asked the scientists how the development of our current vaccines might have been different if Moderna and Pfizer knew about this language of viral escape. Bryson said, “I think our model underscores the importance of using the full length of the spike as an immunogen, as opposed to prioritizing particular regions of the protein over others.” He said it is fortunate that a lot of the vaccine designs are focused on the full-length spike protein, which their model suggests is a good move. At the same time, Bryson warned, “our model does quantify certain parts of the protein as having high escape potential.”</p><p>However, with that knowledge, Bryson said, chemists could fine-tune vaccines to target the sequences most likely to escape. “We could say, OK, even as we get more and more sequences, how can we think about designing new vaccine strategies that focus the immune response on this particular region of the protein?” In the computer, he explained, he could generate new spike mutations and determine (to use the language metaphor) whether they change the meaning of the protein sequence and become dangerous. Based on that modeling, Bryson said, “We can do deep virology, immunology, antibody-binding—all these types of experiments that allow us to explore those pieces.”</p><p>The team is looking to take their model to uncharted territory beyond protein sequences. “This conceptual framework is not limited to immune selection and immune escape, but can generalize …</p></div></div>

                                                <p>GameStop, a struggling, mall-based video games retailer, has topped the business news this week. In part, this is because its common stock (ticker: GME) has seen an incredible run-up in price. But the story has also garnered a lot of attention because the media is portraying the company as the latest battleground between populism and the establishment.</p>
<p>On one side are the hedge funds that have bet against GameStop by short selling GME. That’s to say, hedge funds have borrowed the company’s stock, sold it and are betting that they can buy it back at a lower price. On the other side are the investors, including retail investors on Reddit’s r/wallstreetbets, who are betting on GameStop stock to go up. Moreover, they’re buying GME and encouraging other investors to do the same to push up the price of the stock and bankrupt the hedge funds that have shorted it.</p>
<p>Bulls and bears have fought for as long as we’ve had financial markets. The difference now? The increasing availability of derivatives to retail traders, who can use these sophisticated investment products to lever returns. For example, consider a vanilla call option. Owning a call on GME gives me the right (but not the obligation) to purchase a share of GME at a fixed price (called the strike) and on a fixed date (called the expiry).</p>
<p>Let’s use some illustrative numbers. Suppose I bought a call on GME back on Jan. 4 with a strike of $250 and an expiry of Jan. 27. The fair price of this option would have been very cheap, say a few dollars or less. Why? For the call to have a positive payoff, termed being “in the money,” GME would have had to rise from $20 (the price on the 4th) to above $250 (the strike) by the expiry. Essentially, buying the GME call would have been a bet on incredible levels of stock price volatility.</p>
<p>As it turns out, that’s what happened. Since GME closed at about $350 on Jan. 27, the payoff of that single call (purchased for pocket change) would have been $100. That’s because exercising the call gets the owner a share of GME (worth $350) at the strike price ($250). That’s a return of two orders of magnitude greater than the initial investment. In this way, close-to-expiry, far out-of-the-money call options allow for extremely leveraged bets. Like a lottery ticket or roulette wheel spin, these calls may only cost a few dollars but have a possibility of unlimited profit. The allure of stock speculation? Like poker, you’re playing against real humans. If you can outsmart them, then you can eat their lunch. And now we can do it during lunch on our phones.</p>
<p>With GameStop, we have a classic short squeeze. When the price of GME rises, the investment banks and brokerage firms that lent out the stock require that the short sellers provide more collateral. To do this, the shorts might have to sell their existing positions in other stocks at bad prices to quickly raise cash. Worse, the lenders can immediately call the loaned stock back. The short seller is then forced to buy back the stock at a higher price than they originally sold it at, often taking a bath. In the short sellers’ scramble to cover their shorts, the GME price rises further. Because stock prices have unlimited potential to rise, the short seller is exposed to potentially unlimited losses. Therefore, in a short squeeze, the short sellers risk bankruptcy even if they are ultimately right about the fair value of the stock. But, as John Maynard Keynes is reputed to have said, “The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.”</p>
<p>But is the run-up in GME price irrational? Does it illustrate the inefficiency of financial markets, like a modern version of tulip mania?</p>
<p>First, we should be skeptical of bite-sized economic history. Case in point: Keynes never made that quip, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-MB-32547">according to expert historians</a> Robert Skidelsky and Donald Moggridge. And the tulip mania story might also be bust, as historian Peter Garber explains in <em>Famous First Bubbles: The Fundamentals of Early Manias</em>. History has useful economics, but beware history badly done. Still the question remains: Is GME a bubble, born of irrational exuberance?</p>
<p>Bubbles are a favorite topic of my Mercatus colleague Scott Sumner. In the simplest model of an efficient market, stock prices follow a random walk. Since prices instantly and perfectly reflect all available information, price changes are only caused by unexpected news. And since you can’t predict unexpected news, prices evolve randomly. So as Scott has pointed out, even efficient market prices can exhibit bubble-like patterns by chance. Some stock prices will rapidly rise on good news and subsequently collapse on bad news. But you can’t know which stocks ahead of time.<img loading="lazy" src="https://www.discoursemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Discourse_Graphic_Gamestop-e1611941850710.png" alt="" width="600" height="468"></p>
<p>But there’s a problem applying this reasoning in the GameStop case. What news about the company’s business could have plausibly driven the large swings in GME? The stock price steadily tripled from about $20 at the beginning of January to about $60 roughly three weeks later on the 22nd. Then this week, the stock price and volatility exploded. The share price ran up to nearly $475, amid much bouncing around. For instance, on Thursday, Jan. 28, the stock reached $468 soon after the opening bell, only to fall to $126 about an hour later. To my knowledge, no news about GameStop’s business explains these swings. I suspect the truth mixes rationality and human psychology. Here’s my theory:</p>
<p>For starters, the hedge funds shorting GME got greedy. More shares of GME have been shorted than there are shares of GME outstanding. This fact means that if all the shorts are called in at the same time, they couldn’t all be covered. Moreover, GameStop isn’t obviously destined for failure. I don’t give financial advice and haven’t taken either side of the GME trade. But in the same way that some investors are pessimistic about GME, other investors are optimistic about GME. Both sets of investors try to convince the public of their view. This is perfectly normal. The key difference here? The optimistic GME investors have realized the vulnerable position of the short sellers, and they’ve coordinated to expose it. Why GME and not another stock? Because gamers like GameStop.</p>
<p>In this way, bidding up the price of GME is akin to a bank run or a foreign-exchange speculative attack. Investors realize, often suddenly and simultaneously, “If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.” The realization leads to coordinated action by self-interested individuals—<a href="https://www.adamsmithworks.org/documents/spontaneous-order-in-adam-smith">Smithian spontaneous order</a>—causing the unsustainable arrangement to collapse. Some call it creative destruction; others call it financial instability. Your language might depend on whether you’ve gained or lost.</p>
<p>Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/joint-statement-ongoing-market-volatility-2021-01-27">announced</a> that it was “actively monitoring” the situation. And so are Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and other Biden administration officials, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gamestop-white-house/white-house-monitoring-situation-involving-gamestop-other-firms-idUSKBN29W2I1">according to White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki</a>. The SEC and other securities regulators may be concerned that the GameStop short squeeze is an illegal form of market manipulation, a notoriously vague crime under U.S. securities law. I’m not a lawyer and can’t offer a legal opinion.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, retail investors must not be prosecuted simply because they were on the winning side of a trade and used colorful language on the internet. Hedge funds are sophisticated financial market actors that are responsible for managing their own risk. SEC regulations prohibit the general public from investing in them under their “accredited investor” rules. And as SEC officials regularly point out in their indictments, professional traders also use colorful language in their chats. So, let’s be fair. Absent an underlying crime, when hedge funds leave a free lunch on the table, don’t punish retail traders for eating it.</p>
<p>Like GameStop, I say: Power to the players.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> is a wonderful lightweight markup: minimalistic,
easy to read and write. Markdown is supported by GitHub,
Bitbucket, Reddit, Diaspora, Stack Exchange, and many others.
It is not without issues though.  Markdown is precedent-based,
so to say.  It aimed to codify preexisting practices which
were... diverse.  For that reason, it is messy and inconsistent
between implementations.  </p>
<p>StrictMark is a rational <em>subset</em> of Markdown that implements
all the features with the shortest <em>formal</em> grammar possible.
Hence, uniform syntax and no ambiguities.  The idea is that
StrictMark can reuse all the existing Markdown support,
without sharing the weight of the legacy syntax and its
incidental complexity.</p>
<p>StrictMark is Markdown, refactored.</p>
<h2>Markdown critique</h2>
<p>Markdown implementations are inconsistent. Vim highlights it one
way, VS Code does it differently, and the resulting HTML is yet
another thing. A textbook fix for inconsistent implementations
is having a <em>formal grammar</em>.  That might be either a proper
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form">eBNF</a> grammar or just some regexes in simpler cases.  There
must be something formal and unambiguous.  HTML has it, CSS has
it, every markup or programming language has it.  But Markdown.
Sadly, the syntax itself is so ambiguous that making a formal
grammar becomes a road of pain. For example, HTML (which is
hardly lightweight) has a uniform syntax for its <code>&lt;/elements&gt;</code>.
With Markdown, every element has its own syntax and those
syntaxes interact.  Markdown formal grammar was attempted in the
past, but if you ask me, the result was underwhelming. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form">PEG
based grammar</a> is 700 lines long. For a <em>minimalistic</em>
markup, that is <strong>a lot</strong>. So ironic.</p>
<p><a href="http://commonmark.org/">CommonMark</a> is a Markdown codification effort that produced
the most complete spec so far.  Still, that spec is
rule-and-exception based, no grammar.  The text of the spec is
full of "legalese":</p>
<blockquote><p>Â«An indented code block cannot interrupt a paragraph, so
there must be a blank line between a paragraph and a
following indented code blockÂ»</p></blockquote>
<p>Here it describes the specifics of interrelations between two
particular markup elements. But <code>N</code> elements produce <code>N*N</code>
relations!  Consider that ATX headings are always single-line
while Setext headings can be multiline. Why? Because the spec
says so. It is one big heap of rules and another one of
exceptions. That's why it advises a "parsing strategy" and
not a parser generator.</p>
<p>Whether the CommonMak spec has fixed all the corner cases and
ambiguities is unclear.  Or maybe clear, as the spec is actively
revised. So is the code.  The CommonMark C parser is 10KLoC of
hand-written code.  It has plenty of exceptions and tweaks.
While writing <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/ron.sm">RON</a> docs, I ran into issues immediately;
had to use the HEAD version which has those issues fixed.</p>
<p>Overall, that seemingly theoretical grammar problem causes
plenty of <em>accidental complexity</em>.  Markdown is messy and hard
to reason about;  it is not always clear how to interpret a
given construct.  That combinatorial mess may not be a problem
for its current uses, of course.  (Although, I highly doubt
that.) After all, the existing libcmark parser is fuzzed,
thus reasonably reliable.  Still, Markdown is a very shaky
base if you want to build on top of it.  To build something
more advanced than a README.  Like, full WYSIWYG editing or
diff highlighting or other complex behavior.</p>
<h2>StrictMark principles</h2>
<p>StrictMark's objective is to make a Markdown <em>subset</em> which is a
<em>proper markup language</em>. To  remove that incidental complexity
by rationalizing the grammar and making it formal.  This
document <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/strictmark.sm?@text">is StrictMark</a>.</p>
<p>One may ask, why do I want to make Markdown a proper language?
After all, there is HTML which is proper enough. Yes, HTML is a
widely supported standard, but it is hopelessly elephantine.
Let's think, who can afford to develop/support a proper HTML
engine?  That is roughly one-and-a-half companies in the world.
Hence the interest in a minimalistic hypertext markup language.</p>
<p>The next question is obvious.  If StrictMark is ever used at
some scale, would not it become elephantine, naturally?
Consider Wikipedia/Mediawiki markup.  Once neat and lean like
all such markups, it evolved into an elephantine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sneakers&amp;action=edit">mess</a>.
What about table support, for example?  Some people think it is
necessary, quite deservedly so.</p>
<p>I plan to prevent feature sprawl by enabling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion">transclusion</a>.
A document may reference other documents and objects through
hyperlinks.  It can also <em>include</em> other objects and documents,
through hyperlinks.  The good old <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag is an example of
transclusion.  That will not even extend the syntax: StrictMark
reuses the image syntax for the general case of transclusion.
Once you need a table, you transclude a table!  It is up to the
renderer to deal with all those other data types.  CSV is a much
better format for tables than HTML or Markdown.</p>
<p>StrictMark is a backwards compatible subset of CommonMark, for
the most part.  Any existing CommonMark tooling will support
StrictMark reasonably well.  A StrictMark parser may not
understand arbitrary Markdown.</p>
<p>StrictMark principles:</p>
<ol><li><p>A formal grammar.  StrictMark is a <em>regular language</em> in its
structural part (i.e. blocks).  The inline markup syntax is
based on regex-defined <em>markers</em>.  That way, a decent parser
can be implemented in regexes only.</p></li>
<li><p>There is one way to do a thing, as uniform as possible.
Hence: spaces, not tabs!  Because spaces can replace tabs,
not the other way around. ATX headings only. Formatting
brackets are <code>*one char*</code> wide only. All block formatting is
indented uniformly.</p></li>
<li><p>Minimize ambiguity. Same character should not denote lists
and emphasis, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>No spooky action-at-a-distance.  Each line can be parsed
separately.  All the structural markup is 4-char-wide, hence
indents are uniform. This restriction makes the nesting
structure clear and unambiguous.</p></li>
<li><p>Inline markup has very limited nesting; it is of secondary
importance anyway.  There is clear markup precedence; a
<code>code</code> span wins over <code>strong</code>, <code>strong</code> wins over <code>emph</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>HTML is not the only output format.  It could be PDF, DOC,
TeX, whatever.  Hence, no HTML inserts. Use transclusion
for other formats.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep markup to the minimum. The plain text form must stay
clean and readable.</p></li>
<li><p>If the StrictMark interpretation contradicts CommonMark or
CommonMark has an ambiguity then screw CommonMark.</p></li></ol>
<p>Interestingly enough, <a href="https://johnmacfarlane.net/beyond-markdown.html">similar ideas</a> were proposed in the
CommonMark community some years ago.</p>
<h2>Inline markup</h2>
<p>Markdown inline markup may seem like an easy part. Sadly, it is
not.  Due to very irregular and ambiguous syntax, implementing
it properly is difficult.  For that reason, StrictMark
rationalizes the inline markup in the following ways:</p>
<ol><li><p>All inline markup is seen as bracketing.  Brackets are
matched separately, using regular expressions; e.g.
<code>(?&lt;=\s)[*](?=\S)</code> is the opening bracket for STRONG.
Bracket pairs only become effective if they satisfy the
precedence rules.</p></li>
<li><p>Bracket precedence, lower to higher:</p>
<ol><li><p><code>_emphasized_</code>,</p></li>
<li><p><code>[link][1]</code>,</p></li>
<li><p><code>*strong*</code>,</p></li>
<li><p><code>\* escapes</code>, </p></li>
<li><p>`<code>code</code>`.</p></li></ol></li>
<li><p>An open bracket can be paired with any following closing
bracket of that kind.  A new open bracket will cancel any
preceding unmatched open bracket of its kind.</p></li>
<li><p>In case of overlap, higher-precedence brackets win; in case
of equal-precedence, the earlier range wins.</p></li>
<li><p>Higher-precedence brackets may nest in lower-precedence, but
not the other way around (the lower one is cancelled).  In
case of equal-precedence, the earlier range wins.</p></li>
<li><p>No double symbols, i.e. <code>*strong*</code> not <code>**strong**</code>.</p></li></ol>
<p>Compared to CommonMark, restrictions are many:</p>
<ul><li><p>no double-symbol syntax,</p></li>
<li><p>no arbitrary nesting,</p></li>
<li><p>only reference links, the label is 1 symbol long,</p></li>
<li><p>no way to put backticks inside a code span.</p></li></ul>
<p>That may seem restrictive, but again: inline formatting has a
supplementary role.  It must pull its own weight or it must not
be there.  The accurate bracket patterns are listed in the
grammar appendix.</p>
<h2>Links, images and transclusions</h2>
<p>The only form of links CommonMark supports is full reference
links.  The link label must be exactly one symbol long. This
approach:</p>
<ul><li><p>matches a common established practice of using numbered
references;</p></li>
<li><p>minimizes the visual noise in the text flow;</p></li>
<li><p>keeps reference definitions exactly 4 symbols long.</p></li></ul>
<p>Reference definitions can be placed anywhere.  It is nice to put
them at the end of a section or in the end of the document.
Example:</p>
<pre><code>    see [Replicated Object Notation][1]

    [1]: http://doc.replicated.cc/ron.sm "What is RON"
</code></pre>
<p>If you have more than 10 links, use letters. 
In case you have thousands of links, use Unicode symbols.</p>
<p>Transclusions and images use the same syntax as links, 
with an exclamation mark <code>!</code> prepended.
Example:</p>
<pre><code>    ![here is the table][T]
    [T]: /table?@tab "this might be any object"
</code></pre>
<h2>Block markup</h2>
<p>StrictMark has tree types of blocks:</p>
<ol><li><p>container blocks (lists, blockquotes, divs),</p></li>
<li><p>leaf blocks (paragraphs, headers, rulers, fenced code blocks).</p></li></ol>
<p>Container and entry blocks can contain other blocks, leaf blocks
can not.  Depending on the type of a leaf block, it can contain
text, metadata or nothing at all, </p>
<p>The block-related markup goes in the beginning of the
line, in blocks of four symbols.  That part of a line  is called
a <em>block stack</em>.  The allowed blockstack pattern is
<code>(INDENT|QUOTE)* LIST? LEAF?</code>.  In absence of an explicit leaf
block, a formatted text paragraph is implied.</p>
<p>A block can be continued in the following lines; that is
signaled by indents (four spaces) in place of the block markup.
An empty line is considered to be a continuation line for the
container blocks in the stack, but not for the leaf block.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code> #  Multiline
    header

 1. here the entry starts,
    and then it continues

    and continues...
 2. ...till the next entry.
</code></pre>
<p>Changes in blockstack depth cause container nesting changes.
Additional indent of less than 4 spaces is not meaningful.
That allows for easier line-by-line parsing and interpretation.
If an indent level starts with a bare indent, that creates a
generic container block (in other words, a <code>div</code>).  With
CommonMark, that should be a code block.  StrictMark generalizes
that slightly.</p></div>

            Lenovo laptops have a “User-defined Key” on F12 which can be mapped to a limited number of functions

        </p>
        <p>
            We’re going to create a simple C# application that triggers a virtual keyboard event for the media
            play/pause button present on some keyboards when the application is open and then configure Lenovo
            Vantage to open it when the F12 key is pressed. This allows us to have a play/pause button on our keyboard.
        </p>
        <p>
            In your plain text editor of choice (I used Notepad++) create a file called <code>f12-play-pause.cs</code>;
            this will be the source code for our application. In it, add the following text:
        </p>
        <pre><code>using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

public class Program
{
    public const int KEYEVENTF_EXTENTEDKEY = 1;
    public const int KEYEVENTF_KEYUP = 0;
    public const int VK_MEDIA_PLAY_PAUSE = 0xB3;

    [DllImport("user32.dll")]
    public static extern void keybd_event(byte virtualKey, byte scanCode, uint flags, IntPtr extraInfo);

    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        keybd_event(VK_MEDIA_PLAY_PAUSE, 0, KEYEVENTF_EXTENTEDKEY, IntPtr.Zero);
    }
}</code></pre>
        <p>

            When this program is run, it’ll execute the <code>Main()</code> method, which has one command: trigger a
            keyboard event for the <code>MEDIA_PLAY_PAUSE</code> key. Once this single command is run, the application
            is closed and you’re returned to what you were doing before. In practice, this happens so quickly that
            there’s virtually no interruption and the only indication that an application is being opened for this is a
            slight flicker in the Taskbar.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that we have the source code for our application, we need to compile it into an exe file. If you don’t
            already have a C# development set up, the easiest way I’ve found to compile this application is to use
            <a href="https://github.com/oleg-shilo/cs-script" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CS-Script</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to compile the script using CS-Script you first need to install it; this can be easily done by
            <a href="https://github.com/oleg-shilo/cs-script/releases/latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">downloading
                the latest release from Github</a>, extracting the folder (you might also need to install 7-Zip to open
            the archive), and double-clicking <code>install.cmd</code>. Once we’re done it can be easily uninstalled by
            double-clicking <code>uninstall.cmd</code> if you won't be needing it again.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that we have CS-Script installed, we can open a cmd window and navigate to the folder where we saved
            f12-play-pause.cs. First test that your script is working correctly by running:
        </p>
        <pre><code>cscs f12-play-pause.cs</code></pre>
        <p>
            Once you're sure that the script runs correctly using this command, run the following command to compile it
            to a file (<code>-e</code> stands for export, in that it's exporting the compiled application to a file
            instead of just running it):
        </p>
        <pre><code>cscs -e f12-play-pause.cs</code></pre>
        <p>
            This will generate a new file called <code>f12-play-pause.exe</code>, which should simulate a play/pause
            button pressed when open. Make sure this application is working properly and move it to somewhere you’re
            okay with keeping it permanently.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, it’s time to connect our new application to the F12/User-defined key. Open Lenovo Vantage and
            select “Input &amp; accessories” from the Device dropdown.

        <p>
            Scroll down and select “Open applications or files” option in the Action User Defined Key dropdown. You’ll
            now be presented with two options: Applications to open and Files to open. Interestingly, our new
            application isn’t available through the Applications option, so we need to instead click on the Add button
            in the “Files to open” section and select our <code>f12-play-pause.exe</code> application.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our application won't display in the list unless you restart Lenovo Vantage (after which it'll appear as a
            nameless entry in the Applications list), but now when you click F12 on your keyboard your music will toggle
            between play and pause.

            I am, of course, always looking for ways to improve this setup; feel free to add any comments, questions, or

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This is the first part of a three part (II, III) discussion of an idea I am going to term (<a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/2021/01/warrior-episode-forty-one/">borrowing from one of its proponents</a>) the ‘universal warrior’ – the idea that there is a transcendent sameness about either the warrior experience or warrior values which provides some sort of useful blueprint for today or a fundamental truth about viewing the past (it is generally presented as both).</p>



<p>Of course the ‘universal warrior’ is not meant literally; no one, <a href="https://theimaginativeconservative.org/2016/05/through-a-glass-darkly-george-s-patton.html">save George S. Patton</a>, is claiming that a single warrior was reincarnated through a host of battles, always the same in each case.  <strong>Rather, the claim that there is a ‘universal warrior’ is really a claim that there is a universal <em>war experience</em></strong>, which all combatants in all wars take part of and which remains largely unchanged or that there is fundamentally a <strong>universal set of warrior values, behaviors or attributes</strong> which define combatant through the ages and through different kinds of armies, different kinds of service</p>



<p>And that notion is a popular one, appearing equally at home in <a href="https://youtu.be/A50lVLtSQik">anti-war songs</a> and <a href="https://angrystaffofficer.com/2016/12/14/stop-calling-us-warriors/">military recruitment propaganda </a>(along with<a href="https://youtu.be/62tnJtLBQzQ"> lava monsters</a>).  Most recently, my attention was drawn to it by a series of what are effectively <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/category/the-warrior-archetype/">self-help videos</a> framed around the idea by best-selling author Steven Pressfield and I am going to use those videos as the clear form of the argument I want to engage.  In part, this is because Pressfield makes the argument in almost all of its fullness, making many of the implications (‘warrior societies,’ the life advice, the transcendent connection between ‘warriors’ past and present, the implication that ‘warrior’ life is more morally pure and so on) explicit and clear.  And also because Pressfield’s books – <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7rdgm4/how_accurate_is_the_depiction_of_spartan_hoplite/">his <em>fiction</em> I should note, for his historical fiction works have at best a tenuous relationship with the historical record</a> – are, among other things, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gates_of_Fire">on officer training reading lists</a></em> making it a rather important thing if he is peddling an utterly bunk notion of the past.</p>



<p>And it is not hard to see why the idea of a universal warrior value set or a universal warrior experience is an attractive notion; it offers a transcendent connection, linking the experience of combat – whether that is understood positively, as Pressfield does, or negatively as the famous song does – across generations, centuries and cultures.  And it offers the promise of turning that feeling of transcendent connection into a sense of heroism in everyday life, a blueprint for self-improvement, or a timeless model for political consciousness.</p>



<p>And it <em>feels</em> true.  After all, we call people who fought in wars even at the beginnings of written history ‘soldiers’ and ‘warriors and we call our own war-fighters ‘soldiers’ and (unfortunately) ‘warriors.’  That suggestion of equivalence is built right into our linguistic systems.  Students often marvel at the ludicrous tendency for historical artists to represent conflicts in their own deep past (like medieval manuscript illustrators depicting conflicts from classical antiquity) using present (to them) day arms, armor and tactics.  But those same students will often almost immediately fall into the mistake of assuming that combatants of the past shared the same <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/04/16/collections-a-trip-through-bertran-de-born-martial-values-in-the-12th-century-occitan-nobility/">attitudes </a>and <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/04/10/collections-antarah-ibn-shaddad-victory-songs/">motivations </a>about war as they do.</p>



<p><strong>Of course a lot of things <em>feel</em> true which aren’t</strong>.  Standing on the ground, the Earth <em>feels</em> flat, it <em>seems</em> the Sun moves across the sky; of course in reality, the Earth is a ball and in a real sense the sky moves across the Sun.  Many things are <em>intuitive</em>, they <em>feel</em> true, without <em>being</em> true.  <strong>So is there a universal combat experience?</strong></p>



<p>To probe that question, we are going to examine it in two ways. <strong> This week, we’re going to look at the <em>kinds</em> of people in war, what the distinctions are between them and if their experience really can be universally applied</strong>.  Then next week, we’re going to look at this question culturally and chronologically, asking if the experience of the same kinds of people in war was really the same in <em>different wars</em>, drawing heavily on the social-military-history lens which concerns itself with the experience of battle (often called the <em>Face of Battle</em>-school after J. Keegan’s <em>The Face of Battle </em>(1976)).  Then the week after that we’ll take a look at the implications (particularly for how manliness and masculinity are understood) that this historical theory and its failures have on the broader cultural constructs built around it.</p>



<p>Because – spoiler alert –<strong> there is no universal warrior </strong>(in case some of you were concerned that I was going to spend two weeks carefully explaining different categories only to conclude that they were meaningless!) and <strong>there is no universal combat experience</strong>.</p>

<p>Alright?  Let’s soldier on!</p>



<h2>Soldiers and Warriors</h2>



<p>We want to start with asking what the distinction is between <em>soldiers</em> and <em>warriors</em>. <a href="https://angrystaffofficer.com/2016/12/14/stop-calling-us-warriors/"> It is a tricky question </a>and even the <a href="https://youtu.be/7TprgnuYfyQ">U.S. Army sometimes gets it badly wrong</a> (Pressfield, I should note, draws a distinction which isn’t <em>entirely</em> wrong but is so wrapped up with <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/2020/09/warrior-episode-seven/">his dodgy effort to use discredited psychology</a> that I think it is best to start from scratch).  We have a sense that while both of these words mean ‘combatant,’ that they are not quite equivalent.</p>



<p>I suspect many of my readers (specifically the native English speakers) will immediately agree, for instance, that this fellow is a warrior, but not a soldier:</p>

<p>While these fellows, volunteers enrolled in an army for just a single conflict, are soldiers but not warriors:</p>

<p><strong>But <em>why</em>?</strong>  The etymologies of the words can actually help push us a bit in the right direction.  Warrior has a fairly obvious etymology, being related to war (itself a derivative of French <em>guerre</em>); as <em>guerre </em>becomes war, so Old French <em>guerreieor</em> became Middle English <em>werreior</em> and because that is obnoxious to say, modern English ‘warrior’ (which is why it is warrior and not ‘warrer’ as we might expect if it was regularly constructed).  By contrast, soldier comes – it has a tortured journey which I am simplifying – from the <em>sold/sould</em> French root meaning ‘pay’ which in turn comes from Latin <em>solidus</em>, a standard Late Roman coin.  So there is clearly something about pay, or the lack of pay involved in this distinction, but clearly it isn’t <em>just</em> pay or the word mercenary would suit just as well.</p>



<p>So here is the difference: <strong>a warrior is an individual who wars, because it is their foundational vocation</strong>, an irremovable part of their identity and social position, pursued for those private ends (status, wealth, place in society).  <strong>So the core of what it is to be a warrior is that it is an element of personal identity and also fundamentally individualistic</strong> (in <em>motivation</em>, to be clear, not in fighting style – many warriors fought with collective tactics, although I think it fair to say that operation in units is much more central to soldiering than the role of a warrior, who may well fight alone).  A warrior remains a warrior when the war ends.  A warrior remains a warrior if fighting alone or for themselves.</p>



<p>By contrast, a soldier is an individual who <em>soldiers</em> (notably a different verb, which includes a sense of drudgery in war-related jobs that aren’t warring <em>per se</em>) as a <em>job</em> which they may one day leave behind, under the authority of and pursued for a larger community which directs their actions, typically through a system of regular discipline.  <strong>So the core of what it is to be a soldier is that it is a not-necessarily-permanent employment and fundamentally build about being both in and in service to a group.  </strong>A soldier, when the war or their term of service ends, becomes a civilian (something a warrior generally does not do!).  A soldier without a community stops being a soldier and starts being a mercenary.</p>



<p>Incidentally, this distinction is not unique to English.  Speaking of the two languages I have the most experience in, both Greek and Latin have this distinction.  Greek has <em>machetes </em>(<em>μαχητής</em>, lit: ‘battler,’ a <em>mache</em> being a battle) and <em>polemistes</em> (πολεμιστής, lit: ‘warrior,’ a <em>polemos</em> being a war); both are more common in poetry than prose, often used to describe mythical heroes.  Interestingly the word for an individual that fights <em>out of battle order</em> (when there is a battle order) is a <em>promachos</em> (πρόμαχος, lit: ‘fore-fighter’), a frequent word in Homer.  But the standard Greek soldier wasn’t generally called any of these things, he was either a <em>hoplite</em> (ὁπλίτης, ‘full-equipped man,’ named after his equipment) or more generally a <em>stratiotes</em> (στρατιώτης, lit, ‘army-man’ but properly ‘soldier’).  That general word, <em>stratiotes</em> is striking, but its root is <em>stratos</em> (στρατός, ‘army’); a <em>stratiotes</em>, a soldier, for the ancient Greeks was defined by his membership in that larger unit, the army.  One could be a <em>machetes</em> or a <em>polemistes</em> alone, but only a <em>stratiotes</em> in an army (<em>stratos</em>), commanded, presumably, by a general (<em>strategos</em>) in service to a community.</p>



<p>Latin has the same division, with similar shades of meaning.  Latin has <em>bellator</em> (‘warrior’) from <em>bellum</em> (‘war’), but Roman soldiers are not generally <em>bellatores</em> (except in a poetic sense and even then only rarely), even when they are actively waging war.  Instead, the soldiers of Rome are <em>milites</em> (sing. <em>miles</em>).  The word is related to the Latin <em>mille</em> (‘thousand’) from the root ‘mil-‘ which indicates a collection or combination of things.  <em>Milites</em> are thus – like <em>stratiotes</em>, <strong>men put together</strong>, defined by their collective action for the community (strikingly, groups acting for individual aims in Latin are not <em>milites</em> but <em>latrones</em>, bandits – a word Roman authors also …</p></div></div>

The vaccine worked better in the U.S. — 72 per cent effective against moderate to severe COVID-19 — compared to 57 per cent in South Africa, where it was up against an easier-to-spread mutated virus.</p>  <p>Dr. Matthew Oughton, an infectious disease&nbsp;specialist at Jewish General Hospital in Montreal, told CBC News the trial data "certainly looks promising for a single dose, which of course will certainly ease a lot of the logistics we've been dealing with so far with the current vaccines that have been granted approval."</p>  <p>He said by examining mixed populations across continents, the J&amp;J trial is not only "looking at differences in how different groups of people respond, that also means that they capture different viral variants, so they have a good sense of the real-world efficacy of this vaccine."</p>  <p>With vaccinations off to a rocky start globally, experts have&nbsp;been counting on a one-dose vaccine that would stretch scarce supplies and avoid the logistics nightmare of getting people to return for boosters.</p>    <h2>Greater protection&nbsp;vs. more shots</h2>  <p>But with some competing vaccines shown to be 95 per cent effective after two doses, the question is whether somewhat less protection is an acceptable tradeoff for getting more shots in arms quickly.</p>  <p>Matthew Miller, an associate professor at the Institute for Infectious Disease Research at McMaster University, told CBC News by email that the decision will depend on multiple factors, including "the procurement timelines for specific vaccines in each country" and how prevalent the newly circulating variants become.</p>  <p>"Some high-risk populations may need vaccines that confer higher degrees of protection, while less efficacious vaccines might be appropriate for lower-risk populations," he said.</p>  <p>The Canadian government signed an agreement with Johnson &amp; Johnson for up to 38 million doses of their vaccine, though as of earlier this month, officials said a vaccine schedule had not been finalized.</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH \ Dr. Matthew Oughton, infectious diseases specialist, encouraged by data so far:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine 'very promising,' says infectious disease specialist" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1850072131736-metadata-" title="Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine 'very promising,' says infectious disease specialist"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/15/283/JNJ.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>Calling the clinical trial 'thorough,' infectious disease specialist Dr. Matthew Oughton says Johnson &amp; Johnson's single-shot COVID-19 vaccine is also easier to handle logistically compared to approved vaccines in Canada.<!-- --> <!-- -->3:40</span></span></span></p>  <p>J&amp;J said that within a week, it will file an application for emergency use in the U.S., and then abroad. It expects to supply 100 million doses to the U.S. by June, and expects to have some ready to ship as soon as authorities give the green light.</p>  <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has set a 50 per cent threshold for any COVID-19 vaccine to be considered for emergency use authorization.</p>  <h2>No deaths reported in the vaccine group</h2>  <p>The J&amp;J data comes from&nbsp;preliminary findings from a study of 44,000 volunteers that isn't completed yet. Researchers tracked illnesses starting 28 days after vaccination — about the time when people getting a two-dose vaccine would have needed another shot.</p>  <p>After day 28, no one who got vaccinated needed hospitalization or died, regardless of whether they were exposed to "regular COVID or these particularly nasty variants," Dr. Mathai Mammen, global research chief for J&amp;J's Janssen Pharmaceutical unit, told The Associated Press.&nbsp;When the vaccinated did become infected, they had a milder illness.</p>  <p>Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also was particularly encouraged by the findings with respect to patients with the most serious symptoms.</p>  <p>"This really tells us that we have now a value-added vaccine candidate," said Fauci at a Friday briefing of U.S. health officials in President Joe Biden's administration.</p>    <p>Defeating the scourge that has killed more than two million people worldwide will require vaccinating billions, and the shots currently being rolled out in different countries&nbsp;require two doses a few weeks apart for full protection. Early data is mixed on exactly how well all the different kinds work, but shots made by Pfizer and Moderna appear to be about 95 per cent protective after the second dose.</p>  <p>But amid shortages, some countries have advised delaying the second dose of certain vaccines with little data on how that would affect protection.</p>  <h2>Company also testing 2-shot vaccine</h2>  <p>All COVID-19 vaccines train the body to recognize the new coronavirus, usually by spotting the spike&nbsp;protein that coats it. But they're made in very different ways.</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH \ Canadian labs working hard to track new variatns:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="Growing concern about COVID-19 variants in Canada" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1848895043807-metadata-" title="Growing concern about COVID-19 variants in Canada"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/940/735/boudjikanian-variant-concerns.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>COVID-19 numbers are falling, but Canadian health officials are becoming increasingly concerned about the presence of two coronavirus variants. A variant first found in the U.K. has been confirmed in three provinces while a variant first discovered in South Africa variant has been found in two provinces.<!-- --> <!-- -->4:15</span></span></span></p>  <p>J&amp;J's shot uses a cold virus like a Trojan horse to carry the spike gene into the body, where cells make harmless copies of the protein to prime the immune system in case the real virus comes along.</p>  <p>Rival AstraZeneca makes a similar cold virus vaccine that requires two doses. Both the AstraZeneca and J&amp;J vaccines can be stored in a refrigerator, making them easier to ship and&nbsp;use in developing countries than the frozen kind made by Pfizer and Moderna.</p>  <p>J&amp;J said its vaccine works consistently in a broad range of people: A third of participants were over age 60, and more than 40 per cent had other illnesses putting them at risk of severe COVID-19, including obesity, diabetes and HIV.</p>  <h2>Vaccine producers need to be 'nimble': Fauci</h2>  <p>J&amp;J said the vaccine is safe, with reactions similar to other COVID-19 shots, such as fever, that occur when the immune system is revved up.</p>  <p>"Gambling on one dose was certainly worthwhile," said&nbsp;Mammen, but J&amp;J has&nbsp;hedged its bets with a study of a two-dose version of its vaccine, which is still underway.</p>  <p>While it released few details, the company said there were no serious allergic reactions. But occasionally other COVID-19 vaccines trigger such reactions, which can be reversed if promptly treated — and authorities have warned people to be on the lookout regardless of which type of vaccine is used.</p>  <p>A handful of coronavirus variants have gained attention in recent weeks, a development that Fauci and the new director of the Centers for Disease Control described as one to be expected.</p>  <p>"I think we should be treating every case right now as if it's a variant," said the CDC's Dr. Rochelle Walensky.</p>  <p>"We will continue to see the evolution of mutants," said&nbsp;Fauci. "We will have to be nimble to adjust to make versions of the vaccine that are actually specifically directed to whatever mutations are prevalent at the time."</p>  <p>Friday's interim results come on the heels of another vaccine in final testing. Novavax reported this week that its vaccine appears 89 per cent effective in a U.K. study, and that it also seems to work — though not as well — against new mutated versions of the virus circulating in Britain and South Africa. A larger study in the U.S. and Mexico is still enrolling volunteers.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

Demand soared after Beijing last year imposed a sweeping new national security law on the former British colony following months of pro-democracy protests.</p>    <p>"The British side's attempt to turn a large number of Hong Kong people into second-class British citizens has completely changed the nature of the two sides' original understanding of BNO," Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing.</p>  <p>"This move seriously infringes on China's sovereignty, grossly interferes in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs, and seriously violates international law and the basic norms of international relations. China will no longer recognize the so-called BNO passport as a travel document and proof of identity starting from Jan. 31, and reserves the right to take further measures."</p>  <h2>Multiple passports</h2>  <p>Many Hong Kongers carry multiple passports and it is unclear what if anything the Chinese government could do to prevent people entering the U.K. through the BNO visa plan. As a further protection of personal privacy, a cellphone app will allow applicants to download their biometric information without having to be&nbsp;seen visiting the British visa office.</p>  <p>The BNO passport was originally a disappointment for Hong Kongers when it was first offered ahead of Hong Kong's handover to Chinese rule in 1997. At the time, it offered only the right to visit for six months with no right to work or become a full citizen. Applicants had to have been born before the handover date.</p>    <p>However, pressure grew to expand such privileges as China increasingly cracked down on civil and political life in Hong Kong in what critics say violates China's commitment to maintain the city's separate way of life for 50 years after the handover. China first declared the 1984 Sino-British Declaration setting out the handover arrangements null and void despite its recognition by the United Nations, then imposed the national security law on the territory after the city's legislature was unable to pass it on its own.</p>  <p>"I am immensely proud that we have brought in this new route for Hong Kong BNOs to live, work and make their home in our country," British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a statement.</p>  <p>"In doing so we have honoured our profound ties of history and friendship with the people of Hong Kong, and we have stood up for freedom and autonomy —&nbsp;values both the U.K. and Hong Kong hold dear."</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <header>  <nav> <a href="https://mjj.io/">Home</a> <a href="https://mjj.io/about">About</a> <a href="https://mjj.io/rss.xml">RSS</a> </nav> </header> <section>  <time datetime="2021-01-26T00:00:00+00:00"> Tuesday, January 26, 2021 </time> <p>During the recent holiday season, I decided to put my admittedly limited Haskell skills to use. While the <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/">CIS 194</a> course exercises are excellent for learning and practicing Haskell, and I enjoy working through them when time permits, I wanted to work on a more structured “real world” project this time.</p> <p>I had a few goals in mind for this particular project. First and foremost, it had to be a well-defined and relatively simple problem that I needed to solve. Secondly, I wanted it to require me to handle IO and side effects, and, lastly, I wanted it to offer me an opportunity to integrate third-party libraries in my app.</p> <p>Only a couple of weeks prior to starting this project, I had been reading the <a href="https://www.eff.org/dice">guide</a> by the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> on how to generate strong six-word <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware">Diceware</a> passphrases. Turning their suggested method into a small command-line utility seemed to suit my three goals nicely, so I decided to give it the old college try. In this blog post, I will elaborate on how this method of generating passphrases works and how it can be implemented in Haskell. The entire project can be found on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/majjoha/passphrase">here</a>.</p> <p>The steps needed to generate a passphrase using the directions provided by EFF are fairly simple, and you only need five dice and a <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2016/07/18/eff_large_wordlist.txt">wordlist</a>:</p> <ol> <li>Roll five dice at the same time and write down the five numbers. The numbers might be something like 4, 3, 4, 6, 3.</li> <li>In your wordlist, find the word that matches the number 43463 (in this case, panoramic), and write it down.</li> <li>Repeat these two steps until you have (at least) six words. Once you have repeated the steps, you might have a passphrase such as “whinny daffodil aerobics upheld bankable niece.”</li> </ol> <p>Before detailing the implementation, it should be noted that the project uses <a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/rio"><code>rio</code></a> as a prelude replacement by setting <code>{-# LANGUAGE NoImplicitPrelude #-}</code> and importing <code>RIO</code> in all files. With our project description in place, we are now ready to implement it.</p> <p>In order to solve the first step, we need to be able to roll five dice and join the numbers into a single digit. To do so, we define a <code>rollDice</code> function:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>rollDice</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Integer</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Integer</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>[</span><span>Integer</span><span>]</span>
<span>rollDice</span> <span>rolls</span> <span>start</span> <span>end</span> <span>=</span> <span>replicateM</span> <span>rolls</span> <span>$</span> <span>generateBetween</span> <span>start</span> <span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p><code>rollDice</code> takes three arguments: <code>rolls</code> which describes how many dice we want to roll, and <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> which respectively describe the start and end of the range of numbers, we will be working with. Here, we rely on <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cryptonite-0.27/docs/Crypto-Number-Generate.html#v:generateBetween"><code>generateBetween</code></a> from the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cryptonite">Cryptonite</a> library to generate a random number within our range. Since our result is wrapped in a monad, we need to use <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.1.0/docs/Control-Monad.html#v:replicateM"><code>replicateM</code></a> to repeat this process N times.</p> <p>Next, we need to be able to join these digits into one. To do this, we will define a function <code>joinDigits</code> in the following manner:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>joinDigits</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>Integer</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Integer</span>
<span>joinDigits</span> <span>=</span> <span>L</span><span>.</span><span>foldl'</span> <span>((</span><span>+</span><span>)</span> <span>.</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span> <span>10</span><span>))</span> <span>0</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This function takes a list of <code>Integer</code>s and uses <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-List.html#v:foldl-39-"><code>L.foldl'</code></a> to combine them into one.</p> <p>For every element in the list, we multiply our accumulator with 10 and then add the first element in our list to the result. This process is repeated until our list is empty. For instance, given the numbers 5, 2, 3, 1, 6, and 0 as our initial accumulator value, this is how our result is calculated:</p> <div><div><pre><code>0                  # Initial accumulator value
0*10+5    = 5      # The list is now [2, 3, 1, 6]
5*10+2    = 52     # The list is now [3, 1, 6]
52*10+3   = 523    # The list is now [1, 6]
523*10+1  = 5231   # The list is now [6]
5231*10+6 = 52316  # The list is now []
</code></pre></div></div> <p>With these two functions defined, we now have the necessary parts for generating the indices which we will need later when pairing dice rolls with words. To pair indices with words, we will need a function <code>toTuple</code>:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>toTuple</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>String</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>Integer</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span>
<span>toTuple</span> <span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>""</span><span>)</span>
<span>toTuple</span> <span>(</span><span>index</span><span>:</span><span>word</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>fromMaybe</span> <span>0</span> <span>index'</span><span>,</span> <span>fromMaybe</span> <span>""</span> <span>word'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>where</span>
    <span>index'</span> <span>=</span> <span>readMaybe</span> <span>index</span> <span>::</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Integer</span>
    <span>word'</span> <span>=</span> <span>L</span><span>.</span><span>headMaybe</span> <span>word</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p><code>toTuple</code> takes a list of <code>String</code>s and returns a tuple of <code>(Integer, String)</code> where the <code>Integer</code> represents an index, and the <code>String</code> represents the corresponding word from the wordlist. We will call this function later when we map over each line in our wordlist.</p> <p>Since a line in our wordlist follows the format “<code>11111 abacus</code>”, we want to read the first string as an <code>Integer</code> and take the first word of the remaining words in our line. As <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Partial.html#v:read"><code>read</code></a> and <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-List-Partial.html#v:head"><code>head</code></a> can throw exceptions, we use the safe alternatives <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Prelude.html#v:readMaybe"><code>readMaybe</code></a> and <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-List.html#v:headMaybe"><code>L.headMaybe</code></a> instead. To unwrap our <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Prelude-Types.html#t:Maybe"><code>Maybe</code></a> values, we call <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Prelude.html#v:fromMaybe"><code>fromMaybe</code></a> and use <code>0</code> and <code>""</code> as the default values for the index and word, respectively. Lastly, to avoid non-exhaustive patterns, we pattern match on the empty list and return <code>(0, "")</code> for good measure.</p> <p>Now we can finally move on to writing the logic for generating passphrases which is handled by the <code>passphrase</code> function:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>passphrase</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>[[</span><span>Integer</span><span>]]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span>
<span>passphrase</span> <span>wordlist</span> <span>dice</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>unwords</span> <span>$</span> <span>map</span> <span>(</span><span>flip</span> <span>(</span><span>Map</span><span>.</span><span>findWithDefault</span> <span>""</span><span>)</span> <span>wordMap</span><span>)</span> <span>indices</span>
    <span>where</span>
      <span>indices</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span> <span>joinDigits</span> <span>dice</span>
      <span>wordMap</span> <span>=</span> <span>Map</span><span>.</span><span>fromList</span> <span>$</span> <span>map</span> <span>(</span><span>toTuple</span> <span>.</span> <span>words</span><span>)</span> <span>$</span> <span>lines</span> <span>wordlist</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>To generate a passphrase, we need to pass our wordlist as the first argument and then a list containing a list of our dice rolls as the second argument. The first argument will look like this:</p> <div><div><pre><code>11111 abacus
11112 abdomen
11113 abdominal
11114 abide
11115 abiding
11116 ability
11121 ablaze
11122 able
11123 abnormal
11124 abrasion
11125 abrasive
11126 abreast
11131 abridge
...
</code></pre></div></div> <p>While the second argument, i.e., our dice rolls, might look like this:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>[</span> <span>[</span><span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>]</span>
<span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>]</span>
<span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>]</span>
<span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>]</span>
<span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>]</span>
<span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>6</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>]</span>
<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>For all the lists in our list of dice rolls, we use our previously defined <code>joinDigits</code> function to join the numbers in the list into single digits. We then store these digits, or indices, in the <code>indices</code> variable, so we can use them later when we need to look up words in our wordlist.</p> <p>As shown above, the wordlist follows the format <code>INDEX WORD</code>, so we split our wordlist on line breaks using <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Prelude.html#v:lines"><code>lines</code></a> which gives us a list of <code>String</code>s containing elements such as <code>"11111 abacus"</code> and <code>"11112 abdomen"</code>. We want to further break these elements down so we will end up with a list of tuples. To do so, we map over all the lines in our wordlist and call <code>(toTuple . words)</code> on them. Now that we have a list of tuples, we can convert it to a <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Map.html#t:Map"><code>Map</code></a> using <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Map.html#v:fromList"><code>Map.fromList</code></a> so we can perform efficient lookups later.</p> <p>For all our indices, we want to find the corresponding word in our wordlist which we do with <code>map (flip (Map.findWithDefault "") wordMap) indices</code>. Since <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Map.html#v:findWithDefault"><code>Map.findWithDefault</code></a> expects the index of the map to be the second argument and the map to be the last, we use two useful techniques here to make our code less convoluted. First, we leverage currying by applying <code>""</code> as the first argument to <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Map.html#v:findWithDefault"><code>Map.findWithDefault</code></a>, and then we use <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Prelude.html#v:flip"><code>flip</code></a> to reverse the order of the last two arguments.</p> <p>By flipping the order, we can now do a simple map over our <code>indices</code> variable and perform a lookup in our <code>wordMap</code> in a slightly more elegant fashion. Once we have all our words, we can join them into a single <code>String</code> using <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-List.html#v:unwords"><code>unwords</code></a>.</p> <p>With the fundamental logic now defined, we only need to read our wordlist from a file, throw five dice six times, and pass these two values to our <code>passphrase</code> function. We do so by defining the entry point of our app in <a href="https://github.com/majjoha/passphrase/blob/main/app/Main.hs"><code>Main.hs</code></a> as such:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>wordlist</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>T</span><span>.</span><span>unpack</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> <span>readFileUtf8</span> <span>"data/eff-large-wordlist.txt"</span>
  <span>dice</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>replicateM</span> <span>6</span> <span>$</span> <span>rollDice</span> <span>5</span> <span>1</span> <span>6</span>
  <span>runSimpleApp</span> <span>$</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>logInfo</span> <span>.</span> <span>display</span> <span>.</span> <span>T</span><span>.</span><span>pack</span> <span>$</span> <span>passphrase</span> <span>wordlist</span> <span>dice</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This largely resembles the steps listed earlier. To retrieve our wordlist, we call <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO.html#v:readFileUtf8"><code>readFileUtf8</code></a> with the path to our wordlist, and then <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Text.html#v:unpack"><code>T.unpack</code></a> to convert the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Text.html#t:Text"><code>Text</code></a> value into a <code>String</code>.</p> <p>Next, we roll our five dice six times by calling <code>replicateM 6 $ rollDice 5 1 6</code>, and pass our <code>wordlist</code> and <code>dice</code> to the <code>passphrase</code> function.</p> <p>After calling our <code>passphrase</code> function, we now have a passphrase that we need to output in our terminal. Following the conventional structure for how to build apps using <a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/rio"><code>rio</code></a>, we run our app as a <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.15.0/docs/RIO-Prelude-Simple.html#t:SimpleApp"><code>SimpleApp</code></a> which provides a convenient default configuration. We convert the result from our <code>passphrase</code> function into a <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Text.html#t:Text"><code>Text</code></a> value, then a <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.15.0/docs/RIO.html#t:Utf8Builder"><code>Utf8Builder</code></a>, and, lastly, print it in our terminal with <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.15.0/docs/RIO.html#v:logInfo"><code>logInfo</code></a>.</p> <p>With everything in place, we have now reached our goal and can finally build our project by running <code>stack build</code> and generate a passphrase:</p> <div><div><pre><code>% stack exec -- passphrase
polar geek nimble okay appealing trim
</code></pre></div></div> <p>In my experience, the Haskell community is great at sharing their knowledge on both Twitter and in various blog posts. With this blog post, I hope to contribute back to the community and help especially the people newer to the language who might want to move beyond contrived exercises and learn how to build smaller apps. If you are interested, you can find the project on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/majjoha/passphrase">here</a>, and if you have any feedback, I am all ears.</p> </section> </div></div>]]>

<p>Arguably one of the strangest events in European history, to this day the exact cause of the plague is still up for debate.</p>

<p>When one thinks of the great European plagues we imagine the horrors of the <a href="https://www.historytoday.com/ole-j-benedictow/black-death-greatest-catastrophe-ever">Black Death</a>, which rampaged its way across medieval Europe. High born or peasant, all were subject to the misery it brought to our towns and villages.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_plague_of_1518">Dancing Plague</a>, however, appears quite comical at first glance. Its victims displayed signs of delirium and their symptoms were a relentless need to dance and contort their bodies.</p>

<p>The event took place in the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alsace"> Alsace</a> region – which at the time was part of the<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Holy-Roman-Empire"> Holy Roman Empire</a> – and over 400 people are said to have fallen victim to this mania.</p><p>The first alleged case of the Dancing Plague arose when a Strasbourg native, Mrs Troffea, began to dance in the street. Within a matter of days, others in Strasbourg has joined Mrs Troffea and quickly the numbers began to swell.</p><p>Within a month there were scores of people dancing for up to six days at a time, resulting in death by exhaustion, heart attack or stroke.</p>



<p>As the situation deteriorated, many concerned nobles in the Alsace region sought the advice of physicians and the clergy. Many believed the mania currently being exhibited on their streets were being caused by astrological events or even witchcraft.</p>

<p>Physicians denied the notion of the supernatural and instead believed the cause of this epidemic to be a natural one. ‘Hot blood’ was the prognosis, and in an even stranger turn of events, the physicians actually advised that those suffering continue to dance so as to wear off the effects of the affliction.</p>

<p>Authorities even went so far as to draft in musicians to assist in the affair. The reality, however, is that those affected by this bizarre ‘disease’ were pushing their bodies to the limit of human endurance.</p>

<p>When one considers the strain that long-distance running, swimming or other forms of exercise have upon the body, then dancing near continuously for days on end without hydration or food is very dangerous.</p><h4><strong>Potential Causes</strong></h4>

<p>There are a number of theories that point toward the source of this outbreak in 1518, which was not the first time a dancing epidemic had occurred. In the late 14th century, a similar event took place in modern-day Belgium and Luxembourg.</p>

<p>One cause points toward ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergot">ergot</a>‘, a psychotropic mould that grows on rye crops. This substance is known to cause delusions and spasms, however, it also cuts off blood supply to the extremities, making basic movement very difficult.</p>

<p>Another popular modern hypothesis is that the cause was simply mass-hysteria. The same general region had seen similar occurrences in the past, and on both occasions, the regions in question were blighted by famine, disease and social &amp; religious unrest.</p><p>This was a particularly tumultuous time in European history, and with social upheaval also comes uncertainty and fear.</p>

<p>People in the 16th century were very spiritual and we see on many occasions that superstition can lead to hysteria, unrest, and even violence. Historian John Waller hypothesises that whilst in a distressed psychological state, the people of Strasbourg may have entered a trance. Thereafter, the issue was exacerbated by the superstitious nature of their neighbours and peers.</p>

<p>There is no denying that the Dancing Plague spread very quickly, and almost appears to take the form of a contagious disease. Spreading quickly throughout the peasantry the hysteria brought turmoil to Strasbourg, and it is an event that still baffles many to this day.</p>

"So we think that public rules by Parliament would help clarify these things and obviously apply across the internet."</p>  <p>Chan said Facebook already removes content considered illegal in Canada such as hate speech, revenge porn, and content involving child exploitation or terrorism. It also applies other Canadian laws such as removing ads for things like baby walkers that Health Canada has prohibited for sale in Canada.</p>  <p>Chan said Facebook also goes further and removes content that isn't illegal in Canada such as posts involving nudity, bullying or harassment. While Chan said Facebook has a sophisticated system in place, he said it would welcome a move by Parliament to help draw the line between prohibited and allowable content.</p>  <p>"We would welcome further rules. We would welcome further guidance and we would ... welcome rules that apply to everyone equally."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5155004.1587157658!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/facebook-canada-public-policy-kevin-chan.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5155004.1587157658!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/facebook-canada-public-policy-kevin-chan.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5155004.1587157658!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/facebook-canada-public-policy-kevin-chan.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5155004.1587157658!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/facebook-canada-public-policy-kevin-chan.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5155004.1587157658!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/facebook-canada-public-policy-kevin-chan.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5155004.1587157658!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/facebook-canada-public-policy-kevin-chan.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Facebook Canada's global director and head of public policy Kevin Chan says the tech giant would welcome clearer rules regarding what can - and can't - be posted online.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Chris Wattie/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Chan said Facebook would also like to see stronger privacy legislation and has called for changes in tax provisions such as collecting and remitting sales tax to the government.</p>  <p>However, Chan said it would be a mistake for Canada to try to follow Australia's attempt to force tech giants to pay news media for their content shared on Facebook.&nbsp;</p>    <p>"Some of the ideas that we've seen discussed, such as the ones proposed in Australia where Facebook would be required to pay for links that are shared on our platform that we don't control, is going to be unworkable, we wouldn't be able to make that work because that's just not how things get shared onto Facebook."</p>  <h2>Legislation on tech giants expected</h2>  <p>Chan's comments come as he and Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault are each scheduled to testify separately today before the House of Commons heritage committee on the relationship between Facebook and the government. The hearing was convened following a news report last fall suggesting that the tech giant's relationship with some Canadian government officials was too cozy.</p>  <p>In his latest mandate letter, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau charged Guilbeault with ensuring that the revenues of web giants are shared more fairly with creators and the media. Guilbeault is also tasked with making sure social media companies&nbsp;"take action on combating hate groups and online hate and harassment, ideologically motivated violent extremism and terrorist organizations."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5366690.1611961724!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/trudeau-cabinet-20191120.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5366690.1611961724!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/trudeau-cabinet-20191120.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5366690.1611961724!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/trudeau-cabinet-20191120.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5366690.1611961724!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/trudeau-cabinet-20191120.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5366690.1611961724!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/trudeau-cabinet-20191120.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5366690.1611961724!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/trudeau-cabinet-20191120.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault is set to testify today before the House of Commons heritage committee. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Camille Gagné-Raynault, press secretary to Guilbeault, said the government is planning to introduce two separate pieces of legislation related to tech giants.

More recently, Facebook removed militarized social networks from its platform and QAnon conspiracy sites.</p>    <p>Chan said Facebook is working with Canadian experts like Barbara Perry, director of the Centre on Hate, Bias and Extremism at Ontario Tech University, to identify extremist content and block it. But as Facebook removes things like hate speech, those trying to disseminate it try to find ways to get around Facebook's systems.</p>  <p>"If we start removing certain people, certain presences on Facebook and Instagram, it is very possible that they evolve their tactics and try to work around our enforcement measures," said Chan.

<h2 id="what-is-pony">What is Pony?</h2>

<p>Pony is an open-source, object-oriented, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">actor-model</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security">capabilities-secure</a>, high-performance programming language.</p>

<p>If you are looking to jump in and get started with Pony <em>right now</em>, you can try it in your browser using the <a href="http://playground.ponylang.io/">Pony Playground</a>. Keep reading if you are interested in what makes Pony different and why you should consider using it.</p>

<p>If you are interested in the early history of Pony and how it came into existence, you’re in luck: <a href="https://www.ponylang.io/blog/2017/05/an-early-history-of-pony/">“An Early History of Pony”</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-makes-pony-different">What makes Pony different?</h2>

<h3 id="pony-is-type-safe">Pony is type safe</h3>

<p><em>Really type safe</em>. There’s a mathematical <a href="https://www.ponylang.io/media/papers/fast-cheap-with-proof.pdf">proof</a> and everything.</p>

<h3 id="pony-is-memory-safe">Pony is memory safe</h3>

<p>There are no dangling pointers and no buffer overruns. The language doesn’t even have the concept of null!</p>

<h3 id="exception-safe">Exception-Safe</h3>

<p>There are no runtime exceptions. All exceptions have defined semantics, and they are <em>always</em> caught.</p>

<h3 id="data-race-free">Data-race Free</h3>

<p>Pony doesn’t have locks nor atomic operations or anything like that. Instead, the type system ensures at compile time that your concurrent program can never have data races. So you can write highly concurrent code and never get it wrong.</p>

<h3 id="deadlock-free">Deadlock-Free</h3>

<p>This one is easy because Pony has no locks at all! So they definitely don’t deadlock, because they don’t exist!</p>

<h3 id="native-code">Native Code</h3>

<p>Pony is an ahead-of-time (AOT) compiled language. There is no interpreter nor virtual machine.</p>

<h3 id="compatible-with-c">Compatible with C</h3>

<p>Pony programs can natively call C libraries. Our compiler is able to generate a C-header file for Pony libraries. Consequently, C/C++ programs can natively call Pony programs!</p>

<h2 id="why-pony">Why Pony?</h2>

<p>There’s plenty to love about Pony, but more than anything else, what we love most is that Pony makes it easy to write fast, safe, efficient, highly concurrent programs. How? The Pony type system introduces a novel concept: “reference capabilities”. <a href="https://tutorial.ponylang.io/capabilities/reference-capabilities.html">Reference capabilities</a> allow you to label different bits of data based on how that data can be shared. The Pony compiler will then verify that you are in fact correctly using the data based on the labels you provide. Reference capabilities combined with Pony’s actor model of concurrency makes for a powerful pairing. Let’s dig in and take a quick look:</p>

<h3 id="mutable-state-is-hard">Mutable state is hard</h3>

<p>The problem with concurrency is shared mutable data. If two different threads have access to the same piece of data then they might try to update it at the same time. At best this can lead to those two threads having different versions of the data. At worst the updates can interact badly resulting in the data being overwritten with garbage. The standard way to avoid these problems is to use locks to prevent data updates from happening at the same time. This causes big performance hits and is very difficult to get right, so it causes lots of bugs.</p>

<h3 id="immutable-data-can-be-safely-shared">Immutable data can be safely shared</h3>

<p>Any data that is immutable (i.e. it cannot be changed) is safe to use concurrently. Since it is immutable it is never updated and it’s the updates that cause concurrency problems.</p>

<h3 id="isolated-data-is-safe">Isolated data is safe</h3>

<p>If a block of data has only one reference to it then we call it <em>isolated</em>. Since there is only one reference to it, isolated data cannot be <em>shared</em> by multiple threads, so there are no concurrency problems. Isolated data can be passed between multiple threads. As long as only one of them has a reference to it at a time then the data is still safe from concurrency problems.</p>

<h3 id="every-actor-is-single-threaded">Every actor is single threaded</h3>

<p>The code within a single actor is never run concurrently. This means that, within a single actor, data updates cannot cause problems. It’s only when we want to share data between actors that we have problems.</p>

<h3 id="reference-capabilities-enforce-safe-data-handling">Reference capabilities enforce safe data handling</h3>

<p>By sharing only immutable data and exchanging only isolated data we can have safe concurrent programs without locks. The problem is that it’s very difficult to do that correctly. If you accidentally hang on to a reference to some isolated data you’ve handed over or change something you’ve shared as immutable then everything goes wrong. What you need is for the compiler to force you to live up to your promises. Pony reference capabilities allow the compiler to do just that.</p>

<p>If you ask us, that’s pretty damn cool and a hell of a reason to give Pony a try.</p>

<h2 id="why-not-pony">Why not Pony?</h2>

<p>There are many valid reasons to not use Pony. Amongst these are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lack of API stability</li>
<li>Lack of high-quality 3rd party libraries</li>
<li>Limited native tooling</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="api-stability">API stability</h3>

<p>Pony is pre-1.0. We regularly have releases that involve breaking changes. This lack of stability is plenty of reason for many projects to avoid using Pony.</p>

<h3 id="batteries-required">Batteries required</h3>

<p>If your project is going to succeed or fail based on the size of community around the tools you are using, Pony is not a good choice for you. While it’s possible to write stable, high-performance applications using Pony, you will have to do a decent amount of work. The pool of open source, ready to use Pony libraries is very small. If it’s not in the standard library then odds are you are going to have to add it yourself, either by writing it from scratch in Pony or by wrapping an existing C library using Pony’s excellent <a href="https://tutorial.ponylang.io/c-ffi/">C-FFI</a> functionality.</p>

<h3 id="tooling">Tooling</h3>

<p>There’s a wide swath of tooling that some people have come to expect that isn’t currently available for Pony. We don’t have an IDE. You can use standard debuggers like GDB or LLDB but the experience still has some rough edges. If you are comfortable working with a basic text editor and using LLDB, VTune and other tools, you’ll probably be ok. Just don’t expect a full, robust ecosystem. We aren’t there yet.</p>

<p>If your project isn’t going to get a great deal of benefit from any of Pony’s strengths, then you shouldn’t use Pony. If you are writing a single threaded application without any overriding performance concerns, and you need access to a large community and wealth of libraries then you’re much better off selecting another language. However, we hope that you see enough potential in Pony to start playing around with it even if it isn’t right for your current project.</p>

<h2 id="the-pony-philosophy">The Pony Philosophy</h2>

<p>In the spirit of <a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html">Richard Gabriel</a>, the Pony philosophy is neither “the-right-thing” nor “worse-is-better”. It is “get-stuff-done”.</p>

<h3 id="correctness">Correctness</h3>

<p>Incorrectness is simply not allowed. <em>It’s pointless to try to get stuff done if you can’t guarantee the result is correct.</em></p>

<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>

<p>Runtime speed is more important than everything except correctness. If performance must be sacrificed for correctness, try to come up with a new way to do things. <em>The faster the program can get stuff done, the better. This is more important than anything except a correct result.</em></p>

<h3 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h3>

<p>Simplicity can be sacrificed for performance. It is more important for the interface to be simple than the implementation. <em>The faster the programmer can get stuff done, the better. It’s ok to make things a bit harder on the programmer to improve performance, but it’s more important to make things easier on the programmer than it is to make things easier on the language/runtime.</em></p>

<h3 id="consistency">Consistency</h3>

<p>Consistency can be sacrificed for simplicity or performance.
<em>Don’t let excessive consistency get in the way of getting stuff done.</em></p>

<h3 id="completeness">Completeness</h3>

<p>It’s nice to cover as many things as possible, but completeness can be sacrificed for anything else. <em>It’s better to get some stuff done now than wait until everything can get done later.</em></p>

<p>The “get-stuff-done” approach has the same attitude towards correctness and simplicity as “the-right-thing”, but the same attitude towards consistency and completeness as “worse-is-better”. It also adds performance as a new principle, treating it as the second most important thing (after correctness).</p>

<h2 id="guiding-principles">Guiding Principles</h2>

<p>Throughout the design and development of the language, the following principles should be adhered to.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use the get-stuff-done approach.</p></li>

<li><p>Simple grammar. Language must be trivial to parse for both humans and computers.</p></li>

<li><p>No loadable code. Everything is known to the compiler.</p></li>

<li><p>Fully type safe. There is no “trust me, I know what I’m doing” coercion.</p></li>

<li><p>Fully memory safe. There is no “this random number is really a pointer, honest.”</p></li>

<li><p>No crashes. A program that compiles should never crash (although it may hang or do something unintended).</p></li>

<li><p>Sensible error messages. Where possible use simple error messages for specific error cases. It is fine to assume the programmer knows the definitions of words in our lexicon, but avoid compiler or other computer science jargon.</p></li>

<li><p>Inherent build system. No separate applications required to configure or build.</p></li>

<li><p>Aim to reduce common programming bugs through the use of restrictive syntax.</p></li>

<li><p>Provide a single, clean and clear way to do things rather than catering to every programmer’s preferred prejudices.</p></li>

<li><p>Make upgrades clean. Do not try to merge new features with the ones they are replacing, if something is broken remove it and replace it in one go. Where possible provide rewrite utilities to upgrade source between language versions.</p></li>

<li><p>Reasonable build time. Keeping down build time is important, but less important than runtime performance and correctness.</p></li>

<li><p>Allowing the programmer to omit some things from the code (default arguments, type inference, etc) is fine, but fully specifying should always be allowed.</p></li>

<li><p>No ambiguity. The programmer should never have to guess what the compiler will do, or vice-versa.</p></li>

<li><p>Document required complexity. Not all language features have to be trivial to understand, but complex features must have full explanations in the docs to be allowed in the language.</p></li>

<li><p>Language features should be minimally intrusive when not used.</p></li>

<li><p>Fully defined semantics. The semantics of all language features must be available in the standard language docs. It is not acceptable to leave behavior undefined or “implementation dependent”.</p></li>

<li><p>Efficient hardware access must be available, but this does not have to pervade the whole language.</p></li>

<li><p>The standard library should be implemented in Pony.</p></li>

<li><p>Interoperability. Must be interoperable with other languages, but this may require a shim layer if non-primitive types are …</p></li></ul></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			<!-- Article Start -->
			
<p>Not long after she got home from a Women’s March event in Jakarta in 2018, Anindya Restuviani opened her Instagram account to find hundreds of follow requests — and a slew of insults. In direct messages, users said she “looked like a dog,” that her genitalia smelled, and that they would remember her face so they could rape her on the street.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Restuviani works for several feminist associations in the Indonesian capital, and a photo of her at the rally had been circulated on the Instagram account of a religious hard-liner with hundreds of thousands of followers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The scare made me take more precautions on social media, [do] more self-censorship,” Restuviani says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As civil rights groups in Indonesia increasingly come to rely on online tools for discussion and organization, female activists in the country are struggling against relentless abuse and discrimination.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From a small house on a side street in Jakarta’s Tebet District, veteran human rights activist Dhyta Caturani is trying to reclaim the internet for women and minority groups through her own initiative, PurpleCode Collective.</p>



<p>“At the beginning, there was this imagination that internet technology was a democratic space — equal, open, and a decentralized power. In reality, it is not,” Caturani says.</p>



<p>“Technology is still mostly developed by cisgender, heterosexual white men from the global north countries who have biases, therefore, many women, along with gender and sexual minority groups, are marginalized.”</p>



<p>Caturani, who often wears thick-rimmed, oversized glasses, has been on the frontlines of Indonesian civil movements for more than two decades. In 1999, at a political demonstration against military interference in the country’s politics, <a href="https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/dhyta-caturani-nothing-has-changed-indonesia">she was hospitalized</a> after being shot in the back with a plastic bullet. Since the Reformation — Indonesia’s democratic revival, which spanned the late 1990s and early 2000s — she has led a number of women’s rights campaigns, including the Purple Rose Campaign against sex trafficking; Reclaim the Night, <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/03/11/women-city-reclaim-night.html">which fought the stigma attached to women going out after dark</a>; and One Billion Rising, a movement to raise awareness about violence against women through flash-mob dance parties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the past few years, she has turned her gaze online, after concluding that women are just as unsafe in digital spaces as they are on the street. Like most women — and particularly activists — on social media, Caturani routinely faces threats of violence and abuse. In 2010,<strong> </strong>after she posted on Facebook about a protest against a government official who publicly blamed a rape victim for wearing a miniskirt on public transport, a man sent her a message saying: “You deserve to be raped. Just wait, there will be someone who comes to rape you.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Caturani says the threat was particularly disturbing because the sender wasn’t a random stranger —&nbsp;he had attended a workshop that she had been involved in. “I thought he may have known where I live,” she says.</p>

<p>Most of the threats Caturani received came from male social media users. Women do go on the attack online, but their threats are different, Caturani says. Male users often target women’s bodies and sexuality, usually through rape threats or name-calling.</p>



<p>In 2014, Caturani began to research security techniques for women online. She found that the software she needed to protect herself — even basic products, such as password managers, programs to safeguard sensitive files, and virtual private networks — were out of reach for most people in Indonesia, and especially women and marginalized groups. Getting and using them assumed layers of privilege that may not have occurred to developers — including being able to afford digital tools and being fluent enough in English to use them. “You have to have the knowledge first, and that’s a privilege,” Caturani says. “Digital security was still very masculine, so I had problems when entering the ecosystem.”</p>



<p>Those same biases have led to the creation of unsafe spaces for women, Caturani says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Indonesia, cases of online gender-based violence spiked by 300% in 2019, according to a report by Komnas Perempuan, the national commission on violence against women. Caturani says that social media platforms bear some responsibility for this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The platforms allow people to commit violence because of the way they were created. They never considered safety for women,” she says. “The platforms were built by the biases of their developers, which is why the platforms become unsafe and marginalize many people.”</p>



<p>Caturani was one of 50 activists convened by the Association for Progressive Communications, an independent network of activists, for a 2014 meeting that led to the formulation of the <a href="https://www.apc.org/en/pubs/feminist-principles-internet-version-20">Feminist Principles of the Internet</a>.</p>



<p>The 15 principles — which were updated in 2016 to include two additional points — are designed to reclaim the internet for women and minority groups. They reject surveillance, anonymity restrictions, online gender-based violence, and attempts to control data and women’s expression by the state and corporations. They ask for greater access, greater data protection, inclusion at decision-making tables, more free and open source tech, and embedding the ethics of consent into the design and policies of internet platforms.</p>



<p>In 2015, Caturani founded PurpleCode in Jakarta to help implement these principles. At the time, there was a growing number of online feminist initiatives in Indonesia. There was <a href="https://magdalene.co/"><em>Magdalene</em></a>, a feminist online magazine <a href="https://www.splicemedia.com/magdalene-indonesia/">set up in 2013</a>; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/jakartafeminist">Jakarta Feminist Discussion Group</a>, a Facebook group created in 2014 that <a href="https://www.jakartafeminist.com/">later evolved into a formal association</a>; and <a href="http://indonesiafeminis.com/">Indonesia Feminis</a>, a multiplatform provider of feminist news and events established in 2015.</p>



<p>But unlike those outlets, which simply use technology to disseminate information, Caturani says that PurpleCode’s main purpose is to question technology and disrupt its culture by encouraging more women and minority groups to become developers and to get involved in designing governance structures in tech.</p>



<p>Until the pandemic forced PurpleCode’s physical space to shut, it hosted incubation programs, workshops, and training for women and gender-nonconforming people. When it reopens, Caturani hopes to hold coding classes for middle and high school–age girls.</p>



<p>While the issues that Caturani first identified a decade ago seem as or more prevalent today, Caturani says that is partly because Indonesian women now have the language to articulate their concerns. As it is increasingly common for people to talk publicly about online violence, more women are able to identify experiences they have had as violent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PurpleCode’s work has taken on fresh relevance over the past few months. Demonstrations against the government have been <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/hacking-democracy/">met with a campaign of digital threats against protesters</a>, and the collective’s security tools have been adopted by a number of activists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Caturani says that, as protests increasingly move online, it is vital to remember how the internet is not just a tool for the movement but a place where real people live and interact.</p>



<p>“If the internet is our space to build movements, then [it] must be fought for to be the space we all had imagined it to be at the beginning,” she says.</p>

<p>Though I'm right now not employed as a software engineer I have been writing code under various hats for the last few years (As a data scientist, ML engineer, and software engineer). Naturally me being me I have not just done the thing but also reflected about the thing. Questions like what's good software, what does being a good software engineer mean, how should meetings be ran, and so on. Here are some thoughts on that.</p>

<h2 id="the-cost-of-disagreement">The cost of disagreement</h2>
<p>In many cases a disagreement may be over something that both sides agree is not sizable. I can think something is 80% good whereas you think it's just 75% and I can think the opposite of your solution. But we can agree that the cost to resolve that disagreement can defeat the gains from actually choosing the best solution. So "I disagree but let's go ahead" is something that should be done in these cases, with a coin flip if needed. Consensus-driven decision making may be good at some stages, especially if paired with good processes around meetings but it can lead to gridlock.</p>
<p>I'm of course not the first one in proposing the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disagree_and_commit">disagree and commit</a>" principle though I only learned this had a name very recently.</p>
<h2 id="meetings">Meetings</h2>
<p>Meetings can be terrible, meetings can be great. Bad meetings tend to occur because people show up without having thought much about what is to be discussed in the meeting. Isn't the point of the meeting to do the thinking? That's one way, perhaps the most common way of viewing meetings, and it's a lazy default because they don't impose homework on you. But doing the thinking in real time, with many voices to be sequentially heard and given a constrained time is not great for good decision making. Many times I've seen meetings that dragged on forever where disagreements would keep circling back and forth, or where we would simply be talking past each other.</p>
<p>A better way to run meetings, which I also tried, is to collate whatever is it that the outcome should be before the meeting. If it's an architecture design meeting, do the work, usually the meeting owner can do most of it, even if they know it won't be 100% perfect. Then ask for feedback a week ahead of the meeting. Incorporate the feedback to the document, repeat. Note down disagreements; have a literal "Standing disagreements" section in the document with the key points that are not quite agreed on, plus the reasoning behind them. Having everyone review the disagreements and having time to do so, on (digital) paper sets up a clearer goal for the meeting: Iron out specific points. During the meeting, a moderator would go one by one over those points and ask for a decision, then highlighting in bold which option was chosen. Then we would move to the next point and so on. Everyone liked this kind of meeting.</p>
<h2 id="ownership">Ownership</h2>
<p>Lack of ownership is the root of all evil (ok, some exaggeration here). Everyone's problem is no one's problem. In documentation, lack of ownership means finding obsolete documentation and no one person to go to to get it fixed; or what's worse, no system in place to enforce that the documentation is up to date (i.e. every document could disappear 6 months after it's published unless whoever uploaded or created it says otherwise in an email the system sends them after six months, documents shouldn't live rent free). Or having a team dedicated to tirelessly aggregating information so that everything everyone is doing is visible. We had something like this in my first job at the London Electric Vehicle Company (LEVC) and I suspect this may be more common in automotive or aerospace than in software or in biotech.</p>
<p>Apple had a very clever idea in defining <a href="https://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/status/1279478277585817600">Directly Responsible Individuals</a> (DRIs) for everything. Having a name accountable instead of a vague "the team" or "the process" makes it easy to make changes. I think many people are reluctant to blame individuals for mistakes they make, but well timed blame (feedback about what mistakes were made, potentially there being consequences for grave mistakes etc) can both help the blamed individual (They can know what to improve) and the team as a whole to succeed.</p>
<p>Something I once thought is that many decisions that involve estimates could be made into bets, either for small amounts of money or some kind of token. If you say X will be finished in a week and it takes longer, then you lose. This could be gamed by overestimating how long things take, but something like this seems like the right way to get better at making decisions involving uncertainty.</p>
<h2 id="questions-as-systemic-failures">Questions as systemic failures</h2>
<p>Every question asked in an internal Slack is a policy failure. It means the existing information systems failed to deliver an answer, and the user falls back to manually asking the hive mind's tacit knowledge. This has various problems: One, it introduces longer delays between question and answer, especially if whoever knows the answer is in another timezone. Two, it embraces tacit knowledge in a distributed and incoherent fashion: If there is no one true answer there can be many answers and that can lead to disagreements and wrong decisions. Instead, ideally there is a centralized repository of information where for each Q there is one and only one A, and a team dedicated to getting owners of various systems to actually codify their knowledge. This should work well with the ownership system above.</p>

<h2 id="good-software">Good software</h2>
<p>Good software is code that is readable, fast, flexible, and scalable. Out of these only speed is the one that is universally agreed on how to measure. The rest are fuzzy, as are most things in life.</p>
<p>Readable code pretty much depends on who is writing it; <a href="https://github.com/jayfoad/aoc2019apl/blob/master/p12.dyalog">Dyalog</a> looks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">Brainfuck</a> to me, and the many parenthesis in Lisps can make code hard to read to someone who is not a lisper (I did the experiment; I spent some time learning basic Clojure and while I remain not a Clojurian, the parenthesis become less of an issue). Lifetimes in Rust seem obscure until one know how they work.</p>
<p>Flexible code is code that is easier to extend. This is hard to quantify but anyone that has coded knows it when they see it; a given piece of code can just effortlessly do something new with a two line change, or it may need a thousand line change to work again. The former is more flexible than the latter. Moreover this flexibility shouldn't come at the expense of readability though sometimes this can be the case.</p>
<p>Scalable code is code that works well with small as well as big inputs, this can be achieved in a single machine or many.</p>
<p>The extent to which these matter depend on who is developing it (Readable code depends on individual preferences), and flexibility is not really needed if the end result is more or less fixed; but it's really desired in a startup that is constantly adapting. In that environment, speed may be sacrificed for extra flexibility.</p>
<p>The code that should be written absent any constraints is good code, but real life situations means that the right thing to do is to make tradeoffs and move ahead. Those decisions are at the heart of what experience in software engineering is.</p>
<h2 id="static-types">Static types</h2>
<p>Static typing is great. Early on in a codebase in Python back at Aiden.ai, we made the decision of going for static typing using myopia as much as we could. So instead of writing something like</p>
<pre><code><span>def </span><span>sum_one</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>):
  </span><span>return </span><span>x+</span><span>1
</span></code></pre>
<p>We would rather much write</p>
<pre><code><span>def </span><span>sum_one</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:int)-&gt;int:
  </span><span>return </span><span>x+</span><span>1
</span></code></pre>
<p>Or even further, in some cases we would use <em>newtypes</em> to make these type annotations more meaningful, dataclasses to bundle data together, as well as exhaustive enumerations to ensure that all variants of an enum get handled, for example:</p>
<pre><code><span>class </span><span>Operation</span><span>(</span><span>Enum</span><span>):
  </span><span>Multiply="</span><span>Multiply</span><span>"
  Add="</span><span>Add</span><span>"
Value = Union[int,float]
</span><span>def </span><span>assert_never</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>: NoReturn) -&gt; NoReturn:
    </span><span>raise </span><span>AssertionError</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>Invalid value: </span><span>{x</span><span>!r</span><span>}")
</span><span>def </span><span>do_the_op</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>:Value,</span><span>b</span><span>: Value, </span><span>op</span><span>:Operation) -&gt; Value:
  </span><span>if </span><span>op is Operation.Multiply:
    </span><span>return </span><span>a*b
  </span><span>else if </span><span>op is Operation.Add:
    </span><span>return </span><span>a+b
  </span><span>else</span><span>:
    </span><span>assert_never</span><span>(op)   
  
</span></code></pre>
<p>So if we ever say remove an operation or add a new one, mypy will force us to handle it. This is enforced dynamically but most importantly also statically so the code won't pass tests if there is a missing variant.</p>
<p>All these typing (Plus a custom pandas typechecker I wrote, but that's another story) made it relatively easy to refactor, and add new features when we needed to do so. It would have been a huge pain to fly blind without the types. Python has a tendency to blow up in your face when you least expect it. Starting with types from day 1 is something I don't regret having gone for, it didn't make the coding any slower and saved a lot of time (Or so we imagine!).</p>
<p>There seems to be a trend now towards types everywhere. Javascript died (for any serious developer) to let Typescript rise and Ruby, while still around with the Sorbet type checker, got Crystal.</p>
<p>As a <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Theodore_Kaczynski#:%7E:text=Consistent%20failure%20to%20attain%20goals,low%20self%2Desteem%20or%20depression.&amp;text=text%20on%20wikisource-,The%20Industrial%20Revolution%20and%20its%20consequences%20have,disaster%20for%20the%20human%20race.&amp;text=The%20industrial%2Dtechnological%20system%20may%20survive%20or%20it%20may%20break%20down.">wise man</a> once said, <em>Python and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race</em>. Python has a tendency to blow up in your face, even with all the typing. The typechecker may be happy but it doesn't guarantee that if it thinks something is type T it's actually so, maybe what you thought was a number is actually a string and because of duck typing it can take a few function calls for the error to manifest itself.</p>
<h2 id="yolo-programming-vs-chill-programming">YOLO programming vs chill programming</h2>
<p>I believe there is a tradeoff between writing a lot of code and writing correct code. In a day you could write X lines of code or you could write X/2. Two days of programmer B will produce the same as one day of programmer A but probably the latter will have introduced fewer bugs. You can write more or less tests, you can be more or less sure that something you just wrote is actually correct.</p>
<p>As you can expect from the number of typos here, I'm more of a YOLO programmer than a chill programmer. I'm the guy that was once pushing to prod from a one-handed GitHub hot fix from my phone as I was having dinner in a hotel in Tokyo (That one did work!).</p>

<p>Nyxt has a new visual-mode (mouseless text selection)!</p>
<p><img src="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/static/image/article/visual-mode-select.png"></p>

<p>Visual mode is a mouseless way of selecting <span>any</span> text on any page (with as few keystrokes as possible). Conceptually based on <code>vi</code>'s visual mode, Nyxt adapts it for the web.</p>

<p>The first step is to run the <code>visual-mode</code> command.</p>
<p><img src="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/static/image/article/visual-mode-enable.png"></p>
<p>After doing so, you will be presented with hints to select a starting paragraph for your cursor.</p>
<p><img src="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/static/image/article/visual-mode-paragraph.png"></p>
<p>Upon selecting a paragraph, a cursor will appear. You can move the cursor around and press <code>shift-space</code> to toggle the mark (start/stop highlighting).</p>
<p><img src="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/static/image/article/visual-mode-cursor.png"></p>
<p>Importantly, you can use all your favorite keybindings (move by word, move to next line, beginning of line, etc.)!</p>
<p><img src="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/static/image/article/visual-mode-select.png"></p>
<p>Eureka! Just like that, we have selected text, no mouse required!</p>

<p>A very special thank you to <span data-cites="kssytsrk">@kssytsrk</span> for this wonderful addition to Nyxt!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading :-)</p>

January 29, 2021 | https://techtinkering.com/2013/03/05/turbo-pascal-a-great-choice-for-programming-under-cpm/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://techtinkering.com/2013/03/05/turbo-pascal-a-great-choice-for-programming-under-cpm/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>CP/M was blessed with many programming languages, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.  I think that Turbo Pascal stands out from these and I'm not alone.  When Turbo Pascal was released in 1983 by Borland, as their first software development application, it was quickly adopted by schools, universities, hobbyists and professional software developers.  Turbo Pascal combined ease of use, power, speed and a great manual all for the really low price of $49.95.</p>
<h2>Why Use Turbo Pascal Under CP/M?</h2>
<p>With TP you get an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), so that you can edit, compile and run all from the same application.  Since the IDE is only 34Kb there is plenty of space left on a disk for your source code and compiled programs.  This is particularly handy for single disk machines.  The editor is very functional and uses a subset of the Wordstar key combinations.</p>
<p>Pascal was designed to be easy to compile and because TP uses a single pass compiler, compilation speed is incredibly quick.  The downside of the compilation speed is that the code is quite a literal translation without much optimization.  However, for many applications this won't be much of an issue compared to the increased programmer productivity.</p>
<p>If you need parts of your program to run faster, you can always embed inline machine code into functions/procedures or access functions in external binaries.  The latter option allows you to create libraries in assembly language and use a jump table to access individual functions with the <code>external</code> keyword.</p>
<p>In 1986 Borland released Turbo Pascal 3.0 which added support for <em>overlays</em>.  The running code could now be swapped in and out from disk as needed.  With careful planning, you could escape the normal 64Kb limit and only be constrained by the capacity of the disk you are running the application from.</p>
<p>The standard library offers a good range of functions and TP keeps quite close to Standard Pascal as defined by Jensen &amp; Wirth in their '<a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xXSZbSLFTM8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">User Manual and Report</a>'.  As with all Pascal implementations, there are problems porting programs between implementations.  However, if you aren't using any of the operating system specific calls, then you can easily port to the MS-DOS and CP/M-86 versions.  My only gripe is that TP doesn't support procedures and functions passed as parameters.</p>
<p>Finally, Borland included a highly readable and very complete <a href="http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/borland/turbo_pascal/Turbo_Pascal_Version_3.0_Reference_Manual_1986.pdf">manual</a>.  It covered not just the IDE, language and libraries, but also detailed information on the memory layout and calling conventions from assembly language.  This meant that you could quickly get up and running with few additional resources.</p>
<h2>How to install</h2>
<p>First download <a href="http://www.retroarchive.org/cpm/lang/TP_301A.ZIP">Turbo Pascal 3.01a</a> for CP/M-80 and unzip the archive.</p>
<p>Put at least <code>TINST.*</code> and <code>TURBO.*</code> files onto a disk.  The real advantage of not copying all the files is seen if you only have a single drive.  The extra room will allow you to edit, compile and run your programs all from the same disk.  For instructions on how to create a virtual disk for z80pack look at: <a href="https://techtinkering.com/articles/emulating-a-cpm-system-with-z80pack/">Emulating a CP/M System With z80pack</a>.</p>
<p>Boot up your CP/M system, put in the disk with TP on it and change to this drive if necessary.  In my examples I am using <code>B:</code></p>
<p>Run the <code>TINST</code> program to set up the screen:</p>
<pre><code>B&gt; tinst
</code></pre>
<p>Press <code>S</code> for <em>Screen Installation</em> and select the appropriate terminal for your set up.  I'm using z80pack, so I select ANSI.  You probably don't want to alter this definition so say No to altering it.  Then enter the speed in Mhz of your machine.  If a suitable terminal isn't listed consult the TP manual for advice.</p>
<p>If you want to configure additional editor commands, you can do this via the <em>Command Installation</em> option.  At the very least, if you have them, you'll probably want to configure the page-up, page-down keys as well as the cursor keys to represent character-left, character-right, line-up and line-down.  If not press <code>Q</code> to quit.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To start the IDE run:</p>
<pre><code>B&gt; turbo
</code></pre>
<p>You should now be looking at the Turbo Pascal splash screen, showing the version, copyright message and which terminal is configured.  At the bottom you are asked whether to 'Include error messages'.  For the moment press <code>Y</code>.</p>
<p>Now you will be presented with the main screen.  You have a number of commands on this screen, which are accessed by a single letter.</p>
<p><img src="https://techtinkering.com/img/articles/turbo_pascal_cpm_main.png"></p><p>To work with a pascal source file, first press <code>W</code> and then enter a filename.  This is the file that the editor will open and it is also the file that the compiler will compile if you haven't selected a main file.</p>
<p>To edit the work file, press <code>E</code>.  The editor uses Wordstar key combinations which you can read more about in the manual.  For now the following keys will be useful to know:</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr><th>Key command</th><th>Action</th></tr>
  <tr><td>CTRL-s</td><td>Character Left</td></tr>
  <tr><td>CTRL-d</td><td>Character Right</td></tr>
  <tr><td>CTRL-e</td><td>Character Up</td></tr>
  <tr><td>CTRL-x</td><td>Character Down</td></tr>
  <tr><td>CTRL-k s</td><td>Save Document</td></tr>
  <tr><td>CTRL-k d</td><td>Quit</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>You can also use any keys that you configured above with the <em>Command Installation</em> option in <code>tinst</code>.</p>
<p>Files are edited in memory so to save them to disk you press <code>S</code> from the main menu.</p>
<p>To compile and run the work file, or main file if selected, press <code>R</code>.  Depending on what is set in the compiler options, this will either compile to a <code>com</code> file or will compile to memory.</p>
<h3>Hello, world!</h3>
<p>To try this with the traditional 'Hello, world!' program, set the work file to <code>hello.pas</code>, edit the file and enter the following, then quit the editor.</p>
<pre><code>program helloworld;
begin
  writeln('Hello, world!');
end.
</code></pre>
<p>Compile and run it by pressing <code>R</code> from the main menu.  You should see it compile and then say hello to the world.</p>
<h2>Video</h2>
<p>The following video shows the creation of a FizzBuzz program using Turbo Pascal and allows us to see just how quick and easy it is.</p>
<p>
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/acYu0sL9Ol0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>
<p>The source code for <code>fizzbuzz.pas</code> used in the video is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>program fizzbuzz(output);
var
  i: integer;
begin
  for i := 1 to 100 do
  begin
    if i mod 15 = 0 then
      write('FizzBuzz ')
    else if i mod 3 = 0 then
      write('Fizz ')
    else if i mod 5 = 0 then
      write('Buzz ')
    else
      write(i, ' ');
  end
end.
</code></pre>

<p>Get the <a href="http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/borland/turbo_pascal/Turbo_Pascal_Version_3.0_Reference_Manual_1986.pdf">Turbo Pascal 3.0 Manual</a> for CP/M-80, CP/M-86 and PC-DOS/MS-DOS from <a href="http://bitsavers.org/">bitsavers.org</a>.  It is a wonderfully well-laid out manual and you should have no problems using this to learn and get the most out of Turbo Pascal.  You may also want to take a look at a copy of the old Borland musuem page: <a href="http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/20792">Antique Software: Turbo Pascal v3.02</a>.</p>
<p>You are now ready to use Turbo Pascal to write and compile applications like it was 1986.</p>

          <p><b>Check out <a href="https://my-qr.art/">My-QR.art</a> for the final result!</b></p>

          <p>QR codes provide a clear and approachable way of translating the physical world to the
          digital world. When I see a QR code, I always want to scan it to find out what is behind
          it, somehow they always fascinate me. But QR codes always look very similar, could there
          be a way to make them look more cool? Make them a certain specific shape or contain pixel
          art?</p>

          <p>People already (ab)use the error correction build into QR codes to embed their logo
          in it, they simply put their logo over a part of the QR code and let the error correction
          handle the missing data. However, you can never obscure more than 30% of the code (and
          usually a lot less) if you choose this approach. But QR codes are mostly a visualisation
          of data. Can we approach the problem from the other side? What if we don't try to
          design a QR code to fit the data, but fit the data to the design of the QR code that we
          want.</p>

          <p>Spoiler, we can. Check out <a href="https://my-qr.art/">My-QR.art</a>. All the code is
          totally free and open source, so feel free to
          contribute <a href="https://github.com/raatmarien/my-qr.art">on GitHub</a></p>

          <h2 id="the-idea">The idea</h2>

          <p>Say, we want to promote our website. And we have a nice grayscale logo. Now we want to
          have an engaging QR code that looks like our logo.</p>

          <p><img src="https://marienraat.nl/assets/img/blog/hacking-qr-codes/my-qr.art-logo.svg" alt="My-QR.art logo"></p><p>And we have an URL that we want the QR code to lead us too, for
            example: <a href="https://my-qr.art/">https://my-qr.art</a>.</p>
          
          <p>We set up a web server that can redirect certain URLs to other URLs. Then we can make
          the beginning of the data of our QR code the URL to that web-server and the rest of the
          QR's data can be anything. So we can choose the rest of the data in any way that makes
          our QR code look most like our design!</p>

          <p>For example the QR code could send you
            to <code>https://my-qr.art/r/arbitrary-super-long-string</code>. On the back-end we tell
            the server to redirect any request with the
            URL <code>https://my-qr.art/r/arbitrary-super-long-string</code>
            to <code>https://my-qr.art</code>. And tada! We have a functional QR code that sends us to
            the address we want, while having way more control over how the QR code looks! Up to 80%
            of the code can be freely designed this way!</p>

          <p>When we have this all working, we could even make nice scannable QR gifs. We could make
          each frame separately and let them all redirect to the same page. I admit, most QR codes
          are printed, so gifs might not make the most sense, but they look pretty cool! To keep you
          excited for the rest of the article, here is world's first ever working QR gif (as far
          as I know)!</p>
          
          <p><img src="https://marienraat.nl/assets/img/blog/hacking-qr-codes/qr.gif" alt="Animated QR code that shows a running horse"></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Horse_in_Motion">The running horse might
          remind you of some other movie...</a></p>

          <h2 id="qr-codes">How does QR work?</h2>

          <p>Now that we know the concept, lets get started. First we need to know how QR codes
          actually work.</p>

          <p>QR codes encode data by making some blocks dark and other light. The QR scanner can
          then read which are dark and which are light and reconstruct the original data. QR codes
          can have 40 different sizes, from <em>version 1</em> (very small, 17x17) to <em>version
          40</em> (very big, 177x177). QR codes are made of black and white 'modules' and
          each module has one of the following 4 functions:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Help the scanner recognise and orient the QR code</li>
            <li>Give information about the QR code size, type and other internal QR stuff</li>
            <li>Encode the actual data that the QR code represents</li>
            <li>Encode error correction info about the QR code</li>
          </ol>

          <h2 id="drawing">Creating a template</h2>

          <p>Our plan is to allow the user to choose the colour of any module that has function 3. So
          the first step is to let the user know which pixels they can control and which pixels they
          can't control for the QR code size they chose. For now lets try to create an image on
          which the modules with function 3 are coloured white and all other modules are coloured
          grey.</p>

          <p>For this we can colour all the modules and error data. To get this right you really need
          to dive into how QR codes work. We need to think about the data encoding, interleaving,
          extra eyes, error words and more. We'll also need to take into account that we'll
          need to reserve first few characters of our data for the start of our URL. Luckily there
          is a great source on QR codes on the
          internet, <a href="https://www.thonky.com/qr-code-tutorial/introduction">the QR code
          tutorial from Thonky.com</a>. Putting the work in, we get something like this, for version
          30.</p>

          <p><img src="https://marienraat.nl/assets/img/blog/hacking-qr-codes/qr-template.png" alt="A template for a QR design"></p><h2 id="reading">Reading a design</h2>

          <p>Now let's work on the other side of the puzzle, when we have a design that a user
          has drawn on our template, how do we convert it to a working QR code? QR codes have 4
          possible types of encoding: <em>numeric</em>, <em>alphanumeric</em>, <em>binary</em>
          and <em>kanji</em>. We need something that we can create valid URLs with, so numeric and
          kanji are out. Secondly, we need the random string at the end of our URL to
          be <em>normal</em> enough so that QR scanners will still recognise our code as an
          URL. The <em>binary</em> encoding will create characters that aren't ordinarily found
          in URLs ('\0' for example), which means lots of QR scanners won't let their
          users open our URL. Luckily the <em>alphanumeric</em> encoding has just enough characters
          to let us make valid URLs (although they'll have to be all caps).</p>

          <p><img src="https://marienraat.nl/assets/img/blog/hacking-qr-codes/qr-design.png" alt="A design for a QR code that contains the My-QR.art logo">

          <img src="https://marienraat.nl/assets/img/blog/hacking-qr-codes/qr-data-order.png" title="Made by Thonky, shared under the CC ANC 4.0" alt="An illustration from Thonky.com that shows how data is encoded in a QR code"></p><p>So with that figured out, lets read that design the user made. First we'll extract
          a bit string from all the data modules in the design. For small QR codes this is quite
          straight forward, the QR code is simply read from right to left, bottom to top and back
          again in double columns, see the illustration from Thonky above. However, when the QR code
          size passes 5, we'll have to take into account interleaving. Then the data words are
          scattered around the QR code, presumably to make the data pattern more random. So
          we'll have to reverse that interleaving procedure. Luckily how it works is explained
          by <a href="https://www.thonky.com/qr-code-tutorial/error-correction-coding">Thonky.com</a>. At
          last we get a bit string from our design, here we only show the first 80 character, the
          real bit string for this design is 13863 bits long.</p>
          <p><code>01100011010101001100101010001100011110111010100000000001110100111110011101001001</code></p>

          <h3 id="decoding">Decoding the bitstring</h3>
          <p>Now we'll need to decode the bits to an alphanumeric string. Here we group 11 bits
          together every time and then convert that into two alphanumeric characters
          using <a href="https://www.thonky.com/qr-code-tutorial/alphanumeric-table">this
          table</a>. We get the following data string (again truncated).</p>

          <p>We'll just replace the first 20 characters with our URL prefix and we get:</p>

          <h3 id="qr-code">Generating the QR code</h3>

          <p>Now we can use any QR library to create the QR code! The QR library will handle adding
          all the difficult error codes and other boring stuff for us.</p>

          <p><img src="https://marienraat.nl/assets/img/blog/hacking-qr-codes/failed-qr.png" alt="A random looking QR code"></p><p>But what is that? Why does it still look all random? The problem is masking. The QR
          code spec includes 5 different masks and the mask that makes the QR code look most random
          is chosen, which is almost certainly not our design. This is done to make the code easier
          to read for scanners. However, in my experience, QR codes scan just fine with more
          structured data. So we don't have to feel too bad about modifying our QR library to
          always use the same mask. Then after we apply the same mask to our design before
          processing it, we finally get the desired image.</p>

          <p><img src="https://marienraat.nl/assets/img/blog/hacking-qr-codes/my-qr.art-qr.png" alt="A QR code with the design in it"></p><h2 id="redirecting">Redirecting the request</h2>

          <p>Now to redirect the QR code to the right domain. This should be easy, put the QR URL in
          a database and link it to the redirect URL. When we receive a request, simply look up the
          corresponding URL in a database. However, if we want to use a modern web server, we'll
          have to jump through some hoops... Apache doesn't like most of our URLs, since they
          are technically malformed (ugh, spoil the fun much Apache?). So it throws an <em>Error
          400: Bad request</em>. We can't disable this error anywhere it seems. However, luckily
          there is a workaround, we can set a custom error page for our <em>Error 400</em>, so if we
          just set the redirect page as the error page for <em>Error 400</em>, we are home free!
          Luckily Apache is not so much of a spoilsport that it throws a Bad Request error while
          trying to handle a Bad Request...</p>

          <p>For the back-end I've been using Django, and it has another fun bug that shows up
          with these really weird URLs. It tries to decode the URL as an ISO-8859-1 string, but some
          of the characters passed by Apache aren't in ISO-8859-1. So we have to derive our own
          WSGI handler to workaround
          this, <a href="https://github.com/raatmarien/my-qr.art/blob/main/my_qr_art/custom_wsgi.py">see
          here</a>. But now it works, try to scan the QR we made, it redirects where we want it to
            redirect!</p>

          <p>One small caveat though, QR codes themselves are standardized and we create standard
          compliant QR codes with correct URLs in them, but QR scanners aren't standardized and some
          might not recognize our code as a URL and will see it as plain text instead.</p>

          <h2 id="a-web-app">Custom QR codes for everyone!</h2>

          <p>Just outputting and parsing images isn't very user friendly, so I made a nice web
          app at <a href="https://my-qr.art/">My-QR.art</a> using Django. It
          has <a href="https://my-qr.art/editor">a friendly editor</a> where you can draw, fill or
          upload black and white images to make your QR code. It also has some …</p></div></div></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p><strong><em>This is the fifth part of the “Rebuilding the spellchecker” series, dedicated to explaining how the world’s most popular spellchecker Hunspell works.</em></strong></p>

<p>Today, we talk about <strong>edit-based suggestions.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Quick recap</strong>: <strong><a href="https://zverok.github.io/blog/2021-01-05-spellchecker-1.html">The first part</a></strong> described what Hunspell is; and why I decided to <a href="https://github.com/zverok/spylls">rewrite it in Python</a>. In <strong><a href="https://zverok.github.io/blog/2021-01-09-spellchecker-2.html">the second</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://zverok.github.io/blog/2021-01-14-spellchecker-3.html">the third</a></strong> parts, we’ve talked about <strong>lookup</strong>: checking the word’s correctness.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://zverok.github.io/blog/2021-01-21-spellchecker-4.html">The fourth part</a></strong> introduced <strong>suggest</strong>, an algorithm for search for corrections. We described that Hunspell performs suggest in two main stages:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Generate edits and test them for the correctness</li>
  <li>(If the first stage didn’t produce good enough results) Search through the entire dictionary and find similar words</li>
</ol>

<p>So, speaking about the <strong>edit-based suggestions search</strong>: its full behavior is a curious example of emergent complexity. Every single step and every single condition is quite simple, but the resulting behavior is quite sophisticated—and hard to dissect.</p>

<p>Let’s dive into this beautiful mess!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before we proceed, let’s try something new: in this chapter, I’ll show some spylls code to play with and illustrate some points. So, if you want to follow, begin with:</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p>…and load spylls into your REPL of choice:</p>
</blockquote>

<div><div><pre><code>  <span>from</span> <span>spylls.hunspell</span> <span>import</span> <span>Dictionary</span>

  <span>english</span> <span>=</span> <span>Dictionary</span><span>.</span><span>from_files</span><span>(</span><span>'en_US'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>To simplify experimenting, a few dictionaries used in examples are distributed with spylls. Other dictionaries to play with can be downloaded from <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/language-tools/">Firefox</a> or <a href="https://extensions.libreoffice.org/?Tags%5B%5D=50">LibreOffice</a> extension sites.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Once the dictionary is loaded, you can use suggest:</p>
</blockquote>

<div><div><pre><code>  <span># this will return suggestion generator
</span>  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>english</span><span>.</span><span>suggest</span><span>(</span><span>'spylls'</span><span>))</span>
  <span># &lt;generator object Dictionary.suggest at 0x7f62e972d950&gt;
</span>
  <span># ...and this will unpack it into suggestions
</span>  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>english</span><span>.</span><span>suggest</span><span>(</span><span>'spylls'</span><span>))</span>
  <span># spells spills
</span>
  <span># For illustrative purposes, there is also an
</span>  <span># easy-to-use internal method, that produces
</span>  <span># Suggestion objects with an indicator of the
</span>  <span># method it was found with.
</span>  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>english</span><span>.</span><span>suggester</span><span>.</span><span>suggestions</span><span>(</span><span>'spylls'</span><span>))</span>
  <span># Suggestion[badchar](spells)
</span>  <span># Suggestion[badchar](spills)
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="the-order-of-edits">The order of edits</h2>

<p>As we already mentioned, the “classic” edits for string comparison algorithms are insert, delete, replace, and swap adjacent letters. To contrast, Hunspell’s carefully crafted set of edits is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Change the word to the uppercase (see also “Word case” sub-section below);</li>
  <li>Replace common misspellings, like “f”→”ph” and vice versa, defined by <code>REP</code> table from aff-file;</li>
  <li>Split the word in two parts in every position (with space or dash), to be tested as a <em>single dictionary entry</em>, like “ad hoc” (see also #13 below);</li>
  <li>Replace related chars, like “a”, “å”, “ä”, defined by <code>MAP</code> table from aff-file;</li>
  <li>Swap every two adjacent letters,
    <ul>
      <li>oh, and for 4- and 5-letter words also try <em>two</em> swaps: “ahev” → “have”;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Swap two non-adjacent letters (up to distance 4);</li>
  <li>Replace every letter with the adjacent on the keyboard, e.g. “miraclw” → “miracle”. The keyboard layout is defined by <code>KEY</code> directive in aff-file;
    <ul>
      <li>and, on the same step, with the capitalized version of the character (“paris” → “Paris”, but not vice versa), also considered as a possible keyboard-related error;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Remove every letter in turn;</li>
  <li>Insert every letter from the language’s alphabet (defined by <code>TRY</code> directive in aff-file) into every position;</li>
  <li>Move every letter forward and backward into all possible positions;</li>
  <li>Replace every letter with every other letter from the language’s alphabet;</li>
  <li>Find a duplicated <em>pair</em> of letters and remove it: “chicicken” → “chicken”;</li>
  <li>Split the word in two in every position, to be tested as two separate words (see also #3 above).</li>
</ol>

<p>Phew!</p>

<p>As <del>complicating matters is kinda Hunspell’s shtick</del> there are many edge cases to handle, producing edits in some order is just the beginning!</p>

<h3 id="suggestion-ranking-and-limiting-is-hard-coded">Suggestion ranking and limiting is hard-coded</h3>

<p>Classical spellchecker algorithm papers typically describe the process of ranking of suggestion after they are generated: by edit’s probability, by similarity to the original word, or by word’s popularity. In Hunspell, the ranking is <em>implicit</em>: the order of steps is already considered the best possible order.</p>

<p>So, all suggestions to remove a letter that produce correct words (step 8) will be returned before all suggestions to insert a letter (step 9)<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>english</span><span>.</span><span>suggester</span><span>.</span><span>suggestions</span><span>(</span><span>'haz'</span><span>))</span>
<span># Suggestion[extrachar](ha)       # all "extra character removed" suggestions
# Suggestion[forgotchar](haze)    # then, all "forgotten character inserted"
# Suggestion[forgotchar](hazy)
# Suggestion[badchar](has)        # then, all "bad character replaced"
# Suggestion[badchar](hat)
# Suggestion[badchar](had)
# &lt;...skip, there are lots...&gt;
# Suggestion[twowords](ha z)      # finally, all "should be split in two words"
# Suggestion[twowords](ha-z)
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The number of edit-based suggestions is hard-limited to 15. Even if there’s a possibility to produce more, Hunspell does not attempt to balance the number of suggestions from each group: it just stops searching for more after the first 15, no matter how they were produced.</p>

<p>There is also a hard cut-off by certain categories of suggestions: if (3) produces a correct word, no further edit-based and no ngram-based suggestions are tried; if any of (1-2) produce correct words, the rest of edit-based suggestions are produced too, but no ngram suggestions are produced.</p>

<p>Finally, there is a hard cut-off by time: 0.25 seconds for a whole suggestion algorithm, 0.1 seconds for each approach to edit-based algorithm (in each possible word case): once the time limit is reached, the suggestion generation stops. (Spylls doesn’t try to reimplement this, as Python is obviously slower than C.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Contrast this rigid ordering/limiting to aspell’s approach: it provides several <a href="http://aspell.net/0.61/man-html/Notes-on-the-Different-Suggestion-Modes.html">suggestion modes</a>, allowing to trade time for breadth or vice versa; and also has a lot of <a href="http://aspell.net/0.50-doc/man-html/4_Customizing.html">fine-tuning options</a> to adjust this behavior.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="non-lowercase-words-increase-the-number-of-searches">Non-lowercase words increase the number of searches</h3>

<p>What if the misspelling is not in the same case as the desired correction is in the dictionary? The answer (as one who already has some gist of this series might imagine) is complicated.</p>

<p>Lowercase word that should be capitalized will be fixed relatively easy, on step (7):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>english</span><span>.</span><span>suggester</span><span>.</span><span>suggestions</span><span>(</span><span>"london"</span><span>))</span>
<span># [Suggestion[badcharkey](London)]
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The word that should’ve been uppercased will be fixed even easier, on step (1):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>english</span><span>.</span><span>suggester</span><span>.</span><span>suggestions</span><span>(</span><span>"nasa"</span><span>))</span>
<span># Suggestion[uppercase](NASA)
# Suggestion[forgotchar](nasal)
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>But when the misspelling is not in the lowercase (and the target spelling is), the wonders begin. The word is transformed to all cases it <em>could</em> have been if it was spelled correctly; then, for each of the variants, steps 1-13 run, then the final suggestions are capitalized back into the original form of the misspelling<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. For example, let’s misspell a kitten.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>english</span><span>.</span><span>suggester</span><span>.</span><span>suggestions</span><span>(</span><span>"Kittn"</span><span>))</span>
<span># Suggestion[badchar](Kitty)     |
# Suggestion[twowords](Kit tn)   | Three edit suggestions from "Kittn"
# Suggestion[twowords](Kit-tn)   |
#
# Suggestion[forgotchar](Kitten) | Edit suggestion from "kittn",
#                                | capitalized after it was found
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that, again, suggestions are <em>not</em> reordered: the user receives them in the order they were found.</p>

<h3 id="aff-file-contents-affects-quality-dramatically">Aff-file contents affects quality dramatically</h3>

<p>One might notice that descriptions of some steps refer to the <strong>data defined in aff-file</strong>. It means that some of what is perceived as a suggest <em>algorithm</em> is actually represented by <em>data</em> and is delegated to the dictionary’s maintainer.</p>

<p>Some of the directives are hard to populate—for example, <code>REP</code>, the list of commonly misspelled letter groups (“f/ph”, or “tion/shun”). Many dictionaries omit it or make a very small list, missing the opportunity to cover the most important mistakes. Other directives (like <code>KEY</code> or <code>TRY</code>) are quite trivial and yet are not included in some dictionaries, leading to a sharp drop in suggestion quality.</p>

<p>We’ll discuss dictionaries and their quality in one of the future chapters. For now, just one telling example.</p>

<p>To perform steps like “insert a missing letter” or “replace a letter with another,” Hunspell needs to know <em>the language’s alphabet</em>. Being truly multi-lingual, it can’t assume regular Latinic <code>a-z</code> as a default. So, there is a <strong><code>TRY</code> directive</strong>, which should specify this alphabet. If it is absent,  several of the important steps would be missing<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>russian</span> <span>=</span> <span>Dictionary</span><span>.</span><span>from_files</span><span>(</span><span>'ru_RU'</span><span>)</span>
<span># "кошка" is "female cat", "коша" is informal name/misspelling for it:</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"кошка"</span> <span>in</span> <span>russian</span><span>.</span><span>suggest</span><span>(</span><span>'коша'</span><span>))</span> <span># "к" is missing</span>
<span># False</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"кошка"</span> <span>in</span> <span>russian</span><span>.</span><span>suggest</span><span>(</span><span>'тошка'</span><span>))</span> <span># "к" is replaced with "т"</span>
<span># False</span>

<span># Let's fix it!</span>
<span>russian</span><span>.</span><span>aff</span><span>.</span><span>TRY</span> <span>=</span> <span>'абвгдеёжзийклмнопрстуфхцчшщъыьэюя'</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"кошка"</span> <span>in</span> <span>russian</span><span>.</span><span>suggest</span><span>(</span><span>'коша'</span><span>))</span>
<span># True</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"кошка"</span> <span>in</span> <span>russian</span><span>.</span><span>suggest</span><span>(</span><span>'тошка'</span><span>))</span>
<span># True</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> In fact, using the alphabetic order of letters to fix the issue is too naive. Hunspell’s documentation advises sorting letters in <code>TRY</code> in the order of frequency (they’ll be actually <em>tried</em> in the order they are specified). Also, we forgot to include <code>-</code> (dash) into the alphabet—which will lead to omitting of all “(good word)-(another good word)” suggestions.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="multiword-suggestions-are-cumbersome">Multiword suggestions are cumbersome</h3>

<p>One of the most common spelling mistakes is <strong>accidentally joining two words</strong>: so, every good spellchecker should try to cover this case. Unfortunately, it is frequently overlooked in spellchecking libraries and algorithm explanations (everybody focuses on the distance between one misspelling and one suggestion)<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Usually, we want split suggestions at the end of the suggestion list (thus, the last step). Otherwise, short words will overwhelm the user with possibilities:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>[</span><span>*</span><span>en</span><span>.</span><span>suggester</span><span>.</span><span>suggestions</span><span>(</span><span>'Itall'</span><span>)]</span>
<span># Suggestion[extrachar](Tall)
# Suggestion[extrachar](Ital)
# Suggestion[badchar](Stall)
# Suggestion[badchar](Italy)
# Suggestion[twowords](I tall)
# Suggestion[twowords](It all)
# ...
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Sometimes, though, we might want to ensure that some …</p></article></div>

        <h2>James O'Grady plays, reviews and mods (!) a game I wrote in Z80 machine code in 1984</h2>
    </header>

    <section>
      <p><img src="https://jamesmead.org/images/graphic-adventures-for-the-spectrum-48k.jpg" alt="Book cover for 'Graphic Adventures for the Spectrum 48K'"></p>

<p>I recently stumbled across <a href="#the-youtube-video">a quirky Youtube video</a> which piqued my interest. In the video <a href="https://twitter.com/JAMOGRAD">James O'Grady</a> demonstrated a 3D maze game. He'd typed in the code for the game from a familiar-sounding book called <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0744700132">Graphic Adventures for the Spectrum 48K</a>.</p>

<p>The nominal author of this book, Richard Hurley, was one of my teachers and he included programs written by me and a number of my friends. The 3D maze game was one I wrote in about 1984 when I was 16. In the video James goes on to critique the game, to explore some ways to improve it, and to read some reviews of the book from magazines of the time.</p>

<p>In my early teens I played a lot of games on the ZX81 and then the Spectrum, but as I got older I became bored of playing the games and more interested in writing them. I learnt a lot about programming games from typing in code from magazines and books.</p>

<p>The first games I developed were written entirely in <a href="https://worldofspectrum.org/ZXBasicManual/">Sinclair BASIC</a>, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/floehopper/sub-hunt">Sub Hunt</a> which was published in <a href="https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/index.php?cat=96&amp;id=2000461">an earlier book</a>, but I quickly realised I would need to use machine code to get the performance I wanted. Initially I wrote small bits of machine code to speed up critical bits of the games. However, the 3D Maze game in the video was the first game I wrote pretty much entirely in Z80 machine code using the excellent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus_Assembler">Zeus assembler</a> and with my trusty copy of <a href="https://archive.org/details/CompleteSpectrumROMDisassemblyThe">The Complete Spectrum ROM Disassembly</a>. It was closely based on the "3D Monster Maze" game by J.K. Greye Software.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Most importantly, from the point of view of video game history, the ZX81 was the computer which hosted the world's first ever 3D game on a home computer - JK Greye's 3D Monster Maze. A simple labyrinth is generated, and the player has to find their way out, all the while being stalked by a Tyrannosaurus Rex. The whole experience was rendered in what is now referred to as 'first person' view - ie, you see what you would see out of the eyes of the character in the maze, as pictured in the ZX81's rather blocky but still effective graphics. A quick play of this game on an emulator is recommended to all fans of Doom, Quake, Unreal, Half Life and all the other FPSs which are now so popular, as it really is the literal grandaddy of them all. It is difficult now to describe the impact this game had on a public who had quite literally never seen anything like it.

<h3 id="my-version">My version</h3>

<p>One slight disappointment was that unlike in "3D Monster Maze" there was no "monster" in my version of the game or at least not in the version James was playing. I know that I did eventually add a Tyrannosaurus Rex to the game, but I vaguely remember having to rush for a publication deadline, so the monster might've have missed the cut! If I recall correctly, a friend with better artistic skills than me drew a T Rex in a series of "frames" walking towards the observer. I then traced the drawings onto graph paper and converted them into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum_character_set">user-defined graphic characters</a>. I do half wonder whether these might be the mystery bytes which James refers to at one point in his video. Otherwise I believe the program uses calls to the ROM, e.g. <a href="https://speccy.xyz/rom/asm/24b7">this line-drawing subroutine</a>, to draw the walls of the maze.</p>

</p>

<h3 id="the-youtube-video">The Youtube video</h3>

<p>James must've been incredibly patient to type in all the raw numbers for the machine code with only very rudimentary checksums. And, given that the game is written entirely in machine code and the assembler source code is lost in the mists of time, I was impressed that James managed to successfully modify the game in a couple of different ways using a load of judicious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEEK_and_POKE"><code>PEEK</code>s and <code>POKE</code>s</a> and apparently without the use of a disassembler. In particular he's written a nice maze editor program which runs on the Spectrum and allows you to design your own maze. I was quite amused to learn that the maze had to be square - I can't imagine it would've been much harder for me to have allowed rectangular ones!</p>

<p>James is very fair in his criticisms of the game - his main observation is that it's not very interesting to play, but it is very fast compared to other similar games. I also enjoyed reading the reviews of the book he'd found in a couple of magazines of the time. I had a lovely exchange with him in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q656CqMIXLY&amp;lc=UgzsXaL19aLWF7T3qCp4AaABAg">the Youtube comments</a> and he <a href="https://twitter.com/JAMOGRAD/status/1351920870621589506">changed the title</a> of the Youtube video to include my name which was a nice gesture. Anyway, this was a brilliant trip down memory lane for me and reminded me of my programming roots!</p>

<h3 id="playing-the-game">Playing the game</h3>

<p>If you feel as if you want the full "type it in" experience, the Portuguese (!) version of the book is available for <a href="https://archive.org/download/World_of_Spectrum_June_2017_Mirror/World%20of%20Spectrum%20June%202017%20Mirror.zip/World%20of%20Spectrum%20June%202017%20Mirror/sinclair/books/g/GraphicAdventuresForTheSpectrum48K(AventurasGraficasParaOSpectrum48K)(TemposLivres).pdf">download</a> from <a href="https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/index.php?cat=96&amp;id=2000168">Spectrum Computing</a> and you can find the game in "Labirinto" (chapter 4, page 105). Otherwise, <a href="https://github.com/floehopper/3d-maze">this GitHub repo</a> includes a set of <a href="https://worldofspectrum.org/faq/reference/formats.htm#TAP">TAP format</a> files which might work in a Spectrum emulator, although I haven't yet had a chance to try them myself.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>To explain the idea of ‘product discovery’, we can learn a lot from the story of Quibi. <br><a href="https://quibi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quibi</a>, a new streaming service designed for mobile phones, launched on April 6th, 2020. In a crowded market full of big-name competitors like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney Plus, Quibi differentiated its product by offering high-quality, professionally made TV shows tailored for on-the-go viewing. Each piece of content was 10 minutes or less and optimized for both vertical and horizontal full-screen dimensions.</p><p>Because its co-founders were already so successful in both Hollywood and business, Quibi raised almost $2billion prior to launch. They commissioned top talent to create exclusive content. The app itself was well-designed and easy to use. Switching from vertical to horizontal full-screen worked seamlessly, and felt like a genuinely unique feature.</p><p>But on October 22nd, 2020, Quibi shut down with hardly any users—just six months after launching. An article by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528404/quibi-shut-down-cost-subscribers-content-tv-movies-katzenberg-whitman-tiktok-netflix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Verge</a> lists some reasons behind this, from the global pandemic to simply bad content. Above all, the author picks out one factor as decisive: “a lack of insight into consumer behavior, wants, and needs.”</p><p>“Quibi didn’t work because no one at Quibi knew what it should be, what people wanted, or how people use their phones. Its entire thesis is wrong.”</p><p>In other words, Quibi didn’t fail because of flaws in the final product or bad user experience—it failed as an <em>idea</em> for a product. The way to avoid this? Product discovery.</p></div><p id="what"><h2>What is product discovery?</h2></p><div><p>Product discovery is the process of closely understanding what your users’ problems and needs are, then validating your ideas for solutions before starting development. By forming a close relationship with your users and letting them guide your design thinking, your overall product strategy is much more likely to end up solving real-user problems.</p><p>The idea of product discovery was originally developed in the 90s, when many of today’s product management best practices were formed. Back then, companies building websites and digital products spent a lot of time and money trying to convince customers that they needed their great products—but not so much time actually listening to them.</p><p>This led to a lot of very expensive failures, as products often made it to full release before their creators realized that people just didn’t need them. Over time, the development of customer-centric ideas—like the <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jobs to be done</a> framework, and early iterative testing based on user feedback—encouraged product teams to put themselves in their users’ shoes more, and to ask what they thought more often.</p><p>These days, we refer to this broad template of activities and approaches as ‘product discovery.’</p></div><p id="framework"><h2>A step-by-step product discovery framework</h2></p><div><p>There’s no singular, defined set of methods that you have to follow with product discovery—you could include customer feedback surveys, interviews, focus groups, journey mapping, insights from product analytics, and various types of <a href="https://maze.design/guides/usability-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">usability testing</a> in your approach.</p><p>But whatever modern <a href="https://maze.co/guides/product-discovery/techniques/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">product discovery techniques</a> you end up using—more on that in chapter 4—the goals are always the same:</p><ul><li>Form a deep, upfront understanding of what your users need</li><li>Define and validate a solution based on your users’ input</li></ul><p>For this reason, it’s vital to approach product discovery with a mindset that’s open to all possibilities. You might start the process with a really cool idea for a product in the back of your mind, only to find out that your users don’t need a new product after all. Maybe a few specific improvements to your current product are enough. This kind of realization is all part of the ‘discovery’—it’s what makes product discovery both useful and interesting.</p><p>And while the exact methodology is up to you, to achieve your product discovery goals you should combine this open mindset with this basic, step-by-step product discovery framework:</p><h3>1. Learn &amp; understand</h3><p>Before you start thinking about what's next on your product roadmap or even decide which problem you want to solve, spend a decent amount of time communicating with users. Run customer interviews, organize user stories into themes, create journey maps, and form a close relationship with a group of users.</p><p>The information you learn here will help you hone in on pain points to build solutions for. You could spend weeks or months in this stage—however long it takes to start spotting clear themes in your users’ feedback.</p><h3>2. Define &amp; decide</h3><p>Once you’ve got a healthy amount of data and feedback, your team should take a step back and prioritize the most important problems for your users.</p><p>With problems prioritized, you should be able to form a clear, broad hypothesis that can form the foundation of the solutions you develop. This should be a short, simple sentence—often a question—that covers the main problem and related sub-problems you want to solve for your users. Here’s an example:</p><p><em>“Building a commenting feature will increase the amount of time users spend in our product.”</em></p><p>This sounds straightforward, but it will probably take you a few attempts. Take your time—it’s super important to get this part right, as your hypothesis will determine what you build.</p><h3>3. Ideate &amp; prioritize</h3><p>Next, it’s time to get creative and start thinking about what a new product idea might look like. Encourage your team to brainstorm without limits at first, then gradually narrow down to the best ideas. You could even do an ideation hackathon to get the whole team focused on the problem.</p><p>Once you have a few solid options, plan out how each solution could work in practice by assigning scores for predicted value and feasibility to build. There are many ways of prioritizing your options—<a href="https://www.productboard.com/glossary/product-prioritization-frameworks/">some very detailed</a>. The simplest way is the ICE framework: score each solution out of 10 for the Impact (I) it’ll have, your Confidence (C) that it’ll solve the problem, and the Ease (E) of building it, then compare the average scores to get a prioritized list.</p><h3>4. Prototype &amp; test</h3><p>The final stage of product discovery is where you can start prototyping new products or features. But don’t get too carried away—the idea is just to create some quick prototypes for user testing. You could make a working MVP (Minimum Viable Product), a mockup using a design tool, or even a paper prototype.</p><p>With your prototype done, now’s the time to reach out to users again. Run some <a href="https://maze.design/blog/prototype-testing/">prototype tests</a> and collect user feedback to find out if you're building the right product. If your users’ responses validate your hypothesis and early iteration, you’re ready to start development. If not, keep tweaking your prototypes until you’re confident that the solution you’re proposing is really what your users are looking for.</p></div><p id="benefits"><h2>The benefits of product discovery</h2></p><div><p>Like many best practices of modern product development, a lot of the product discovery process seems like common sense. But as the fall of Quibi shows, the benefits of investing time into product discovery are still often overlooked to this day. So let’s take a look at some of the main ones:</p><h4>You’ll save time &amp; money</h4><p>Product teams spending weeks or months doing a lot of thinking and not very much building might seem counterintuitive to the fast startup culture they exist in. The demands of key stakeholders to drive metrics and business goals by shipping new products is a constant pressure for most product teams.&nbsp;</p><p>But cutting corners with <a href="https://maze.design/guides/ux-research">user research</a> to press on with development is a massive—and very expensive—risk. You’re essentially gambling on assumptions about what your users want, which could turn out to be false no matter how experienced you are. Product discovery gives you validation on whether your product needs to exist before spending a lot of money building, polishing, and marketing it. It makes you more agile, not less.</p><p>Sebastien Phlix, Product Manager at N26, sums it up:</p></div><div><div><p color="blue500" font-size="4" font-weight="600" font-family="Public Sans, sans-serif">“Think about how much one two-week sprint costs. 10k? 20K? Product discovery is important because engineering and design time is the most precious asset a company has.”</p><div><div><p><img src="https://images.prismic.io/maze-marketing/69724ec4-2cf8-4519-b505-e0b39715ffc9_Seb.jpg?auto=compress,format&amp;rect=52,0,481,481&amp;w=400&amp;h=400"></p></div></div></div></div><div><h4>Your products will be more innovative</h4><p>By incorporating customer viewpoints from the beginning, product discovery inspires your team to challenge their own assumptions and think outside of the box when making product decisions. This doesn’t just lead to more innovative solutions—it also validates which of your ideas are market opportunities.</p><p>Freddie Beesely, VP of Product at Attest, sees innovation as the true value of product discovery:</p></div><div><div><p color="blue500" font-size="4" font-weight="600" font-family="Public Sans, sans-serif">“Product discovery helps you expand within your market, move into new ones, stay ahead of competition, and adapt to changing trends. Without discovery, products tend to stagnate by getting stuck focusing on the short-term.”</p><div><div><p><img src="https://images.prismic.io/maze-marketing/0d66aefd-6515-4623-ad64-2042b227b9f4_freddie.jpg?auto=compress,format&amp;rect=0,0,200,200&amp;w=400&amp;h=400"></p><p color="#000000" font-size="1" font-family="Public Sans, sans-serif" font-weight="500"><span font-size="16" font-weight="400" color="#000000" font-family="Public Sans, sans-serif">Freddie Beesely<!-- -->,</span><span font-size="16" font-weight="400" color="#000000" font-family="Public Sans, sans-serif"> <!-- -->VP of Product at Attest</span></p></div></div></div></div><div><h4>Your product designers and development team will thank you</h4><p>Product discovery gives you a good idea of whether your new product or feature will be used. And for product designers and developers, seeing their creations help thousands or even millions of people is one of the best parts of the job. Without product discovery, your team members won’t get the feedback they crave.&nbsp;</p><p>Fadeelah Al-horaibi, Senior Product Manager at Slite, knows the feeling:</p></div><div><div><p color="blue500" font-size="4" font-weight="600" font-family="Public Sans, sans-serif">“I've unfortunately been in an environment where product discovery was skipped. No-one was talking about the customer or business opportunities—just product delivery. The scariest part is that once the delivery took place, we were straight on to the next.” </p><div><div><p><img src="https://images.prismic.io/maze-marketing/e6442d46-7134-485f-a972-73dce9fd6a8c_fadeelah.jpg?auto=compress,format&amp;rect=0,333,1333,1333&amp;w=400&amp;h=400"></p><p color="#000000" font-size="1" font-family="Public Sans, sans-serif" font-weight="500"><span font-size="16" font-weight="400" color="#000000" font-family="Public Sans, sans-serif">Fadeelah Al-horaibi<!-- -->,</span><span font-size="16" font-weight="400" color="#000000" font-family="Public Sans, sans-serif"> <!-- -->Senior Product Manager at Slite</span></p></div></div></div></div><div><p>Pivoting late in the development process—or worse, releasing a feature that no one uses—just doesn’t feel good. In many ways, the product development process is all about failing and learning. But without staying close to your customers, it’s hard to even know whether your team succeeded or not.</p><h2>Final notes</h2><p>Before Quibi, co-founder Jeff Katzenberg was CEO of Dreamworks Animation.

<p>Published on <span id="pubdate">2021-01-24</span>.</p>
<p>For many years I have been advocating passionately against the so-called "modern web" as it is really nothing more than a poor excuse for not using your brain and instead following the hype and trends of stuffing web applications with unneeded JavaScript and slow and crappy frameworks. But now the time has come when soon the "modern web" will finally die.</p>

<p>Most people don't like to feel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8BkzvP19v4">outside</a>, which is why the majority is always just following hype and trends. This is also why it is so easy for politicians and news media to fill people with lies.</p>

<p>If something is presented as "the right thing to do", most people want to do it. But what happens when the so-called right thing really doesn't make any sense, or the so-called right thing has obvious flaws? Truly independent thinking and responsible people gather information objectively and try to reach a conclusion without any consideration to social conformity, but most people are not truly independent thinking even though they like to believe they are.</p>

<p>Do you know how you can tell if you are really lying to yourself about why you do what you do? One crystal clear sign is if you are blindly following what the majority is doing without truly understanding the consequences of your actions. Another very clear sign is if you passionately and emotionally criticize the opposite opinion without any true personal experience or knowledge and then call what you do as being "modern", as if what you do is the right thing whereas what others are doing is hopelessly outdated.</p>

<p>The fact about the so-called modern web is that there has really never been any modern web. The hardware has become much faster, but that has nothing to do with the modern web. No, the truth is that the so-called modern web was invented as a term by people who like to feel important and smart. They did so by developing software and frameworks and then telling everyone else to stop "re-inventing the wheel" and instead use their clever solutions. And rather than evaluating the claims of these people objectively, the masses where swayed by all their impressive rhetoric's and their popularity.</p>

<p>The result has been absolutely mind bugling and ridicules because even though the real advance in technology has made the hardware many many times faster, both in processing power and data transfer speeds, the Internet has become absolutely stupidly slow. The main reason for that is all the webpages that gets stuffed with useless JavaScript and frameworks.</p>

<p>I have said it <a href="https://www.unixsheikh.com/articles/stop-pushing-javascript.html">before</a>, and I'll say it again: <strong>If you're pushing JavaScript as a dependency for your website to function, you'd better be serving some pretty amazing and special content, otherwise your website is just plain broken!</strong></p>

<p>Today data centers around the world are using more electricity than ever. It takes more than 50 power plants, each capable of generating 500 megawatts of electricity, to power all the data centers in operation in the U.S. alone. And this number will increase dramatically over the years if the current development model doesn't improve drastically.</p>

<p>My prediction is that in only a couple of years from now, it will be socially and environmentally unacceptable for any kind of company to have a high carbon footprint! And this doesn't mean that a company can simple go all green and start using windmills e.g. The reason for that is that even the production of windmills leaves a pretty high carbon footprint. No, what companies need to do is to reduce power consumption as much as possible. And when it comes to the software industry, then there is only one sure way forward, and that is to improve application performance as much as possible. This is especially important with gaming, web applications and other Internet related services such as gaming server applications. Video providers such as YouTube will eventually have to disallow content that doesn't generate any revenue for them because storage servers requires huge amounts of power.</p>

<p>I believe that in the near future companies will actually begin to compete with each other about who has the most performant applications, web or otherwise.</p>

<p>Just like responsible and grown up people don't throw trash on the street, responsible and grown up people also take care when they develop software. This is actually nothing new at all, it has just been ignored by the staggering careless approach of just "throwing more hardware at the problem because hardware is cheap". The fact is that hardware has never been cheap! Hardware production has always had a huge negative impact on the environment, not only in the form of carbon footprint during production, but also pollution and the thoughtless behavior of simply <a href="https://envibrary.com/electronic-pollution/">throwing away fully working machines</a>.</p>

<p>In 2018 electronic waste in America represented about 2% of the trash in landfills, but it equaled 70% of overall toxic waste.</p>

<p>In the near future public attention will drive government policy and carbon footprints will become a subject of worldwide scrutiny. Individuals, companies and countries will have to seek the fastest and most affordable ways to achieve a net-zero carbon footprint.</p>

<p>This will also mean that careless use of technology in web development, such as JavaScript and frameworks, needs to be a thing of the past and our current way of developing web applications will in the future look like the "dark ages".</p>

<p>For years I have worked as an independent contractor with a main focus on improving performance and security in web applications. My work has not been about throwing more hardware at the problems, but rather to remove hardware! This has been achieved in one very simple way each and every time: Remove all unnecessary JavaScript and re-build the application using a fast programming language without a framework and without stupid and slow design patterns. Absolutely no hype or trends allowed here!</p>

<p>I have argued for years against the irresponsible behavior of software developers who could care less about the future of a company by careless design choices, but for some strange reason many people believe that if you don't use a framework, then you have to reinvent the wheel each time you build something. But nobody does that! What you do instead is that you study and understand the technology you're using and then you put together small pieces of performant and reusable code and use that.</p>

<p>Other people argue against building web applications from the ground up because if you work in a team, then you need to read other peoples code, and without a framework, then nobody knows how to structure the code or understand what other people are doing. Well, guess what, that's what software development is about! Reading and understanding other peoples code, writing really good and quality documentation, commenting your code and following a clear and concise code style guide. If you cannot do that, then you shouldn't be a software developer. This is what we used to call "good programming".</p>

<p>It's time to take responsibility. Be a part of the solution, not the problem!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This is the first part of a three part (II, III) discussion of an idea I am going to term (<a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/2021/01/warrior-episode-forty-one/">borrowing from one of its proponents</a>) the ‘universal warrior’ – the idea that there is a transcendent sameness about either the warrior experience or warrior values which provides some sort of useful blueprint for today or a fundamental truth about viewing the past (it is generally presented as both).</p>



<p>Of course the ‘universal warrior’ is not meant literally; no one, <a href="https://theimaginativeconservative.org/2016/05/through-a-glass-darkly-george-s-patton.html">save George S. Patton</a>, is claiming that a single warrior was reincarnated through a host of battles, always the same in each case.  <strong>Rather, the claim that there is a ‘universal warrior’ is really a claim that there is a universal <em>war experience</em></strong>, which all combatants in all wars take part of and which remains largely unchanged or that there is fundamentally a <strong>universal set of warrior values, behaviors or attributes</strong> which define combatant through the ages and through different kinds of armies, different kinds of service</p>



<p>And that notion is a popular one, appearing equally at home in <a href="https://youtu.be/A50lVLtSQik">anti-war songs</a> and <a href="https://angrystaffofficer.com/2016/12/14/stop-calling-us-warriors/">military recruitment propaganda </a>(along with<a href="https://youtu.be/62tnJtLBQzQ"> lava monsters</a>).  Most recently, my attention was drawn to it by a series of what are effectively <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/category/the-warrior-archetype/">self-help videos</a> framed around the idea by best-selling author Steven Pressfield and I am going to use those videos as the clear form of the argument I want to engage.  In part, this is because Pressfield makes the argument in almost all of its fullness, making many of the implications (‘warrior societies,’ the life advice, the transcendent connection between ‘warriors’ past and present, the implication that ‘warrior’ life is more morally pure and so on) explicit and clear.  And also because Pressfield’s books – <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7rdgm4/how_accurate_is_the_depiction_of_spartan_hoplite/">his <em>fiction</em> I should note, for his historical fiction works have at best a tenuous relationship with the historical record</a> – are, among other things, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gates_of_Fire">on officer training reading lists</a></em> making it a rather important thing if he is peddling an utterly bunk notion of the past.</p>



<p>And it is not hard to see why the idea of a universal warrior value set or a universal warrior experience is an attractive notion; it offers a transcendent connection, linking the experience of combat – whether that is understood positively, as Pressfield does, or negatively as the famous song does – across generations, centuries and cultures.  And it offers the promise of turning that feeling of transcendent connection into a sense of heroism in everyday life, a blueprint for self-improvement, or a timeless model for political consciousness.</p>



<p>And it <em>feels</em> true.  After all, we call people who fought in wars even at the beginnings of written history ‘soldiers’ and ‘warriors and we call our own war-fighters ‘soldiers’ and (unfortunately) ‘warriors.’  That suggestion of equivalence is built right into our linguistic systems.  Students often marvel at the ludicrous tendency for historical artists to represent conflicts in their own deep past (like medieval manuscript illustrators depicting conflicts from classical antiquity) using present (to them) day arms, armor and tactics.  But those same students will often almost immediately fall into the mistake of assuming that combatants of the past shared the same <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/04/16/collections-a-trip-through-bertran-de-born-martial-values-in-the-12th-century-occitan-nobility/">attitudes </a>and <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/04/10/collections-antarah-ibn-shaddad-victory-songs/">motivations </a>about war as they do.</p>



<p><strong>Of course a lot of things <em>feel</em> true which aren’t</strong>.  Standing on the ground, the Earth <em>feels</em> flat, it <em>seems</em> the Sun moves across the sky; of course in reality, the Earth is a ball and in a real sense the sky moves across the Sun.  Many things are <em>intuitive</em>, they <em>feel</em> true, without <em>being</em> true.  <strong>So is there a universal combat experience?</strong></p>



<p>To probe that question, we are going to examine it in two ways. <strong> This week, we’re going to look at the <em>kinds</em> of people in war, what the distinctions are between them and if their experience really can be universally applied</strong>.  Then next week, we’re going to look at this question culturally and chronologically, asking if the experience of the same kinds of people in war was really the same in <em>different wars</em>, drawing heavily on the social-military-history lens which concerns itself with the experience of battle (often called the <em>Face of Battle</em>-school after J. Keegan’s <em>The Face of Battle </em>(1976)).  Then the week after that we’ll take a look at the implications (particularly for how manliness and masculinity are understood) that this historical theory and its failures have on the broader cultural constructs built around it.</p>



<p>Because – spoiler alert –<strong> there is no universal warrior </strong>(in case some of you were concerned that I was going to spend two weeks carefully explaining different categories only to conclude that they were meaningless!) and <strong>there is no universal combat experience</strong>.</p>

<p>Alright?  Let’s soldier on!</p>



<h2>Soldiers and Warriors</h2>



<p>We want to start with asking what the distinction is between <em>soldiers</em> and <em>warriors</em>. <a href="https://angrystaffofficer.com/2016/12/14/stop-calling-us-warriors/"> It is a tricky question </a>and even the <a href="https://youtu.be/7TprgnuYfyQ">U.S. Army sometimes gets it badly wrong</a> (Pressfield, I should note, draws a distinction which isn’t <em>entirely</em> wrong but is so wrapped up with <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/2020/09/warrior-episode-seven/">his dodgy effort to use discredited psychology</a> that I think it is best to start from scratch).  We have a sense that while both of these words mean ‘combatant,’ that they are not quite equivalent.</p>



<p>I suspect many of my readers (specifically the native English speakers) will immediately agree, for instance, that this fellow is a warrior, but not a soldier:</p>

<p>While these fellows, volunteers enrolled in an army for just a single conflict, are soldiers but not warriors:</p>

<p><strong>But <em>why</em>?</strong>  The etymologies of the words can actually help push us a bit in the right direction.  Warrior has a fairly obvious etymology, being related to war (itself a derivative of French <em>guerre</em>); as <em>guerre </em>becomes war, so Old French <em>guerreieor</em> became Middle English <em>werreior</em> and because that is obnoxious to say, modern English ‘warrior’ (which is why it is warrior and not ‘warrer’ as we might expect if it was regularly constructed).  By contrast, soldier comes – it has a tortured journey which I am simplifying – from the <em>sold/sould</em> French root meaning ‘pay’ which in turn comes from Latin <em>solidus</em>, a standard Late Roman coin.  So there is clearly something about pay, or the lack of pay involved in this distinction, but clearly it isn’t <em>just</em> pay or the word mercenary would suit just as well.</p>



<p>So here is the difference: <strong>a warrior is an individual who wars, because it is their foundational vocation</strong>, an irremovable part of their identity and social position, pursued for those private ends (status, wealth, place in society).  <strong>So the core of what it is to be a warrior is that it is an element of personal identity and also fundamentally individualistic</strong> (in <em>motivation</em>, to be clear, not in fighting style – many warriors fought with collective tactics, although I think it fair to say that operation in units is much more central to soldiering than the role of a warrior, who may well fight alone).  A warrior remains a warrior when the war ends.  A warrior remains a warrior if fighting alone or for themselves.</p>



<p>By contrast, a soldier is an individual who <em>soldiers</em> (notably a different verb, which includes a sense of drudgery in war-related jobs that aren’t warring <em>per se</em>) as a <em>job</em> which they may one day leave behind, under the authority of and pursued for a larger community which directs their actions, typically through a system of regular discipline.  <strong>So the core of what it is to be a soldier is that it is a not-necessarily-permanent employment and fundamentally build about being both in and in service to a group.  </strong>A soldier, when the war or their term of service ends, becomes a civilian (something a warrior generally does not do!).  A soldier without a community stops being a soldier and starts being a mercenary.</p>



<p>Incidentally, this distinction is not unique to English.  Speaking of the two languages I have the most experience in, both Greek and Latin have this distinction.  Greek has <em>machetes </em>(<em>μαχητής</em>, lit: ‘battler,’ a <em>mache</em> being a battle) and <em>polemistes</em> (πολεμιστής, lit: ‘warrior,’ a <em>polemos</em> being a war); both are more common in poetry than prose, often used to describe mythical heroes.  Interestingly the word for an individual that fights <em>out of battle order</em> (when there is a battle order) is a <em>promachos</em> (πρόμαχος, lit: ‘fore-fighter’), a frequent word in Homer.  But the standard Greek soldier wasn’t generally called any of these things, he was either a <em>hoplite</em> (ὁπλίτης, ‘full-equipped man,’ named after his equipment) or more generally a <em>stratiotes</em> (στρατιώτης, lit, ‘army-man’ but properly ‘soldier’).  That general word, <em>stratiotes</em> is striking, but its root is <em>stratos</em> (στρατός, ‘army’); a <em>stratiotes</em>, a soldier, for the ancient Greeks was defined by his membership in that larger unit, the army.  One could be a <em>machetes</em> or a <em>polemistes</em> alone, but only a <em>stratiotes</em> in an army (<em>stratos</em>), commanded, presumably, by a general (<em>strategos</em>) in service to a community.</p>



<p>Latin has the same division, with similar shades of meaning.  Latin has <em>bellator</em> (‘warrior’) from <em>bellum</em> (‘war’), but Roman soldiers are not generally <em>bellatores</em> (except in a poetic sense and even then only rarely), even when they are actively waging war.  Instead, the soldiers of Rome are <em>milites</em> (sing. <em>miles</em>).  The word is related to the Latin <em>mille</em> (‘thousand’) from the root ‘mil-‘ which indicates a collection or combination of things.  <em>Milites</em> are thus – like <em>stratiotes</em>, <strong>men put together</strong>, defined by their collective action for the community (strikingly, groups acting for individual aims in Latin are not <em>milites</em> but <em>latrones</em>, bandits – a word Roman authors also …</p></div></div>

<p><span>2020, the most fascinating and boring year of my life, is over, and despite one of the most violent market crashes in history and the sharpest recession of all time, US equity investors clocked in another good year on the calendar. The S&amp;P 500 index finished the year up 18.4%; this despite being down by as much as 30% in March, making 2020 one of the wildest swinging markets in history.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://ycharts.com/indices/%5ESPXTR/chart/#/?annotations=&amp;annualizedReturns=false&amp;calcs=id:total_return_forward_adjusted_price,include:true,,&amp;chartType=interactive&amp;correlations=&amp;dateSelection=range&amp;displayDateRange=false&amp;displayTicker=false&amp;endDate=12/31/2020&amp;format=indexed&amp;legendOnChart=false&amp;maxPoints=2000&amp;note=&amp;partner=basic_2000&amp;quoteLegend=true&amp;quotes=true&amp;recessions=false&amp;redesign=true&amp;scaleType=linear&amp;securities=id:^SPXTR,include:true,,&amp;securityGroup=&amp;securitylistName=&amp;securitylistSecurityId=&amp;source=false&amp;splitType=single&amp;startDate=01/01/2020&amp;title=&amp;units=false&amp;useCustomColors=false&amp;useEstimates=false&amp;zoom=custom"><img src="https://media.ycharts.com/charts/ccd34ab62ba3cdcc49abe8547f2cff73.png" alt="^SPXTR Chart"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://ycharts.com/indices/^SPXTR">^SPXTR</a> data by <a href="https://ycharts.com/">YCharts</a></p>
<p><span>But if you didn’t earn double digit returns last year you were in good company. The bull market was extremely concentrated in a narrow subset of stocks and most others floundered over the year. By my count, of the top 5,000 stocks trading on US exchanges (this includes over a thousand foreign stocks with US listings), only a little over half finished 2020 in positive territory and the median return was only 4.3%. If you didn’t have the good fortune to buy the few winners you were left behind, as happened with some of the industry’s best. Many of the world’s largest and previously most successful hedge funds and institutional money managers had a terrible 2020, including the top two: Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates and Jim Simon’s Renaissance Technologies, each famous for their billionaire visionary founders, uniquely<span> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-12/the-unsolved-mystery-of-the-medallion-fund-s-success">secretive</a>/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbsVbFAczg">creepy</a></span> company culture, and astounding market-beating performance over decades, each suffered <em>negative double-digit</em> returns in their main funds in 2020. Similarly, some of the industry’s most highly regarded names such as <span><a href="https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1p9nxxx1d47xk/AQR-to-Liquidate-Some-Funds-After-Persistent-Outflows">AQR</a></span>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-17/renaissance-two-sigma-see-losses-as-quant-giants-navigate-chaos"><span>Two Sigma</span></a>, and <span><a href="https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1012650/dfa-is-paying-the-price-for-its-conviction">Dimensional Fund Advisors</a></span> all suffered massive investor redemptions in the face of substantial underperformance in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span>All these fund managers pursue a variety of different strategies in a variety of different markets, but they all have one thing in common: they’re quants. They take a data-driven approach to investing, using mathematical models based typically on decades of market returns to execute their strategy, often employing teams of Ph.D mathematicians, computer scientists, and economists to crunch the numbers. They generally pay little attention to the “human interest” elements of investing like the executive bio or squishy concepts like “product market fit” or five year strategic plans. There are a lot of different ways to be a quant, but if you are one, or invested with one in 2020, you probably had a bad year. 2020 was the year of the swashbuckling stock-picker. As Bloomberg declared in a year-end article, <span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-30/human-run-hedge-funds-trounce-quants-in-year-defined-by-pandemic">Human-Run Hedge Funds Trounce Quants in Covid Year</a></span>. 2020 was the revenge&nbsp;<em>against</em> the nerds.</span></p>
<p><span>So what happened? Leo Tolstoy famously wrote, “All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” So it was with investing in 2020, there were many different investing strategies that went unhappily in 2020, and all the strategies that went happily looked pretty much the same. Let’s look at the unhappy families first and then return to the one thing that went well in 2020.</span></p>
<h3>Diversification</h3>
<p>2020 saw a repeat of something we’ve witnessed a few times in the last decade, not only did US stocks have an especially good year, they did substantially better than pretty much every other market. Investors who diversified across multiple asset classes therefore had much weaker returns.</p>
<p><a href="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-1024x619.png" alt="" width="1024" height="619" srcset="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-200x121.png 200w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-300x181.png 300w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-400x242.png 400w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-600x363.png 600w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-768x464.png 768w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-800x484.png 800w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-1024x619.png 1024w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-1200x726.png 1200w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020.png 1470w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p><span>Just about the only major asset that beat the S&amp;P 500 last year was gold. The shiny metal held its weight during the crisis in March and powered through the rest of the year. Emerging market stocks also put in a solid year, virtually tied with the US market, despite suffering an even harder crash in March. Most other major assets, however, had much more modest returns, including the stock markets of most other rich, industrialized nations. Investors diversified across these major markets still likely had reasonably positive returns, but were a far cry from the meteoric rise of the S&amp;P 500.</span></p>
<p><span>Of course, how investors allocated both across and within these asset classes was of tantamount importance to their outcomes in 2020, and generally these outcomes frustrated quants at every turn. Whether picking stocks within a market or allocating across asset classes, quants often rely on measures of valuation, volatility, or momentum to guide their process, based on the historical success of these metrics in predicting returns, and in nearly every case following the numbers led investors astray in 2020, starting with perhaps the most time-tested of financial strategies, value investing.</span></p>
<h3><span>Value and Fundamentals</span></h3>
<p><span>For investors like yours truly who believe markets ultimately have to have some <span><a href="https://rhsfinancial.com/2020/08/11/does-reality-matter-stock-market-2020/">relation to reality</a></span>, the following joke tweet from December is a little too on the nose.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="395" srcset="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word-200x82.jpg 200w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word-300x123.jpg 300w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word-400x165.jpg 400w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word-600x247.jpg 600w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word-768x316.jpg 768w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word-800x329.jpg 800w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"></a></p>
<p><span>Value investors ask the same seemingly reasonable question of investments we all ask when we’re considering buying a good or service: is the price I have to pay a good deal compared to the quality I’m getting? In practice this generally means value investors seek to buy assets whose prices are low relative to their cashflows or other economic fundamentals. Value investing has an intellectual pedigree going back to at least the 1920s with the classic writings of Graham and Dodd and is perhaps most famous for their most successful student, Warren Buffett (who also didn’t do so well last year). Value investing has been out of favor for several years now, especially in the US market, something I documented extensively in my <span><a href="https://rhsfinancial.com/2020/08/11/does-reality-matter-stock-market-2020/">two part</a> <a href="https://rhsfinancial.com/2020/08/19/does-reality-matter-part2/">series</a></span> last year on market valuations.</span></p>
<p><span>Last year was a miserable one for value investors. Within the US market, value stocks lagged the market in the first couple months, fell further during the crash, and recovered slower than the rest of the market. Though they rallied harder in the last two months of the year, value stock both large and small finished the year finished the year just barely above zero, as judged by the commonly followed Russell 1000 Value (large stocks) and Russell 2000 Value (small stocks) indexes.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://ycharts.com/indices/%5ESPXTR/chart/#/?annotations=&amp;annualizedReturns=false&amp;calcs=id:total_return_forward_adjusted_price,include:true,,&amp;chartType=interactive&amp;correlations=&amp;dateSelection=range&amp;displayDateRange=false&amp;displayTicker=false&amp;endDate=12/31/2020&amp;format=indexed&amp;legendOnChart=false&amp;maxPoints=2000&amp;note=&amp;partner=basic_2000&amp;quoteLegend=true&amp;quotes=true&amp;recessions=false&amp;redesign=true&amp;scaleType=linear&amp;securities=id:^SPXTR,include:true,,id:^RLVTR,include:true,,id:^RUJTR,include:true,,&amp;securityGroup=&amp;securitylistName=&amp;securitylistSecurityId=&amp;source=false&amp;splitType=single&amp;startDate=01/01/2020&amp;title=&amp;units=false&amp;useCustomColors=false&amp;useEstimates=false&amp;zoom=custom"><img src="https://media.ycharts.com/charts/273b52a1901248cfb2556266430d94d6.png" alt="^SPXTR Chart"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://ycharts.com/indices/^SPXTR">^SPXTR</a> data by <a href="https://ycharts.com/">YCharts</a></p>
<p><span>Applying the value effect around the world gave even worse results. Choosing between stock markets, the US started the year the most expensive market in the world, and those in Europe were among the cheapest. But as we saw, the US market became more expensive still, and European stock investors barely ended the year in positive territory. Value stocks within foreign markets similarly failed to keep up with their broader market aggregates. One index of value stocks around the world, the MSCI ACWI Value Index, finished the year up a mere 0.42%. Taking an even more expansive view of valuation and applying it across global assets, buying those stocks, bonds, commodities, and currencies measured as cheap and selling those measured as expensive would have lost you about 12% in 2020 (through November) according to <span><a href="https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Datasets/Value-and-Momentum-Everywhere-Factors-Monthly">AQR’s methodology</a></span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Skeptics of value investing often point out that value stocks are usually cheap for a reason: they’re junk. Indeed, if you simply sort the market based on a simple valuation metric like price to book ratio you’ll often find that the most undervalued stocks are in declining industries, have weak balance sheets and margins, and are projected to lose market share. Value investors often try to avoid “value traps” like this by augmenting their value factors with metrics to score some measure of “quality”, looking at profitability measures like return on equity, for example. Adding such quality filters would have only made things worse in 2020. Among the cheapest stocks in the market, the most profitable among them did the worst last year.</span></p>
<p><span>Professor Ken French keeps an invaluable <span><a href="https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html">online database</a></span> to quants that records the track records to different portfolios of stocks sorted on a variety of metrics. Looking at a double-sorted portfolio of the stocks that are in the lowest quintile of valuation and the highest quintile of profitability, here’s how such a portfolio did last year (through November) compared to the S&amp;P 500.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-1024x546.png" alt="" width="1024" height="546" srcset="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-200x107.png 200w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-300x160.png 300w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-400x213.png 400w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-600x320.png 600w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-768x409.png 768w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-800x426.png 800w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-1024x546.png 1024w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-1200x639.png 1200w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value.png 1490w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><span>The most profitable, cheapest stocks in the US lost more than half of their value in the crash last year, before recovering to end up down “only” about 20% last year, a staggering 33.8% behind the S&amp;P 500.</span></p>
<p><span>Take a moment to consider how counterintuitive this ought to seem. I think most people, even without much financial savvy, would consider the strategy of “buy highly profitable companies at attractive valuations” to seem like a fairly reasonable one, the sort of things that might actually deliver superior results over the long run, and indeed if we look at the long run data it has, as we’ll see further down the page. You might even suspect that such a prudent strategy might shine especially during a period of great economic tumult and uncertainty, and indeed it often has historically. But that is absolutely&nbsp;<em>not</em> what happened during the chaos of 2020. And that wasn’t the only curveball 2020 threw quants either.</span></p>
<h3><span>Low Volatility/Risk Parity</span></h3>
<p><span>After value, low volatility strategies are some of the most commonly used quant approaches of the last decade. Research going back to the 70s shows that those stocks whose prices are relatively more stable tend to roughly keep up with the rest of the market or nearly so when times are good, but lose far less value during panics and bear markets. Thus, over the long run they’ve done about as good or better as the rest of the market with a lot less risk. That is… decidedly not what happened last year. Within the US market, two of the most popular quant funds of recent years have been the iShares US Minimum Volatility ETF and the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Low Volatility ETF, two ETFs that use a quantitative approach to pick the least volatile stocks within the US market. With tens of billions of dollars between them, here’s how these two flavors of low volatility stock investing did last year.</span></p>

<h3>When the pipe bursts</h3>



<p>7am every Wednesday, it was time to release the code. I’d take a weeks worth of code that I knew nothing about, by 2 dozen people, and ship it to production. We tested the code in isolation. We tested it together in our lower environments.  But even then when it was up on production who knew what was going to happen. Even if the release itself went well, there was always a chance that a feature was not ready for users. Finding that out at the last minute could push a release to a later day. This would delay other important releases that teams worked hard on.</p>



<p> <br>By batching up releases, we thought we were doing everyone a favor.  Customer success only has to learn about the release once a week! One person can own the release process and be an authority on it! We can test everything together all at once, and know for sure that it will work!. We were so wrong. </p>



<p><br>By batching up releases, we introduced a ton of risk. The release became an all or nothing affair. If any feature in a release wasn’t ready for customers, everything we had already communicated to customers was at risk. We would mitigate that risk by creating new problems. Rushing through something or introducing new issues. </p>



<p><br>The person (me) who was doing the deployment had no context for what exactly I was deploying. Sure the steps we could document the steps and what was in the release. But if something went wrong,, all I knew I could do was stop the whole train. If anything broke, it was impossible to figure out what may have caused it. Even if you are an expert of a system, a week’s worth of work by 20+ people is impossible to isolate defects. </p>



<p><br>After a few too many stressful releases, we decided one of the best investments we could make quickly was feature flags. With feature flags, you separate the release of code to customers from the deployment to production. Code for a new feature can live in a production environment for any duration of time without disruption to your customer. When the feature is ready, any team member can turn it on. If there is an issue for any reason, Anyone can shut the feature off, limiting impact. </p>



<p><br>We saw improvements to our process right away.  We stopped batching deployments, instead we would deploy to production regularly. Each change getting sent to production was easy to discern, it could be as small as a couple lines of code. If there was an issue it would be easy to track and identify. </p>



<p><br>When a feature was  ready for customers, anyone on our team, especially our product owners, could turn it on. We even went further. To deliver value customers sooner, we could build smaller features and only release it to users who had no known edge cases.  Once we had more time to identify how to approach the edge cases those customers would receive the updates. Teams became more confident, less stressed, and could get feedback on their work in a much shorter timeframe. </p>



<p><br>This was a transformative experience for me. I’ve been preaching the gospel ever since. I knew I could help get teams to work faster by enabling feature flags for more teams. </p>



<p><br>That’s why I built Molasses. <br></p>



<h3>The Great Molasses Flood </h3>

<p>I started building in June. I focused on the problems I saw with the current tools. I surveyed those who had used feature flagging and A/B testing services in the past to get their opinion. What I found was that while there are great solutions here and there, but there was space for improvement. </p>



<p><br>Despite being a developer focused tool,  so many feature flag services are developer hostile. They can be slow, and make blocking remote calls. They are naive in their ability to target users, sometimes only by IP address or one parameter.  They had no way to audit changes. They lacked integrations with platforms for planning, chatops or observability.   Teams are slow to remove feature flags, accumulating technical debt. The gaps in these feature flag systems are  filled with custom software. Taking away from expensive developer and operations resources. </p>



<p><br><a href="https://www.molasses.app/">Molasses</a> allows teams to get up and running with feature flags right away. It supports many different languages and frameworks.  Molasses’ clients are fast, non-blocking, and the service pushes updates to the client instantly, no waiting.  You can roll out features to specific users and target specific groups. Molasses lets teams focus on the features they are building, not building feature flag technology. </p>



<p><br>Molasses unlocks A/B testing. We can examine the effectiveness  of a change right away. Want to start rolling out a feature to a set of alpha or beta users? No problem! Molasses will let you adjust who receives a feature over time.</p>

<p><br>Molasses isn’t the only tool in your toolchain. It integrates with the systems you already use, like Datadog or Slack. You can use those updates to know if a recent change is causing issues. When your feature is finally rolled out, Molasses has the code clean itself up. It opens a PR in your Github repo removing any stale code. </p>

January 28, 2021 | https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/constant-folding-python | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/constant-folding-python">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Every programming language aims to be performant in its niche and achieving superior performance requires a lot of compiler level optimizations. One famous optimization technique is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding">Constant Folding</a> where during compile time the engine tries to recognize constant expressions, evaluate them, and replaces the expression with this newly evaluated value, making the runtime leaner.</p>
<p>In this essay, we dive deep and find what exactly is Constant Folding, understand the scope of it in the world of Python and finally go through Python's source code - <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/">CPython</a> - and find out how elegantly Python actually implements it.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding">Constant Folding</a>, the engine finds and evaluates constant expressions at compile time rather than computing them at runtime, making the runtime leaner and faster.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>day_sec = <span>24</span> * <span>60</span> * <span>60</span>
</code></pre>
<p>When the compiler encounters a constant expression, like above, it evaluates the expression and replaces it with the evaluated value. The expression is usually replaced by the evaluated value in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract Syntax Tree</a>, but the implementation is totally up to the language. Hence the above expression is effectively executed as</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>day_sec = <span>86400</span>
</code></pre>

<p>In Python, we could use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#module-dis">Disassembler module</a> to get the CPython bytecode giving us a good peek at how things will be executed. When we disassemble the above constant expression using the <code>dis</code> module, we get the following bytecode</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>import</span> dis
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>dis.dis(<span>"day_sec = 24 * 60 * 60"</span>)

        <span>0</span> LOAD_CONST               <span>0</span> (<span>86400</span>)
        <span>2</span> STORE_NAME               <span>0</span> (day_sec)
        <span>4</span> LOAD_CONST               <span>1</span> (<span>None</span>)
        <span>6</span> RETURN_VALUE
</code></pre>
<p>We see that the bytecode, instead of having two binary multiply operations followed by one <code>LOAD_CONST</code>, is having just one <code>LOAD_CONST</code> with the already evaluated value of <code>86400</code>. This indicates that the CPython interpreter during parsing and building of Abstract Syntax Tree folded the constant expression, <code>24 * 60 * 60</code> and replaced it with the evaluated value <code>86400</code>.</p>
<h3>Scope of Constant Folding</h3>
<p>Python tries to fold every single constant expression present but there are some cases where even though the expression is constant, but Python chooses not to fold it. For example, Python does not fold <code>x = 4 ** 64</code> while it does fold <code>x = 2 ** 64</code>.</p>
<p>Apart from the arithmetic expressions, Python also folds expressions involving Strings and Tuples, where constant string expressions till the length <code>4096</code> are folded.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = <span>"-"</span> * <span>4096</span>   
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = <span>"-"</span> * <span>4097</span>   
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = <span>"--"</span> * <span>4096</span>  
</code></pre>

<p>Now we shift our focus to the internals and find exactly where and how CPython implements Constant Folding. All AST optimizations, including Constant Folding, can be found in file <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/ast_opt.c">ast_opt.c</a>. The base function starting it all is <code>astfold_expr</code> which folds any and every expression that Python source has. The function recursively goes through the AST and tries to fold every constant expression, as seen in the snippet below.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/103898628-38922200-511b-11eb-965f-fb4d46d3c45c.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/103898628-38922200-511b-11eb-965f-fb4d46d3c45c.png"></p>
<p>The <code>astfold_expr</code> before folding the expression at hand, tries to fold its child expressions (operands) and then delegates the folding to the corresponding specific expression folding function. The operation-specific folding function evaluates the expression and returns the evaluated constant value, which is then put into the AST.</p>
<p>For example, whenever <code>astfold_expr</code> encounters a binary operation, it recursively folds the two child operands (expressions) before evaluating the expression at hand using <code>fold_binop</code>. The function <code>fold_binop</code> returns the evaluated constant value as seen in the snippet below.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/103898745-670ffd00-511b-11eb-88a9-f741157473b3.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/103898745-670ffd00-511b-11eb-88a9-f741157473b3.png"></p>
<p><code>fold_binop</code> function folds the binary operation by checking the kind of operator at hand and then invoking the corresponding evaluation function on them. For example, if the operation at hand is an addition then, to evaluate the final value, it invokes <code>PyNumber_Add</code> on both its left and right operands.</p>
<h3>What makes this elegant?</h3>
<p>Instead of writing special logic to handle certain patterns or types to fold constant expressions efficiently, CPython invokes the same general code. For example, it invokes the same usual <code>PyNumber_Add</code> function while folding that it does to perform the usual addition operation.</p>
<p>CPython has thus eradicated the need to write special functions to handle constant folding by making sure its code and evaluation process is structured in such a way that the general-purpose code itself can handle the evaluation of constant expressions.</p>

It'll send you an email/SMS/push notification when logging into your domain manager.</p><p>While not a foolproof way of stopping hackers, it'll slow them down <strong>and</strong> alert you if your account has been compromised.</p><h2 id="check-that-your-domain-is-set-to-auto-renew"><a href="#check-that-your-domain-is-set-to-auto-renew" aria-label="guidelines to help avoid losing your domain permalink"></a>Check that your domain is set to auto renew</h2><p>Some domain registrars don't enable auto renew by default, particularly when transferring domains.</p><p>Check your domain manager to see that it's enabled.</p><h2 id="lock-your-domain-from-transfer"><a href="#lock-your-domain-from-transfer" aria-label="guidelines to help avoid losing your domain permalink"></a>Lock your domain from transfer</h2><p>While you're checking your domain manager has auto renewal enabled, also double check that your domain's "transfer lock" is also enabled.</p><p>Enabling transfer lock for your domain is effectively like a car alarm for your domain. If someone manages to get into your domain manager account, and tries to transfer the domain, you'll receive quite a few emails about it.</p><h2 id="check-your-payment-details"><a href="#check-your-payment-details" aria-label="guidelines to help avoid losing your domain permalink"></a>Check your payment details</h2><p>I know this one sounds obvious, but if the payment fails, your domain doesn't get renewed.</p><p>The most common mistake is that your credit card expires, and you forget to update the payment details your domain registrar has on file.</p><p>On the off-chance your domain registrar accepts Paypal (or similar), also double check that the payment details that they have are also up to date.</p><h2 id="use-a-reputable-domain-registrar"><a href="#use-a-reputable-domain-registrar" aria-label="guidelines to help avoid losing your domain permalink"></a>Use a reputable domain registrar</h2><p>There are a few ways to interpret "reputable" - I mean large companies trust them with their services, and the business itself is trustworthy. Certain domain registrars also own companies that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_drop_catching">"drop catch"</a> domains that expire from their services. Would <strong>you</strong> want to use a domain registrar that's financially incentivised to let your domain expire?</p><p>Here are some reputable domain registrars that immediately come to mind:</p><ul><li>AWS<ul><li>Some of the largest internet companies trust AWS to host their services</li></ul></li><li>NameCheap<ul><li>Decent reputation, has been around a very long time, used to make you pay for privacy, now doesn't</li></ul></li><li>Gandi<ul><li>Decent reputation, has been around a very long time</li></ul></li><li>Google Domains<ul><li>I hesitated to put this one on the list. Google has a reputation for <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">killing products</a> once it realises it won't be a billion dollar business. Despite this, I've heard Google's Support has been slowly improving over time.</li></ul></li></ul><p>I've personally had negative experiences with GoDaddy and CrazyDomains (in Australia), and would strongly recommend to anyone reading this: transfer your domain ASAP to somewhere like AWS.</p><h2 id="be-sure-you-own-your-domain"><a href="#be-sure-you-own-your-domain" aria-label="guidelines to help avoid losing your domain permalink"></a>Be sure you own your domain</h2><p>If you purchased your domain through a third-party, like Wix, WordPress, or maybe the agency or contractor that helped build your site, chances are you're not fully in control of your domain.</p><p>Sure, it might be easier for you to have them manage the domain for you, and pass the bill along each year, however this sort of arrangement can become problematic when you want to cancel the service, or move to another provider.</p><p>If you're having an agency or contractors build your site for you, and they become unresponsive, you risk losing the domain if you also let them manage it for you.</p><p>By keeping the login to your domain manager to yourself, you can cut ties with rogue third-parties and move to a different provider.</p><h2 id="extend-your-domain-registration"><a href="#extend-your-domain-registration" aria-label="guidelines to help avoid losing your domain permalink"></a>Extend your domain registration</h2><p>Most domain registrars will let you extend your registration for around $12 USD per year for .com domains. This lets you remove the risk of your automatic renewal not going through by manually renewing.</p><p>For example, AWS offers the following:</p><p><img src="https://onlineornot.com/assets/guidelines-to-help-avoid-losing-your-domain/extend-domain-registration.png" alt="AWS Extend Domain Registration"></p><p>Considering the amount of money domain squatters will try to get from you if you let your domain expire, it's a pretty good deal.</p><h2 id="be-aware-of-any-tld-specific-rules-around-renewals"><a href="#be-aware-of-any-tld-specific-rules-around-renewals" aria-label="guidelines to help avoid losing your domain permalink"></a>Be aware of any TLD-specific rules around renewals</h2><p>While it's great fun to grab a domain from a country half way across the world from you so you can spell out your brand, different countries have different rules around domain renewals.</p><p>As an example, Spain (.es) charges a renewal fee on top of an annual fee. As well as that, if you let the domain expire, there's another renewal fee that ranges from 30 USD to hundreds of dollars (depending on your registrar).</p><p><strong>Got any tips I'm missing?</strong> Feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/RozenMD">tweet them at me</a>!</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>On December 13, 2020, Reuters broke the story that the Treasury Department has been compromised by sophisticated hackers, and afterwords numerous organize confirm the story. Washington Post attributed hack to cozy bear (Russian SVR). To understand Solarwinds hack, first need to understand what <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solarwinds</a> does.</p>

<h2><span id="What_Solarwinds_does"></span>What Solarwinds does?<span></span></h2>
<p>Solarwinds is a software company which has numerous software offering for systems managements. These software programs are primarily managed by IT professionals at large institutions.</p>

<p>Orion<strong> NMS (Network Management Systems)</strong> is the most popular software of Solarwinds and has capabilities of managing and monitoring a wide variety of devices such as servers, desktop, laptop, network devices etc. </p>

<p>The Company has 300,000+ customers worldwide, including 425 of US Fortune 500 companies. </p>

<h2><span id="How_hacker_compromises_Solarwinds_systems_And_Why_Solarwinds_hack_spread_for_so_long_without_detection"></span>How hacker compromises Solarwinds systems? And Why Solarwinds hack spread for so long without detection?<span></span></h2>
<p>Since Solarwinds NMS has access to so many devices in an institution and so many institutions use Solarwinds NMS, it becomes a prime target of hackers.</p>
<p>NMS are run on two modes. First is monitoring and second is monitoring/managing. Many of the systems are configured to do both. So if NMS compromised, attacker can do what NMS can do. </p>
<p>According to SEC filling by Solarwinds, hackers infiltrated as early as March 2020, and It took almost 9 months to detect <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the first instance of hack</a>, so why it took so long to figure out even tough 425 out of Fortunes 500 companies were using it.</p>
<p>Hacker compromise build server of Solarwinds and added malware(named sunburst) to existing software during build process and signed with Solarwinds digital signature. As once software signed by official signature, many of the anti-malware and anti-virus software accept that software behavior as normal, As anti-malware and anti-virus companies don’t know Solarwinds signature has been compromised. This is still evolving situation and some argue only build process was compromise. (But anyhow digital signature became useless). </p>
<p>Sophistication does not stop here. Malware was written in away, so it will stay dormant for first 15 days or so anti-malware and anti-virus can’t associate changes in network pattern to change in Solarwinds software version.</p>
<p>Not just that, Hackers make sure that sunburst maleware’s outgoing traffic look very similar to typical Solarwinds traffic. It seems like the hackers’ goal was to stay in the infected systems as long as possible. </p>
<p>The story gets even crazy, before executing sunburst malware, hacker will make sure it is not private IP or Microsoft IP ranges as it seems like hackers were aware that Microsoft has capabilities to capture this kind of activity, so hackers make sure malware does not connect to Microsoft IP. Kudos to Microsoft. </p>

		<p>A key defence of appeasement, and especially the 1938 Munich Agreement, is that it gave Britain and France time to rearm against the Nazi threat. It is actually an ex-post argument: Chamberlain himself sold his policies as a bid for peace, not time. He launched no rearmament effort until March 1939, when Hitler reneged on Munich. The idea has nevertheless achieved a surprising degree of acceptance, especially in Britain. It was worthwhile sacrificing Czechoslovakia in 1938 the better to be able to face Germany militarily in 1939/40, so it goes. Except it wasn’t.</p>
<p>In this post I set out why the Entente partners actually <em>lost&nbsp;</em>time at Munich in as few words as possible. The long argument can be found in <em>The Bell of Treason</em>or in my <em>International History Review&nbsp;</em>article on the subject. It is touched upon in the rest of the Munich literature, of course, though not with the full data.</p>
<p>The first reason Britain and France were worse off in 1939 than 1938 is that in 1939 they got a far weaker set of allies. In September 1938, they could count on Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union. In September 1939, they only had Poland. Czechoslovakia had fully mobilised, possessed a well-equipped army, and could base its defence on a long fortification barrier. Poland was surprised in the middle of mobilization, its army was ill equipped, and – thanks to the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of August 1939 – it was invaded from both sides. The longer explanation, again, is in my book.</p>

<p><em>Nuremberg Panzer factory (Ullstein Bild – Photo12 / Collection Bernard Crochet)</em></p>
<p>The key data is military. France, and with it Britain, lost time because the one to one-and-a-half years between 1938 and 1939/40 helped Germany far more than it helped them. This was partly because the Germans were able to seized the large Czechoslovak stockpiles and factories. A third of the tanks that pierced the French front in May 1940, causing the French collapse, were built in Czechoslovakia. Germany faced dire raw-material and production bottlenecks in 1938, which were relieved through time gained, the Czech annexation, and the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. Meanwhile, German rearmament proper had only begun in 1935 when Hitler had reintroduced conscription. By 1938, Germany had thus been forming new army divisions for three years. By 1939 this was four years and by 1940 almost five: half as long again as by 1938.</p>
<p>I set out the relative army numbers, in simplified form, in the table below. France did not need to re-arm because it was already armed at or close to its full potential. Its accretion in military strength between 1938 and 1939 was limited. Germany’s accrued power was considerable. The difference became even more marked by 1940. This does not count the relative value of the Czechoslovak or Polish armies nor any Soviet contribution. Britain’s expeditionary force only increased from two to five divisions in the interval, so it can be ignored.</p>

<p>After the war started, France was able to put together another twenty divisions, while Germany assembled another forty. So France’s position changed from an advantage of fifteen divisions in 1938, to a disadvantage of twenty-four by 1939, which became forty-five in May 1940. This is a quantitative, not a qualitative overview, but two additional factors are worth mentioning. First, the 1938 German tanks were all Panzer I and II models, fitted with inferior armour and firepower. The mark I Panzer did not even possess a canon, just a machinegun. The tanks that pierced the French front in 1940 were mark III and IV – still at the prototype stage in 1938. Second, the German army was only able to push through Belgium, in 1940, by taking its border fortresses with glider and parachute units. In 1938, these elite units were still being assembled.</p>
<p>Germany lacked the firepower to defeat France in 1938. Indeed, it faced defeat at the hands of a stronger coalition, possibly in short order. It also follows, finally, that it was not in a position to launch an attack on Britain. This goes to the core of the theory that Chamberlain bought time by helping muster the country’s air defences. Actually in 1938 Britain was already producing Spitfires and Hurricanes, and output rhythms were not sped up until the spring of 1939 – and even then still less than to a wartime pace – so that the time gained was close to nil. But the key is that the <em>Luftwaffe</em>, even in 1940, could only launch an assault on Britain from bases in Belgium and northern France. It was not possible to do that from Germany. So until France fell, there could be no Battle of Britain. And if Germany lacked the land forces to defeat France in 1938 or 39…</p>
<p>The Battle of Britain was this incredibly romantic moment, immortalized by Churchill. Seen more coldly, though, it was only one of many turning points in WWII, the first among which were the falls of Poland, then France. The Battle of Britain was not even “the end of the beginning” (that was reserved to El Alamein). I want to close this post with Churchill’s own words, making exactly the point I make in the preceding paragraph.</p>
<p>“The German armies were not capable of defeating the French in 1938 or 1939. The vast tank production with which they broke the French front did not come into existence until 1940, and, in the face of French superiority in the West and an unconquered Poland in the East, they could certainly not have concentrated the whole of their air-power against England as they were able to do when France had been forced to surrender. This takes no account either of the attitude of Russia or of whatever resistance Czechoslovakia might have made. I have thought it right to set out the figures of relative air-power in the period concerned, but they do not in any way alter the conclusions which I have recorded. For all the above reasons, the year’s breathing-space said to be “gained” by Munich left Britain and France in a much worse position compared with Hitler’s Germany than they had been at the Munich crisis.”</p>

<p>Earlier, I had written about controversial court cases, such as the trials of George Zimmerman, Dominique Strauss Kahn &amp; the Duke Lacrosse Team. We discussed our <a rel="noopener" href="https://outlookzen.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/acknowledging-our-ignorance/" target="_blank">tendency to jump to conclusions</a> and assume what must have really happened, based on flimsy pieces of evidence and our own preconceived notions and biases. In truth, this isn’t isolated to sensational current events. This is endemic to the way we live our lives &amp; perceive the world every single day.</p>



<p>All too often, we see people who are so unwaveringly certain. Certain that their lifestyle &amp; way of doing things is best. Certain that their God is the one true God &amp; all others are heathens or infidels. Certain that their political beliefs are correct, and their opponents represent everything that is wrong with the country. Certain that they are right &amp; anyone who disagrees with them is wrong.</p>



<p>Personally, I find this certainty to be unbearably stifling. Even when I’m with like minded peers who subscribe to my political or lifestyle beliefs, I often find myself ill at ease with how certain they are of themselves, and how dismissive they are of anyone or anything that disagrees with their mental model of how the world works. Isn’t it possible to believe in something, while still holding reservations about the possibility of being wrong?</p>



<p>Hence why I found the <a rel="noopener" href="http://nyti.ms/1k1pB7c" target="_blank">following article so refreshing and insightful</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>“One aim of the physical sciences has been to give an actual picture of the material world. One achievement of physics in the 20th century has been to show that such an aim is unattainable.” For Dr. Bronowski, there was no absolute knowledge and anyone who claims it — whether a scientist, a politician or a religious believer — opens the door to tragedy. All scientific information is imperfect and we have to treat it with humility. Such, for him, was the human condition.</em></p><p><em>This is the condition for what we can know, but it is also, crucially, a moral lesson. It is the lesson of 20th-century painting from Cubism onwards, but also that of quantum physics. All we can do is to push deeper and deeper into better approximations of an ever-evasive reality. The goal of complete understanding seems to recede as we approach it.</em></p><p><em>There is no God’s eye view, Dr. Bronowski insisted, and the people who claim that there is and that they possess it are not just wrong, they are morally pernicious. Errors are inextricably bound up with pursuit of human knowledge, which requires not just mathematical calculation but insight, interpretation and a personal act of judgment for which we are responsible.</em></p><p><em>… the genesis of Werner Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle in the hugely creative milieu that surrounded the physicist Max Born in the 1920s. Dr. Bronowski insisted that the principle of uncertainty was a misnomer, because it gives the impression that in science (and outside of it) we are always uncertain. But this is wrong. Knowledge is precise, but that precision is confined within a certain toleration of uncertainty.</em></p><p><em>… Dr. Bronowski thought that the uncertainty principle should therefore be called the principle of tolerance. Pursuing knowledge means accepting uncertainty. Heisenberg’s principle has the consequence that no physical events can ultimately be described with absolute certainty or with “zero tolerance,” as it were. The more we know, the less certain we are.</em></p><p><em>In the everyday world, we do not just accept a lack of ultimate exactitude with a melancholic shrug, but we constantly employ such inexactitude in our relations with other people. Our relations with others also require a principle of tolerance. We encounter other people across a gray area of negotiation and approximation. Such is the business of listening and the back and forth of conversation and social interaction.</em></p><p><em>For Dr. Bronowski, the moral consequence of knowledge is that we must never judge others on the basis of some absolute, God-like conception of certainty. All knowledge, all information that passes between human beings, can be exchanged only within what we might call “a play of tolerance,” whether in science, literature, politics or religion. As he eloquently put it, “Human knowledge is personal and responsible, an unending adventure at the edge of uncertainty.”</em></p><p><em>The relationship between humans and nature and humans and other humans can take place only within a certain play of tolerance. Insisting on certainty, by contrast, leads ineluctably to arrogance and dogma based on ignorance.</em></p><p><em>At this point, in the final minutes of the show, the scene suddenly shifts to Auschwitz, where many members of Bronowski’s family were murdered… The play of tolerance opposes the principle of monstrous certainty that is endemic to fascism and, sadly, not just fascism but all the various faces of fundamentalism. When we think we have certainty, when we aspire to the knowledge of the gods, then Auschwitz can happen and can repeat itself. Arguably, it has repeated itself in the genocidal certainties of past decades.</em></p><p><em>The pursuit of scientific knowledge is as personal an act as lifting a paintbrush or writing a poem, and they are both profoundly human. If the human condition is defined by limitedness, then this is a glorious fact because it is a moral limitedness rooted in a faith in the power of the imagination, our sense of responsibility and our acceptance of our fallibility. We always have to acknowledge that we might be mistaken. When we forget that, then we forget ourselves and the worst can happen.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>To me, the central message from above is one of humility, and admitting the fallibility of our knowledge. The truth is, we live in an extraordinarily complicated world, and we ourselves are such humble, small and flawed creatures in comparison with the size, breadth and depth of our universe. Any certainty that we may ever hold, reflects more on our conceit, than on the world we live in. No human knowledge is ever certain, not even scientific knowledge. For centuries, Newtonian laws of physics were extremely well tested and formed the cornerstone of science… But they too were proven wrong by Einstein’s &nbsp;theory of relativity.</p>



<p>Of course we should still act and make the best decisions possible in the face of limited knowledge, but we should be aware of the lack of certainty. For a patient with heart disease, getting open-heart surgery is the right decision to take. Not because of absolute certainty in its effectiveness, but because it’s reasonably well proven and better than the alternative of doing nothing. Even with something as small as driving to work, we have to accept that there is no certainty of us reaching there safely. You could meet with an accident and die any day. This is very unlikely since we’ve made this same drive thousands of times safely, but we still have to acknowledge its possibility.</p>



<p>Living under the false delusion of absolute certainty will lead one to drive recklessly and not pay close attention to danger signs. The belief in absolute certainty closes off our minds, and stops us from learning anything new. Only by acknowledging the fallibility of our knowledge can we avoid making catastrophic mistakes, correct our mistaken prejudices, and continue bettering ourselves.</p>

        <h2>Searching the web</h2>
        <p>"Searching" is the most common action performed on the internet everyday. Google alone receives <a href="https://ardorseo.com/blog/how-many-google-searches-per-day-2019/#targetText=This%20translates%20to%20over%2040%2C000,listed%20by%20Internet%20Live%20Stats.">40,000 search queries every second (3.5 billion searches per day on average)</a>. That is a <i>lot</i> of queries. That also means there is a great deal of user interaction taking place between what is essentially a single text input and a list of outputted data. So, why has barely any UI/UX improvements been introduced over the years? I find it difficult to assume that the current "search engine design" has achieved <i>perfection</i> since there are so many obvious flaws.</p>
        <p>Let's take a stab at enhancing this extremely important user interface and see if we can evolve the search engine experience.</p>
        <h2>Default search engine results (DuckDuckGo)</h2>
        <p>For our baseline example we will use the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> search engine. If you aren't currently using DDG as your default search engine, I recommend that you make the switch. Google has continually proven that they shouldn't be trusted with user data, nor do they have their customers' well being and privacy at the forefront of their priorities. I've <a href="https://bradleytaunt.com/stop-crawling-google/">talked about ditching Google in the past</a> if you're interested. &lt;/End rant&gt;</p>
        <p>This is what a default search result for the term "canada" returns:</p>
        <p><img src="https://uglyduck.ca/better-search-results/default-search-results.png" alt="Default Search Results">
        </p>
        <p>Overall the design is clean and focuses on exactly what the user cares about: the content. A quick, detailed pane is presented to the right of the top list results, giving the user an easy overview of the searched query. I have no real complaints about the visuals. The overall UX is a different story.</p>

        <h2>Respecting user limitations</h2>
        <p>Not everyone has unlimited data usage or fast internet. In fact, reliable internet is more of a first-world luxury that is often taken for granted. Many people (specifically those on restricted mobile plans or low-end, under-powered devices) can't afford to eat through their data caps when performing something as simple as an internet search. For some, these under-powered devices may be their only way to connect to the web. By forcing items like tracking scripts or injected advertisement media onto the users' devices, you're stealing away what little available data they have. You're also doing this while providing zero positive gain for the users themselves.</p>

        <h2>Introducing page size results</h2>
        <p>Why not give the user the ability to instantly know how much data each listing will consume <i>before</i> they commit to actually visiting that website? By introducing a simple toggle filter at the top of the search results (I would advocate to have this <i>active</i> by default) you give the user a quick-and-easy way to see each listing's total page size. Take a look at the concept of this idea below:</p>
        <p><img src="https://uglyduck.ca/better-search-results/page-size-results.png" alt="Page Size Search Results">
        </p>
        <p>In the top right section of each listing the user can now see how "heavy" each webpage item is. By displaying the page weight, users have a better understanding of which sites will be faster and easier on their data caps - based on a very simple addition.</p>
        <p>An indirect consequence (but overall a great bonus) of this page weight element being standard, is companies would be forced to review their current websites/apps, as to avoid being flagged.</p>
        <p><img src="https://uglyduck.ca/better-search-results/search-item-details.png" alt="Search Item Details">
        </p>
        <h3>• Page Size Indicator</h3>
        <p>This element would show the final size of the entire webpage the listing is linked to. Default styling would display this as a minimal, grey text item. Webpages with a total webpage size of <a href="https://www.machmetrics.com/speed-blog/website-size-the-average-web-page-size-is-more-than-2mb-twice-the-size-of-the-average-page-just-3-years-ago/">1MB or greater</a> would be styled in a way to warn the user of a large download requirement. (Light red background to attract immediate attention)</p>

        <h2>Scanning results</h2>
        <p>Having the ability to know the weight of a given listing is great, but what about privacy? Including an option to tell the user which listings will track, send your data to 3rd-party services, or display obnoxious ads should be more important than your data consumption. This can also be implemented with a simple UI:</p>
        <p><img src="https://uglyduck.ca/better-search-results/scan-results.png" alt="Scan Search Results">
        </p>
        <p><img src="https://uglyduck.ca/better-search-results/search-item-scan.png" alt="Search Item Scanned">
        </p>
        <h3>• Ads Indicator</h3>
        <p>This tag element is added to listings that contain certain flagged advertisement scripts (Google adsense, carbon ads, buysellads, etc.). Advertisements don't necessarily mean a <i>bad</i> experience, so their styling is designed as more informational.</p>
        <h3>• 3rd-Party Scripts Indicator</h3>
        <p>The tracking tag element is designed in a way to indicate a warning to the user. These scripts tend to ignore user privacy, so they have more importance to the user's security. These would include (but not be limited to) Google Analytics, Kissmetrics, Mixpanel, Chartbeat, etc. This element might also be a good way to "upsell" the user on using script blocking extensions like Ghostery or uBlock.</p>

        <h2>Companies reliant on advertisements</h2>
        <p>Won't companies dependent on embedded advertisements and tracking scripts push-back against this design concept? Probably.</p>
        <p>But too bad. My message to companies who rely on beefy ads and follower their users wherever they go, as a means to make a profit: <strong>Adapt or die.</strong></p>
        <p>Ruining your users' experience for the sake of monetizing your business is bad for said business in the long run. Personally, I believe it's border-line unethical. Your users never consent to these 3rd-party tracking scripts or give permission for you to force-download megabytes of data.</p> 
        <p>Stop feeding your customers garbage and you won't have to worry about more detailed search results. You'll be one of the <strong>good guys</strong> 👍. Figure out a way to make money without screwing over your users. It's just lazy to say "there is no other way" before even trying something else.</p>
