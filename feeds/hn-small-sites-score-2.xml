Distributing computational expensive simulations among the available resources, avoiding duplication and keeping the data safe are challenges that scientists face every day.</p><p id="8d66">In this post we present our web service <a href="https://insilico-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" rel="noopener">Insilico</a> and its command line interface <a href="https://moka-command-line-interface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" rel="noopener">Moka</a>. Insilico solves the problem of <em>computing</em>, <em>storing</em> and <em>securely sharing</em> computationally <em>expensive</em> simulation results. Researchers can save significant time and resources by easily computing new data and reusing existing simulation data to answer their questions.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/9856/0*bI9DbwobcmYvOYyk" width="4928" height="3280" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*bI9DbwobcmYvOYyk 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*bI9DbwobcmYvOYyk 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*bI9DbwobcmYvOYyk 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*bI9DbwobcmYvOYyk 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*bI9DbwobcmYvOYyk?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@publicpowerorg?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">American Public Power Association</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><blockquote><p id="71c5">At the <a href="https://www.esciencecenter.nl/" rel="noopener">Netherlands eScience Center</a> we empower academic researchers by building together simulation tools, data pipelines, etc. A common goal among several tools that we develop for projects in different scientific fields, is to reduce the calculation time of computationally expensive physical simulations (e.g. molecular processes) by applying statistical methods to previously simulated data.</p></blockquote><p id="204c">The aforementioned methodology can potentially save us significant human and computational resources by easily generating high value data using previous computations. But before we are ready to apply any statistical method we of course need the data and for doing so, we need to ask ourselves questions like:</p><blockquote><p id="7c69">What input is required?</p><p id="75eb">Who is going to perform the simulation?</p><p id="a35c">What facilities are going to be used?</p><p id="93ec">Where is the resulting data going to be stored?</p><p id="6091">How to access the available data?</p></blockquote><p id="6fb9">Physical simulations usually require intricate input that takes into consideration several aspects and parameters used by different models to approximate the phenomena under consideration. Also, scientific simulations are computationally demanding tasks, so they are usually run in (inter)national supercomputers or very specialized facilities. We also want to maximize the impact of the data in the scientific community, therefore we want other scientists to be able to access the data and even add their own, but we need some security layers to protect such valuable data.</p><p id="bcb8">There is no silver bullet to address all the previous questions, but there are amazing initiatives like the <a href="https://foldingathome.org/" rel="noopener">folding at home project</a> that distributes some computational tasks among volunteers around the world who give away some time in their computers to simulate protein dynamics.</p><p id="6858">It seems that if we want to collaborate on the distribution of computational tasks and the assemblage of the resulting data, we need a central “entity” that (1) allows users to request new tasks, (2) receives the task’s results to be stored and (3) returns some available data when requested. It sounds like we need a web service!</p><blockquote><p id="6a2b">Writing a web service is a nontrivial task, you need to be aware of different technologies, libraries, etc. while making sure that your data is going to be safe and of course you need some infrastructure to host your service. This post goal is to give you some hints about building a web service for scientific applications and it is by no means a complete guide to writing web applications.</p></blockquote><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/9662/0*HnAn4y-BQGmvGjGZ" width="4831" height="3221" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*HnAn4y-BQGmvGjGZ 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*HnAn4y-BQGmvGjGZ 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*HnAn4y-BQGmvGjGZ 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*HnAn4y-BQGmvGjGZ 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*HnAn4y-BQGmvGjGZ?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@johnschno?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">John Schnobrich</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p id="a44e">Before entering into the web service technical details, let’s explore what its behavior should be.</p><p id="74cc">So, once it has been decided what are the best approximations and models to perform the simulations, we can compile all the simulation metadata into different jobs. For instance, a job can be a single molecular simulation under some specific conditions. We would like to make all these jobs available to the users, in such a way that they can run one or more jobs at a time but avoiding that the same job is run by more than one user.</p><p id="2b33">It would be great that when the simulation is done a user can send the results to the web service or ask for already available results. We also want to be able to call the web service from our local computer, specialized infrastructure or wherever we want to perform the computation, without worrying about where the service is running.</p><p id="be30">It seems, that we want a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git" rel="noopener">Git</a>-like behavior where we can pull jobs (or available data) and push results.</p><p id="ba78">With these requirements in mind, I have developed an open source web service called <a href="https://github.com/nlesc-nano/insilico-server" rel="noopener">Insilico-server</a>. Let’s see how it works!</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/7296/0*P4hHvh84YZQLPGgi" width="3648" height="2432" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*P4hHvh84YZQLPGgi 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*P4hHvh84YZQLPGgi 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*P4hHvh84YZQLPGgi 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*P4hHvh84YZQLPGgi 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*P4hHvh84YZQLPGgi?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@andrew_gook?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Andrew Gook</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p id="773a">The web service consists of two parts: a small command line interface (CLI) that communicates with the service and the <a href="https://insilico-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" rel="noopener">Insilico web service</a> that handles all the data.</p><p id="0fa0">Our CLI is called <a href="https://moka-command-line-interface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" rel="noopener">Moka</a> and it offers several actions to interact with the service, like logging in, computing, querying, etc. as shown in the following snippet:</p><pre><span id="4e44">&gt;&gt;&gt; moka --help<br>usage: moka [-h] [--version] {login,compute,report,query,add,manage} ...</span><span id="84c2">positional arguments:<br>  {login,compute,report,query,add,manage}<br>                        Interact with the properties web service<br>    login               Log in to the Insilico web service<br>    compute             Compute available jobs<br>    report              Report the results back to the server<br>    query               Query some properties from the database<br>    add                 Add new jobs to the database<br>    manage              Change jobs status</span><span id="6b00">optional arguments:<br>  -h, --help            show this help message and exit<br>  --version             show program's version number and exit</span></pre><p id="b5c4">Using <a href="https://moka-command-line-interface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" rel="noopener">Moka</a> we can compute some jobs using a command like:</p><pre><span id="f521">moka compute -c collection_name -j number_of_jobs_to_compute</span></pre><p id="8e50">The previous command handles the communication with the web service, fetches the requested jobs from a given collection (or dataset) and runs them directly or invokes a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_scheduler" rel="noopener">job scheduler</a> like <a href="https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html" rel="noopener">Slurm</a>. To communicate with the service, <a href="https://moka-command-line-interface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" rel="noopener">Moka</a> invokes the <a href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/" rel="noopener">Python Requests library</a> that handles the communication.</p><p id="54f9">Once the jobs are done we can report the computed data like:</p><pre><span id="2183">moka report</span></pre><p id="eafc">You may be wondering how does the client know what data it needs to send/receive. Well, that is the subject of the next section!</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/8064/0*o_Zzwgbaexr6Fz8y" width="4032" height="3024" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*o_Zzwgbaexr6Fz8y 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*o_Zzwgbaexr6Fz8y 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*o_Zzwgbaexr6Fz8y 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*o_Zzwgbaexr6Fz8y 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*o_Zzwgbaexr6Fz8y?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@tofi?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Tobias Fischer</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p id="e270">The main goal of the web service is to minimize the interaction between the users and the data. If the client requests some read-only action you just return the data (if available) and if the client wants to change something, you need to ensure that (1) the client has permissions to mutate the data (2) only the mutations specified by the client are carried out but nothing more. I will skip authentication in this post.</p><p id="2b72">Therefore, the <a href="https://insilico-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" rel="noopener">Insilico</a> web service needs to handle two kinds of requests by the client: read-only queries and mutations on the datasets. These “queries” and “mutations” can be easily describe with <a href="https://graphql.org/" rel="noopener">GraphQL</a>.</p><p id="0dbe">In a nutshell, <a href="https://graphql.org/" rel="noopener">GraphQL</a> defines a contract (known as a schema) between the actions that a client can perform with the web service and the possible outcomes of those actions. More formally, <a href="https://graphql.org/" rel="noopener">GraphQL</a> is a query language that allows you to specify an application Programming interface (API) using different programming languages. If you have previous experience with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" rel="noopener">RESTful API</a> have a look at a comparison between <a href="https://www.howtographql.com/basics/1-graphql-is-the-better-rest/" rel="noopener">GraphQL and REST</a>.</p><p id="ecf0">But how does GraphQL work? First, you need to define a schema using the <a href="https://graphql.org/" rel="noopener">GraphQL</a> schema language. The following code snippet defines a schema to query a job using its status,</p><figure><div></div><figcaption>Schema definition for job query</figcaption></figure><p id="2045">The <strong>Query</strong> schema specifies that in order to request some <strong><em>jobs</em></strong> you need to provide a <em>Status</em> argument, where <em>Status</em> can be one of four possibilities: <em>AVAILABLE, DONE, FAILED</em> and <em>RUNNING. </em>The exclamation mark (!) indicates that the argument cannot be <em>Null</em> (a.k.a <em>None</em> in Python).</p><p id="5870">The following <strong>Mutation</strong> schema defines the required arguments to update a given job status.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption>Schema definitation for Job status mutation</figcaption></figure><p id="9dd2">The <strong><em>updateJob</em></strong> action specifies that you must provide an <em>id</em> and a <em>new_status</em> in order to be able to update a job. You will receive a <em>Reply</em> specifying whether the update action has succeeded.</p><p id="54d3">Have a look at the Insilico <a href="https://github.com/nlesc-nano/insilico-server/blob/master/insilicoserver/sdl/Query.graphql" rel="noopener">queries</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nlesc-nano/insilico-server/blob/master/insilicoserver/sdl/Mutation.graphql" rel="noopener">mutations</a> schemas. They are slightly more complex than the aforementioned schemas but follow the same rationale as the previous examples. You can also have a look at the official <a href="https://graphql.org/learn/" rel="noopener">introduction to GraphQL</a>.</p><p id="33f0">We have just defined the schemas that specify the actions that we want to perform. We still need to implement the actions and for doing so, we need a GraphQL engine: a library that takes the schemas together with the code that implements the actions and generates an API.</p><p id="39ea">We have chosen the <a href="https://tartiflette.io/" rel="noopener">Tartiflette GraphQL engine</a> to implement our web service mostly because it is easy to use and open source. The following snippet shows a possible implementation for querying jobs based on their status using <a href="https://tartiflette.io/" rel="noopener">Tartiflette</a>.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="affa">the <strong><em>Resolver</em></strong> decorator indicates that the <strong><em>resolver_query_jobs</em></strong> function corresponds to the implementation of the <strong><em>query jobs</em></strong> schema. The function takes 4 arguments of which I only use <strong><em>args</em></strong> and <strong><em>ctx</em></strong><em> </em>(You can refer to <a href="https://tartiflette.io/" rel="noopener">Tartiflette</a> for further details). <strong><em>args </em></strong>contains the arguments given by the client code, while <strong><em>ctx </em></strong>contains the context for running the current function, for example the handler to access the database that is called <strong><em>mongodb</em></strong> in this code snippet.</p><p id="9242">Notice that the definition of the aforementioned function starts with the <em>async</em> keyword. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html" rel="noopener">Asyncio</a> is a popular built-in Python library to write concurrent code. It is extensively used to write high performance web services.</p><p id="fb0a">In the Insilico web service implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/nlesc-nano/insilico-server/tree/master/provisioning" rel="noopener"><strong>queries</strong></a> and <a href="https://github.com/nlesc-nano/insilico-server/blob/master/insilicoserver/mutation_resolvers.py" rel="noopener"><strong>mutations</strong></a>, there are definitions for all the Python functions that perform the actions specified in the GraphQL schemas. For each query and mutation, there is a corresponding function.</p><p id="632b">We need a database not only for storing the interesting data but also to store the jobs metadata, like what jobs are available. For the Insilico web service we use <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" rel="noopener">MongoDB</a>.</p><p id="1b90">My personal opinion is that a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL" rel="noopener">NoSQL database</a> like <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" rel="noopener">MongoDB</a> gives a significant advantage over traditional SQL databases on research projects where up-front design of the schemas to store data is unfeasible. The research priorities can change as the project evolves and having dynamic …</p></div></div></section></div>

December 10, 2020 | https://blog.senx.io/digital-twins-requirement-for-industrial-ai/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.senx.io/digital-twins-requirement-for-industrial-ai/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Using AI to make industrial assets more efficient and reduce their downtime is on many agendas. Learn how digital twins and time series data play a major role in this plan.</p><article>
      
<p><strong>When interviewed, CEOs across industries all state that AI is part of their top priorities.</strong> But when it comes to actual implementation AI projects are not very glamorous. Past simple proofs of concept and the hiring of a team of data scientists, there is usually no sign of the highly anticipated digital transformation wished by the CEOs.</p>



<p>There are multiple reasons for this disenchantment, far too many to list here. But among those, some are directly related to what we focus on at <a href="https://senx.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SenX</a>, data, and the way industries introduce them in their environment.</p>



<h2>No digital transformation without data</h2>



<p>The willingness to transform is genuine in many organizations, driven by ambitious visions or just the consciousness that the competitive landscape is evolving.</p>



<p>The next step is usually for those businesses to pick some quick wins to prove that the transformation can be initiated and comfort everyone that it does not mean changing teams or radically modifying their way of working.</p>



<p>Those short projects aim at demonstrating the methodology for transforming limited operational perimeters. They often involve solving a problem with approaches to leveraging new technologies. Those technologies, 100% digital, need fuel to work, and that fuel is data. <strong>So the first step is to ensure data are available</strong>.</p>



<p>The firms hired to help in building those quick wins will then wander among departments. They will harvest datasets here and there until they have sufficient matter for implementing their solutions.</p>



<p>This step can sometimes take time if the data is not well identified and distributed across the organization. But it is a mandatory path to follow as without data no digital transformation will happen.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2>No AI without big data</h2>



<p>Past the simple quick wins done to bootstrap the transformation comes a time when more ambitious projects are brought on the table, and that is when AI (Artificial Intelligence) comes into the conversation. The hype around AI is so strong that projects around AI and ML (Machine Learning) cannot be neglected.</p>



<p>The problem with the current hype is that very few people really understand what AI actually implies. <strong>For many</strong>,<strong> you buy an AI like you buy a Microsoft Office 365 subscription</strong>, this is just not true. The promise of AI is to bring new, automatic, ways to use data to help in or even completely assume the decision process. This promise can only be fulfilled if the actual AI put to work, otherwise called the model, is actually trained on the data in your very own organization, and this requires once again the same digital transformation fuel, data. The difference is that this time you need more of it. You are no longer trying to light a fondue burner but a rocket engine!</p>



<p>Training a model does indeed require a lot of data covering the various aspects of your business operations you want the model to focus on, also covering a long period of time so trend and seasonality can be modeled. </p>



<h4>This has several impacts</h4>



<ul><li>The first is that you cannot expect to train a model and efficiently introduce AI in your operations until you actually have collected enough meaningful data. And if your organization has not done so so far you need to start as soon as possible. </li><li>The second impact is that this data collection process is not a one time job. It does not stop once you have enough data for training a model. It needs to go on and on so you keep on accumulating signals on how your business operates to retrain your models in the future if their performance starts to degrade. This means that prior to your journey into the core of AI you need to plan for big data to be collected, stored and made available to teams across your organization so they can start looking at the data and imagine possible uses and models.</li></ul>



<h2>No industrial AI without Digital Twins</h2>



<p>Among verticals, industrial organizations face the hardest problems of data collection. Industries whose data mainly relates to users using their services are lucky. In the end, their data are not that massive. Sure we have all heard stories of banks or retailers hoarding piles of data. But we are talking about a few thousand interactions per year per user. So even with a billion users, which not that many banks or retailers have, we are talking a few trillion events per year.</p>



<p>In the industrial world, things are different, the assets producing data do not eat or sleep. They work day and night and sometimes produce thousands of measurements per second.</p>



<h3>For example...</h3>



<p>Take for example the CERN experiments at the LHC. They produced 600 million events per second during the campaigns for the quest of the Higgs boson. That is 51 trillion events per day. Luckily for the CERN, not all events needed to be retained. With highly efficient AI-based detectors, which needed to be trained with massive data themselves, they were able to limit the production to 100 000 events per second sent for digital reconstruction and ultimately 200 events persisted per second. </p>



<p>But other sectors need to retain more data. Synchro phasors (or PMUs, phase monitoring units) monitoring electrical grids, for example. They each produce several 1000s measures per second, and there are thousands of those at the scale of a country like France. This means millions of C37.118.2 messages sent every second, not to mention the IEC61850 messages sent to supervise the substations. </p>



<p>Same thing in aeronautics where aircraft typically produce 5 000 to 15 000 data points per second they are operating, or industrial assets whose PLC (Programmable Logic Controllers) track the state of many sensors and actuators.</p>



<p>The use of AI in those verticals requires that those truly massive data be collected and organized. Since they are data related to physical assets, it is wise to use an approach which mimics these assets in a digital form, this approach is called Digital Twins. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h3>What are Digital Twins?</h3>



<p>The Digital Twin of an asset is the set of measures coming from its sensors and actuators. Those measures need to be tracked in time to catch the dynamics of the assets' operations. And the technology of choice to do so is a <a href="https://blog.senx.io/which-time-series-database-suited-to-your-needs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Time Series Database</a>. Indeed Digital Twins are nothing else than time series, some for the sensors, some for the actuators with their states. And if you want more advanced digital twins, some with the control commands sent to the assets to modify how it behaves.</p>



<p>Once you start collecting the data from your assets in a Time Series Database, you can easily access the state of those assets at any point in time. More importantly, you can start extracting features to train models to detect anomalies and perform predictive maintenance.</p>



<h2>Takeaways</h2>



<p>AI is on every business' agenda, but the importance of data is too often overlooked. <strong>When it comes to industrial AI, the first step towards a successful implementation is the collection of all sensor data to build Digital Twins of the physical assets involved.</strong> This approach needs to leverage a Time Series Database, the kind of database SenX offers with the <a href="https://warp10.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warp 10 Time Series Platform</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
  <p><span>09 Dec 2020</span></p><p>Yesterday, Mapbox announced that they were moving their <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js">Mapbox GL JS</a> library from a standard BSD license to a new very much <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/blob/main/LICENSE.txt">non-open source license</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://joemorrison.medium.com/death-of-an-open-source-business-model-62bc227a7e9b">Joe Morrison said</a> the news “shook” him (and also the readers of the Hacker News front page, well done Joe). It did me as well. Although apparently for completely different reasons.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mapbox is the protagonist of a story I’ve told myself and others countless times. It’s a seductive tale about the incredible, counterintuitive concept of the “open core” business model for software companies.
<br>– Joe Morrison</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s a couple things wrong with Joe’s encomium to Mapbox and “open core”:</p>

<ul>
  <li>first, Mapbox was <strong>never</strong> an open core business;</li>
  <li>second, open core is a <strong>pretty ugly model</strong> that has very little to do with the open source ethos of shared intellectual pursuit.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/images//2020/core.jpg" alt="Open Core"></p>

<h2 id="mapbox-was-never-open-core">Mapbox was never Open Core</h2>

<p>From the very start (well, at least from the early middle), Mapbox was built to be a location-based services business. It was to be the Google Maps for people who were unwilling to accept the downsides of Google Maps.</p>

<p>Google Maps will track you. They will take your data exhaust and ruthlessly monetize it. They will take your data and use it to build a better Google Maps that they will then re-sell to others.</p>

<p>If you value your data at all (if you are, say, a major auto maker), you probably don’t want to use Google Maps, because they are going to steal your data while providing you services. Also, Google Maps is increasingly the “only game in town” for location based services, and it seems reasonable to expect price increases (<a href="https://housesigma.com/blog-en/2018/06/07/google-map-price-hike/">it has already happened once</a>).</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/images//2020/google-location-history.png" alt="Google is Tracking You"></p>

<p>Nobody can compete with Google Maps, can they? Why yes, they can! Mapbox fuses the collaborative goodness of the <a href="https://openstreemap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> community with clever software that enables the kinds of services that Google sells 
(<a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/#raster-tiles">map tiles</a>, 
<a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/#search">geocoding</a>, 
<a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/#navigation">routing</a>, 
<a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/help/troubleshooting/access-elevation-data/">elevation services</a>), and a bunch of services Google doesn’t sell (like <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/">custom map authoring</a>) or won’t sell (like <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/vision/">automotive vision</a>).</p>

<p>But like Google, the value proposition Mapbox sells isn’t in the software, so much as the data and the platform underneath. Mapbox has built a unique, scalable platform for handling the huge problem of turning raw OSM data into usable services, and raw location streams into usable services. They sell access to that platform.</p>

<p>Mapbox has never been a software company, they’ve always been a data and services company.</p>

<p>The last company I worked for, <a href="https://carto.com/">CARTO</a>, had a similar model, only moreso. All the parts of their value proposition (PostgreSQL, PostGIS, the CARTO UI, the tile server, the upload, everything) are <a href="https://github.com/cartodb">open source</a>. But they want you to pay them when you load your data into their service and use their software there. How can that be? Well, do you want to assemble all those open source parts into a working system and keep it running? Of course not. You just want to publish a map, or run an analysis, or add a spatial analysis to an existing system. So you pay them money.</p>

<p>Is Mapbox an “open core” company? No, is there a “Mapbox Community Edition” everyone can have, but an “Enterprise Edition” that is only available under a proprietary license? No. Does Mapbox even sell <strong>any software at all</strong>? No. (Yes, some.) They (mostly) sell services.</p>

<p>So what’s with the re-licensing? I’ll come back to that, but first…</p>

<h2 id="open-core-is-a-shitty-model">Open Core is a Shitty Model</h2>

<p>Actually, no, it seems to be a passable <strong>monetization</strong> model, for some businesses. It’s a shitty open source model though.</p>

<ul>
  <li>MongoDB has an open source core, and sells a bunch of proprietary enterprise add-ons. They’ve grown very fast and might even reach sufficient velocity to escape their huge VC valuation (or they may yet be sucked into the singularity).</li>
  <li>Cloudera before them reached huge valuations selling proprietary add-ons around the open Hadoop ecosystem.</li>
  <li>MySQL flirted with an open core model for many years, but mostly stuck to spreading FUD about the GPL in order to get customers to pay them for proprietary licenses.</li>
</ul>

<p>Easily the strangest part of the MySQL model was trash-talking the very open source license <strong>they chose</strong> to place their open source software under.</p>

<p>All those companies have been quite succesful along the axes of “getting users” and “making money”. Let me tell you why open core is nonetheless a shitty model:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tell me about the MongoDB developer community. Where do they work? Oh right, Mongo.</li>
  <li>Tell me about the Cloudary developer community? Where do they work?</li>
  <li>Tell me about the MySQL developer community? Where to they work? Oh right, <strong>Oracle</strong>. (There’s a whole other blog post to be written about why sole corporate control of open source projects is a <strong>bad idea</strong>.)</li>
</ul>

<p>A good open source model is one that promotes heterogeneity of contributors, a sharing of control, and a rising of all boats when the software succeeds. Open core is all about centralizing gain and control to the sponsoring organization.</p>

<p>This is going to sound precious, but the leaders of open core companies don’t “care” about the ethos of open source. The CEOs of open core companies view open source (correctly, from their point of view) as a “sales channel”. It’s a way for customers to discover their paid offerings, it’s not an end in itself.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/images//2020/funnel.png" width="75%" alt="Sales Funnel"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We didn’t open source it to get help from the community, to make the product better. We open sourced as a freemium strategy; to drive adoption. 
<br>– Dev Ittycheria, CEO, MongoDB</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, yeah, open core is a way to make money but it doesn’t “do” anything for open source as a shared proposition for building useful tools anyone can use, for anything they find useful, anytime and anywhere they like.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q5o-4pnxDQ">Adam Jacob’s take</a> on the current contradictions in the world of open source ethics; there are no hard and fast answers.</p>

<h2 id="mapbox-shook-me-too">Mapbox Shook Me Too</h2>

<p>I too was a little shook to learn of the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25347310">Mapbox GL JS relicensing</a>, but perhaps not “surprised”. This had happened before, with <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14734589">Tilemill</a> (open) morphing into <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/">Mapbox Studio</a> (closed).</p>

<p>The change says nothing about “open source” in the large as a model, and everything about “single vendor projects” and whether you should, strategically, believe their licensing.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/images//2020/empty-promise.jpg" alt="Empty Promises"></p>

<p>I (and others) took the licensing (incorrectly) of Mapbox GL JS to be a promise, not only for now but the future, and made decisions based on that (incorrect) interpretation. I integrated GL JS into <a href="https://github.com/CrunchyData/pg_tileserv/blob/master/assets/preview-table.html">an open source project</a> and now I have to revisit that decision.</p>

<p>The license change also says something about the business realities Mapbox is facing going forward. The business of selling location based services is a competitive one, and one that is perhaps not panning out as well as their venture capital valuation (<a href="https://blog.mapbox.com/softbank-mapbox-series-c-be207b866b27">billions?</a>) would promise.</p>

<p>No doubt the board meetings are fraught. Managers are casting about for future sources of revenue, for places where more potential customers can be <strong>squeeeeezed</strong> into the sales funnel.</p>

<p>I had high hopes for Mapbox as a counterweight to Google Maps, a behemoth that seems <a href="https://www.justinobeirne.com/google-maps-moat">likely to consume us all</a>. The signs that the financial vice is beginning to close on it, that the promise might not be fulfilled, they shake me.</p>

<p>So, yeah, Joe, this is big news. Shaking news. But it has nothing to do with “open source as a business model”.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>The need for fast and responsive applications has never been greater because of the move from <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/desktop-mobile-tablet/worldwide/2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">desktop to mobile</a>. Still, web applications have been increasing in <a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">complexity and size</a>, with rising load times. It is therefore clear why the topic of webpage performance is more popular today than it likely ever was.</p> <p>This article aims at giving a practical introduction to the whys and hows of web performance, without getting lost in the depth or breadth of this massive topic.</p> <h2 id="why-performance-matters"><a href="#why-performance-matters">#</a> Why performance matters</h2> <p>The time it takes for a service to become usable, as well as its general responsiveness, bear a lot of weight on the user's perception of that service. Helpful features, great design and other prominent characteristics all become irrelevant when an online service is so slow that users navigate away.</p> <p>You can build the best web application in the world, but be mindful that each user will have a specific amount of time they are willing to invest in your service to solve their problems. Exceed that amount, and you risk losing them to a different, more performant solution. This is even truer for new users, who haven't yet been given proof of the quality of your service, and are essentially investing their time up-front, hoping for a return.</p> <h3 id="a-competitive-differentiator"><a href="#a-competitive-differentiator">#</a> A competitive differentiator</h3> <p>There is a brighter side to the topic: if low performance can sink an online platform, high performance can very well help it rise to the top. Speed and responsiveness can be a differentiating characteristic for a service, prompting users to choose it over the competition. Therefore an investment in this area will almost always pay off. Some notorious real-world examples from known businesses include:</p> <ol><li>Pinterest decreasing wait time for their users, <a href="https://medium.com/@Pinterest_Engineering/driving-user-growth-with-performance-improvements-cfc50dafadd7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increasing both traffic and conversions</a>.</li> <li>Zalando applying small improvements in load time and finding a direct correlation with <a href="https://engineering.zalando.com/posts/2018/06/loading-time-matters.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increased revenue per session</a>.</li> <li>The BBC discovering that every extra second that a page took to load led to 10% of <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/features/how-the-bbc-builds-websites-that-scale" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">users leaving the page</a>.</li></ol> <h2 id="measuring-performance"><a href="#measuring-performance">#</a> Measuring performance</h2> <p>Given the importance of page performance, it is no coincidence that browsers expose a ton of insights into <a href="https://web.dev/metrics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">performance metrics</a>. Being aware of how your application scores against these <em>across time</em> will provide you the feedback you need to keep it performant for your users. There are several approaches that can be combined to achieve the best results:</p> <ol><li><em>Real user monitoring</em> to understand what performance actual end-users of your service are experiencing.</li> <li><em>Synthetic monitoring</em> to proactively gather intel on service performance, as well as to find issues before users stumble into them.</li> <li><em>Performance testing</em> to avoid releasing performance regression to production in the first place.</li> <li><em>Regular audits</em> to get an overview of your page's performance and suggestions on how to improve it, e.g. with tools such as <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Lighthouse</a>.</li></ol>  <p>As much as we should be striving to build performant applications, we should commit to monitoring and testing performance to enable continuous feedback and rapid intervention in case of degradation. Puppeteer and Playwright give us a great toolkit to power both synthetic monitoring and performance testing.</p> <ol><li>Access to the Web Performance APIs, especially <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceNavigationTiming" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PerformanceNavigationTiming</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceResourceTiming" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PerformanceResourceTiming</a>.</li> <li>Whenever testing against Chromium, access to the Chrome DevTools Protocol for traffic inspection, network emulation and more.</li> <li>Easy interoperability with performance libraries from the Node.js ecosystem.</li></ol> <h3 id="web-performance-apis"><a href="#web-performance-apis">#</a> Web Performance APIs</h3> <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/navigation-timing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Navigation Timing</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/resource-timing-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resource Timing</a> performance APIs are <a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C</a> specifications. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Navigation_and_resource_timings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MDN docs</a> very clearly define the scope of both:</p> <blockquote><p>Navigation timings are metrics measuring a browser's document navigation events. Resource timings are detailed network timing measurements regarding the loading of an application's resources. Both provide the same read-only properties, but navigation timing measures the main document's timings whereas the resource timing provides the times for all the assets or resources called in by that main document and the resources' requested resources.</p></blockquote> <p>We can use the Navigation Timing API to retrieve timestamps of key events in the page load timeline.</p>  <p>The Resource Timing API allows us to zoom in to single resources and get accurate information about how quickly they are being loaded. For example, we could specifically look at our website's logo:</p>  <h3 id="chrome-devtools-for-performance"><a href="#chrome-devtools-for-performance">#</a> Chrome DevTools for performance</h3> <p>The Chrome DevTools Protocol offers many great performance tools for us to leverage together with Puppeteer and Playwright.</p> <p>One important example is network throttling, through which we can simulate the experience of users accessing our page with different network conditions.</p>  <p>The DevTools Protocol is quite extensive. We recommend exploring the <a href="https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a> and getting a comprehensive overview of its capabilities.</p> <h3 id="additional-performance-libraries"><a href="#additional-performance-libraries">#</a> Additional performance libraries</h3> <p>Lighthouse can easily be used programmatically with Playwright and Puppeteer to gather values and scores for different metrics, like <a href="https://web.dev/interactive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Time To Interactive (TTI)</a>:</p>  <h2 id="further-reading"><a href="#further-reading">#</a> Further reading</h2> <ol><li>The comprehensive <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MDN Web Performance documentation</a></li> <li><a href="https://web.dev/learn/#performance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web.dev's performance section</a></li> <li><a href="https://addyosmani.com/blog/puppeteer-recipes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Web Performance Recipes With Puppeteer</a> by Addy Osmani</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/aslushnikov/getting-started-with-cdp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Getting started with Chrome DevTools Protocol</a> by Andrey Lushnikov</li> <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse#get-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get Started with Google Lighthouse</a></li></ol></div></div>]]>

<p>So, you’ve downloaded and installed <a href="https://obsproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OBS Studio</a> on your computer and you want to start recording your screen, but you’re lost?</p>



<p>Well, simply <strong>follow this step-by-step tutorial and you will be ready to start recording high-quality videos of your screen in no time with OBS Studio</strong>. </p>



<p>Let’s get started.</p>



<hr>



<h2>A Brief Overview of OBS Studio</h2>



<p>Before we go further, let’s get an idea of the GUI layout of OBS Studio. To keep things simple, we will divide OBS Studio into 6 sections.</p>



<div><figure><img width="1024" height="550" src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/obs-screen.png?resize=1024%2C550&amp;ssl=1" alt="Set up OBS Studio for Recording" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/obs-screen.png?resize=1024%2C550&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/obs-screen.png?resize=300%2C161&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/obs-screen.png?resize=768%2C412&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/obs-screen.png?resize=1536%2C825&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/obs-screen.png?resize=1200%2C644&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/obs-screen.png?w=1598&amp;ssl=1 1598w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20550'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/obs-screen.png?resize=1024%2C550&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/obs-screen.png?resize=300%2C161&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/obs-screen.png?resize=768%2C412&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/obs-screen.png?resize=1536%2C825&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/obs-screen.png?resize=1200%2C644&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/obs-screen.png?w=1598&amp;ssl=1 1598w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/obs-screen.png?resize=1024%2C550&amp;ssl=1"></figure></div>



<h3>1. Scenes</h3>



<p>If OBS is a canvas, <code>Scenes</code> would be a place that stores various pictures you can switch at any time. Each scene is used for different purposes. For example, a streamer would use different ones to signify when he is playing, waiting in a lobby, or taking a break.</p>



<h3>2. Sources</h3>



<p>You can think of <code>Sources</code> like a set of colors, you use to paint a scene. These are all of the elements shown on your screen during a recording. A good example of Sources are your logo, webcam, and chat window.</p>



<h3>3. Audio Mixer</h3>



<p>The mixer is where you will set up everything audio-related. More on that later.</p>



<h3>4. Scene Transitions</h3>



<p>Transitions provide you with animations you can play while switching up the scenes.</p>



<h3>5. Controls</h3>



<p>This houses the most important controls you will use to manipulate your recording.</p>



<h3>6. Preview Window</h3>



<p>Finally, there is a Preview Window. This shows exactly what you will see after you’ve recorded your video.</p>



<p>And don’t forget that OBS Studio is really customizable. You can drag and drop all of these windows and re-organize them to create a unique layout that suits your workflow.</p>



<p>Great, now that you have an idea of what hte OBS Studio layout looks like, let’s get started with setting up OBS Studio for recording.</p>



<hr>



<h2>Setup OBS Studio for Recording Your Screen</h2>



<p>Now let’s follow this step-by-step procedure to setup OBS Studio and start recording! </p>



<h3>1. Add Audio Sources</h3>



<p>Let’s start by setting up the audio. First, go to the <code>Controls &gt; Settings &gt; Audio</code>. Set both <code>Desktop Audio</code> and <code>Mic Audio</code> to <code>default</code>. Everything else should be disabled.</p>



<div><figure><img width="1024" height="576" src="https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Audio-Settings.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1" alt="Set up OBS Studio for Recording" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Audio-Settings.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Audio-Settings.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Audio-Settings.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Audio-Settings.png?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Audio-Settings.png?resize=1200%2C675&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Audio-Settings.png?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20576'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Audio-Settings.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Audio-Settings.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Audio-Settings.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Audio-Settings.png?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Audio-Settings.png?resize=1200%2C675&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Audio-Settings.png?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Audio-Settings.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1"></figure></div>



<p>Let’s quickly add some filters to make your voice sound more professional. Click on the gear icon next to <code>Mic/Aux</code> in <code>Audio Mixer</code>.</p>



<div><figure><img width="742" height="431" src="https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Filter.png?resize=742%2C431&amp;ssl=1" alt="Set up OBS Studio for Recording" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Filter.png?w=742&amp;ssl=1 742w, https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Filter.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 742px) 100vw, 742px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20742%20431'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Filter.png?w=742&amp;ssl=1 742w, https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Filter.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Filter.png?resize=742%2C431&amp;ssl=1"></figure></div>



<p>Here we have 3 options: <code>Noise Suppression</code>, <code>Noise Gate</code>, and <code>Gain</code>.</p>



<div><figure><img width="598" height="257" src="https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/0_4ByvJMTJqxt68LJG_.png?resize=598%2C257&amp;ssl=1" alt="Set up OBS Studio for Recording" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/0_4ByvJMTJqxt68LJG_.png?w=598&amp;ssl=1 598w, https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/0_4ByvJMTJqxt68LJG_.png?resize=300%2C129&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20598%20257'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/0_4ByvJMTJqxt68LJG_.png?w=598&amp;ssl=1 598w, https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/0_4ByvJMTJqxt68LJG_.png?resize=300%2C129&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/0_4ByvJMTJqxt68LJG_.png?resize=598%2C257&amp;ssl=1"></figure></div>



<ul><li><strong>Noise Suppression</strong> will remove most of your background noise. Start from -10 dB and drop lower until you can’t hear the noise.</li><li><strong>Noise Gate</strong> will turn off your microphone when the volume drops below the Close Threshold. This way you won’t record your breathing. Settings will vary depending on your type of mic, so play with it until it feels natural.</li><li><strong>Gain</strong> is used for changing the volume of your mic.</li></ul>



<h3>2. Choose Recording Quality</h3>



<p>Go to the <code>Output</code> tab on the left and under <code>Recording</code> choose the path where OBS will save all your videos. By default, it’s set to <code>\Users\OBS\Videos</code>.</p>

<p>If you are just beginning to record your videos, we recommend that you choose <code>High Quality</code>. This will provide you with pretty good quality and reasonable file size.</p>



<p>Others should pick <code>Indistinguishable Quality</code>. This will give you a fully professional video that you can later edit in post-processing.</p>



<p>We can’t really recommend <code>Lossless</code> as it will eat up your storage without providing a perceptible difference.</p>



<p>Under <code>Recording Format</code> choose either <code>MKV</code> or <code>FLV</code> as they are very stable container formats. In case your PC or PBS crashes, you will likely be able to save your recording. </p>

<p>You can easily convert your files later, by going to <code>File &gt; Remux Recording</code>.</p>

<h3>3. Add Scenes</h3>



<p>Now, you will want to create a game scene by clicking on the plus sign in <code>Scenes</code>. A new window will pop up where you can name it.</p>



<div><figure><img width="1024" height="576" src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scenes.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1" alt="Set up OBS Studio for Recording" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scenes.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scenes.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scenes.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scenes.png?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scenes.png?resize=1200%2C675&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scenes.png?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20576'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scenes.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scenes.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scenes.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scenes.png?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scenes.png?resize=1200%2C675&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scenes.png?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scenes.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1"></figure></div>



<h3>4. Capture Your Game</h3>



<p>After creating an in-game scene, keep it selected and click on the <code>+</code> sign in <code>Sources</code>, and select <code>Game Capture</code>. This will open up the properties and let you pick which game you want to record.</p>



<div><figure><img width="562" height="380" src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Game-Capture.png?resize=562%2C380&amp;ssl=1" alt="Set up OBS Studio for Recording" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Game-Capture.png?w=562&amp;ssl=1 562w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Game-Capture.png?resize=300%2C203&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20562%20380'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Game-Capture.png?w=562&amp;ssl=1 562w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Game-Capture.png?resize=300%2C203&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Game-Capture.png?resize=562%2C380&amp;ssl=1"></figure></div>



<p>For <code>Mode</code> make sure it’s set to <code>Capture</code> any fullscreen application. Once you start playing your game, OBS will automatically focus on it.</p>



<p>Nowadays, many games have an anti-cheat system that might affect OBS Studio. For this reason, you should select <code>Use anti-cheat compatibility hook</code>. Don’t worry, you won’t get banned for it.</p>



<p>If you enable 3rd party overlays like Discord or Steam, OBS will try and capture them as well. However, this does not always work, so make sure to check the preview window.</p>



<div><figure><img width="717" height="605" src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/OBS-capture.png?resize=717%2C605&amp;ssl=1" alt="Set up OBS Studio for Recording" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/OBS-capture.png?w=717&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/OBS-capture.png?resize=300%2C253&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20717%20605'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/OBS-capture.png?w=717&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/OBS-capture.png?resize=300%2C253&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/OBS-capture.png?resize=717%2C605&amp;ssl=1"></figure></div>



<p>Once you are done with the setup, click OK and exit. Your game should now be displayed in the OBS.</p>



<h3>5. Add your Webcam</h3>



<p>Go back to the <code>+</code> sign in <code>Sources</code> and select <code>Video Capture Device</code>.</p>



<div><figure><img width="500" height="393" src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Video-Capture.png?resize=500%2C393&amp;ssl=1" alt="Set up OBS Studio for Recording" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Video-Capture.png?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Video-Capture.png?resize=300%2C236&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20393'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Video-Capture.png?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Video-Capture.png?resize=300%2C236&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Video-Capture.png?resize=500%2C393&amp;ssl=1"></figure></div>



<p>That will take you to the <code>Properties</code>. Make sure that you select the right webcam and OBS will set it up. By default, <code>Resolution Type</code> is set to custom. If you want to change it, we recommend choosing either <code>1080p</code> or <code>720p</code>. Hit <code>OK</code> and your webcam will appear under <code>Scenes</code>. Just drag it where you want and resize if needed.</p>



<p>And that’s it! You are now ready to start recording videos in OBS Studio.</p>



<p>Hope you were able to follow this guide and set up your computer to record using <a href="https://obsproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OBS Studio</a>. Have fun recording your screen, or games! Let us know if you have any tips for setting up your OBS Studio installation and we’ll publish it. Thanks! </p>

    <p>In a previous article, <a href="https://ncona.com/2020/12/introduction-to-google-firestore/">we started playing with Google Firestore</a>. In this article we are going to learn how we can test our applications without the need to talk to Google Cloud.</p>

<p>Note that the local version of Google Firestore is intended for testing only and shouldn’t be used for production systems. It doesn’t provide the reliability or scalability features that the real Firestore does.</p>

<h2 id="firebase-emulator-suite">Firebase emulator suite</h2>

<p>Google provides this suite to help developers test applications without having to use production data or incur cost. The suite doesn’t only emulate the database, but also cloud functions and real-time functionality, to name a couple. In this article we’re only going to focus on the Firestore database.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="firebase-cli">Firebase CLI</h2>

<p>We start by installing the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli">Firebase CLI</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>curl -sL https://firebase.tools | bash
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can then start an instance of Firestore:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>firebase emulators:start --only firestore
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>As part of the output we will get something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre>┌───────────┬────────────────┐
│ Emulator  │ Host:Port      │
├───────────┼────────────────┤
│ Firestore │ localhost:8080 │

<p>Port <code>8080</code> is the default for Firestore. When the emulator starts it will look for a file named <code>firebase.json</code> where we can override the port:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

<p>One important thing to keep in mind about the emulator is that the data will be lost every time the emulator is stoped.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://ncona.com/2020/12/introduction-to-google-firestore/">Introduction to Google Firestore</a> we learned how to create a firestore client:</p>

  <span>}</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>client</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>To tell our app that we want to use the emulator, we need to set an environment variable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre><span>export </span><span>FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST</span><span>=</span>localhost:8080
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will cause the credentials to be ignored, and the client will connect to the emulator instead.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This was a quick article to show how we can easily start a local version of Google Firestore that can be used for testing. The emulator provides a lot of advanced features, but I haven’t had the need for them, so I haven’t dived into them.</p>

<p>11th November 2017</p>
<p>This article describes how to program the ATtiny10, Microchip's diminuitive 6-pin processor, using the Arduino IDE. It's a great chip for building small gadgets and wearables, or designing interface logic for other projects, and it really lives up to its "tiny" name:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/attiny10.jpg" alt="ATtiny10.jpg" width="250" height="300"></p>
<p>The following sections explain how to program the ATtiny10 in C, and how to download programs using a low-cost ISP programmer. It also illustrates some simple applications with example programs.</p>
<p>For a couple of projects based on the ATtiny10 see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?201J">ATtiny10 POV Pendant</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2G8A">ATtiny10 Thermometer</a>.</p>
<h3><span>Introduction</span></h3>
<p>If, like me, you like using the simplest possible chip for each application, the ATtiny10 will appeal to you&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref1"><a href="#cite_note1">[1]</a></sup>; it's a 6-pin processor, about the same size as an 0805 SMD resistor, and it costs about 35p/35¢. It packs in the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internal 8MHz clock, by default prescaled to 1MHz.</li>
<li>Three I/O lines.</li>
<li>Two 16-bit PWM analogue outputs.</li>
<li>Three 8-bit analogue inputs.</li>
<li>An analogue comparator.</li>
<li>A 16-bit timer with input capture and an event counter.</li>
<li>A watchdog timer.</li>
<li>1024 bytes of program memory, 32 bytes of RAM, and no EEPROM.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these features will be familiar to users of the larger AVR chips. Here's the pinout (using Spence Konde's design conventions):</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/attiny10pinout.gif" alt="ATtiny10Pinout.gif" width="701" height="159"></p>
<p>The internal oscillator is accurate to within 10%, but you can calibrate it in software to within 1%. You can configure RESET as a fourth I/O line, which prevents further programming, but I don't cover that in this article.</p>
<p>To work with the ATtiny10 on a breadboard you can mount it on a SOT23 breakout board, such as the one available from Sparkfun <sup id="cite_ref2"><a href="#cite_note2">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>Programming the ATtiny10</h3>
<p>Unlike the SPI protocol used to program the larger AVR chips, such as the ATmega328 in the Arduino Uno, the ATtiny10 uses a programming protocol called TPI (Tiny Programming Interface) which needs only five wires. Fortunately Thomas Fischl's excellent USBasp programmer supports this protocol&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref3"><a href="#cite_note3">[3]</a></sup>; you can build your own, order one from his site, or they are widely available on eBay&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref4"><a href="#cite_note4">[4]</a></sup>, Banggood&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref5"><a href="#cite_note5">[5]</a></sup>, etc. I recommend getting one with a 10-pin to 6-pin adapter for ISP programming. The current versions of the Arduino IDE support the ATtiny10, so you can program it in C and upload programs as easily as with the other AVR chips. Since an Arduino core would use up almost half of the available program memory the best way to program it is to access the registers directly, and I give an overview of how to do this in the section&nbsp;<a href="#Alternatives">Alternatives to core functions</a>&nbsp;below.</p>
<p>Here are step-by-step instructions for programming the ATtiny10.</p>
<p>NOTE: There is a problem with compiling for the ATtiny10 with versions of the Arduino IDE 1.8.9 and higher. If necessary, run version 1.8.8 to do this, or for a workaround see the Disqus comments below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the <strong>ATtiny10Core</strong> hardware configuration from my repository on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/technoblogy/attiny10core" target="_blank">ATtiny10Core</a>.</li>
<li>Copy it to the&nbsp;<strong>hardware</strong>&nbsp;folder in your&nbsp;<strong>Arduino</strong>&nbsp;folder in your <strong>Documents</strong> folder. If there isn't already a <strong>hardware</strong> folder there, create one first.</li>
<li>Restart the Arduino IDE.</li>
</ul>
<p>This should add an&nbsp;<strong>ATtiny10Core</strong>&nbsp;heading to the <strong>Board</strong> menu.</p>
<ul>
<li>Enter your program into the Arduino IDE editor.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, try the&nbsp;<strong>Blink</strong>&nbsp;example program given below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect the USBasp to the ATtiny10 as shown in the following diagram:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/attiny10usbasp.gif" alt="ATtiny10USBasp.gif" width="203" height="157"></p>
<p><em>Connecting the USBasp programmer to an ATtiny10.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Choose&nbsp;<strong>Board</strong>&nbsp;from the&nbsp;<strong>Tools</strong>&nbsp;menu, and select the&nbsp;<strong>ATtiny10/9/5/4</strong>&nbsp;option under the <strong>ATtiny10Core</strong> heading; it's the only option.</li>
<li>Choose the chip you want from the <strong>Chip</strong> menu; for example&nbsp;<strong>ATtiny10</strong>.</li>
<li>Choose <strong>USBasp</strong> from the&nbsp;<strong>Programmer&nbsp;</strong>option on the&nbsp;<strong>Tools</strong>&nbsp;menu.</li>
<li>Choose&nbsp;<strong>Upload</strong>&nbsp;to upload the program.</li>
</ul>
<p>The LED should blink at 0.5Hz.</p>
<p>Here's my test setup on a mini breadboard:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/usbasp.jpg" alt="USBasp.jpg" width="680" height="324"></p>
<p><em>Testing the ATtiny10 Blink program on a mini breadboard, using the USBasp programmer.</em></p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>Here are a couple of examples using the ATtiny10:</p>
<h4>Blink</h4>
<p>This is the ubiquitous Blink program:</p>
<pre>#include &lt;avr/io.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;

int main (void) {
  DDRB = 1;                       // PB0 as an output
  TCCR0A = 1&lt;&lt;COM0A0 | 0&lt;&lt;WGM00;  // Toggle OC0A, CTC mode
  TCCR0B = 1&lt;&lt;WGM02 | 3&lt;&lt;CS00;    // CTC mode; use OCR0A; /64
  OCR0A = 15624;                  // 1 second; ie 0.5Hz
  while (1);
}</pre>
<p>To run it connect an LED to PB0 as follows:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/attiny10usbasp2.gif" alt="ATtiny10USBasp2.gif" width="157" height="128"></p>
<p><em>Circuit using an ATtiny10 to blink an LED.</em></p>
<p>It uses Timer/Counter0 to divide the 1MHz system clock by a prescaler value of 64, and then by 15625, toggling the output PB0 with a period of 1 second.</p>
<h4>Analogue frequency generator</h4>
<p>The following program reads the voltage from a potentiometer on analogue input ADC1 (PB1), and then uses this to set the compare match register OCR0A of Timer/Counter0, to generate a square wave on PB0 whose frequency you can control with the potentiometer:</p>
<pre>#include &lt;avr/io.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;

int main (void) {
  DDRB = 1;                       // PB0 as an output
  // Set up ADC on PB2
  ADMUX = 1&lt;&lt;MUX0;                // ADC1 (PB1)
  ADCSRA = 1&lt;&lt;ADEN | 3&lt;&lt;ADPS0;    // Enable ADC, 125kHz clock
  // Set up waveform on PB0
  TCCR0A = 1&lt;&lt;COM0A0 | 3&lt;&lt;WGM00;  // Toggle OC0A, Fast PWM
  TCCR0B = 3&lt;&lt;WGM02 | 4&lt;&lt;CS00;    // Fast PWM with OCR0A as TOP; /256
  // Main loop
  for (;;) {
    ADCSRA = ADCSRA | 1&lt;&lt;ADSC;    // Start
    while (ADCSRA &amp; 1&lt;&lt;ADSC);     // Wait while conversion in progress
    OCR0A = ADCL;                 // Copy result to frequency output
  }
}</pre>
<p>Note that because we're changing the compare match value, we need to use Fast PWM mode in this application, because it double-buffers the compare match value. Here's the circuit:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/attiny10usbasp3.gif" alt="ATtiny10USBasp3.gif" width="247" height="132"></p>
<p><em>Circuit using a potentiometer to adjust the frequency of a square wave generated by an ATtiny10.</em></p>
<p>It generates a frequency between 1MHz/256/256, or about 15Hz, and 1MHz/256/1, or 3.9kHz.</p>
<h3 id="Alternatives">Alternatives to core functions</h3>
<p>The following sections give some tips on programming the ATtiny10 to achieve some of the things provided by the Arduino core functions.</p>
<h4>includes</h4>
<p>You need to add these includes at the start of your program to include the AVR register definitions and standard C++ routines:</p>
<pre>#include &lt;avr/io.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;</pre>
<h4>setup and loop</h4>
<p>Arduino programs are normally written with the initialization in&nbsp;<strong>setup()</strong>&nbsp;and the main program in&nbsp;<strong>loop()</strong>, rather than the standard&nbsp;<strong>int&nbsp;main()</strong>&nbsp;function required by C. If you want to keep to this convention you'll need to add the following definition at the end of your program:</p>
<pre>int main() {
  setup();
  for(;;) loop();
}</pre>
<h4>pinMode</h4>
<p>To specify whether pins are inputs or outputs you set the corresponding bits in the <strong>DDRB</strong> register to 0 or 1 respectively. For example, to define pins 1 and 3 as outputs (and leave the other pins as inputs):</p>
<pre>DDRB = 0b0101; &nbsp; &nbsp;     // Equivalent to pinMode(1, OUTPUT); pinMode(3, OUTPUT);</pre>
<h4>Input pullups</h4>
<p>Unlike the older AVR chips, such as the ATmega328 and ATtiny85, the ATtiny10 enables pullup resistors using a separate pullup register, <strong>PUEB</strong>. To set pullups on input pins you set the corresponding bits in this&nbsp;register. For example, to set a pullup resistor on input pin 2:</p>
<pre>PUEB = 0b0010;         // Equivalent to pinMode(2, INPUT_PULLUP);</pre>
<p>Note that it doesn't make sense to set a pullup on an output.</p>
<h4>digitalWrite</h4>
<p>To set the state of an output you set the corresponding bits in the <strong>PORTB</strong> register. For example, to set bit 1 low and bit 3 high (assuming they have been defined as outputs):</p>
<pre>PORTB = 0b0100;        // Equivalent to&nbsp;digitalWrite(1, LOW);&nbsp;digitalWrite(3, HIGH);</pre>
<p>Changing the state of&nbsp;an input has no effect.</p>
<h4>digitalRead</h4>
<p>To read the state of the I/O pins you read the <strong>PINB</strong> register:</p>
<pre>int temp = PINB;</pre>
<h4>analogWrite</h4>
<p>You can use OC0A (PB0) and OC0B (PB1) for analogue output using PWM. You first need to configure the Timer/Counter into PWM mode for that pin; for example, using PB0:</p>
<pre>TCCR0A = 2&lt;&lt;COM0A0 | 3&lt;&lt;WGM00; // 10-bit PWM on OC0A (PB0), non-inverting mode
TCCR0B = 0&lt;&lt;WGM02 | 1&lt;&lt;CS00;   // Divide clock by 1
DDRB = 0b0001;                 // Make PB0 an output</pre>
<p>To write an analogue value we then need to write the value to the appropriate output compare register, OCR0A:</p>
<pre>OCR0A = 1000;                  // Equivalent to analogWrite(0, 1000)</pre>
<p>With a 5V supply this will set PB0 to 1000/1024 * 5V, or 4.88V.</p>
<h4>analogRead</h4>
<p>To use an I/O pin for analogue input you first need to configure the Analogue-to-Digital Converter. For example, to use ADC0:</p>
<pre>ADMUX = 0&lt;&lt;MUX0;               // ADC0 (PB0)
ADCSRA = 1&lt;&lt;ADEN | 3&lt;&lt;ADPS0;   // Enable ADC, 125kHz clock</pre>
<p>To read an analogue value from the pin we then need to start a conversion, and when the conversion is ready read the ADC register:</p>
<pre>ADCSRA = ADCSRA | 1&lt;&lt;ADSC;     // Start
while (ADCSRA &amp; 1&lt;&lt;ADSC);      // Wait while conversion in progress
int temp = ADCL;               // Copy result to temp
</pre>
<h4>delay</h4>
<p>For a simple substitute for&nbsp;<strong>delay()</strong>&nbsp;you can use a loop adjusted to give roughly the right timing:</p>
<pre>void delay (int millis) {
  for (volatile unsigned int i = 34*millis; i&gt;0; i--);
}</pre>
<p>This would provide an alternative way of writing the Blink program. Note that the counter variable&nbsp;<strong>i</strong>&nbsp;must be defined as&nbsp;<strong>volatile</strong>&nbsp;or the compiler will optimise it out of the loop, eliminating the delay.</p>
<p>For more accurate delays, and to implement timers like&nbsp;<strong>millis()</strong>, you could set up Timer/Counter0 as a timer, or use the Watchdog Timer.</p>
<h3>Update</h3>
<p>30th December 2019: Added a note about problems compiling for the ATtiny10 with versions of the Arduino IDE 1.8.9 or later. Use 1.8 to 1.8.8.</p><hr>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2020/what-is-ebpf-header.png" width="100%" alt="what is ebpf"></p>

<p>About a year ago, a friend of mine decided to build an <a href="https://medium.com/mycrypto/the-ethereum-virtual-machine-how-does-it-work-9abac2b7c9e">EVM</a> (Ethereum Virtual Machine) assembler in Rust. After some prodding from him, I began to help by writing unit tests. At the time, I knew very little about operating systems and started to read about lexical and symbolical analyzers. I was quickly in way over my head. What I did retain, however, was a newfound appreciation for the OS as a whole. So, when he started raving about eBPF, I knew I was in for a treat.</p>

<p>The bar for understanding what eBPF is and what it can do is high. Finding a good foothold to start was difficult for me. On the spectrum of basic 500-word mini-blogs to <a href="https://cilium.io/">Cilium’s</a> overwhelming documentation, material certainly skews towards documentation. My goal here is to provide a thorough entrypoint into this nascent technology, preparing you for progressively technical deep dives, like <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/740157/">Linux Weekly News</a>, <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/index.html">Brendan Gregg’s</a> website, and Cilium’s <a href="https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/bpf/">documentation</a>. Together, we will explore:</p>

<ul>
<li>What eBPF does</li>
<li>How eBPF works</li>
<li>An example of eBPF in use</li>
<li>How to start using eBPF</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-does-ebpf-do">What Does eBPF Do?</h2>

<p>eBPF lets programmers execute custom bytecode within the kernel <em>without</em> having to change the kernel or load kernel modules. Exciting? Maybe not yet. eBPF is closely intertwined with the Linux kernel. For context, let’s briefly review some fundamental concepts.</p>

<p>Linux divides its OS into two distinct areas: kernel space and user space. Kernel space is where the core of the operating system resides. It has full and unrestricted access to all hardware - memory, storage, CPU, etc. Due to the privileged nature of kernel access, the space is protected and allowed to run only the most trusted code. User space is where anything that is not a kernel process runs - I/O, file system manipulation, etc. These programs have limited access to hardware and must make syscalls through an API exposed by the kernel. In other words, user space programs must be filtered through the kernel space.</p>

<p>While the system call interface was sufficient in most cases, developers need more flexibility to add support for new hardware, filesystems, network protocols, or even custom system calls. There had to be a way for custom programs to access hardware directly, a way to extend the base kernel without adding directly to the kernel source code. <a href="https://tldp.org/LDP/lkmpg/2.6/html/lkmpg.html">Linux Kernel Modules</a> (LKMs) serve this function. Unlike system calls, whereby requests traverse from the user space to kernel space, LKMs are loaded directly into the kernel, making them a part of it. Perhaps the most valuable feature of LKMs is that it can be loaded at runtime, removing the need to recompile the entire kernel and reboot the machine.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2020/what-is-ebpf-1.png" width="60%" alt="LKMs in kernel space"></p>

<p>Figure 1 - LKMs can be dynamically loaded and unloaded as part of kernel space (<a href="http://derekmolloy.ie/writing-a-linux-kernel-module-part-1-introduction/">Source</a>)</p>

<p>As helpful as LKMs are, they do introduce a lot of risk to the system. The division of kernel and user spaces added a number of security measures to the OS. The kernel space is meant to run only a privileged OS kernel. The layer between, connected by the system call interface, separated user space programs that could mess with finely tuned hardware. In other words, LKMs could certainly crash the kernel. Aside from the wide blast radius of security vulnerabilities, modules incur a large overhead maintenance cost in that kernel version upgrades could break the module.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-ebpf">What is eBPF</h4>

<p>eBPF programs are a more recent invention for accessing services and hardware from the Linux kernel space. Already these programs have been used for networking, debugging, tracing, firewalls, and more.</p>

<p>Born out of a need for better Linux tracing tools, eBPF drew inspiration from <code>dtrace</code>, a dynamic tracing tool available primarily for Solaris and BSD operating systems. Unlike <code>dtrace</code>, Linux could not get a global overview of running systems, it was limited to specific frameworks for system calls, library calls, and functions. Building on the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF), a tool for writing packer-filtering code using an in-kernel VM, a small group of engineers began to extend the BPF backend to provide a similar set of features as <code>dtrace</code>. First released in limited capacity in 2014 with Linux 3.18, making full use of eBPF requires at least Linux 4.4 or above.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2020/what-is-ebpf-2.png" width="100%" alt="simplified visualization of eBPF architecture"></p>

<p>Figure 2</p>

<p>In Figure 2, we see a simplified visualization of eBPF architecture. Before being loaded into the kernel, the eBPF program must pass a certain set of requirements. Verification involves executing the eBPF program within the virtual machine. Doing so allows the <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/kernel/bpf/verifier.c">verifier</a>, with 10,000+ lines of code, to perform a series of checks. The verifier will traverse the potential paths the eBPF program may take when executed in the kernel, making sure the program does indeed run to completion without any looping that would cause a kernel lockup. Other checks, from valid register state, program size, to out of bound jumps, must also be met. Almost immediately, eBPF sets itself apart from LKMs with important safety controls in place.</p>

<p>If all checks are passed, the eBPFprogram is loaded and compiled into the kernel at a point in a code path and listens for the right signal. That signal comes in the form of an event that passes where the program is loaded in the code path. Once triggered, the bytecode executes and collects information as per its instructions.</p>

<p>So what does eBPF do? It lets programmers safely execute custom bytecode within the Linux kernel without modifying or adding to kernel source code. While still a far cry from replacing LKMs as a whole, eBPF programs introduce custom code to interact with protected hardware resources with minimal threat to the kernel.</p>

<h2 id="how-ebpf-works">How eBPF Works</h2>

<p>So far, I’ve reduced eBPF to its bare architecture. But, there are more components working together, each of which has layers of complexity of their own.</p>

<h3 id="anatomy-of-an-ebpf-program">Anatomy of an eBPF Program</h3>

<h4 id="events-and-hooking">Events and Hooking</h4>

<p>eBPF programs are triggered by events that pass a particular location in the kernel. These events are captured at hooks when a specific set of instructions are executed in a single run. When triggered, these hooks will execute an eBPF program, letting us capture or manipulate data. The diversity of hook locations is one of the many aspects that makes eBPF so useful. A quick sampling of these locations include:</p>

<ul>
<li>System Calls - Inserted when user space functions transfer execution to the kernel</li>
<li>Function Entry and Exit - Intercepts calls to pre-existing functions</li>
<li>Network Events - Executes when packets are received</li>
<li>Kprobes and uprobes - Attach to probes for kernel or user functions</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="helper-calls">Helper Calls</h4>

<p>When eBPF programs are triggered at their hook points, they make calls to helper functions. These special functions are what makes eBPF feature-rich in accessing memory. For example, helpers can perform a wide variety of tasks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Search, update, and delete key-value pairs in tables</li>
<li>Generate a pseudo-random number</li>
<li>Collect and flag tunnel metadata</li>
<li>Chain eBPF programs together, known as tail calls</li>
<li>Perform tasks with sockets, like binding, retrieve cookies, redirect packets, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>These helper functions must be defined by the kernel, meaning there is a whitelist of calls eBPF programs can make. But the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/bpf-helpers.7.html">number</a> is large and continues to grow.</p>

<h4 id="maps">Maps</h4>

<p>To store and share data between the program and kernel or user spaces, eBPF makes use of maps. As implied by the name, maps are key-value pairs. Supporting a number of different data structures, like hash tables, arrays, and tries, programs are able to send and receive data in maps using helper functions.</p>

<h3 id="executing-an-ebpf-program">Executing an eBPF Program</h3>

<h4 id="loading-and-verifying">Loading and Verifying</h4>

<p>The kernel expects all eBPF programs to be loaded as bytecode, so unless bytecode is being written, we need a way to compile higher level languages. To build out this compiler, eBPF uses <a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> as its back-end infrastructure on which a front-end for any programming language can be built. Because eBPF programs are written in C, that language front end is <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a>. But before compiled bytecode can be hooked anywhere, it must pass a series of checks. By simulating the program in a VM-like construct, an <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/kernel/bpf/verifier.c">in-kernel verifier</a> can prevent programs that loop, do not have the right permissions, or crash the kernel. If the program passes all checks, program bytecode will be loaded onto the hook point using a <code>bpf()</code> system call</p>

<h4 id="just-in-time-jit-compiler">Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler</h4>

<p>After verification, eBPF bytecode is JIT’d into native machine code. eBPF has a modern design, meaning it has been upgraded to be 64-bit encoded with 11 total registers. This closely maps eBPF to hardware for x86_64, ARM, and arm64 architecture, amongst others. Fast compilation at runtime makes it possible for eBPF to remain performant even as it must first pass through a VM.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>Putting this conceptual jigsaw together, eBPF programs are inserted into a hook point after passing a number of safety checks. When they are triggered by an event, programs execute immediately, using a combination of helper functions and maps to manipulate and store data. We’ll take a closer look at how these components work together in the next section</p>

<h2 id="example-ebpf-in-action">Example: eBPF in Action</h2>

<p>At Teleport, we’ve used a few eBPF programs in one of our open source projects, Teleport, for tracing and networking. For some necessary context: <a href="https://goteleport.com/teleport">Teleport</a> gives developers secure server access via SSH. Because organizations want to know what happens during a session, Teleport records user actions. Yet there are ways to bypass session recording entirely by obfuscating behavior within encoded commands, commands run in shell scripts, or even terminal commands like disabling <code>echo</code>.</p>

<p>Earlier this year with our <a href="https://goteleport.com/blog/teleport-release-4-2">Teleport 4.2 release</a>, we introduced <em>enhanced</em> session recording, which uses three eBPF programs (for now!) to take unstructured SSH sessions and transform them into a stream of structured events.</p>

<p>Consider <code>echo Y3VybCBodHRwOi8vd3d3LmV4YW1wbGUuY29tCg== | base64 --decode | sh</code>. Though we can capture this command printed in the terminal, it means nothing to us as the …</p></article></div>

            <td>
            <p>1. Notable New Features</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Scalable TrueType font (TTF) output for DOS applications</p>With the new TrueType font (TTF) output, you will get nice high resolution DOS screen rendered using a TrueType font (either the built-in one or a TTF font of your choice), and the window can be set to almost any usable number of lines and columns. This feature greatly improved DOSBox-X's support for DOS applications. Set "output=ttf" (or from the "Video" menu) to enable this output.</li>

<li><p>On-screen text styles for DOS applications</p>With the TrueType font output, DOSBox-X now supports on-screen text styles for DOS applications including WordPerfect, WordStar, and XyWrite. With this feature you will visually see fonts in bold for bold text, and fonts in italics for italicized text, and so on. Set a DOS word processor (WP/WS/XY) to enable this feature.</li>

<li><p>Support for Apple M1 Mac and macOS Big Sur</p>DOSBox-X now supports the new Apple ARM-based M1 MacBooks! The dynamic core now works on the new ARM-based macOS systems. The audio also works once again when compiled and run on macOS 11 Big Sur.</li>

<li><p>Pasting clipboard text in macOS SDL1 builds</p>Pasting text from the host system clipboard is now supported in the macOS SDL1 build, similar to the Linux SDL1 build. On all other platforms (Windows SDL1/SDL2, Linux SDL2, and macOS SDL2) both copying to and pasting from the clipboard are supported.</li>

<li><p>System menu in Windows SDL2 builds</p>The system menu that was available in Windows SDL1 builds is now also
available for Windows SDL2 builds, which includes a few common menu options such as the configuration tool and the mapper editor.</li>

<li><p>Select common host keys from the menu</p>You can now select a host key from the "Main" menu, which now includes common key combinations such as Ctrl+Alt, Ctrl+Shift, and Alt+Shift, or you may just use the mapper-defined host key (which default to F11 on Windows and F12
otherwise). The default shortcuts for a few items are changed to use the host key style.</li>

<li><p>Switch OpenGL (GLSL) shaders at run-time</p>With the OpenGL outputs (opengl/opengnb/openghq), you can now select and switch to a different GLSL shader at the run-time by selecting the menu item "Select OpenGL (GLSL) shader..." from the "Video" menu, similar to the function for Direct3D pixel shaders for the Direct3D output.</li>

<li><p>Display IDE disk or CD status</p>There is now a menu option under "DOS" menu which allows you to see the current assignments (disk or CD image) of the IDE controllers.</li>

<li><p>Support for mounting MAME CHD CD images</p>Mounting the MAME CHD images is now supported in DOSBox-X! You can mount CHD files as CD images with IMGMOUNT command, or from the "Drive" menu.</li>

<li><p>Support for saving your files for the save-state feature</p>There is a now a FLAGSAVE command which allows you to mark files to be saved and loaded by the save-state feature. Type "FLAGSAVE /?" at the DOSBox-X shell for more usage information.</li>

<li><p>Enhanced MODE command to change screen dimensions</p>You can now change the number of columns and lines on the screen with the
MODE command, similar to real DOS systems. Alternatively, this can be done from the "Video" menu (within "Text-mode" menu group).</li>

<li><p>Improved LOADFIX command to auto-allocate memory</p>The LOADFIX command now has an -a option which will automatically allocate enough memory to fill lowest 64KB memory instead of using exactly 64KB memory. This will let some memory-demanding DOS programs or games to run with this command.</li>

<li><p>Improved automatic fix for the "Packed file corrupt" error</p>The handler for the "Packed file corrupt" error has been greatly improved so that it will likely automatically handle the error more efficiently. There is now also an option to silence the messages during the automatic fix.</li>

</ul>

            <p>2. Notable Usability Improvements</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Improved mapper editor interface</p>The mapper editor interface has been enhanced! The texts for the shortcut functions are now longer and clearer, and there are now multiple pages in the mapper, navigable with the "Previous Page" and "Next Page" buttons.</li>

<li><p>Load DOSBox-X mapper files from menu</p>You can now select and load DOSBox-X mapper files at run-time from the "Main" menu. Previously it was possible to load a mapper file dynmically from the command line, but now you can do so from the menu too.</li>

<li><p>List network interfaces from menu</p>There is now a "List network interfaces" menu option under the "Help" menu that will list the current network interfaces for the NE2000 networking feature. Previously you can only see the network interface list from the log file.</li>

<li><p>Display DOS command help from menu</p>You can now find a "DOS commands" menu group under the "Help" menu, which allows you to select a DOS shell command (DIR, CD, etc) to see its help messages. Alternatively you can type "[COMMAND] /?" (e.g. "DIR /?") for help information for the command.</li>

<li><p>Searching for config file and mapper file in DOSBox-X executable path</p>DOSBox-X will now look for the config file (e.g.
dosbox-x.conf) and the mapper file in the directory containing the DOSBox-X executable too if they cannot be found in the DOSBox-X working directory. This makes DOSBox-X even more portable.</li>

<li><p>More saving options for the built-in configuration tool</p>The graphical configuration tool now provides the option to save
to the primary or user config files, not just the dosbox-x.conf file.</li>

<li><p>New config options for save state options</p>The config options "saveremark" and "forceloadstate" are added to [dosbox]
section which can be used to control the save state-related options from the config file. In the previous section these can only be done from the "Capture" menu.</li>

</ul>

            <p>3. Bugfixes and Other Improvements</p>
There are also many bugfixes and other improvements, such as fixing the CD audio issue with the game "The Secret of Monkey Island" when talking to the pirate in Scumm Bar. Please see the full changelogs below for more information.
<p>4. Full Changelog In This Version</p>
<ul>
<li>
Added support for scalable TrueType font (TTF)
output for text-mode programs. Set "output=ttf"
and optionally a monospaced TTF font (such as
consola) with config option "ttf.font" to use it.
Lines and columns can be specified with config
options "ttf.lins" and "ttf.cols", and the cursor
can be made blinking with the option "ttf.blinkc".
The config options "ttf.ptsize" and "ttf.winperc"
can be used to set the TTF font size and window
percentage respectively. If you specify a TTF font
size with "ttf.ptsize" then "ttf.winperc" will be
ignored. You can also specify a word processor
(WP=WordPerfect, WS=WordStar, XY=XyWrite) for the
on-screen text-style and 512-character font (WP)
features. When using the TTF output DOSBox-X will
temporarily switch to a different output when a
graphical mode is requested (or when trying to take
a screenshot); the TTF output will be auto-switched
back later), which can be customized via config
option "ttf.outputswitch" (which defaults to auto).
Menu items in the "Text-mode" menu group (under
"Video" menu) have been expanded to support TTF
options such as increasing/decreasing the TTF font
sizes and on-screen text style toggling (including
bold, italics, underline and strikeout). You can
also select a TTF font to use at run-time with the
"Select TrueType font (TTF)" menu option. (Wengier)
</li><li>
Added the "Load mapper file..." menu option (under
"Main") to select and load a DOSBox-X mapper file
at run-time. Be sure to select a SDL1 mapper file
for SDL1 builds, and similar for SDL2. (Wengier)
</li><li>
You can now select a host key from the menu (under
"Main") including Ctrl+Alt, Ctrl+Shift, Alt+Shift,
or use the mapper-defined host key as in previous
versions (which default to F11 on Windows and F12
otherwise). A config option "hostkey" is added so
that you can specify it from config file. (Wengier)
</li><li>
Pasting text from the clipboard on macOS SDL1 build
is now supported like Linux SDL1 build. (Wengier)
</li><li>
Added support for ARM-based Apple M1 MacBook. The
dynamic core now works on ARM-based macOS systems.
SDL1 builds updated to use newer audio APIs on the
macOS platform so that the audio works once again
when compiled and run on macOS 11 (Big Sur). Prior
to the change, ancient versions of the API dating
back to the mid 2000s were used which no longer
work on Big Sur.
</li><li>
DOSBox-X will now look for the config file (i.e.
dosbox-x.conf/dosbox.conf) and the mapper file in
the directory containing the DOSBox-X executable
too if the config or mapper file cannot be found
in the DOSBox-X working directory. (Wengier)
</li><li>
The system menu in Windows SDL1 builds is now also
available for Windows SDL2 builds, and menu items
"Reset font size", "Increase TTF font size" and
"Decrease TTF font size" are added. (Wengier)
</li><li>
Enhanced the mapper editor interface to allow more
keyboard shortcuts to be added, shown in multiple
pages in the mapper, navigable with the "Previous
Page" and "Next Page" buttons. The text in the
grids are now longer and clearer too. The default
shortcuts for a few items are changed to use the
Host key style (e.g. Host+S and Host+L for saving
and loading states respectively). (Wengier)
</li><li>
Added menu item "List network interfaces" under
"Help" menu to list network interfaces in the host
system for the NE2000 feature. (Wengier)
</li><li>
Added menu group "DOS commands" under "Help" menu
to display the help content for the selected DOS
shell command (DIR, CD, etc). (Wengier)
</li><li>
Configuration Tool now provides the option to save
to the primary or user config files. (Wengier)
</li><li>
Certain config options (e.g. doublescan) that were
marked as advanced options are now general config
options and will appear in dosbox-x.reference.conf
apart from dosbox-x.reference.full.conf. (Wengier)
</li><li>
Added config options "saveremark" (default: true)
and "forceloadstate" (default: false) in [dosbox]
section which can be used to control if DOSBox-X
should ask users to enter remarks when saving a
state or show warnings when loading a saved state
if there is a mismatch found. (Wengier)
</li><li>
The config option "pixelshader" is moved from the
section [gui] to [render] …</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></div></div>

		<p>Using <em>@gmail.com</em> for your email address is like living at someone’s house
without rent and potentially being kicked out any day without warning. All your
belongings inside, without any access.</p>

<p>One of my first jobs around 1997 was being a sysadmin and managing email
servers, writing <code>sendmail.cf</code> configuration files without M4, and I should
have known better.</p>

<p>Someone who used Gmail for over 10 years <a href="https://www.businessinsider.fr/us/google-users-locked-out-after-years-2020-10">recently got locked
out</a>
without explanation. When all services you use, tools, and all your life are
connected to your <em>@gmail.com</em> address, you can imagine how much of a nightmare
scenario this is.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It feels like getting baited by all the convenience that Google offers, only for Google to use your data as it pleases and possibly takes it all away with no prior notice.”</p>

  <p><cite>— <a href="https://www.businessinsider.fr/us/google-users-locked-out-after-years-2020-10">What it’s like to get locked out of Google indefinitely</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gmail has been here for so long it’s hard to imagine they can take it away from
you just as quickly. And good luck to get it back once that happens… Therefore
I highly recommend using their <a href="https://takeout.google.com/">Takeout</a> feature
to back up all your data and move away from using their domain <em>@gmail.com</em> in
your email address.</p>

<p>The unit of Internet space ownership is the domain name, get yours now.</p>

<p>I also use my <em>@gmail.com</em> too much because it’s easy, and its spam filtering
is so good. But I’ve reconsidered it, moved away, and use a non-public address
on my own domain when registering for new services. The following is a detail
of what I did and what I used to implement it.</p>

<h4 id="email-portability">Email portability</h4>

<p>Mobile phone numbers are so critical to everyday life that France has a law
allowing you to keep your phone number using a <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relev%C3%A9_d%27identit%C3%A9_op%C3%A9rateur">Relevé d’identité
opérateur</a>
(carrier identity number) when changing carrier. This service must be provided
free of charge.</p>

<p>Email addresses are essential, and portability is as key for them as for phone
numbers. But you can’t keep the same address when switching from one provider
to another. Once you start using <em>something@gmail.com</em>, it is painful to move
to a new one as you have to change it on every service you use, confirming each
one, one by one.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1323582505065320448">@dhh says</a> <em>Hey!</em> will
forward your email for life once you paid for the first year. That should be
mandatory for all providers, so you don’t have this Gmail life single point of
failure. It’s best to own your own domain name, but this is a lesser evil than
most other email providers.</p>

<p>I believe email providers should be legally obliged to forward your email
address for life to a new email address. A routing system similar to
<a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relev%C3%A9_d%27identit%C3%A9_op%C3%A9rateur">RIO</a>
preventing the old provider from having to forward them to the new one would be
best, but this is not technically possible with the SMTP Protocol.</p>

<p>Some people went as far as <a href="https://kevq.uk/de-googling-my-life-2-years-on/">De-Googling their
life</a> completely with success.</p>



<p>I created my <a href="https://www.hey.com/">hey</a> account for both making sure
fabienAThey.com would be mine if I ever wanted to use it, and for trying it
after viewing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCeYTysLyGI&amp;t=175s">this video</a>
about the service. Some of the features really make sense, like editing email
subjects <em>after</em> you received them or grouping multiple threads, but I still
prefer classic email interfaces.</p>

<p>After looking at a few options, I opted for
<a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a> for their pricing, security disclaimer,
and overall good reputation. I used <a href="https://kolabnow.com/">Kolab</a> for years
but decided to move away. I also quickly tried Zoho but had a bad experience
with their UI trying to set things up.</p>

<p>I also used FM import feature to get all my old emails from Kolab back to FM.</p>

<p>I enabled catch-all emails on FM, meaning any email to my domain is redirected
to me. Anywhere I register, I use a different email address based on the
service’s name (service@my_domain_com). I can easily set specific filters like
anything sent to service@mydomain goes to its folder and skip the inbox, or
find who resell my email.</p>

<p>It used to be a real pain to do that, but the password manager included in
Safari (or 1Password) now remembers which email you used to register to a
service. You don’t have to remember that yourself anymore.</p>

<p>I added a server filter. Anything matching /unsubscribe/ goes to a specific
/unsub/ folder and skip the inbox. All newsletters usually get caught in this.
I enabled server-side spam filtering on FM and installed
<a href="https://c-command.com/spamsieve/">Spamsieve</a> on my laptop for a local bayesian
filter, moving detected spam to a Junk folder.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://freron.com/">Mailmate</a> to read emails, which is by far the best
email client I ever found on macOS (a long way from Linux and in order Elm,
Pine, Mutt, Gnus). I now remember why I started using Gmail… Because I was
coming from those MUA!</p>

                    <h3 id="every-hour-of-every-day-of-every-year">Every hour of every day of every year</h3><p>A framework I’ve found helpful for understanding what it means to get to 100% carbon-free electricity generation is a 24 x 365 grid. Each of the 8,760 squares represents an hour of power generation in the year that needs to be emissions free. I first came across this diagram reading <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-sustainability.appspot.com/pdf/24x7-carbon-free-energy-data-centers.pdf">Google’s 2019 discussion paper</a> on their corporate efforts to match 100% of their data center’s electricity demand with zero-carbon sources at every hour. In Google’s version of the diagram (shown below), green indicates a 100% clean energy match and grey means a 0% match. The gradation across each day and throughout the year reveals where there’s progress and where difficulties remain. More organizations in the private sector and in government should adopt this method of thinking about power generation for themselves or the region in which they are responsible. This framework makes the problem tractable and makes the end goal clear. Every hour of every day of every year must be 100% clean — each square needs to be solid green.</p><figure><img src="https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-12.43.00-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-12.43.00-AM.png 600w, https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-12.43.00-AM.png 1000w, https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-12.43.00-AM.png 1600w, https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-12.43.00-AM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Example of 24 x 365 grid from Google's 2019 discussion paper</figcaption></figure><p>A benefit of the 24 x 365 diagram is the breakdown along the axes of time of day and time of year. Both are critical because the pathway to 100% clean energy runs through massively increasing solar and wind energy generation which are highly time dependent. While this framework makes visualizing the utilization of those two technologies easier, it also puts emphasis on the most important objective: Achieving 0 emissions from power generation at all times. The goal isn't just deploying 500 more megawatts of solar or closing down a specific natural gas plant, it’s about bringing each hour to 100% clean energy generation. Tactics should stay tactics while strategy is created to bring portions of the day or year to 100% zero emissions through any number of methods.</p><p>While useful on its own, the 24 x 365 grid is even better when paired with the ability to zoom in and observe the quantity and mix of power generated each day. These types of charts are common today among grid operators. <a href="https://www.nyiso.com/real-time-dashboard">NY ISO</a> and <a href="https://www.caiso.com/TodaysOutlook/Pages/supply.html">CA ISO</a> both have real-time dashboards of energy mix on their respective websites.</p><p>With the 24 x 365 grid and the per day breakout in hand, we can reason about what improvements would happen if specific actions are taken. Consider the following two examples.</p><p><strong>Example 1: Adding more solar generation</strong></p><p>Building a new solar farm would immediately allow afternoon hours during the summer to achieve a higher level of carbon free generation. Using the two visuals we can quickly see where a solar farm would provide benefits during the year as well as a specific day.</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-9.49.17-PM.png" width="2000" height="1097" alt="" srcset="https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-9.49.17-PM.png 600w, https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-9.49.17-PM.png 1000w, https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-9.49.17-PM.png 1600w, https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-9.49.17-PM.png 2282w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-9.49.34-PM.png" width="1772" height="1268" alt="" srcset="https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-9.49.34-PM.png 600w, https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-9.49.34-PM.png 1000w, https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-9.49.34-PM.png 1600w, https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-9.49.34-PM.png 1772w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div></div><figcaption>Visualizations made using 2019 NY ISO data</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Example 2: Building a closed loop pumped hydro system</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/pumped-storage-hydropower">Closed loop pumped hydro systems</a> can be thought of as very large water batteries.

Batteries can extend the window of operation for solar and wind by storing excess electricity production. A 4-hour capacity of battery storage can enable solar and wind to take on peak demand in the evening hours. Residential demand response programs, where customers are paid to use less energy during certain parts of the day, when mapped onto the 24 x 365 grid would also serve to make certain hours cleaner as fewer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaking_power_plant#:~:text=Peaking%20power%20plants%2C%20also%20known,as%20peak%20demand%2C%20for%20electricity.">peaker plants</a> would be needed to meet consumer demand. The per day breakout would similarly show a lower total quantity demanded and a cleaner mix of energy generation. These two visuals provide an easy way to conceptualize the effects of many different solutions all while keeping focus on the singular goal, 0 emissions at every single moment.</p><p>We collectively need to solve for 8,760 hours each year. Making each individual hour 100% clean will take a combination of technologies. What this visual framework provides is a map to gauge how far we’ve come and what remains. There’s a satisfaction that comes when checking off an item on a to-do list, we should consider this the same. 8,760 to-dos, some harder than others, but all equally necessary. I hope these visuals are used more broadly across the climate space both in the private and public sector.</p><p>Below I’ve created an <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/nitin.iyer#!/vizhome/shared/48H8ZRNTC">interactive version of the 24 x 365 grid</a> and per day demand graphs using data from the NY ISO in 2019. Hover the cursor over the 24 x 365 grid to see the breakout for an individual day.</p><p>Carbon Free and Fossil Fuel generation in the data:</p><ul><li>Carbon Free consists of: Hydro, Nuclear, Wind, and Other Renewables</li><li>Fossil generation consists of: Dual Fuel, Natural Gas, and Other Fossil Fuels</li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: html-->                <!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="low-hanging-hours-first">Low hanging hours first</h3><p>For any organization to have the most impact, the next step after constructing a snapshot of their 24 x 365 grid is to identify the low-hanging hours currently available. Low hanging hours are those hours of the day or year which are the easiest and cheapest to convert from fossil energy to clean energy. Depending on the geographic area that could be afternoons in July when the sun is always out and PV panels are readily available, or evenings in October when the wind blows continuously and turbines are relatively the cheapest. Not all hours of the day will be as easy or cheap to convert but emissions averted at 9 AM are the same as emissions averted at 12 PM. And in mitigating climate change, reducing emissions is of utmost importance.</p><p>On that last point, the advantages of tackling the low-hanging hours first are two-fold. One is that tackling those hours first preserves more of the <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-much-carbon-budget-is-left-to-limit-global-warming-to-1-5c#:~:text=The%20models%2C%20labelled%20%E2%80%9CIPCC%20AR5,until%20the%20budget%20is%20exhausted.">“budget” of allowable emissions</a> for the harder to clean hours of the day. The nature of climate mitigation is that emissions averted sooner are much more valuable than emissions averted later. A <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/co2-mitigation-2c">great illustration</a> of this concept comes from Robbie Andrew who shows how far emissions must fall in each subsequent year depending on when we hit peak emissions in order to stay under 2°C of warming. Assuming priority can only be given to one initiative at a time, the low hanging hours are the place to begin. This isn’t exactly like a to-do list where the common advice is tackle the hardest task of your day first. In that sense it's the complete opposite, clean the easiest parts of the day first and leave the difficult parts of the day for later.</p><p>The second advantage builds off of the first. As the low-hanging hours run out, demand for fossil energy will only exist for those harder to convert hours of the day. As a result, costs for fossil generation will increase as the fixed costs of those plants become spread across reduced hours of operation. Higher costs for fossil generation will make more expensive clean generation technologies such as <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/geothermal/geothermal-power-plants.php#:~:text=Geothermal%20power%20plants%20use%20hydrothermal,or%20from%20hot%20water%20wells.&amp;text=The%20hot%20water%20or%20steam%20powers%20a%20turbine%20that%20generates%20electricity.">geothermal</a> more competitive. Without this demand reduction based cost increase or a price on carbon, these farther out zero-carbon baseload technologies may take too long to become cost competitive. This advantage could be hobbled by factors such as contract terms, political lobbying, or subsidies to fossil power generators. All of which may limit how fast fossil generation costs go up. But at some point the market overrides all barriers. Cheap energy is cheap energy.</p><p>Armed with the 24 x 365 framework and a strategy of addressing low hanging hours first, any organization is properly equipped to start the daunting task of getting to 100% clean energy. With climate change every solution is needed, but at the same time we cannot forget the power of prioritization. Tackling low hanging hours first provides some sense of direction in a flood of possible actions.</p>

the complexity of a system increases, the productivity of a monolith architecture
starts out as very productive, but decreases in productivity faster than a service oriented
architecture (SOA), until a SOA is more productive than the monolith.</p>
<p>Here’s a chart he provides to illustrate:</p>

    </span></p>
<p>But, come on, when you add all the drawbacks of an SOA, the costs are enormous and they get worse.
Data syncing, backfilling, inconsistencies, progogation of bad data. Books upon books on how to
deal with the problems specific to using an SOA. It takes a truly terribly designed monolith
and a fantastically designed SOA for those lines to cross. The chart should really look like this:</p>

to get their code into master, it takes days to get merged. The vast majority of that
time spent waiting for CI (compiling, tests, linting). You have two options: make all of that
faster, or harken back to the good old days when your project was smaller by splitting it up.</p>
<p>The problem is, in the good old days, all your data was still in one database. That’s a terrible
idea in a SOA. Now you’re sacrificing all kinds of simplicity and safety to make your project
compile and test faster in smaller pieces. Invalid data being the root of all evil,
giving up foreign key constraints is selling your soul.</p>
<p>Or, you could make things faster:</p>

<p>Seeing as making all of this fast once your project is already huge is very hard to do, I think
there are a few actionable points of advice I would like to leave with people starting new projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a language and ecosystem that prioritizes fast compiles and a fast feedback loop dev experience. i.e. Go.</li>
<li>Keep your tests fast from day one.</li>
<li>Do not preoptimize for microservices. Don’t over-engineer your code to work like an SOA. If you follow the first two points of advice, you may never have to go there at all. Boundaries are great, so theres a lot of gray area here, but I think its important to keep things <a href="https://atomkirk.com/2020-12-04-simple-as-possible-as-long-as-possible/">as simple as possible as long as possible</a>.</li>

            <p><strong>Dec 9, 2020</strong></p>
            
            <p>It turns out that sales tax has a huge, gigantic, terrible flaw: It punishes specialized businesses. A value added tax (VAT) has no such problems.</p>

<p>The US has sales tax. Most of the planet has VAT.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/VAT_map_updated.png" alt="VAT map"></p>

<p>Maybe it’s not the most important issue in the world, but it’s just so <em>clear</em>. Sales tax is dumb and VAT is better.</p>



<p>Many people apparently believe that in the US today, sales tax is only paid by final consumers. <strong><a href="https://www.cost.org/globalassets/cost/state-tax-resources-pdf-pages/cost-studies-articles-reports/1903-3073001_cost-ey-sales-tax-on-business-inputs-study_final-5-16.pdf">THIS IS FALSE</a></strong>. It varies hugely by state, but the current situation is a hybrid between a “pure final retail consumer only” sales tax and what the toy model below describes. You can debate if it’s “sales tax” or “gross receipts tax” or whatever, but it’s a fact that <em>businesses pay tax on business inputs</em> all the time. You can find proof of this <a href="https://www.cost.org/globalassets/cost/state-tax-resources-pdf-pages/cost-studies-articles-reports/1903-3073001_cost-ey-sales-tax-on-business-inputs-study_final-5-16.pdf">here</a> or <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/documents/standcomm/sccomfc/Business-Inputs-Study.pdf">here</a> or <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/41788786">here</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_receipts_tax#United_States">here</a>.</p>

<p>I emphasize that the explanation below is a toy illustration. The US tax code isn’t <i>nearly</i> this bad. But the flaw described <i>does</i> exist. I beg you: <strong><a href="https://www.cost.org/globalassets/cost/state-tax-resources-pdf-pages/cost-studies-articles-reports/1903-3073001_cost-ey-sales-tax-on-business-inputs-study_final-5-16.pdf">IF YOU THINK THE US DOESN’T HAVE TAXES WITH THE FLAW DESCRIBED BELOW PLEASE READ THIS LINK. SO FAR I AM NOT AWARE OF ANYONE WHO HAS READ THIS YET CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT.</a></strong></p>

<p>OK, let’s continue.</p>



<p>Say you decide to get into the decorative <a href="https://dyno-might.github.io/2020/12/09/sales-tax-creates-more-unnecessary-pain-than-value-added-tax/(https://dyno-might.github.io/2020/09/11/comparative-advantage-and-when-to-blow-up-your-island/)">coconut</a> manufacturing business.</p>

<p>You’re good at painting coconuts. You find a friend who is good at picking them, and another who’s good at making coconut paint. You find a third friend who’s a genius with applying finishing lacquer and a fourth who runs a store.</p>

<p>You buy coconuts and paint, apply the paint, then sell to the finisher. He applies lacquer and sells to a retailer.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/supply_chain.png" alt="supply chain"></p>

<p>After negotiating prices, you settle on $1 for a raw coconut, $1 for a coconut’s worth of paint, $3 for a painted coconut, $4 for a finished coconut, and $5 retail. This works out to everyone making $1 of profit.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/market.png" alt="market"></p>

<p>Here’s a table showing the accounts:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Item</th>
      <th>Cost of inputs</th>
      <th>Profit</th>
      <th>Price</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Raw coconuts</td>
      <td>$0</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Paint</td>
      <td>$0</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Painted coconut</td>
      <td>$2 (raw coconut+paint)</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Finished coconut</td>
      <td>$3 (painted coconut)</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Retail coconut</td>
      <td>$4 (finished coconut)</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$5</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>



<p>For a while, everything runs beautifully. Every day you wake eager to help capture more beauty in coconut form — and then the government announces a 20% sales tax. Whenever you sell something, you need to pay 20% of the sale price to the government.</p>

<p>You talk it over. Everyone feels they still deserve to make the same $1 profit as before. Since you now pay $1.20 for a raw coconut and $1.20 for paint, you need to mark up to $3.40 before tax, and $4.08 after.</p>

<p>After everyone marks up their prices in this way, here are the results:</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/sales_tax.png" alt="sales tax"></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Item</th>
      <th>Cost of inputs</th>
      <th>Profit</th>
      <th>Price</th>
      <th>Price after tax</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Raw coconut</td>
      <td>$0</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$1.2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Paint</td>
      <td>$0</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$1.2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Painted coconut</td>
      <td>$2.4</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$3.40</td>
      <td>$4.08</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Finished coconut</td>
      <td>$4.08</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$5.08</td>
      <td>$6.10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Retail coconut</td>
      <td>$6.10</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$7.10</td>
      <td>$8.52</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Your customers aren’t thrilled about the increase in price, but what are they going to do — live <em>without</em> painted coconuts? So they pay the higher price, the government gets its tax, and life continues.</p>



<p>A few months later, your unscrupulous  cousin hears about your business. He’s the jealous type and decides to try stealing your customers. He opens a store and finds four friends to help make coconuts. Unlike you, however, he hires everyone as <em>employees</em>. He sells the coconuts for $6 ($5 plus tax) and gives everyone $1 per coconut in wages.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/integrated2.png" alt="integrated"></p>

<p>Your cousin and friends don’t appreciate the subtle art of coconut decoration. Everyone agrees yours are better but they start to complain: Why are you charging $8.52 when a slightly worse product is available for only $6? Slowly, your loyal customers drift away and you go out of business.</p>

<p>How could this happen? Your team was asking for the same profit while doing a better job! Yet everyone is left with your cousin’s knock-off coconuts.</p>



<p>Suppose the government had instead announced a 20% VAT. With a VAT, whenever you sell something, you only pay tax on the sale price <em>minus the price of the stuff you bought to make it</em>.</p>

<p>As before, you’ll need to pay $1.20 for raw coconuts and $1.20 paint. You charge $3.40 for painted coconuts, now you’re only taxed on the profit of $3.40-$2.40=$1.00. The price with tax is now $3.60.</p>

<p>Here are the final prices as they go through through the system. Everyone is making a profit of $1, so everyone pays a tax of $0.20.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/vat.png" alt="vat"></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Item</th>
      <th>Cost of inputs</th>
      <th>Profit</th>
      <th>Price</th>
      <th>Price after tax</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Raw coconut</td>
      <td>$0</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$1.2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Paint</td>
      <td>$0</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$1.2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Painted coconut</td>
      <td>$2.4</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$3.40</td>
      <td>$3.60</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Finished coconut</td>
      <td>$3.60</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$4.60</td>
      <td>$4.80</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Retail coconut</td>
      <td>$4.80</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$5.80</td>
      <td>$6.00</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The final price is $6.00. Since your coconuts are better, your cousin won’t be able to drive you out of business with his low-grade stuff.</p>



<p>What happened? Your cousin created a <em>vertically integrated</em> business. A sales tax is collected every time someone buys something. If you just do it yourself, no tax is collected.</p>

<p>Are vertically integrated businesses bad? Not necessarily.</p>

<p>However, take your chain of independent independent artisans making and selling coconut products. Imagine someone invents a paint that customers prefer. You almost <em>have</em> to switch, or some other painter will drive you out of business. Contrast this with cousin’s integrated business making all coconuts. In theory, the inventor could convince your cousin to hire him or license the paint process. If he won’t be convinced, the only way for that paint to get to customers is if the inventor develops an entire independent coconut manufacturing chain. Vertical integration means there are price signals at fewer points during production, which tends to make it harder for innovations to thrive.</p>

<p>There are times where vertical integration is better. (If everyone is independent, a lot of time is spent on negotiations!) That’s perfectly fine. What we <em>don’t</em> want is to artificially encourage vertical integration even when it’s less efficient, which sales tax does.</p>



<p>Another advantage of the VAT is it tends to be easier to enforce. When I sell something, I need to provide certificates proving I paid VAT on my inputs. This gives everyone an incentive to ensure compliance in the previous layer of the chain. With a sales tax, the government needs to watch every single transaction.</p>

<p>Of course, people know sales tax is distortionary. Many exceptions exist to minimize the worst distortions. For example, a retailer usually won’t pay sales tax on a manufactured good they intend to a consumer in the same form. Without this exception, we’d probably have a crazy economy where manufacterers sell directly to consumers. The messy patchwork of exceptions reduces the problems with sales tax but doesn’t eliminate them.</p>

<p>I think there are two major reasons to oppose replacing sales tax with VAT. The first is a Leninist “worse is better” attitude. If you think <em>all taxes are bad</em> then you’d want to keep them painful and visible so people will be maximally annoyed by them. The second is that VAT is complicated to administer, particularly when sales tax can be different in each local area. This might be true, but I find it a bit hard to believe. VAT is more self-enforcing and sales taxes are <em>already</em> a nightmare, particularly for anyone selling to different cities/states. If we’re keeping the sales tax to keep things simple, where’s the payoff?</p>

  <li>The initial map is based on Wikipedia, but found that many places (<a href="https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/thailand/corporate/other-taxes">Thailand</a>, <a href="https://home.kpmg/us/en/home/insights/2020/05/tnf-saudi-arabia-vat-rate-to-increase-to-15-percent-covid-19.html">Saudi Arabia</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_Iran#Value_added_tax_(VAT)">Iran</a>, <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/om/en/pages/tax/articles/oman-to-implement-vat-from-2021.html">Oman</a>, <a href="https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/finance-and-investment/taxation/valueaddedtaxvat">UAE</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kuwait-economy-tax-idUSKCN1IG0OW">Kuwait</a>, <a href="https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report-international/insight-early-days-for-angola-value-added-tax">Angola</a>, <a href="https://www.avalara.com/vatlive/en/vat-news/liberia-to-introduce-vat-2019.html">Liberia</a>) have recently implemented VAT. I checked that most of the others (<a href="https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/jordan/corporate/other-taxes">Jordan</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_Greenland">Greenland</a>, <a href="https://www.tradecommissioner.gc.ca/france/market-facts-faits-sur-le-marche/7685.aspx?lang=eng#valuetax">French Guinana</a>, <a href="https://www.nordeatrade.com/en/explore-new-market/cuba/taxes">Cuba</a>, <a href="https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/libya/individual/other-taxes">Libya</a>, Hong Hong) still do not have a VAT.</li>
  <li>To be sure, if you could implement a sales tax that only applied to final consumers, that would be economically equivalent to VAT. Is that how state taxes work in the US? It’s hard to make simple generalizations because (1) it’s sometimes hard to say what a “final consumer” is (2) there are different laws in each state and (3) the relevant tax is sometimes called a “gross receipts” tax. The important question is: <strong>Does the US have taxes on intermediate products</strong> that “cascade” like described in the above model? The answer to that question is <a href="https://www.cost.org/globalassets/cost/state-tax-resources-pdf-pages/cost-studies-articles-reports/1903-3073001_cost-ey-sales-tax-on-business-inputs-study_final-5-16.pdf">YES</a>.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Historically, development teams and operations teams have been at odds.<br></p><p>Development teams wanted to add slick new features to products. Operations teams wanted to make sure these features didn’t cause dysfunction.<br></p><p>This began to change in 2003 when software engineer Benjamin Treynor invented site reliability engineering (SRE) while working at Google. He made his software engineering team responsible for some ops tasks, creating the concept of SRE and helping to resolve issues between development and operations.</p><h2>How does SRE work?</h2><p>SRE is performed by site reliability engineers, also known as service reliability engineers. These professionals are typically software developers who have gained some operations experience. They can also be IT professionals who have development skills.<br></p><p>SRE teams set service-level agreements (SLAs) for each service in a system. The SLAs define the system’s required reliability, helping teams figure out which features they can implement.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Within each SLA are service-level indicators (SLIs) and service-level objectives (SLOs).<br></p><p>SLIs are metrics that measure a specific aspect of a service level. Examples of SLIs you might want to monitor could be availability, error rate, or system throughput.<br></p><p>An SLO is simply the target you want to hit for an SLI. For example, you might shoot for a 99.9% availability over the course of a year.<br></p><p>The difference is the downtime level. The downtime level is known as the “error-budget,” which is the maximum amount of error allowed in the system.&nbsp;<br></p><p>By acknowledging the error is inevitable, you can then plan for the errors, making it easier for the development team to release new features. See, the development team can release whatever features they want—whenever they want—as long as they stay within the error budget. As soon as they step outside of it, they must reign in errors before moving forward with new features.<br></p><p>A vital part of an SRE’s work is automation. SREs often have to automate away repetitive manual tasks, called “toil,” so they can focus on long-term, value-adding work. <a href="https://www.getcortexapp.com/post/understanding-kubernetes">Kubernetes</a> can be helpful with this.</p><h2>DevOps vs. SRE</h2><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/">DevOps</a> is a philosophy and set of practices that combines software development and IT operations. It consists of <a href="https://www.overops.com/blog/devops-vs-sre-whats-the-difference-between-them-and-which-one-are-you/">five pillars</a>. Google defines these pillars as:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Reducing organizational silos</li><li>Accepting failure as normal</li><li>Implementing gradual changes</li><li>Leveraging tooling and automation</li><li>Measuring everything<br></li></ul><p>If DevOps is the “what,” SRE is the “how.” It’s simply an implementation of the DevOps philosophy. In fact, SRE meets all five pillars of DevOps:<br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Reducing organizational silos:</strong> SREs share ownership with the developers, and they use the same tools and techniques.</li><li><strong>Accepting failure as normal:</strong> SREs quantify failure using SLIs and SLOs. They assume that errors will happen, but set a maximum allowable amount to balance failure against new releases.</li><li><strong>Implementing gradual changes:</strong> SREs encourage smaller, more iterative deployments of new features in order to reduce the cost of failure.</li><li><strong>Leveraging tooling and automation:</strong> SREs automate away manual tasks, as mentioned above.</li><li><strong>Measuring everything:</strong> SREs use metrics (SLIs) to quantify service levels. Consequently, they can keep errors down.</li></ul><h2>Benefits of SRE</h2><p>Let’s take a look at a few of the ways SRE can offer some major advantages to your organization.&nbsp;</p><h3>Provides clear metrics</h3><p>Clear metrics allow SRE teams to highlight areas of improvement, such as reducing security vulnerabilities.<br></p><p>SRE teams can also use metrics to calculate impact in other areas, such as revenue. For example, they could look at how much revenue they lose per minute of downtime.</p><h3>Improves code</h3><p>The development and SRE teams share the same talent pool. If the development team writes poor code, more talent is allocated to the SREs to fix these issues—leaving fewer people available for the development team.<br></p><p>As a result, the development team is incentivized to write better code. When their code works well, they could gain more teammates, bringing them the resources they need to create better features.</p><h3>Frees up time and resources to add value</h3><p>Better code, fewer bugs, and more efficiency creates more time to add value to the product.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The developers can create better and more exciting features that are less likely to cause problems. On the other side, operations can spend more time testing and performing upkeep.<br></p><p>Put these together, and you have a better product for the customer.</p><h2>The bottom line</h2><p>SRE is quickly taking hold as an essential part of many organizations. It can help close the gap between operations and development. Consequently, you can deliver better applications faster—without sacrificing the reliability of those applications.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Cortex can help your SRE team track service quality better so they can find more areas where service can be improved.<a href="https://www.getcortexapp.com/"> Schedule your demo today</a> to learn more about what we can do.</p></div></div>]]>

    <article>

        

        <section>

            <p>I think we, as a profession, shot ourselves in the foot when we coined the term <em>tech debt</em>. This <a href="https://daverupert.com/2020/11/technical-debt-as-a-lack-of-understanding/">recent post</a> (though my browser’s search bar found no less than 3 recent articles I read on the subject in Hacker News) got me thinking that the term tech debt is an exercise in bad marketing.</p>

<p>Debt is evil. It’s the stuff that can <a href="https://money.com/student-loan-forgiveness-death-discharge/">live on</a> longer than you do. There’s never been an instance where calling something “debt” elicited a positive response. So why do we tell our Product Managers we have to <em>tackle</em> tech debt?</p>

<p>Is it to create urgency? I hope not. Everyone believes their priorities are the most important priorities. So an engineer’s tech debt will never seem more important than a PM’s product backlog.</p>

<p>Is it to create gravity around the seriousness of the work involved? Then why is it that PMs always bucket “20% time” for making room for tech debt that is never fully paid off?</p>

<p>I loved this analogy I saw on Hacker News about this concept:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you run a commercial kitchen and you only ever cook food, because selling cooked food is your business – if you never clean the dishes, never scrape the grill, never organize the freezer – the health inspector will shut your shit down pretty quickly.</p>

  <p>Software, on the other hand, doesn’t have health inspectors. It has kitchen staff who become more alarmed over time at the state of the kitchen they’re working in every day, and if nothing is done about it, there will come a point where the kitchen starts failing to produce edible meals.</p>

  <p>Generally, you can either convince decision makers that cleaning the kitchen is more profitable in the long run or you can dust off your resume and get out before it burns down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the flip side, if you ever have the luxury of getting ahead of your technical debt then you can contribute things called <a href="https://www.stillbreathing.co.uk/2016/10/13/technical-credit">technical credits</a>. As you can imagine, technical credits are the opposite of tech debt: things that <em>pay dividends</em> to your code rather than incur a cost and drag it down. <a href="https://gomakethings.com/progressive-enhancement-graceful-degradation-and-asynchronously-loading-css/">Progressive enhancement</a> is touted as an example of technical credit.</p>

<p>Marrying these two concepts, I actually think a way around the horrible marketing of tech debt can be resolved with Agile terminology that is already familiar to our product-positive counterparts: <strong>engineering-driving work.</strong></p>

<h2 id="engineering-driven-work-over-tech-debt">Engineering-driven work over tech debt</h2>

<p>At the end of the day, whether they be debt or credit, the work engineers want to accomplish to make their code better is something personal to them and them alone. Similarly, your product team has their own vision of what your code can become for your customers. So if we segment on the <em>owner</em> instead of the <em>outcome</em> we remove the negative connotations of the work involved.</p>

<p>On my teams, we make this distinction painfully simple in Jira:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Was the work engineering-driven?</strong> Create a task.</li>
  <li><strong>Was the work product-driven?</strong> Create a story; use sub-tasks to create the work the engineers will do to complete that story.</li>
</ol>

<p>Everything lives on the same playing field and is up for grabs to assign priority. So rather than bucket 20% time for debt, if all engineering-driven tasks (whether they be credits, debts, or something else) are the most important work to be done this week, they take up 100% of the sprint. Similarly, if product’s work is the most important, it can dominate or completely own a sprint.</p>

<p>The important thing is that <strong>the owner of the ticket sells why their work should be as important as it is</strong>. If you can’t sell why a critical security upgrade is vital to the health of your application then you need to learn how to sell and influence others. But then again, you might think that switching from Formik to React Hook Forms would be awesome but if it’s based on personal bias and no tangible value creation for developer productivity you’re dead on arrival.</p>

<p>So I encourage all of my engineers to read sales books. Learn how to sell and influence others. Convincing someone that what you want to do matters is a much better message than starting things off on the wrong foot by calling your work debt that needs to be repaid. Debt makes people wince. Creating value makes people smile. Paying down tech debt adds value so lead with that and focus on why your work is important instead of giving it the Scarlet Letter from the onset.</p>

<p><span><strong>Preface to the third edition</strong></span></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 7">
<div>
<div>
<p>No extensive changes have been made in this edition. The most important are in §§ 80–82, which I have rewritten in accordance with suggestions made by Mr S. Pollard.</p>
<p>The earlier editions contained no satisfactory account of the genesis of the circular functions. I have made some attempt to meet this objection in § 158 and Appendix III. Appendix IV is also an addition.</p>
<p>It is curious to note how the character of the criticisms I have had to meet has changed. I was too meticulous and pedantic for my pupils of fifteen years ago: I am altogether too popular for the Trinity scholar of to-day. I need hardly say that I find such criticisms very gratifying, as the best evidence that the book has to some extent fulfilled the purpose with which it was written.</p>

<div>
<p><span><strong>Extract from the preface to the second edition</strong></span></p>
<p>The principal changes made in this edition are as follows. I have inserted in Chapter I a sketch of Dedekind’s theory of real numbers, and a proof of Weierstrass’s theorem concerning points of condensation; in Chapter IV an account of ‘limits of indetermination’ and the ‘general principle of convergence’; in Chapter V a proof of the ‘Heine-Borel Theorem’, Heine’s theorem concerning uniform continuity, and the fundamental theorem concerning implicit functions; in Chapter VI some additional matter concerning the integration of algebraical functions; and in Chapter VII a section on differentials. I have also rewritten in a more general form the sections which deal with the definition of the definite integral. In order to find space for these insertions I have deleted a good deal of the analytical geometry and formal trigonometry contained in Chapters II and III of the first edition. These changes have naturally involved a large number of minor alterations.</p>

<p><em>October</em> 1914</p>
<p><span><strong>Extract from the preface to the first edition</strong></span></p>
<p>This book has been designed primarily for the use of first year students at the Universities whose abilities reach or approach something like what is usually described as ‘scholarship standard’. I hope that it may be useful to other classes of readers, but it is this class whose wants I have considered first. It is in any case a book for mathematicians: I have nowhere made any attempt to meet the needs of students of engineering or indeed any class of students whose interests are not primarily mathematical.</p>
<p>I regard the book as being really elementary. There are plenty of hard examples (mainly at the ends of the chapters): to these I have added, wherever space permitted, an outline of the solution. But I have done my best to avoid the inclusion of anything that involves really difficult ideas. For instance, I make no use of the `principle of convergence’: uniform convergence, double series, infinite products, are never alluded to: and I prove no general theorems whatever concerning the inversion of limit-operations—I never even define $\dfrac{\partial^{2} f}{\partial x\, \partial y}$ and $\dfrac{\partial^{2} f}{\partial y\, \partial x}$. In the last two chapters I have occasion once or twice to integrate a power-series, but I have confined myself to the very simplest cases and given a special discussion in each instance. Anyone who has read this book will be in a position to read with profit Dr Bromwich’s <em>Infinite Series</em>, where a full and adequate discussion of all these<br>
points will be found.</p>

December 9, 2020 | https://www.khanna.law/blog/using-tailwind-ui-and-next-js-together | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.khanna.law/blog/using-tailwind-ui-and-next-js-together">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><em>This process has gotten much easier with the <a href="https://blog.tailwindcss.com/tailwindcss-v2">release of TailwindCSS 2.0</a>. These instructions have been updated to reflect the installation process for TailwindCSS 2.0 and Next.js 10.</em></p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> is an incredible framework for building server-side React applications. <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a> is a utility-first CSS framework that makes designing and building websites a breeze. And <a href="https://tailwindui.com/">Tailwind UI</a> is a commercial set of pre-baked components made in Tailwind CSS by two incredible designers, Adam Wathan and Steve Schoger. Using these tools together, I can develop whole web applications that look beautiful, from scratch, in record time.</p>
<p>To figure out the right way to set them up together, I pulled the relevant pieces of documentation from each of Next.js, Tailwind CSS and Tailwind UI and synthesized them into this guide. I reference and link to those parts of documentation where appropriate.</p>
<ol>
<li>Set up Next.js with Tailwind CSS in development</li>
<li>Add Tailwind UI</li>
<li>Optimize for production with PurgeCSS</li>
</ol>
<h2>1. Set Up Next.js and Tailwind CSS in Development</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs">Next.js-specific TailwindCSS installation instructions</a> do an excellent job of getting you setup with both of these in a project. Complete the steps there and come back here when you're done.</p>
<p>Confirm it works by running <code>npm run dev</code> and navigating in your browser to <code>localhost:3000</code>, where you should see a page that looks something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.khanna.law/assets/blog/using-tailwind-ui-and-next-js-together/next-js-screenshot.png" alt="Next.js Default Page"></p>
<p>Edit <code>pages/index.js</code> to use some Tailwind CSS classes to make sure its working:</p>
<pre><code>// pages/index.js
import Head from 'next/head'

export default function Home() {
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;Head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Next.js TailwindCSS&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico"/&gt;
      &lt;/Head&gt;

      &lt;div className="container mx-auto"&gt;
        &lt;h1 className="text-lg text-center m-4"&gt;TailwindUI/Next.js&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p className="bg-green-600"&gt;This is a test of the tailwind next integration.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  )
}
</code></pre>
<p>If Next.js has put a <code>Home.module.css</code> file in the <code>styles/</code> directory, you should delete that since that file just has the styling for the Next.js example page and should not be used anymore.</p>
<p>If it doesn't look like it working, you may need to stop the Next.js dev server and restart it because it may not pick up the changes to the <code>postcss.config.js</code> file unless you do a manual restart.</p>
<p>If you're still stuck, Next.js publishes an <a href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-tailwindcss">example app with Tailwind CSS</a> so you can see how your matches up.</p>
<p>One thing that may have noticed that may throw you off is that since this process creates a <code>postcss.config.js</code> file, it <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/customizing-postcss-config">completely overwrites the implicit defaults used by Next.js</a>. On first glance, the defaults have a lot of stuff in it like <code>postcss-flexbox-fixes</code> and <code>postcss-preset-env</code> along with some configuration that we seem to have ignored. This is intentional.</p>
<p>Since by and large you won't be using CSS directly but will be using Tailwind CSS utility classes, you don't need that stuff and can just use the minimal <code>postcss.config.js</code> config from above.</p>
<h2>2. Add Tailwind UI</h2>
<p>The newest version of TailwindCSS and TailwindUI doesn't specifically require you to install TailwindUI-specific packages until you encounter that requirement by a particular TailwindUI component. For example, if you encounter a component that requires the <code>@tailwindcss/forms</code> plugin, you'll need to install it in your project with a <code>npm install --save @tailwindcss/forms</code> before you can use it.</p>
<p>There are some general and React-specific tips and tricks in the <a href="https://tailwindui.com/documentation">TailwindUI documentation</a>.</p>
<p>If things don't seem to be working and you've installed a new package or updated your <code>tailwind.config.js</code> file, you may need to stop and restart the Next.js dev server for it to pick up the changes.</p>
<p>If you are going to use the recommended <code>Inter var</code> font <a href="https://tailwindui.com/documentation#optional-add-the-inter-font-family">recommended by the TailwindUI documentation</a>, you'll need to put the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag that it suggests in the <code>index.js</code> file <code>&lt;Head&gt;</code> tag:</p>
<pre><code>...
&lt;Head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Next.js TailwindCSS&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" /&gt;
  &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://rsms.me/inter/inter.css" /&gt;
&lt;/Head&gt;
...
</code></pre>
<p>To test that Tailwind UI is working properly, in <code>pages/index.js</code>, copy and paste in an element that does not have any Javascript (e.g., the Marketing Blog Section component).</p>
<p>You may need find-and-replace the <code>class</code> attribute to <code>className</code> if your IDE doesn't do this for your automatically.</p>
<p>That's it! Integrating TailwindUI with Next.js has gotten much simpler since TailwindCSS 2.0 arrived on the scene.</p></div></div></div>]]>

December 9, 2020 | https://www.pythonstacks.com/blog/generating-realtime-weather-data-python/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.pythonstacks.com/blog/generating-realtime-weather-data-python/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>In this short tutorial, you will learn to obtain the realtime/current weather conditions of any city in python. We are going to make use of the weather API from <a href="https://www.weatherapi.com/" target="_blank"><span>www.weatherapi.com</span></a>.</p>

<p>WeatherAPI is a service that provides weather data, including realtime weather data, forecasts, and historical data to developers for use in applications and other services.</p>

<p>Before using their API, you have to signup for a free account and generate an API key. You will need the API key for accessing their service.</p>

<p>We will use the Python Requests module for accessing the API. If you are not familiar with Requests, checkout Introduction to <a href="https://www.pythonstacks.com/blog/making-requests-python-requests-library/">Python's Requests library</a>.</p>

<p>Install the requests module by running:</p>

<pre><code>pip install requests</code></pre>



<h2>Retrieving the Current weather data</h2>

<p>Before we make the request, first we will create these variables:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p><code>base_url </code>, which stores the API's URL which is <span>http://api.weatherapi.com/v1.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><code>api_key</code>, stores your API key</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><code>city</code>, the city whose weather data is needed.</p>
	</li>
</ol>



<pre><code>import requests

api_key = "your_API_key"
base_url = "http://api.weatherapi.com/v1"
city = "london"

parameters = {"key":api_key, "q":city}         # URL parameters
r = requests.get(f"{base_url}/current.json", params=parameters)

data = r.json()         # retrieve the json data

print(data)</code></pre>

                <p>Today, we were informed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) that the agency has been subject to a cyber attack and that some documents relating to the regulatory submission for Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, BNT162b2, which has been stored on an EMA server, had been unlawfully accessed. It is important to note that no BioNTech or Pfizer systems have been breached in connection with this incident and we are unaware that any study participants have been identified through the data being accessed. At this time, we await further information about EMA’s investigation and will respond appropriately and in accordance with EU law. EMA has assured us that the cyber attack will have no impact on the timeline for its review.</p>

<p>Given the critical public health considerations and the importance of transparency, we continue to provide clarity around all aspects of the vaccine development and regulatory processes. Our focus remains steadfast on working in close partnership with governments and regulators to bring our COVID-19 vaccine to people around the globe as safely and as efficiently as possible to help bring an end to this devastating pandemic.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>The release of Apple M1 Silicon has laid to rest many questions about whether ARM CPUs can go toe-to-toe with the best of the bunch from Intel and AMD. The question now is not whether ARM chips can perform better than Intel/AMD but whether others can build similarly powerful ARM CPUs. Today, companies like Marvell, Ampere and AWS are shipping ARM CPUs that keep getting better with each generation and close to the level of performance of top-end X86 CPUs. It only feels like a matter of time before ARM CPUs will provide tough competition to the X86 CPUs from Intel and AMD. This feels a bit like standing on the Florida coast and watching the first bands of a hurricane arrive. This reminds me of the iconic scene in the movie “The Dark Knight Rises” when Selina Kyle (<em>Catwoman</em>) tells Bruce Wayne (<em>Batman</em>) that there’s a storm (<em>Bane</em>) coming. The full dialogue goes something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Selina Kyle (Catwoman): There’s a storm coming, Mr. Wayne. You and your friends better batten down the hatches, because when it hits, you’re all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little for the rest of us.</p>
<p><em>—The Dark Knight Rises (2012)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you read between the lines, there are many parallels that you can draw from the characterization in the movie to real life.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Batman and Catwoman are frenemies, which is not much different from Intel and AMD’s relationship. They are often competitors, just like Batman &amp; Catwoman. Still, they managed to work together once and ship this baby - <a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/130409/intel-core-i7-8809g-processor-with-radeon-rx-vega-m-gh-graphics-8m-cache-up-to-4-20-ghz.html">Intel® Core i7-8809G</a> - a rare Intel CPU with AMD integrated graphics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intel has dominated a large part of the CPU market’s profits for a very long time. In contrast, everyone else has had to contend with using lower cost as a vector to compete against Intel’s hegemony. For e.g. <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/02/05/amd-gained-share-against-intel-in-x86-processor-market-in-q4/">Intel dominates about 95.5% of the server chip market</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(<em>SPOILER ALERT</em>)</strong> Selina ends up joining up with Bane by giving up Batman. This might be very similar to the rumors that AMD is planning its own ARM CPUs in real life.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">AMD has an M1 competitor in prototype stages, one version with integrated RAM, and one without it<br>he said "almost ready"<br>but -imo- idk<br>leak is only a few days old, the chip idk</p>— Mauri QHD (@MauriQHD) <a href="https://twitter.com/MauriQHD/status/1332601734565416962?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2020</a></blockquote>

</li>
</ol>

<p>Apple Silicon M1 has taken the CPU market by storm and, in doing so, answered every doubt whether it can compete with the best of the best. The M1 is currently sitting at the top of Geekbench’s <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/mac-benchmarks">single-core throne</a>, all while using less power than competing CPUs. The M1 has completely reset the Performance per Watt expectations. It’s even more astonishing to think that as Apple has introduced the M1 for only the lowest-end Macs, this is the slowest SoC that Apple will ever make (<em>for Macs</em>). Based on Apple’s history of consistently delivering year-over-year performance improvements, the follow-ups to the M1 will likely improve upon the current single-core performance very rapidly. It is not clear whether Intel and AMD have something in the pipeline that could shift the balance back in X86’s favor.</p>

<p><strong>Nuvia</strong> is a startup founded in early 2019 that is building an ARM CPU for the server market. The company was founded by John Bruno, Manu Gulati, and Gerard Williams III. They bring a breadth of experience in system engineering and silicon design for more than 20 chips and more than 100 patents. Nuvia’s leadership team holds an impressive resume with various architect and leadership roles at Google, Apple, ARM, Broadcom, and AMD (<a href="https://nuviainc.com/leadership"><em>See here for the leadership team’s full details</em></a>). It is quite possible that Nuvia’s leadership was involved with the previous Apple Silicon designs and bring with them the ideas and strategies that have made Apple’s chips a market-leader.</p>
<p>Here is <a href="https://medium.com/silicon-reimagined/performance-delivered-a-new-way-8f0f5ed283d5">more on Nuvia’s design goals and philosophy</a> (<em><strong>emphasis</strong> on key talking points mine</em>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our focus at NUVIA is to develop an SoC that will deliver industry-leading performance with the highest levels of efficiency, at the same time. To do this, <strong>we are creating a server CPU that is built in a new way, with a complete overhaul of the CPU pipeline</strong>. Our first-generation CPU, code-named “<strong>Phoenix</strong>” will be a custom core based on the ARM architecture and central to our “<strong>Orion</strong>” SoC.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With X86 solutions claiming most of the market, only a small percentage of niche customers are willing to accept a lower per-core performance, high core count product. Arguably the most successful ARM-based design today is Amazon’s Graviton. Graviton is a captive design, aimed solely for a limited portion of AWS that values cost over performance. While there will likely be additional growth in this area, <strong>the heart of the market clearly demands the highest single-thread performance at TDP and the highest all-core performance at TDP</strong>. This is the fastest way to improve Performance/TCO for the most demanding hyperscale customers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>While these new entrant’s products show improvements, they still fall short of disrupting their X86 incumbents. At NUVIA, we are taking a different approach, with a clean-sheet CPU design that will deliver an elegant balance of performance leadership and power efficiency that maximizes memory bandwidth and core utilization. <strong>Our solution does not need to add extraneous cores to try and make up for a single-threaded performance deficit</strong>. Also, there would be <strong>no need to employ marketing-inflated boost clocks</strong> that are not achievable in any real-world applications of server SoCs, due to running into TDP constraints. In real-world scenarios, server SoCs are designed to be heavily loaded to make the best use of the capitalized hardware and allocated power and cooling budgets. The optimal solution is one where a workload finishes in the shortest time possible while consuming the least possible power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve highlighted the key design goals, but the gist of it is that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nuvia is likely working on a custom ARM design like Apple rather than reusing ARM’s reference architecture like some other ARM licensees.</li>
<li>The goal is the highest single-thread performance possible without the use of boost or turbo clocks.</li>
</ol>

<p>Nuvia recently <a href="https://medium.com/silicon-reimagined/performance-delivered-a-new-way-8f0f5ed283d5">published their findings</a> on how their Phoenix CPU fares against the latest X86 and ARM CPUs. Here are the systems that were tested:</p>

</table>
<p>The reasons for choosing these CPUs were as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The devices tested demonstrate the current state of the art from the majority of the major players, both ARM and X86 based platforms. Intel’s Core i7–1068NG7 Ice Lake based SoC is the highest performance variant currently available utilizing the new Sunny Cove CPU microarchitecture, based on Intel’s 10nm process node. We are also assuming that Intel’s next-generation Ice Lake Server will utilize a CPU core built upon a similar base architecture as Sunny Cove. The Intel Core i7–8750H is the last generation of the Skylake microarchitecture and is more closely related to the CPU core shipping in today’s latest Xeon processors. AMD’s Ryzen 4700U utilizes the latest Zen 2 CPU core on TSMC’s 7nm process node. AMD uses the same Zen 2 CPU core within the CCX chiplet in the Rome EPYC family of processors. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 865 utilizes ARM’s latest A77 as its performance core and is implemented on TSMC’s 7nm process node. The latest announced Ampere Altra and Amazon Graviton 2 both use an ARM N1 CPU core that is more closely related to the older A76, and both are built upon TSMC’s 7nm process node. Lastly, the Apple A13 and A12Z demonstrate the current fastest ARM-based processors, also both built upon TSMC’s 7nm process node.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nuvia released the expected single-core Performance-Per-Watt curve of their upcoming CPU. To get an idea of how this ranks against the M1, I’ve added the <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/5197838">single-core Geekbench score for M1 based Mac Mini</a> to Nuvia’s graph. Nuvia is not disclosing the actual score, just giving estimates for now. The actual scores will be released at a later date. My best estimate based on their current projections is that these are higher than Apple M1’s single-core score. Based on the posted graph, I would put the single-core score between <strong>1900</strong> to <strong>2250</strong> range which is about a <strong>10-30%</strong> improvement on single-core performance.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-read-these-results">How to read these results?</h3>
<p>From Nuvia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When measured against current products available in-market in the 1W-4.5W power envelope (<em>per core</em>), the Phoenix CPU core performs up to 2X faster than the competition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 2X claim should now change since the results were published in August before the Apple M1 and the Zen 3 launch. These products now have higher single-core performance than the products Nuvia tested.</p>
<p>Nuvia did, however, expect such a scenario:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We realize the companies we have measured against in these tests are not standing still and will have new products in the market over the next 18 months. That said, we believe that even with significant performance gains (20%+) with new CPU architectures, we will continue to hold a clear position of leadership in performance-per-watt.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-nuvia-focusing-on-this-1w-45w-per-core-power-envelope">Why is Nuvia focusing on this 1W-4.5W per core power envelope?</h3>
<p>I’ll let Nuvia answer this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All current and future flagship server SoCs are power constrained, very much like mobile SoCs. As core count increases, what is not increasing is the TDP. TDPs are likely going to remain in the 250W — 300W …</p></blockquote></div></div>

  				 <p>December 2020</p>

<p>If your product moves money on behalf of customers, and you manage the ledger, you need reconciliation. You can think of recon as the process of making sure every transaction in your system matches one in the external world. For every dollar you’ve moved, an external entity agrees with the amount and direction, and has provided “documentation” to that effect.</p>
<p>I’ve seen a few performant recon systems that came under stress as they scaled, and I’ve worked with startups at early enough stages that getting recon right was not existential. I’ve also never built a recon system from scratch. Everything I'll say here is from the perspective of a user of recon systems rather than a maker of them. I’ve been a customer of a couple, and their performance impacted my output so I have strong opinions about what I wish would exist. Since I'm not sure what a perfect recon system would look like, I'm writing this to flesh out the thought, and to smoke out anyone who already knows.</p>
<p>I’ve interacted with reconciliation systems aimed at two types of problems:</p>
<h2>Reconciliation of transactions</h2>
<p>Transaction oriented recon makes sure that some external party agrees with every money movement in your ledger. I saw this philosophy in the recon systems I interacted with at Cash App &amp; Square in general. In this model, the objective is to make sure that every money movement action matches your intention. This means the state of the transaction, the direction, and the amount are what you expect. A secondary objective is ensuring the timing matches your intention. This is secondary because in a lot of cases, the actual precise timing doesn't matter as long as it happens&nbsp; "soon", and as long as the underlying accounts aren’t run at a $0 balance. In this case reconciliation solves an accounting problem, ensuring money movements are correct. It also helps ensure that the company's receivables and payables are complete, is useful for regulatory &amp; financial audits, and empowers your treasury team to make good cash management decisions. I suspect most acquirers (Stripe, Square, Adyen, etc.) at least start by pursuing transaction oriented recon.</p>
<p>Typically in an acquiring world, you construct the “internal” ledger from the settlement/capture messages generated by the card networks. This is what product teams look at to inform customer facing features. You construct the “external” ledger from settlement files generated by the acquiring bank. Accounting teams look at the external ledger (technically accounting teams look at both ledgers, but product teams rarely look at the external ledger on an ongoing basis).</p>
<p>A recon system often includes an engineering team paired with an operations team, working together. In cases where the internal and external ledgers disagree, a human (on the ops team) reviews the data. They determine what’s causing the exception, whether it's systematic, how frequently it occurs, and what to do to fix it. The eng team continually optimizes the process to reduce the exception rate over time. Transaction oriented recon primarily solves accounting problems. You’re typically working towards SLAs designed for monthly/quarterly earnings close, and your outputs feed into income/cash flow statements.</p>
<h2>Reconciliation of balances</h2>
<p>Balance oriented recon ensures precise amounts in bank or customer accounts on a periodic basis. You use the same internal and external ledgers as in transaction oriented recon. However, you're comparing not only the amounts, state and direction of a transaction, but also its timing. This type of recon system can be useful for accounting, but is ideal for building systems that report a balance at a point in time. One example is a banking system of record. In the case of a system of record, a balance oriented recon system informs customer-facing balances and FDIC insurance.</p>
<p>Balance oriented recon systems are required for organizations that issue instruments and are the final source of truth for their own ledger. Most financial technology companies today rely on the ledgers managed by their infrastructure providers. For instance, if you issue cards, the banking as a service platform typically connects to the bank’s core, and most traditional bank cores have a balance oriented recon framework built in.</p>
<p>For context - in order to provide FDIC insurance to customers, banks are required to provide an auditable record of customer balances at any point in time. This is usually solved by being able to provide a daily snapshot of customer balances. This function is one of several provided by core processors, and as a result most core processors have a balance oriented recon process built in by default.</p>
<p>However if you’re the rare card issuer managing your own ledger (or really building any kind of financial product where you’re responsible for your own ledger, such as a digital wallet where you own the money transmission licenses), you’ll need to build a balance oriented recon system eventually. It's the way you’ll be sure you have the money that you’re telling customers you have.</p>
<h2>Common Problems in Recon</h2>
<h3>Adding a new money movement type to a single balance</h3>
<p>One overarching problem that affects all recon systems is what happens when new types of money movement impact a balance. For instance, imagine you run a digital wallet where your primary funding and cash-out transaction types are ACH debits and credits. Also, imagine you’ve built a perfect reconciliation system, with the combination of technology and human process that allows you to tie out balances and payments with zero failures (this is super unlikely). The moment you add payment cards as funding/cash out instruments, you now have a different external ledger to integrate with. It will have different edges than you're used to. You'll deal with potentially different organizations, who have different processes for resolving exceptions. No matter what you do, this will take time to get right, and long after your new feature is launched, you’ll probably discover new, undocumented quirks. Some of these quirks will only be clear when you’re processing money movements at scale. I’ve seen cases where the incorrect MID set with a card network resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars routed to the wrong (internal) account. Survivable error as the transactions were reconciled in aggregate, but bad for accounting and distraction caused to cross functional team members pulled in to swarm the problem.</p>
<h3>Timing differences between authorization and settlement</h3>
<p>For balance oriented reconciliation systems in particular, solving timing problems is critical. Timing problems typically occur when a) the payment authorization time and the settlement time are different, and your system’s not necessarily aware, b) you’re dealing with payment types where the settlement amount can be adjusted multiple times c) your ledger updates customers balances when a new payment authorization comes in, rather than a settlement message. In all these cases you’re grappling with a few questions (I don’t actually know the right answers to these):</p>
<ul>
<li>When should you update a customer’s balance? When you know there is a transaction (when the auth comes in) or when amount is finalized (when the settlement comes in)</li>
<li>When the authorization and settlement amounts are different, do you retroactively adjust the balance for the day the authorization came in? Or do you fix that in place and only adjust the balance with the delta on the day the settlement arrives?</li>
<li>Is your snapshot on a particular day immutable (i.e. it can never be adjusted) and if so, how do you handle changes in amounts between the authorization and the settlement?</li>
<li>Traditional core systems will have an available balance (which is how much you can access, with pending transaction amounts removed), and an account balance (which includes pending transactions, and is typically higher than the available balance).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Relying on aged systems for exception handling</h3>
<p>Very often you work with a wholesale bank whose systems are seasoned and handle the majority of exceptions using manual workflows. This can be frustrating; you’re faced with either adopting their manual processes, which bind your cost structure to theirs, or accepting a higher exception rate temporarily while you build technical systems around their process. There’s no easy trade-off here.</p>
<h3>Early prototyping and float problems</h3>
<p>In the course of product development you’ll often prototype by adding new money movement types to your ledger. A lot of these prototypes (as should happen) will be discarded. Despite this, they will have moved real money and affected your real ledger, and (at least for your accounting team's sanity) you’ll need a stateful way to reconcile the money that moved to your ledger. While at Cash I once spent a year integrating into 6 card issuer processor systems while prototyping the Cash Card. With each integration we needed a float (depositing funds with the card issuer so we could test transactions in the real world) which meant our accounting team now had 6 new banking relationships to monitor, 4 of which lasted less than 6 months, but all of which required material floats amounts. In a few cases, the issuer processor didn’t actually enable us to manage our own ledger, so we’d have a parallel ledger (one on our databases and a mirror on theirs) that we’d have to keep in sync. There was at least one integration that we ultimately discarded, which took us several months to reconcile, long after we’d walked away from the partnership. How you handle these cases will depend on what’s financially “material” for your organization. In our cases, prototype floats were all sub $100k, so survivable at our scale. But tracking these down repeatedly was an insane level of tedium.</p>
<h3>Managing ledgers across many internal bank accounts</h3>
<p>Sometimes you’ll contract with multiple banks for different financial services. For instance one bank for merchant acquiring and another for …</p></div></div>

<p>Welcome to CellSol!</p>
<p>This website and its associated project are now in beta! Come take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/RbtsEvrwhr-Riley/CellSol/">GitHub</a></p>

<p>What if the internet and cell phone towers went down for more than a few hours - or during an emergency situation? No communication could lead to lost lives.</p>

<p>The end goal of the project is to have a widespread network able to handle low-bandwidth traffic (text, compressed images) for a large number of users, to fill gaps when the larger Internet is unavailable.</p>
<p>In the event of an emergency, the CellSol network, much like the Internet, can be used as a knowledge base, as well as a rally point, giving people a tool to use to coordinate and organize even if 
other communication systems go down. We intend to scale the design, with long-haul routing capabilities, so that regional networks can intercommunicate and interoperate, allowing for a wider breadth of use cases.</p>

<p>The overall design is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking">mesh network</a> of <a href="https://www.semtech.com/lora/what-is-lora">LoRa</a> devices, called “Pylons”
that act as repeaters (extending the range of the network). Terminals (devices that users access the network with) also repeat packets, so that a network
made up entirely of end users is possible.</p>
<p>The two basic types of pylons are the ESP32 WiFi Pylon (a terminal device) and the Ardunio Repeater Pylon (a pure repeater, but can have bluetooth to use as a terminal).</p>
<p>Pylons with more specialized uses, such as data repositories for local emergency resources (phone numbers, shelter locations, etc.) and knowledge bases (such as a Wikipedia mirror) are also intended to be
developed in the future, to add to the overall usefulness of the network.</p>

          <p>It is a really great time to be a developer.</p>

<p>We have tons of APIs integrated within great tools for building dynamic, full stack apps. If you are a developer, you probably are using technologies like schemaless data stores, serverless architectures, JSON APIs, and/or the GraphQL language.</p>

<p>Further, there are a bunch of cool frameworks like the <strong>Jam</strong>stack (<strong>J</strong>avaScript, <strong>A</strong>PIs, and <strong>M</strong>arkup) and services like Netlify to make it fast to deploy a serverless app.</p>

<p>And now, for the first time ever, Apache Cassandra is a part of this stack because <a href="https://astra.datastax.com/">Stargate is now live on Astra</a> as the official data API.</p>

<p>The modern apps we build need data APIs which integrate into our toolset and work with native data shapes (JSON, REST, GraphQL, etc). These data APIs need to support schemaless JSON, while simultaneously providing speed and scalability.</p>

<p>Most importantly, it better only take a few minutes for us to use them within our project.</p>

<p>DataStax built <a href="https://stargate.io/">Stargate</a> into Astra to give us, app developers, a natural data API stack which meshes with the Jamstack (or serverless stack of your choice). Stargate in Astra is built on the rock solid NoSQL data engine (Apache Cassandra) which powers Netflix, Instagram, Yelp, iCloud and other apps we all use everyday.</p>

<h2 id="what-exactly-is-stargate">What exactly is Stargate?</h2>
<p>Stargate is an <a href="https://stargate.io/2020/09/14/init-stargate.html">open source data gateway</a> that sits between your app server and your databases. Stargate brings together an API platform and data request coordination code into one OSS project.</p>

<p>Multiple successful app companies - like Netflix and Yelp - built their own data gateways to help internal app developers create features using simple APIs, without needing to learn the underlying database or mess with schema.</p>

<p>DataStax integrated Stargate into Astra to give you the same power and ease of access to your data.</p>

<p>What does this mean for you?</p>

<ul>
  <li>No upfront data modelling needed for Documents.</li>
  <li>Less custom code to maintain.</li>
  <li>More time to build what you care about.</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="" data-src="/assets/images/stargate-astra/stargate-astra.png" src="https://stargate.io/assets/images/stargate-astra/stargate-astra.png"></p>

<p>You can work with your data the way you want – JSON via schemaless document APIs or database schema aware GraphQL and RESTful APIs – while Stargate serves as the proxy that coordinates these requests to different flavors of Cassandra.</p>

<p>To see it in action, let’s see how this works by using JSON with Stargate’s schemaless Document API in a TikTok clone. Because, if Instagram and Snapchat have a TikTok clone, we should have one, too. Right?</p>

<h2 id="real-quick-note-first">Real Quick Note First</h2>

<p>Slinging JSON to and from Apache Cassandra without data modeling is just too much fun. You gotta <a href="http://astra.datastax.com/">try this out in Astra for yourself</a>. You can get <a href="https://www.datastax.com/dev/documents-api">hands on with it right away</a> or check out our <a href="https://astra.datastax.com/sample-app-gallery">sample app gallery</a> to see schemaless Cassandra in action.</p>

<p>We are stoked to have engineers from Netflix, Burberry, Macquarie Bank, USAA, and Yelp creating Stargate with us. They are already hard at work battletesting the APIs and collaborating on new features.</p>

<p>Ok, onto the code!</p>

<h2 id="posts-in-tiktok">Posts in TikTok</h2>

<p>We are going to walk through using Stargate’s APIs in Astra for creating and updating posts within a TikTok clone. We’re walking through examples that are ready to be pasted into your latest Jamstack app.</p>

<p>To use Stargate in Astra in your app, first install and set up our <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@astrajs/collections">JavaScript SDK</a>. You can learn about storing environment <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSmzEGZQI5A">variables in your .env file here</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s start with a basic TikTok post: a video with a caption, like:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>postData</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>"</span><span>postId</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"</span><span>video</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>https://i.imgur.com/FTBP02Y.mp4</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"</span><span>caption</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>These ducks are cute</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"</span><span>timestamp</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>2020-12-09T09:08:31.020Z</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"</span><span>likes</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>After connecting to Stargate in Astra with a nodejs client, let’s create a new collection in our app and add the post with:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>postsCollection</span> <span>=</span> <span>astraClient</span><span>.</span><span>namespace</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>tikTokClone</span><span>"</span><span>).</span>
  <span>collection</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>posts</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>

<span>const</span> <span>post</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>postsCollection</span><span>.</span><span>create</span><span>(</span><span>postData</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you’ve ever used Cassandra before, you know this is amazing. Look at what we didn’t do: no data modeling, no table creation, no configuration code, no partition keys, no clustering columns. I think you get my drift.</p>

<p>Stargate in Astra allows you to add data to Apache Cassandra in one line of code.</p>

<p>This level of ease of use hasn’t previously been possible with Cassandra. Insert JSON and move on.</p>

<p>Next up, let’s say you want to find all posts about ducks. You can do that via:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// find all posts about ducks</span>
<span>const</span> <span>posts</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>postsCollection</span><span>.</span><span>find</span><span>({</span> <span>caption</span><span>:</span> 
  <span>{</span> <span>$in</span><span>:</span>  <span>[</span><span>"</span><span>ducks</span><span>"</span><span>]</span> <span>}</span> <span>});</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>And boom. Now you have your ducks channel all set up for your users. Because who doesn’t want a stream fully dedicated to ducks?</p>

<p>Now, your app isn’t going to <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/twitter-fleets-reactions-memes-edit-button-1548037">be like Twitter</a>. We can edit stuff here. Let’s show how to edit your post’s caption. Stories tho? That’s on you</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// update the post’s caption</span>
<span>const</span> <span>post</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>postsCollection</span><span>.</span><span>update</span><span>(</span><span>post</span><span>.</span><span>documentId</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>caption</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>These ducks are MEGA cute</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
<span>});</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The above was just a quick tour on how to do a few data API calls for a basic TikTok clone. Want to see the full thing? Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IATOicvih5A">Ania Kubow</a>’s tutorial to see how to wire this up into a full React app with Netlify.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>

<p>For more examples, we have hands-on tutorials for using <a href="https://www.datastax.com/dev/rest">Stargate’s REST</a>, <a href="https://www.datastax.com/dev/documents-api">Document</a> and <a href="https://www.datastax.com/dev/graphql">GraphQL APIs</a>. Check ‘em out and let us know what you think.</p>

<p>Have an app idea or want to join the fun? <a href="https://discord.gg/2Xt8QNyFZA">You can join the Stargate community, too</a>.</p>

<p>We would love to see how you customize your TikTok clone to show off more ways to feature data in your app. Or, you can create your own non-TikTok example. We would love to showcase your example in our <a href="https://astra.datastax.com/sample-app-gallery">sample app gallery</a>, so tell us about it in <a href="https://discord.gg/33mKDHHFUE">our contribute channel</a>.</p>

<h2 id="so-you-are-down-here-looking-for-a-few-more-details">So, you are down here looking for a few more details</h2>
<p>If you came down here, maybe you are looking for a few more lines of code.</p>

<p>No problem.</p>

<p>Let’s show how to set up the node JS client and a few more data API calls. For starters, let’s take a look at how to set up your client to connect to Stargate in Astra.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// npm install @astrajs/collections</span>
<span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>createClient</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>@astrajs/collections</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>

<span>// create an Astra client</span>
<span>const</span> <span>astraClient</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>createClient</span><span>(</span>
<span>{</span>   <span>astraDatabaseId</span><span>:</span> <span>process</span><span>.</span><span>env</span><span>.</span><span>ASTRA_DB_ID</span><span>,</span>
    <span>astraDatabaseRegion</span><span>:</span> <span>process</span><span>.</span><span>env</span><span>.</span><span>ASTRA_DB_REGION</span><span>,</span>
    <span>username</span><span>:</span> <span>process</span><span>.</span><span>env</span><span>.</span><span>ASTRA_DB_USERNAME</span><span>,</span>
    <span>password</span><span>:</span> <span>process</span><span>.</span><span>env</span><span>.</span><span>ASTRA_DB_PASSWORD</span><span>,</span>
<span>});</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Easy enough.</p>

<p>Then, let’s create a users collection in our database to store documents about our TikTok users:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// create the users collection in the app</span>
<span>const</span> <span>usersCollection</span> <span>=</span> <span>astraClient</span><span>.</span><span>namespace</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>tikTokClone</span><span>"</span><span>).</span><span>collection</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>users</span><span>"</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>A TikTok user in our app will have the basics: a unique id, a name, username, etc.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>userData</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>"</span><span>id_3</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>0</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"</span><span>name</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>Mo Farooq</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"</span><span>username</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>mofarooq32</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"</span><span>avatar</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>https://i.imgur.com/9KYq7VG.png</span><span>"</span>
<span>};</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>So, let’s add our user into our collection:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// create a new user</span>
<span>const</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>usersCollection</span><span>.</span><span>create</span><span>(</span><span>userData</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You can check to make sure your user was stored in the database by reading the user back by any of their properties, like their username.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// find our user by username</span>
<span>const</span> <span>users</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>usersCollection</span><span>.</span><span>find</span><span>({</span> <span>username</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>$eq</span><span>:</span> 
  <span>"</span><span>mofarooq32</span><span>"</span> <span>}</span> <span>});</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Or, you can lookup a user by their <strong>documentId</strong>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// get the user by document id</span>
<span>const</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>usersCollection</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>documentId</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>And, lastly, if you need to delete that user:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// delete the post</span>
<span>const</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>usersCollection</span><span>.</span><span>delete</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>documentId</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Want to see the full code? Check out <a href="https://github.com/kubowania/stargate-tik-tok">Ania Kubow’s app</a> to get all the goodness and start customizing it on your own. Let me know when you have stories up and I can subscribe to your ducks channel.</p>

<p>Happy building!</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>There's a ton of resources scattered around the web dealing with code review fundamentals, best practices, tools, etc. In this article we'll summarize the lessons from a dozen of official company engineering blogs. You can find links to the original articles in <a href="http://localhost:8080/blog/code-reviews"></a><a href="https://blogboard.io/search?searchQuery=code%20review">this blogboard search</a>.</p><h2 id="what-s-in-this-article">What's in this article?</h2><p>We'll cover several topics:</p><ol><li>Why do code reviews?<br>Besides the obvious, quality assurance, there are other benefits to code reviews</li><li>Code reviews as quality assurance<br>We'll cover the general recommendations on what to look for in a code review, why having a review checklist is beneficial, and you'll get a fairly long checklist that you can use as a base for your own list</li><li>Code reviews as a team improvement tool<br>If you've done more than a few code reviews, you know they're useful for more than just preventing bugs. We'll summarize common views on how reviews are beneficial as a learning and team bonding tool</li><li>Preparing a pull request for review<br>Lessons for pull request authors. There are rules of thumb consistently pointed out that help to prepare a PR for a smooth review</li><li>Reviewing code - Be human!<br>Lessons for reviewers on how wording and tone of your comments can make a huge difference in effectiveness of the whole review effort.</li></ol><p>The topics are covered fairly independently, so if you're curious about a particular topic feel free to skip ahead.</p><h2 id="why-do-code-reviews">Why do code reviews?</h2><p>It should be obvious that the primary purpose of code review is to assess quality of the changes being introduced. I mean, the dictionary definition of <em>review </em>says precisely that</p><blockquote><strong>review</strong> <em>(noun) - </em>a formal assessment of something with the intention of instituting change if necessary.</blockquote><p>Of course, code being code, there's a lot of things that can be checked and tested automatically, so there's nuance to what actually needs to be checked in an actual code review. We cover that in the next section.</p><p>On the other hand, code review is a form of communication between the <em><strong>author</strong> </em>of the change (these days usually <em>a pull request</em>) and one or several <em><strong>reviewers</strong>. </em>So it has side effects that go beyond preventing bugs from slipping in or keeping the codebase consistent in terms of style and architecture. </p><p>When done well, code reviews help accelerate learning across the team, create psychological safety for all team members, help establish and communicate best practices, teach proper communication and improve team dynamics. When done poorly, they can help deteriorate all of the above.</p><h2 id="code-reviews-as-quality-assurance">Code reviews as quality assurance </h2><p>There are a bunch of ways in which code reviews help maintain the quality bar for the codebase and the product. In the end it comes down to catching mistakes at the level which can hardly be automatically tested, such as architectural inconsistencies. Also, the code for automated tests should be reviewed, so there's a meta level at which reviews help with QA. </p><p>In <a href="https://engineering.gusto.com/high-leverage-code-reviews/">Giving High Leverage Code Reviews</a>, Casey Rollins advocates for having a checklist with all the usual things that need attention. </p><blockquote>When I’m reviewing a pull request, I often do multiple “passes” where I focus on one attribute at a time. I start at the beginning and review the pull request with a single attribute in mind before moving on to the next. When I’ve worked through the checklist, I submit the review.<p>This checklist moves from general to specific checks because it’s important to focus on the high-level attributes first. It doesn’t make sense to offer a variable name suggestion if you’re also suggesting that an entire class or function be refactored.</p></blockquote><p>You can have your own checklist or make it a shared list for the team or a project. There's a ton of material written on the usefulness of checklists. In <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">Getting Things Done</a>, </em>David Allen puts forward a simple idea -<em> </em>our minds are great at processing information, but terrible at storing and recalling it. That's why checklists are a great way of externally storing and breaking down a planned or repetitive task.</p><p>Compiled from several articles (<a href="https://medium.com/paypal-engineering/effective-code-reviews-53d62a203b2f">1</a>, <a href="https://engineering.gusto.com/high-leverage-code-reviews/">2</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/palantir/code-review-best-practices-19e02780015f">3</a>) here's a high-level list of things to be concerned about when reviewing a code change:</p><ul><li>Story alignment - does the change meet the requirements of the task at all; ie. does the code implement any and all of the specified functionalities?</li><li>Consistency across the codebase</li><li>Architectural considerations - how does the new piece of code fit the existing architecture. Can the new feature architecture be improved, is it too generic or not extensible enough?</li><li>Simplicity/over-engineering</li><li>Performance concerns - are there specific cases (eg. peak load times) when the code will break? Do the queries pull more data than necessary? Could new queries benefit from adding new indexes to the database?</li><li>Accidental errors such as typos or errors in math formulas - these can be either obvious or really tricky to notice, especially with math heavy code</li><li>Compliance with laws and regulations - depending on the business this might be the most important thing</li><li>Security concerns - are there any exploitable pieces of code being introduced? Are any secrets being shared or stored unsafely?</li><li>Readability and style - a seemingly perfect piece of code might not be immediately understandable and readable to a different pair of eyes. Is it possible to understand the changes without the author explaining them?</li><li>Best practices - programming languages usually have their best practices - are they met in the pull request? Also, with time any project, team and company will evolve their own set of best practices - code reviews are a way to enforce and spread knowledge about them</li><li>Localization - are all language dependent resources localized properly?</li><li>Dependencies - are there external libraries or APIs being introduced? Are there other simpler/faster/better ways to do this with different dependencies or without any?</li><li>Interactions and side effects - how does the new piece of code interact with the rest of the codebase; does the new function implementation break any existing functionality; are all relevant unit tests updated/added</li><li>Logging - it's practically impossible to debug server code properly without good logging. Is everything logged/traced correctly</li><li>Error handling - how are the errors handled on the backend; how are they communicated to the user; are fallbacks activated where possible?</li><li>Testability/Test coverage - is the new piece of code covered with automated tests? Have all the suspicious test cases been checked either automatically or manually? Is the code written in a way that's suitable for unit testing?</li><li>External documentation - in case it's necessary is the external documentation updated to reflect the change?</li></ul><p>It's a pretty long list. In addition to it, a recurring piece of advice is not to use code reviews in place of static code analysis tools. If your review is mostly about code formatting, variable naming and alphabetical ordering, it might be a good time to include an automated code analysis tool into your development workflow.</p><p>In <em><a href="https://medium.com/paypal-engineering/effective-code-reviews-53d62a203b2f">Effective Code Reviews: Bettering Products, Teams, and Engineers</a> </em>from PayPal engineering<em>, </em>Gabriel McAdams points out several important benefits of code reviews related to team dynamics:</p><ul><li>Team cohesion - by making everyone's code subject to peer review, code review process promotes <em>individual accountability, healthy conflict</em> and the idea that everyone's<em> working together</em> to make the product better. As said in <a href="https://medium.com/palantir/code-review-best-practices-19e02780015f">Code Review Best Practices</a>: <em>Code reviews are classless: being the most senior person on the team does not imply that your code does not need review.</em><br>In summary, McAdams puts it nicely: <em>Trust + healthy conflict + individual accountability + working together to better the team = team cohesion.</em></li><li>Free career improvement training - simply by virtue of reviewing other people's code you become more skilled at reading and understanding new code. I've heard it said that one of the foremost traits of great engineers is the ability to dive into and dissect a completely unfamiliar piece of code. Over time you learn how to spot common practices, little tricks, pieces of syntactic sugar, architectural abstractions and how to appreciate different mental models used to solve the same problem.</li></ul><p>In <a href="https://medium.com/palantir/code-review-best-practices-19e02780015f">Code Review Best Practices</a> from the Palantir Blog, Robert Fink lists several ways in which knowledge sharing and social side-effects happen via code reviews:</p><ul><li>Authors are motivated by the peer review process to do all the necessary pre-checks, tighten the loose ends and generally tidy up the code before sending to review</li><li>A code review explicitly communicates changes made to product functionality to team members</li><li>The author maybe used a technique, abstraction or an algorithm that reviewers are unfamiliar with. The opposite can also be the case - reviewers might be aware of a more appropriate way to solve a given problem</li><li>Positive communication strengthens social bonds within the team (might especially be true for remote teams)</li></ul><h2 id="preparing-a-pull-request-for-review-help-the-reviewer">Preparing a pull request for review - help the reviewer</h2><p>Code reviews should be seen as a team effort. Once you view them that way it becomes clear that both sides - the author and the reviewers - have their distinct sets of responsibilities.</p><p>In <a href="https://medium.engineering/the-code-review-mindset-3280a4af0a89">this short post</a> on Medium Engineering blog, Xiao Ma describes how a different perspective changes the way code reviews are done, how feedback is taken and how people on each side benefit by adopting a <em>positive mindset</em> about code reviews.</p><p>When we talk about the responsibilities of the pull request author, there are several key things recurring in all code review guides.</p><ol><li><strong>Make pull requests as atomic as possible</strong><br><a href="https://shopify.engineering/great-code-reviews">At Shopify</a> they advise to keep <em>your pull requests small </em>- it helps the reviewer dive into it and finish it as an atomic piece of work in their workday. In practice this can mean keeping your pull requests limited to <em>a single concern. </em>A single concern here means a single bug fix, a feature, an API change etc. Don't mix refactoring that doesn't alter behavior with bug fixes or new features.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                <div>
                    <p>When you're just getting started building your own projects marketing seems like a daunting task, especially if your background is in development. You spend some time learning what you can about marketing but a lot of advice relies on utilising your "network".</p><p>That assumes you have a network.</p><p>If you're like me and few of your friends are interested in the products you build, that advice is completely useless.</p><p>Next, they'll suggest you reach out to your wider network and get their support in sharing your project. You'll read articles on "how I got 1000 signups for my product in two weeks" that fail to mention their 5000 followers on Twitter.</p><p>What I've learnt is that you have to look past these tips and focus on scalable and automated methods of growth when you're friendless. Is it harder? Definitely. Does it take a lot longer? 100%. Will you look on enviously as others with networks instantly launch to thousands of signups and acclaim? Absolutely.</p><p>But there is a bright side. Scalable methods are sustainable. They have long-term value while a large network can provide a false indicator of success. If your product is solving a real problem you'll get more rewards from focusing on sustainable methods of growth early on.</p><p>For every new project, I focus on creating small but steady streams of traffic and optimising how I capture that traffic for long-term growth.</p><h3 id="1-seo">1. SEO</h3><p>The first step is setting up your product pages or landing page perfectly for SEO. This means meta tags, titles with keywords, sub-pages that target niche keywords, and so on. You can find specific tips on this everywhere and if you're building a directory site <a href="http://keenen.xyz/seo-tips-for-online-directories/">these tips</a> might be even more helpful.</p><h3 id="2-submit-to-aggregators">2. Submit to Aggregators </h3><p>Next, you want to submit your project to aggregation sites to drive some traffic to your page. Product Hunt, Reddit, Hacker News, etc are all great for this. Submit to as many as you can and let the traffic flow in. Chances are without a network your project won't be number one on any of these sites but you're likely to get a decent bit of traffic and some initial users. Check out this <a href="https://github.com/mmccaff/PlacesToPostYourStartup">comprehensive list here</a>.</p><p>It's also a great way for getting backlinks that will compound the effect of the initial SEO work you did. I try to submit to as many startup directories and Product Hunt clones as I find and hope they use dofollow links. If you get a backlink great. If they don't but you get some traffic that's fine too. If you get nothing 🤷‍♀️, it was free anyway (you definitely shouldn't pay to be listed on the majority of those sites, it's not worth it).</p><h3 id="3-email-signups">3. Email signups</h3><p>Whatever you're doing you should be collecting emails in some form. You want to be able to communicate with users of your product even if you don't require signup to use it. Create an account on Mailchimp or some other email service provider, embed a signup form on your page, and you're sure to get some signups.</p><p>As traffic trickles in from aggregators and SEO you'll begin to capture some emails. Once you do have a handful of signups you can start sharing regular updates with them. Chances are some of them will be drawn back to your product with each issue you send.</p><h3 id="4-reuse-content">4. Reuse Content</h3><p>If your product generates content you should find some way to share it on social media. Preferably in an automated way. Add relevant hashtags to each post and they can drive another bit of traffic to your product. With InboxReads I share every new submission to its' Twitter &amp; Facebook accounts and that results in a steady stream of traffic.</p><p>Emails you send can also be reused for future traffic. When picking an email service provider I would find one that creates indexable blog posts from each email you send. This means each issue becomes a piece of content that links back to your main product.</p><h3 id="5-optimize-repeat">5. Optimize &amp; Repeat</h3><p>Chances are you won't get everything right the first time. You might have misconfigured some meta tags or your social media work is just not getting any attention. It's important to be constantly analysing your results and testing new ideas to improve these steps. As you better understand your audience you'll be able to finetune this process to capture even more traffic.</p><p>These steps aren't likely to make you instantly rich or famous. You shouldn't expect a profile in TechCrunch or an influx of new followers. But they can give you a small but reliable and organic stream of traffic that lets you determine your product's viability. If it is viable then you would have invested time into sustainable and scalable marketing methods from the beginning. </p><p>And maybe you'll make some friends along the way.</p>

<hr>
<p>I wrote this post as a result of my frustration with popular business books and with non-fiction books in general. I am not saying every book is like this, some books are insightful and bring new ideas and perspectives to the table. But I have noticed that some authors have an idea and without fleshing it out and properly researching it they decide to write a book about it. Throw in cognitive dissonance, confirmation bias and an incompetent publishers and you have got yourself a popular non-fiction book. There is no peer review and if you sensationalize things you can earn a lot of money. </p>
<p>You cannot even trust books by experts in the field. I bought into the hype of the book Why We Sleep  by Matthew Walker the author seemed legit and well respected within his field. He even appeared on the Joe Rogan Experience. After reading the book I  began espousing the benefits of 8 hour sleep until I read <a href="https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/">this</a> wonderful article by Alexey Guzey. So who should you trust? Should you stop reading non-fiction altogether? I suggest doing the opposite, read as much as you can and be wary of any broad sweeping statements. Even though some books might get something wrong, the good ideas are still valuable. And as with business you can only get better at it (i.e. filtering signal) by exposing yourself to more of it.</p></section><hr></article></div>]]>

The vaccine was well tolerated by participants and has no important safety concerns. The benefit-to-risk assessment for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is considered favourable."</p>  <p>Canada is just the third country in the world to authorize the vaccine, after the United Kingdom and Bahrain. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will hear tomorrow from an advisory panel on whether the vaccine is safe for use in the United States and&nbsp;authorization&nbsp;is&nbsp;expected in "a matter of days," U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar said Wednesday.</p>  <p>Dr. Howard Njoo, Canada's deputy chief public health officer, said&nbsp;249,000 doses of the two-dose Pfizer vaccine will be on hand by year's end — shots primarily earmarked&nbsp;for long-term care home residents and the staff working there.</p>  <p>Maj.-Gen. Dany Fortin, the military commander leading vaccination logistics at the national operations centre,&nbsp;said 30,000 doses out of the&nbsp;initial run&nbsp;will be shipped from a Pfizer plant in Belgium on Friday.</p>  <p>"We expect&nbsp;vaccines to arrive as early as Monday," Fortin&nbsp;said, adding it's "totally possible" some&nbsp;Canadians could get their&nbsp;shots&nbsp;by mid-week.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834779.1607545281!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/covid-cda-vaccine-20201209.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834779.1607545281!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/covid-cda-vaccine-20201209.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834779.1607545281!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/covid-cda-vaccine-20201209.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834779.1607545281!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/covid-cda-vaccine-20201209.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834779.1607545281!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/covid-cda-vaccine-20201209.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834779.1607545281!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/covid-cda-vaccine-20201209.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Maj.-Gen.

Assuming other&nbsp;promising vaccine candidates from companies like Moderna and AstraZeneca secure regulatory approvals, millions more shots will come online in the months to follow, he said.</p>  <p>The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) said today the country will begin immunizing non-priority populations — people other than the elderly, health care workers and some adults in Indigenous communities —&nbsp;in April 2021. The vaccination campaign is expected to end next December.</p>  <p>"At last, we have a reason to feel optimistic and excited about returning to the lives we led pre-COVID," Njoo said. "Things are happening quickly."</p>  <p>Speaking in question period today, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the Pfizer-BioNTech approval a "big deal" because it signals that the end of this destructive pandemic is in sight.</p>  <p>"It's a good news day for Canadians but we are not through this yet. We have a tough winter to go through," Trudeau said, urging Canadians to respect public health measures&nbsp;even as shots start to arrive.</p>  <h2>Long-term care homes to be among first to get vaccine</h2>  <p>The Pfizer trial had&nbsp;more than 43,000 participants — one of the largest such trials ever conducted — and regulators found that the vaccine's efficacy was consistent across age, gender, race and ethnicity demographics.</p>  <p>The vaccine is&nbsp;based on&nbsp;groundbreaking&nbsp;messenger RNA technology, or mRNA, which essentially directs cells in the body to make proteins to prevent or fight disease.</p>  <p>The shot was found to be 94.7 per cent effective among clinical&nbsp;trial subjects who were over the age of 65 and who had no prior COVID-19 infection — a significant finding, given most&nbsp;novel coronavirus-related deaths in Canada have been reported among the elderly.</p>    <p>While the&nbsp;Pfizer vaccine has been given the necessary approvals, regulators conceded that the clinical&nbsp;trial data could not establish&nbsp;the long-term efficacy of the vaccine.</p>  <p>It is not yet known how long the vaccine-induced immunity will last but Health Canada said it will implement a robust "risk management plan"&nbsp;to monitor immunity and gather data on when it begins to wane. The regulator will also track any&nbsp;"adverse events" that follow immunization.</p>  <p>Cole Pinnow, the president of Pfizer Canada, said Health Canada's approval means the country can start to return to a sense of "normalcy," with&nbsp;millions of Canadians&nbsp;set to be vaccinated over the coming months.</p>  <p>"This is historic. We couldn't be more proud that Pfizer and BioNTech were able to bring to Canada the first COVID-19 vaccine. We think this represents a monumental change in the way that we are fighting the pandemic, and hopefully represents the first big step towards normalcy," Pinnow said in an interview with CBC Radio's&nbsp;<em>The Current</em>.</p>  <p>With recent polls showing that a sizeable number of Canadians will refuse a vaccine altogether, or will wait some time before lining up for a shot, Pinnow said he wants Canadians to be assured the product is safe.</p>  <p>"I would reassure Canadians that the scientific rigour and regulatory oversight that went into this product is as robust, if not more robust, than any other vaccine that's been brought to market," he said.</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH: Pfizer addresses vaccine concerns:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="Dr. Sharma calls the approval of the Pfizer vaccine a 'critical milestone' in the fight against COVID-19." role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1829647939789-metadata-" title="Dr. Sharma calls the approval of the Pfizer vaccine a 'critical milestone' in the fight against COVID-19."><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/1017/255/ftr_SHARMA_approval_frame_3575_corrected.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>Health Canada chief medical adviser Dr. Supriya Sharma briefed reporters on the vaccine's approval during a briefing on Wednesday.<!-- --> <!-- -->2:19</span></span></span></p>  <p>Dr. Supriya Sharma, the chief medical adviser at Health Canada, also sought to reassure Canadians that her department conducted a "rigorous" review of all the product's&nbsp;clinical trial and technical information.</p>  <p>She said&nbsp;scientists&nbsp;found "strong evidence"&nbsp;that the vaccine's potential benefits far outweigh any risks.</p>  <p>"Canadians can have confidence ... the vaccine was authorized only after a thorough assessment of the evidence demonstrated it had met Health Canada's strict standards for efficacy, safety and quality," she said.</p>  <p>"It's an exceptional day for Canada.

<p> And, that’s it. Handbrake should be installed on your Windows computer. </p>

<h2>Select the source file and open it</h2>



<p>Once you finish installing the app, open it.</p>



<p>Go to the left side of the app, choose the Source Selection and then flick File. Then you can choose the file you want to compress and click Open. Once the file is loaded, you can choose where to save it simply by clicking Browse. Make sure that you create a name for the video so you can identify it with ease. Add whatever name you are comfortable with, and then press Save.</p>

<h2>Picking the container type and video codec</h2>



<p>Right under the output settings, you can select the container. Ideally, you want to go with the <code>MP4</code> container format, unless you have any specific containers in mind. Under that you have the Video tab, here you want to select the H.264 codec.</p>

<p>Here you can also select the desired framerate and quality types. The app has options for different video qualities, such as web, HD, and so on. Or you can go with an average bitrate instead of a certain quality. The framerate can be <code>30</code> FPS or more. It all depends on the initial framerate of your video. Most of the time, settling for <code>30</code> FPS will do just fine.</p>



<h2>Selecting a preset</h2>



<p>One of the main benefits of Handbrake is that it has a vast range of presets. You can browse the list of presets on the right side of the user interface. </p>

<p>Normally you can go for <code>Fast 1080p 30</code>, as this is of great quality. But you can easily experiment with a variety of presets and see how the results turn out in the end. The average bitrate for a video should be anywhere from <code>5000</code> to <code>10000</code> kbps. Normally the higher the bitrate is, the better the video quality, but this will take a longer time to process and upload.</p>



<h2>Modifying the resolution and picture options</h2>



<p>In the Dimensions panel, you can see the source resolution and you can keep that or choose whatever resolution you find ok. Here you can also change the Anamorphic mode to None. Ideally, you want to have the modulus option to <code>16</code>. A good rule of thumb is to maintain the aspect ratio, you can do that simply by ticking the option with the same name right near the picture size.</p>

<h2>Modifying audio information</h2>



<p>Go to the Audio tab, here you can modify the sample rate and other options the way you want. A lot of people use <code>48</code> or <code>64</code> kbps as the ideal sample rate, and the mixdown is Stereo. You can also change the audio codec, not to mention you can modify the bitrate. You may want to stick with a <code>320</code> bitrate, as it delivers the best quality.</p>

<h2>Start the encoding process</h2>



<p>Once you fully customized everything, you want to press the Start Encode button. Then you can leave or do something else, as Handbrake will work on the video compression. </p>



<p>You will receive a notification when everything is fully completed.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Compressing any video using Handbrake helps a lot, and this free tool does bring in front incredible results. It does take a bit to get used to the interface, but with a little experimentation, you will have no problems. We recommend you to give Handbrake a try today, and you will be incredibly impressed with its ease of use and incredible compression quality!</p>

<p>In one of our many research projects here at rev.ng, we are dealing with <strong>Big Data</strong> (is a 1..10 TB compressed database dump big? Well, probably not, but it is for us).
Our first approach was to extract the data and store it in an SQL database, then run a bunch of queries and finally export the processed tables for other purposes.
See the problem there? We used to use the database just like a, err... data processing tool?
Unfortunately this wasn't working very well: we were having all kinds of performance bottlenecks since we were doing bulk inserts and bulk selects.</p>
<p>We then thought of using <a href="https://spark.apache.org/"><strong>Spark</strong></a> or some other fancy stuff like that in order to stream process everything and just use text files.
But, you know, we are a binary analysis company so most of the people here don't like garbage collectors (except me, the author of this blogpost, who like them very much).
Anyway, we went from using MySQL to MongoDB+MySQL to MongoDB+PostgreSQL to, you guessed it, text <strong>files + good ol' Bash</strong>.</p>
<p>In this article I will persuade you, CEO at a brand-new Spark'ing startup that, sometimes, <strong>Bash'ing is all you need</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://rev.ng/blog/bashml/edited.svg"></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you haven't checked out our Big Match post, <a href="https://rev.ng/blog/big-match/post.html">go read it</a>.</p>

          
          
            <h2>An example dataset</h2>
<p>For this tutorial we will be using a simplified version of our internal <strong>Big Match</strong> dataset of github repositories. It consists of a set of txt files and each of them contains a newline-separated list of sha256 hashes of strings found in a repo.</p>
<p>So for example, in file <code>torvalds,linux.hashes.txt</code> we have all the hashes of all the strings found in the linux kernel. They are also sorted for ease of use. It's clear that we use commas in place of <code>'/'</code> as a separator between username and repo name.
So, in this case, <code>torvalds,linux.hashes.txt</code> refers to the GitHub repo <code>torvalds/linux</code>.</p>
<p>Let's take a quick look at one of our files:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>head -n <span>5</span> ./dataset/torvalds,linux.hashes.txt
</pre></div>
<div><pre><span></span>0000130323884123bd36b3460e2311191fb0663dc7765e2781b62e1bb4fb1694
000020f8aa6016e534263f726778ea7ed6f8bdc6eaad4db703200b37ae6cf00b
000050a6f4869b1ccb3dc2f76f857561d3bae7c1d01e7153c1a6ef543abbd3ff
000052d246cfb78ed0a80bd74071664dc6cb76e3b5586dfed18d8613251fdeba
00006711c3893c6716caeb147e8894ed5bd9a02d1b8743ac5b207ffcf4508494
</pre></div>
<div><pre><span></span>wc -l ./dataset/torvalds,linux.hashes.txt
</pre></div>
<div><pre><span></span>540297 ./dataset/torvalds,linux.hashes.txt
</pre></div>
<p>But before delving into the fun part, let's fix locale issues between tools. Trust me, you do want to do this, otherwise you will get all sorts of error when piping together different commands (e.g.: <code>sort</code> and <code>join</code> don't like each other very much).</p>

<h2>Building blocks</h2>
<p>Bash tools have all kinds of different options and there seem to be little to no consistency between them. We all know that: I know it, you know it, everybody knows it.
So before starting we are going to create some <strong>helper functions</strong> for the most useful bashML operations out there.</p>
<p>We will start with a <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#v:fst">haskell-inspired</a> helper, <code>fst</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># a b =&gt; a</span>
fst<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    cut -d <span>' '</span> -f <span>1</span> <span>"</span><span>$@</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>It's pretty simple: it takes the first column of a given file. By using <code>$@</code>, we can either give it a file argument or use it without arguments (think pipes) and it will <strong>Just Work™</strong>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>echo</span> -e <span>'ciao mondo\nhello world'</span> <span>|</span> fst
</pre></div>

<div><pre><span></span>fst &lt;<span>(</span><span>echo</span> -e <span>'ciao mondo\nhello world'</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>If you are wondering what bash does on <code>&lt;(...)</code>, look no further:</p>


<p>Long story short, bash replaces the argument with a file descriptor that's connected to the output of the command inside <code>&lt;(...)</code>.
In fact, you can also <code>cat</code> it:</p>


<p>With that out of the way, let's create some additional helpers:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># Like `fst`, but returns the second column:</span>
<span># a b =&gt; b</span>
snd<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    cut -d <span>' '</span> -f <span>2</span> <span>"</span><span>$@</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>

<span># Same as `snd`, but can handle multi-character separators:</span>
<span># a     b =&gt; b</span>
snd_awk<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    awk <span>'{ print $2 }'</span> <span>"</span><span>$@</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>

<span># Turn whitespaces into newlines:</span>
<span># a b</span>
<span># c</span>
<span># =&gt;</span>
<span># a</span>
<span># b</span>
<span># c</span>
flat<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    tr <span>' '</span> <span>'\n'</span> <span>"</span><span>$@</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>

<span># Similar to python `enumerate()`:</span>
<span># a</span>
<span># b</span>
<span># =&gt;</span>
<span># 0 a</span>
<span># 1 b</span>
enumerate<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    nl -v0 -w1 -s<span>' '</span> <span>"</span><span>$@</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>

<span># Swap the first two columns in a file (and ignore the other columns):</span>
<span># a b =&gt; b a</span>
swap<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    awk <span>'{ print $2 " " $1 }'</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>For the few of you unfamiliar with <code>tr</code>, it's a little nice utility that can <em>translate</em> single characters (aka, map one character to another) or delete a character from a stream.</p>
<p>Another nice utility is <code>nl</code>, which counts the number of lines in a file.
Don't worry too much about the options: they are just there to output the format we want.</p>
<h2>Example pipelines</h2>
<p>It's now time to test our crazy bash skills to actually do something useful.</p>
<h3>Repository similarity</h3>
<p>Let's say we want to query our repos to <strong>find Linux forks</strong> just using common strings.
We can use a scoring formula called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index">Jaccard index</a> (also called Jaccard similarity):</p>
<p><span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mi>J</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>B</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mi>A</mi><mo>∩</mo><mi>B</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mi>A</mi><mo>∪</mo><mi>B</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mi>A</mi><mo>∩</mo><mi>B</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mi>A</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mo>+</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mi>B</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mo>−</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mi>A</mi><mo>∩</mo><mi>B</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">
J(A,B) = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|A \cup B|} = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|A| + |B| - |A \cap B|}
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>So, if <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">B</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> are our repositories, <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>J</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>B</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">J(A, B)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is a measure of how many strings they share, divided by the total number of their strings.
How can you do this in bash?
Using <code>comm</code> and some basic <code>awk</code>.</p>
<p>If you are unfamiliar with <code>comm</code>, it's a simple command that is able to compare sorted files line by line.
If you run it without any specific option it will output 3 columns formatted like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>&lt;lines unique to file 1&gt; &lt;lines unique to file 2&gt; &lt;common lines&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>Remember to <strong>sort its input files</strong> otherwise <code>comm</code> will complain!</p>
<p>Anyway, if you run it with <code>--total</code>, it will also write a final line with the total count of lines for each column:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>mkdir -p ./tmp/

<span># a.txt</span>
cat &gt; ./tmp/a.txt <span>&lt;&lt;EOF</span>
<span>a</span>
<span>b</span>
<span>c</span>
<span>EOF</span>

<span># b.txt</span>
cat &gt; ./tmp/b.txt <span>&lt;&lt;EOF</span>
<span>c</span>
<span>d</span>
<span>e</span>
<span>EOF</span>

<span># Compare the lines in a.txt and b.txt (they are already sorted!)</span>
comm --total --check-order ./tmp/a.txt ./tmp/b.txt
</pre></div>

<p>See that last line?
It's the count we were talking about.
We can throw away everything <strong>except that last line</strong>, do some simple math in <code>awk</code>, and get the Jaccard index of the input files:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>jaccard<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span># We don't need to sort because our input files are already sorted</span>
    comm --total --check-order <span>"</span><span>$@</span><span>"</span> <span>|</span> tail -n <span>1</span> <span>|</span> awk <span>'{ print ($3 / ($3 + $2 + $1)) }'</span>
<span>}</span>
jaccard ./tmp/a.txt ./tmp/b.txt
</pre></div>

<p>Same thing, but with a different file:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># c.txt</span>
cat &gt; ./tmp/c.txt <span>&lt;&lt;EOF</span>
<span>b</span>
<span>c</span>
<span>d</span>
<span>EOF</span>

jaccard ./tmp/a.txt ./tmp/c.txt
</pre></div>

<p>In this examples, the first two files have only one line in common out of 5 unique strings, so <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>J</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>B</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>5</mn></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mn>0.2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">J(A, B) = \frac{1}{5} = 0.2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.
In the second example, they share 2 lines out of 4 unique strings, so <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>J</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>B</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mn>2</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mn>0.5</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">J(A, B) = \frac{2}{4} = 0.5</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>Yes, this is what data scientists get paid to do by the way.</p>
<p>Now let's say we want to find the Jaccard similarity between Linux and the biggest repos in our dataset.
We need to start by getting the list of such big files:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># Get list of (size, filename)</span>
biggest_files<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    find ./dataset/ -name <span>"*.hashes.txt"</span> -print0 <span>\</span>
    <span>|</span> xargs -0 du -a <span>\</span>
    <span>|</span> sort -t <span>' '</span> -nr <span>\</span>
    <span>|</span> head -n <span>"</span><span>$@</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>echo</span> <span>'== Biggest files =='</span>
biggest_files <span>5</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>'...'</span>
</pre></div>
<div><pre><span></span>== Biggest files ==
103288  ./dataset/mirror,dd-wrt.hashes.txt
66824   ./dataset/kishikawakatsumi,Mozc-for-iOS.hashes.txt
57564   ./dataset/mirek190,x86-android-5.0.hashes.txt
51008   ./dataset/CyberGrandChallenge,samples.hashes.txt
47068   ./dataset/AndreyPopovNew,asuswrt-merlin-rt-n.hashes.txt
...
</pre></div>
<p>We now want to use the same <code>jaccard()</code> function we defined above <strong>but</strong> we want to run it faster by exploiting <strong>parallel processing</strong>.
We can do that with GNU <code>parallel</code>.</p>
<p>GNU <code>parallel</code> has a metric ton of options.
Yes, that is 1000-kilograms-many options.
Unless you voted for Brexit or play football with your hands: in that case it's ~2205 pounds.
Since we are Europeans and are not here to start a debate about our (superior) measurement system, we will just use 2 options and ignore the others:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>cat ./tmp/a.txt <span>|</span> parallel -j<span>$(</span>nproc<span>)</span> -k -- <span>echo</span> <span>{}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>What's happening here? Quite a bit actually: <code>parallel</code> just ran <code>echo {}</code> 3 times, every time substituting <code>{}</code> with a line from the input.
Remember: the calls to <code>echo</code> happen <strong>in parallel</strong> using multiple processes!</p>
<p>GNU <code>parallel</code> allows you to use <code>{}</code> multiple times if you want:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>cat ./tmp/a.txt <span>|</span> parallel -j<span>$(</span>nproc<span>)</span> -k -- <span>echo</span> <span>{}</span> <span>{}</span> <span>{}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The options we give to <code>parallel</code> are very important: <code>-j$(nproc)</code> is for using as many processes as the processing units on the system (returned by the command <code>nproc</code>), while <code>-k</code> tells <code>parallel</code> to <strong>honor the input order</strong> when printing the output (so we don't get, e.g., <code>c c c</code> then <code>b b b</code> then <code>a a a</code>).</p>
<p>We can now use our previous <code>jaccard</code> function inside <code>parallel</code> to get the <strong>similarity between Linux and the other repos</strong>.
However, we also want a nice output so we throw in a call to <code>printf</code>.
The command gets a little messy due to string formatting, but just focus on the <code>jaccard</code> part:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>similarity<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span># Export the `jaccard` function so that it's available to `parallel`</span>
    <span>export</span> -f jaccard

    <span>echo</span> -e <span>'\n== Similarity to torvalds/linux =='</span>

    <span># Find most linux-like repos</span>
    biggest_files <span>30</span> <span>\</span>
        <span>|</span> snd_awk <span>\</span>
        <span>|</span> parallel -j<span>$(</span>nproc<span>)</span> -k -- <span>printf</span> <span>\'</span>%0.5f %s<span>\\</span>n<span>\'</span> <span>'$(jaccard ./dataset/torvalds,linux.hashes.txt {})'</span> <span>'{}'</span>
<span>}</span>

<p><span>I</span>t is a myth of the West’s choosing: perpetual economic growth, advancing through a digestive system of sorts, one that uses technology as one of its core components. In its churn,<strong> </strong>ecosystems became goods; people, mere consumers. The myth turned the world into a place increasingly inhospitable to human life.</p>



<p>I write these words from the periphery of the metropolises that command this global digestive system — an enclave that resists the myth’s logic. In these parts, resistance begins with a name. Here, Latin America is neither Latin nor America; it is Abya Yala, a term the Guna people of Panama use to describe the Western Hemisphere’s largest landmass as it existed before<strong> </strong>1492. This is a territory that comprises an array of Indigenous nations, Afro-descendant communities, and societies created by political projects of miscegenation. As a whole, the history of this diverse group of peoples is inextricable from the ravages of colonialism. Yet that history has also been defined by those peoples’ ingenious use of new technologies — not as consumable goods, but as means of resisting colonial imposition in the midst of an unprecedented climate crisis.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cepal.org/en/publications/40840-science-technology-and-innovation-digital-economy-state-art-latin-america-and">To metropolitan eyes,</a> Latin America, with its minimal patent production and negligible investment in science and technology, lags behind. The Silicon Valleys springing up in different parts of the world — more an ideological concept than a geographic location — have long dismissed the region as a passive receptor for technology. But Abya Yala challenges that narrative. Here on the periphery, technology, when repurposed for resistance, can bolster the autonomy of peoples and communities.<strong> </strong>In Abya Yala, digital technologies have created virtual spaces to be shared — woven webs of sustainable<strong> </strong>collaboration among the continent’s subaltern voices.</p>



<p>This form of collaborative effort has ancient roots. To many peoples in Mexico, it is known as <em>tequio</em> (from the Náhuatl <em>tequitl</em>) or, farther south, as <em>faena</em>, <em>kol</em>, or <em>minga</em>. Through tequio, schools have been built, potable-water systems have been installed, and art has been made. Tequio has also become a strategy for meeting everyday needs. Just as the modern-day technology of free, open-source code has enabled collective progress in the digital sphere, the communal labor of tequio raises the possibility of resistance in Abya Yala — and survival of the world at large.</p>



<p>But as is true in every struggle against power, hegemonic narratives — those dominant myths that determine how we see the world<strong> </strong>— must first be confronted in order to avoid what Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie has called “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9Ihs241zeg&amp;ab_channel=TED">the danger of a single story</a>,” the all-encompassing Western mythology flooding our distant territories.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 2008, the Wayuu Film and Video Showcase, for instance, has given voice to the Wayuu, an indigenous people living in what<strong> </strong>is now<strong> </strong>Venezuela and Colombia. Similarly, the <a href="http://www.videonasaldeias.org.br/2009/">Vídeo Nas Aldeias</a> streaming platform, created by Vincent Carelli and the Nambiquara, has enabled Indigenous peoples in Brazil to learn to make films and tell their stories in their own narrative formats. The purpose of these initiatives, according to Wayuu director and film curator David Hernández Palmar, is to “close the digital gap that exists between these peoples and technology.” But “closing the gap” doesn’t only mean bringing film to the Wayuu: It also means building a bridge to the West to foster intercultural exchange.</p>



<p>Abya Yala, by repurposing imported technologies, is far ahead of the West in understanding how digital technology can burst out from the realm of the intangible into the “real world.” The West has recently witnessed how “fake news” and online interference in political disputes can spill over into its streets and ballot boxes. But Abya Yala has spent decades waging its struggles in digital spaces, particularly in defense of its native languages:<strong> </strong>Within the next hundred years, experts estimate that up to 80% of the world’s approximately 7,000 languages will have disappeared. Meanwhile, digital knowledge is accessible through just a few Portuguese-, <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/saving-the-world-through-tequiology/">English</a>-, and <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/tecnologia-tequio-cambio-climatico/">Spanish</a>-language<strong> </strong>gateways, inaccessible to non-hegemonic language communities in the periphery. But groups like<strong> </strong><a href="https://rising.globalvoices.org/lenguas/"><em>Activismo Digital de Lenguas Indígenas</em></a><em> </em>are filling the void. This continent-wide digital indigenous-language movement has forged a network of activists from all over Abya Yala, including Wikipedians, app developers, and programmers, among others. Collectives like the one created in the <a href="https://rising.globalvoices.org/lenguas/2020/02/16/mozilla-en-triqui/">Triqui region of southern Mexico</a> have worked together to ensure that they have access to browsers in their own language. In this way,<strong> </strong>we see<strong> </strong>digitally underrepresented peoples appropriating technology<strong> </strong>as a tool of linguistic resistance<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Abya Yala’s technological struggle<strong> </strong>also<strong> </strong>extends to the vindication of material sovereignty. In Mexico, <a href="https://www.redesac.org.mx/telefoniacomunitaria">Community Cellular Technology</a>, through which cell phone systems are locally owned, administered, and operated, has been built against a backdrop that has started to crumble: As proprietors of their own cell company, these communities defy the slogan of the conglomerate that controls 70% of the country’s mobile communication services: “All of Mexico is Telcel territory.” The response from these communities is No: Not all of Mexico is the territory of Carlos Slim, one of the wealthiest men in the world. They strive for technological sovereignty.</p>



<p>Technology has also tapped into ancient collective philosophies to resist the metropole. Rodrigo Pérez Ramírez, better known in Mexico as Zapoteco 3.0, is part of the <a href="https://mozillanativo.org/involucrate">Mozilla Nativo</a> movement, which seeks to empower indigenous peoples online. He told me that he had found in open-source software a natural ally to his local Zapotec-language activism. There is a serendipitous affinity between the logic of collective effort and free cooperation that defines open-source software like Linux and the philosophy of many indigenous communities who built structures to survive the harshness of colonial rule. Both rely on<strong> </strong>mutual support and small-scale, community-level labor linked into a circuit of larger tasks.<strong> </strong>Such tequio is an essential “social technology” common<strong> </strong>across Abya Yala. It has been<strong> </strong>for a long time, including back when indigenous peoples, organized into small communities, created networks to resist paying taxes or to plan rebellions against the Iberian crowns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, this form of scalable Abya Yalan tequio could be a crucial asset to the entire world in the years ahead. When technologies are deployed in forms<strong> </strong>that resemble<strong> </strong>tequio,<strong> </strong>rather than in pursuit of insatiable competitive growth, we may indeed get a true solution to the dire climate emergency we are facing. Even so-called green capitalism has raised hopes that some technological invention will solve our ecological emergency. But we in Abya Yala can see how even some forms of renewable energy wind up as just another pollutant. Here, we have seen<strong> </strong>rare earths violently <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/niobium-the-mighty-element-youve-never-heard-of/">extracted from our territories</a> in order to create “green technologies,” which are then installed on “empty land” by dispossessing our communities.<strong> </strong>This phenomenon was explored at the Wayuu Film and Video Showcase in a documentary called “Tatuushi”<em> </em>(My Grandfather). Through traditional Wayuu singing, it tells the story of a grandfather who travels to the city in search of food. On his return, he finds that coal companies have devastated his land and destroyed his home. Faced with dispossession, the grandfather responds with a traditional prayer.</p>



<p>An alternative, offered by Abya Yala, lies in separating economic development and the development of new technologies from consumerism. This would place technological creation and ingenuity once again at the service of the common good, not of the market. Technology as tequio; technological creation and innovation as a common good. A kind of open-source software we can all participate in, just as we have participated in the construction of our lives as the colonized peoples of this continent, resisting genocide and extinction.&nbsp;In the face of our current global climate emergency, we need to foster forms of technological development that emphasize living with dignity, not infinite economic growth as an end in itself. We must focus on technologies based on collaborative labor more than on competition. As peoples of Abya Yala, we’re experienced in this strategy, which I call <em>tequiology</em>. If the world were to listen to the people of Abya Yala and adopt this new tequiological vision, we could perhaps escape the digestive system that so threatens our world’s climate and endangers human life.</p>

<p>One of the questions I often come back to is this: how much of our collective wealth is inherited by our generations versus created by our generations?</p>

<p>I realized that the keys on the keyboard in front of me might make a good dataset to attack that problem. So I built a small little <a href="https://breckyunits.com/files/keyboard/">experiment to explore the history of the keys on my keyboard</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-five-waves-of-symbols">The Five Waves of Symbols</h2>

<p>Painting with broad strokes, there were approximately five big waves of inventions that have left their mark on the keyboard. The first wave was the invention of the phonetic alphabet letters. The second wave was the Hindu-Arabic Numerals. The third wave was the mathematical punctuation of the Enlightenment period. The fourth wave was the invention of the typewriter. And the fifth and most recent wave was the invention of the personal computer.</p>

<p>I haven’t made any traditional charts yet with this dataset, but you can roughly make out these waves in the interactive visualization by moving the slider around.</p>

<h2 id="concentric-circles">Concentric Circles</h2>

<p>An interesting pattern that I never saw before is how the five waves above are roughly arranged in circles. The oldest symbols (letters) are close to the center, followed by the Hindu-Arabic Numbers, surrounded by the punctuation of the Englightenment, surrounded by the keys of the keyboard, surrounded by the recent additions in the P.C. era. Again, painting with broad strokes, but I found that to be an interesting pattern.</p>

<h2 id="standing-on-the-shoulders-of-giants">Standing on the Shoulders of Giants</h2>

<p>All of these waves happened invented before my generation. Almost all of them before any generation alive today. The keyboard dataset provides strong evidence that most of our collective wealth is inherited.</p>

<h2 id="build-notes">Build Notes</h2>

<p>I got this idea last week and couldn’t get it out of my head. Yesterday I took a quick crack at it. I didn’t have much time to spare, just enough to explore the big ideas. I started by typing all the characters on my keyboard into a Tree Notation document. Then I dug up some years for a handful of the symbols. Then I found the great Apple CSS keyboard. I stitched together the two and it seemed to be at least mildly interesting so I opted to continue. I then flushed out most of the dataset. Finally I played around with a number of visualization effects. At first I thought heatmaps would work well, and tried a few variations on that, but wasn’t happy with anything. I posted my work-in-progress to a few friends last night and called it a day. Today I switched to the “disappearing keys” visualization. That definitely felt like a better approach than the heatmap. I made the thing as fun as I could given time constraints and then shipped.</p>

          <p>In this post, I will guide you through the steps needed to design your database schema using TerminusDB 4.0 Console and its model builder.</p>

<p>Having your data in the right format makes it easier to analyze the data properly but you can model your data in more than one way. This is a reality for all the databases, so how to make the right decision?</p>

<p>The model builder is a tool that lets you visualize and edit your database schema. It is very useful for designing and understanding complex data models.
I’ll show you how you can start from a simple model and build out something more complex in no time.</p>

<p>if you have never used TerminusDB before, this article includes everything you need to get started with TerminusDB. <a href="https://terminusdb.com/blog/2020/09/01/my-first-terminusdb-3-0-graph-bike-share-data/">My First TerminusDB Graph Visualisation — Bike Share Data</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="the-dataset">The Dataset</h3>

<p>In our examples we use the collection of data about the bike journeys between stations in Washington D.C., USA.</p>

<p>We have used this data in other blogs, where with woql.js, a javascript layer that help you to compose <a href="https://terminusdb.com/docs/reference/server/woql/"><strong>WOQL query</strong> (Web Object Query Language)</a>, we have created our database scheme.</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/bike_table.png" alt="data about the bike journeys between stations in Washington D.C"></p>

<p>The CSV data used this tutorial is available at <a href="https://terminusdb.com/t/data/bike_tutorial.csv">https://terminusdb.com/t/data/bike_tutorial.csv</a></p>

<h3 id="how-do-i-model-my-schema-using-the-model-builder">How do I model my schema using the model builder?</h3>

<p>I assume you already have TerminusDB and Console running in your system 
and you have created a db named <strong>myBikes</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/schema_builder-02.png" alt="Go to model builder"></p>

<p>Form the <strong>myBikes</strong> main page.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the menu <strong>Schema-&gt;Schema Builder</strong> to arrive at the model builder interface.</li>
  <li>In the whiteboard select the node <strong>myBikes Schema</strong>, the list of all available node types will show up.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/schema_builder-03.png" alt="See the whiteboard"></p>

<p>Let’s see the different nodes in detail.</p>

<p><strong>Object</strong> contains a piece of the graph and can be accessed by a unique url.
An Object can have multiple properties and can be contained inside other objects.</p>

<p><strong>Document</strong> is a special type of Object. Documents are always top-level objects, never embedded inside other objects, using the Link Property you can link documents to each other.</p>

<p><strong>Enum</strong> or Enumerated is a special data type that enables a property to be a set of predefined constants. The property must be equal to one of the values that have been predefined for it. To use this set of values you’ll need to create an Enum Property and link it to an Emun Element.</p>

<p>Let’s use these elements in practice.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="add-nodes">Add Nodes</h3>

<p>For storing our data we have to create 3 different Documents  <strong>Bicycle</strong>, <strong>Station</strong> and <strong>Journey</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/schema_builder-04.png" alt="Node List"></p>

<p>Follow the steps and start to build your schema graph.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the <strong>myBikes Schema</strong> node in the whiteboard and click the + icon</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Add Document</strong> from the menu. A new node will be added under the node <strong>Documents</strong></li>
  <li>We start to add <strong>Bicycle</strong> Document. Fill the form in the right sidebar with the data from the image above. (Unique Id:Bicycle..)</li>
  <li>Follow the same steps above for adding the other Documents <strong>Station</strong> and <strong>Journey</strong></li>
  <li>Click on the <strong>Save</strong> icon button in the tools bar to save your work.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>At this point our documents are completely unrelated.</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/schema_builder-05.png" alt="Documents"></p>

<hr>

<h3 id="add-properties">Add Properties</h3>

<p>To descrive your Documents and to link them with each other, we need to add properties to our documents.
We have various different type of properties identified by datatypes</p>

<p>DataProperty : String/Numeric/Geo/Temporal Property refers to the format of data storage</p>

<p>ObjectProperty : Enum/Link Property refers to a relationship between elements</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/schema_builder-06.png" alt="Property list"></p>

<p>Let’s add the property <strong>start_station</strong>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the node <strong>Journey</strong> in the whiteboard, in the right panel click on the <strong>Properties</strong></li>
  <li>In the properties panel, click <strong>Add Property</strong> in the pop up menu you can see the list of the available property types.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Property Link</strong> after the form shows up, fill the fields with the value reported in the table above (Unique ID/Label/Description).</li>
  <li>Click on the <strong>Link to Type</strong> menu and Select <strong>Bike Station</strong> 
  <em>Links to Type is a list with all the node that you can linked</em></li>
  <li>Follow the step 1 to 4 for adding the others properties <strong>end_station</strong>, <strong>journey_bicycle</strong></li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/schema_builder-07.png" alt="Property start_station"></p>

<ol>
  <li>Click on the <strong>Save</strong> icon button in the tools bar to save your work.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Relationships</strong> in the right panel top bar to see the links.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>We have created our relationship beetween Documents.</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/schema_builder-08.png" alt="Property start_station"></p>

<hr>

<h3 id="schema-evolution-and-compatibility">Schema Evolution and Compatibility</h3>

<p>An important aspect of data management is schema evolution. 
My initial schema is defined, but my application now need to change it, what can I do?</p>

<p>Let’s see.</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/schema_builder-09.png" alt="Property start_station"></p>

<p>Now we need to model the Document <strong>Station</strong> as Object, so we have to delete the Document <strong>Station</strong> and create a new node type.</p>

<p>The database doesn’t allow you to delete a node if it is related with another node.
More precisely the node can not have children and it can not be the range of a Link Property/Enum 
Property.
This constraint is used to prevent actions that would destroy the integrity of the data model.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="delete-a-node">Delete a Node</h3>

<p>Here the step for doing this.
First we have to remove all the relationship related to our node.</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/schema_builder-10.png" alt="Property start_station"></p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the Document <strong>Journey</strong> node in the whiteboard, in the right panel Select <strong>Properties</strong>. the list of the properties will show up.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>End Station</strong> Property and delete it using the red delete icon.</li>
  <li>Follow the above steps for deleting <strong>Start Station</strong> Property too.</li>
  <li>All the <strong>Station</strong> node constraints have been removed</li>
  <li>Select the <strong>Station</strong> node in the whiteboard, in the right panel, Click the delete red icon.</li>
</ol>

<p>Deleting a node is easy at this stage because we don’t have any data in the database.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="add-an-object-type">Add an Object Type</h3>

<p>Now we add the <strong>Station</strong> node as Object Type.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the <strong>Schema myBikes</strong>, click on the + icon, from the menu Select <strong>Add Object</strong> a new node will be add in the whiteboard.</li>
  <li>As we did before we have to add the Unique ID/Station and the Label/Description Bike Station in the fields in the right panel.</li>
  <li>Select the Node <strong>Journey</strong> and add the Link Property <strong>Start Station</strong> <strong>End Station</strong> again (Follow the add property steps above).</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/schema_builder-11.png" alt="Property start_station"></p>

<hr>

<h3 id="difference-between-object-and-document-types">Difference between Object and Document Types</h3>

<p>The difference in Linking a Property to a Document than a Object is in how this data will be represented and managed in document form.</p>

<p>Here is an example with bike data</p>

<p>If <strong>Station</strong> is a Document Type you have to create a <strong>Station</strong> Document <br>
and link the id of the Document <strong>Station</strong> with the <strong>Journey</strong> Document</p>

<p>This means that if you remove one <strong>Journey</strong> Document 
it removes the link but not the data in the related <strong>Station</strong> document.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, the <strong>Station</strong> is an Object Type, its data will be embedded in the <strong>Journey</strong> Document 
So if you remove one Journey Document entry it will be remove the related <strong>Station</strong>
Object.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="add-an-enum-node">Add an Enum Node</h3>

<p>We continue our Schema evolution by adding the <strong>Type Bike</strong> enum node</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/schema_builder-12.png" alt="Property start_station"></p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the <strong>Schema myBikes</strong>, Select the + icon, from the menu Select <strong>Add Enum</strong></li>
  <li>The Enum node will be added in the whiteboard</li>
  <li>Fill the fields in the right panel (Unique Id:Bike_Type..)</li>
  <li>Select values, Fill the fields and click the button <strong>Add a value</strong> for adding the list of possible values</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h3 id="link-the-enum-node-with-the-enum-property">Link the Enum Node with the Enum Property</h3>

<p>We are going to create our Enum property for the <strong>Bicycle</strong> Documents</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the <strong>Bicycle</strong> node</li>
  <li>In the right panel, Select the <strong>Properties</strong> tab</li>
  <li>Select the <strong>Add Property</strong> menu and Click <strong>Enum Property</strong></li>
  <li>Fill the Property fields in the Property panel (Unique ID:bicycle_type ….)</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Enum Type</strong> menu Select <strong>Bike Type</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>We said that the property <strong>Bicycle Type</strong> in <strong>Bicycle</strong> Document is a string with a value chosen from a list of permitted values.</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/schema_builder-13.png" alt="Property start_station"></p>

<hr>

<h3 id="add-children">Add Children</h3>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/schema_builder-14.png" alt="Property start_station"></p>

<p>We are going to add other elements to create a more complex hierarchy</p>

<p>At this point in our project we need to add information about the bike user, we suppose we can have 2 types of user that rent the bike, a registered user and a guest user.</p>

<p>First we create an abstract Document <strong>User</strong> for grouping the different type of user.</p>

<p>An Abstract Document is a completely “abstract class” that is used to group related properties.</p>

<p>Abstract Documents cannot be used to create Data directly, you cannot add data in a <strong>User</strong>
Document. An abstract Document can have children, all the children will inherit all the parent’s properties and if the children are not abstract, you can insert data as children.</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/schema_builder-15.png" alt="Property start_station"></p>

<p>Let’s see all the steps for creating an abstract document and its children.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the <strong>Document</strong> node in the whiteboard, Select the + icon and from the menu that show up, Choose <strong>Add Document</strong>.</li>
  <li>A new node Document will be added.</li>
  <li>In the right panel fill the fields for the new Document (Unique ID:User, Label:Bike User….)</li>
  <li>Check the <strong>Abstract</strong> checkbox.</li>
  <li>Select the tab <strong>Properties</strong>, from the menu <strong>Add Property</strong> Choose <strong>String Property</strong></li>
  <li>The String Property Panel will show up, fill the fields (Unique ID: email, Label:Email)
<img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/schema_builder-16.png" alt="Property start_station"></li>
  <li>Choose <strong>Email</strong> from the <strong>String Type</strong> menu.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>Cardinality Min</strong> field add 1 (this means that if you add an User Document, the email property must have a value in it).</li>
</ol>

<p><em>we added the Abstract <strong>User</strong> Document with its properties, now let’s add the children.</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the node <strong>Bike User</strong> in the whiteboard, Click on the + icon, from the menu Select <strong>Add Child</strong></li>
  <li>A new Node will be added, in the right panel fill all the fields (Unique Id:Guest ….)</li>
  <li>Follow the above steps for add the <strong>Member</strong> Document too</li>
</ol>

<p>We can decide to not add new properties in the Guest document so the guest user will be identified by the email, but for the <strong>Member</strong> Document we need to add at least the String property Password.</p>

<p>We have to create a Link Property <strong>Bicycle User</strong> in the <strong>Bike Journey</strong> Document for link the <strong>User</strong> Document with the <strong>Bike Journey</strong> Document.</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/schema_builder-17.png" alt="Property start_station"></p>

<hr>

<h3 id="add-a-parent">Add a Parent</h3>

<p>At this point of our project we want to reorganize our nodes.</p>

<p>We have to create an element that can be <strong>a Parent</strong> for an Object node and a Document node. 
Objects can only be children of Object types, Documents can be children of Object Types and Document Types, so we have to create a <strong>New Object Node</strong></p>

<p>We can call this node <strong>Entity</strong>. The <strong>Entity</strong> node is abstract and has a Geo Property  <strong>Position</strong></p>

<p>I am sure you already know all the steps for doing this 😊.</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/schema_builder-18.png" alt="Add Parent"></p>

<p>Let’s group <strong>Bike Station</strong> and <strong>Bicycle</strong> under this new node.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the node <strong>Bicycle</strong> in the whiteboard, in the right panel Select <strong>Relationships</strong></li>
  <li>Under <strong>Add/Remove Parents</strong> panel from the menu …</li></ol></div></div></div></div>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>Yesterday, my cofounder wrote a <a href="https://blog.nillium.com/its-time-to-remove-news-from-facebook-and-google/">controversial post on this blog</a>, presenting a case for news publishers to limit -- or remove -- their reporting from Facebook and Google. &nbsp;The responses were immediate and plentiful, but fascinatingly different depending on the audience.</p><p>On Hacker News, a tech- and startup-focused forum, the link rose to the top of the list before being “flagged” and removed from the front page. &nbsp;The<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25249414"> comments there</a> took a more pragmatic, technical approach to the problem, from “<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25249553">The technical capability already exists in the form of robots.txt and the referer header,</a>” to constant reminders that news organizations <em>need</em> this traffic.</p><p>On the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/k3kmg9/its_time_to_remove_news_from_facebook_and_google/">r/journalism subreddit</a>, we were hit from the other side. &nbsp;Why not just “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/k3kmg9/its_time_to_remove_news_from_facebook_and_google/ge3zqq2/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">nationalize the press so we can quit with the hand-wringing</a>?” suggested one commenter, while another lamented that “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/k3kmg9/its_time_to_remove_news_from_facebook_and_google/ge51kko/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">this idea disenfranchises young journalists who don’t have any name credibility and recognition and need an established platforms [sic] gravitas to help establish them</a>.”</p><p>If ever there was a good illustration of the disconnect we face in trying to make journalism sustainable again, this is it. &nbsp;The tech side that constantly proclaims “information wants to be free,” and sees pay-for-journalism as a solved problem through Substack, and the jaded newsroom audience who sees another tech platform trying to come in and get them financially hooked.</p><p>The problem, of course, is that it is not a problem equally felt across these camps. &nbsp;The Hacker News crowd is absolutely correct when they say that news organizations need the traffic coming from social media and aggregators -- they do! -- but that is a sign of addiction, not a healthy ecosystem. &nbsp;And the journalist demographic has every reason to assume the worst, because they have been hurt before.</p><p>The economics of this are simple. &nbsp;</p><p>A few decades ago, people subscribed to newspapers, written on paper, that were delivered every morning. &nbsp;The subscription fee never fully covered the cost of running a newspaper; ads appeared between articles, and that subscription base guaranteed an audience for the sponsors. &nbsp;These publications naively started putting their articles online for free -- if advertising could buoy their business up until this point, why would the web be any different? &nbsp;As the ad market matured, CPMs increased, and slowly, internet advertising started to represent real money.</p><p>But then things went viral. &nbsp;Lots of things. &nbsp;People started sharing news articles they read (or <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/06/16/six-in-10-of-you-will-share-this-link-without-reading-it-according-to-a-new-and-depressing-study/%20Show%20less">didn’t read</a>) on social media. &nbsp;Tech companies tweaked their sorting algorithms to get content to eyeballs -- and did so incredibly successfully. But, this created our first problem.</p><h3 id="problem-1-hard-news-doesn-t-trend">Problem 1: Hard news doesn't trend</h3><p>Admittedly, this is only a problem depending on what side of the fence you sit.</p><p>If your goal -- like that of any number of tech companies -- is to get content in front of your users that they will engage with -- then this has been an unmitigated success. &nbsp;However, if you are reporting out a story for a specific audience, not being able to reach them is problematic. &nbsp;</p><p>At this point, the tech side may wonder why if your articles are so great, the audience isn’t seeking it out. &nbsp;The answer, I suspect, is that the audience does not know it is there.</p><p>Virtually any digital editor will tell you that most traffic bypasses the homepage. &nbsp;Users rarely think &nbsp;“I wonder what is happening today?” and seek out the news site; rather, they are told what is happening by the sorting algorithms and walk away feeling like they are updated. &nbsp;That works to a degree, except that hard news -- especially local news -- does not trend.</p><p>No one shares the summary of last night’s city council meeting. &nbsp;Even the most damning investigative report will only get so far if it is focused on a small area; users outside the area just won’t amplify it.</p><h3 id="problem-2-fake-news">Problem 2: Fake News</h3><p>What <em>does</em> trend? &nbsp;The outrageous, crazy things that you want to share with the world. &nbsp;Of course, that’s not to say all viral headlines are fake, but at this point it seems pretty well accepted that many are.</p><p>Because anyone can write and post anything, these wholly fabricated, or hyper-partisan stories are usually placed in the same regard as those that are rigorously reported and fact-checked. They are then forced to compete against each other for attention.</p><p>Worse yet, these posts can be so malignant that it impugns the reputation of “the media” -- because now you cannot believe what you read.<br></p><h3 id="problem-3-clickbait">Problem 3: Clickbait</h3><p>How do you compete then? &nbsp;By stooping lower. &nbsp;It means publishers resort to writing clickbait headlines to grab a second or two of user attention, and then covering the article page in more clickbait links to keep them there. &nbsp;</p><p>It can even creep into the editorial decisions: Knowing what people are searching for or clicking on can shape what reporters are assigned. <br></p><h3 id="problem-4-all-the-ads">Problem 4: All the ads</h3><p>Why do drivers in your area need to know about that new law? &nbsp;What celebrity finally “broke [their] silence?” &nbsp;I <em>know</em> I won’t believe what happens next. &nbsp;</p><p>These ads are annoying. These ads are detrimental to the user experience that any publication wants. &nbsp;But these ads are needed -- they are a symptom of the addiction. &nbsp;When the flow of users becomes constricted, these organizations have no other choice but to exploit their traffic for as much as it is worth; it’s survival.</p><p>Those ads in between articles in the print newspaper? &nbsp;They still exist, but they are now sold by Facebook, Twitter, and Google. &nbsp;Money is still being made off of the reader, it just is not going to the people doing the reporting. &nbsp;And partnerships between newsrooms and tech giants are generally for big, national outlets, leaving the local newsroom to suffer.</p><h3 id="problem-5-brain-drain">Problem 5: Brain drain</h3><p>As awful as this all is for the casual news consumer, it is worse for the people working on it all day everyday. &nbsp;No one wants assignment-by-SEO. No one wants the ads all over the place. And most of all, no one wants the layoffs. &nbsp;So those that can are fleeing to Substack, or creating their own publications.</p><p>That is great for them, and I wish them all the best. &nbsp;But as that Reddit commenter pointed out, that only works for reporters who have made a name for themselves. &nbsp;It is much more common to follow someone because you like their ideas than someone who you think reports out a story well. &nbsp;</p><p>What about all of those wide eyed, young, idealistic reporters <em>looking </em>to make a name for themselves? &nbsp;What about all of the important stories <em>they</em> are covering? &nbsp;Will now fewer people go to the legacy publications once the big names jump ship?<br></p><h3 id="what-we-re-doing">What we're doing</h3><p>This is why Xana wrote what she did, and made the case firms should pay up. &nbsp;First, it got your attention enough to rise above the noise (a requirement, as discussed above).

<p>The traditional CentOS Linux distribution as we know it is dead. Here is another drop in the ocean of opinion pieces that follow the news of its death. After cooling down from the initial rush of blood to my head, here is my take on this event.</p>

<h2>Why Did This Probably Happen</h2>
<p>With the advent of DevOps and SRE, businesses and startups are moving away from the old-school concept of traditional server clusters to running their applications on disposable containers. The trend is clear and true. Developers are increasingly less reliant on a tried-and-true Linux distribution that lasts for a decade. With containers, developers can develop, test, deploy, and rollback with blazing fast velocity.

</p><h2>How It Will Affect All of Us</h2>
<p>Without a doubt one of the most popular Linux distributions to ever exist, CentOS was prevalent among all kinds of computing systems ranging from simple database servers to billion-dollar computer clusters. There are countless organizations have made the business decision to keep using the traditional model, or organizations that do not require microservices at all. With CentOS drawn from below their feet, a lot of organizations will be forced to migrate to another option, or fork out a pretty penny for RHEL. Besides, on-prem deployment of any container orchestration tool still requires a stable Linux distribution.</p>

<p>The second ripple effect it will have is towards the skilled professionals who have spend decades on CentOS. Not every company is willing to pay up for RHEL or risk using CentOS Stream. For those who migrate to Debian or OpenSUSE, they will have to retrain and adapt with different tools.</p>

<h2>Questioning IBM/Red Hat Decisions</h2>
<p>The most obvious of them all was, was it necessary for CentOS to die? With CentOS Stream to track ahead of RHEL, it is still possible for CentOS to remain functional and serve its purpose. This is clearly a business decision to increase profits. It used to be that developers wanted to write for RHEL but did not want pay for it; CentOS filled that need. What also happened was that some companies decided that they wanted the free experience all the way. Red Hat now provides free use of the Red Hat Universal Base Image for developers. With this, companies no longer have an excuse.</p>

<p>Secondly, why the PR disaster? In hindsight, there is no way to deliver this news gently to the public. However, I felt that Red Hat gave the bird to the open source community, especially those who contributed to CentOS, by pulling the plug on Centos 8 towards the end of 2021. There wasn't even a courtesy to end it later then CentOS 7's EOL date, June 30th 2024. A raw-dogged "Pay up, now" to everyone. </p>

<p>Last of all, what is the next move from Red Hat/IBM? With CentOS gone, there is a huge vacuum for another to take its place. RHEL sources are still available and can still be repackaged. While Red Hat currently has massive influence over Linux in general, is this a arrogant statement proclaiming "Hey, you can't live without me"? Another ominuous take with conspiratorial undertones would be that Red Hat plans to eventually scrap the FOSS model, but I would have to wear my tin hat for this one.

</p><h2>So, What Happens Now?</h2>
<p>Almost immediately after the release, all the attention is now directed to towards filling the space that CentOS will leave behind. Undoubtedly, Ubuntu and SUSE would try to assert their presence with their open source alternatives. Debian, the largest behemoth of them all, hopefully will receive funding and participation like never before. A silver lining of this event would perhaps be the buzzing excitement of what will be and can be. It is time to be excited about Linux again. I, for one, have to begin migrating my CentOS containers and virtual machines to Debian.</p>

                    <p>Let me start this article by saying - I love Elm!</p><p>I enjoy learning new programming languages, and Elm has been my favorite language for almost 2 years now. I like everything about it - compiler error messages, type system soundness, <a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Elm Architecture</a>, pure functions, immutability, performance, etc. Around the time I discovered Elm, I got a job at <a href="https://www.streamlit.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Streamlit</a>, and I immediately saw the potential for how Elm and Streamlit could work together to supercharge apps. With the release of the Streamlit components architecture earlier this year, this was finally possible, and I'm excited to show you how! To get a taste, check out this awesome Elm <a href="https://terezka.github.io/line-charts/" rel="noopener noreferrer">line charts</a> library embedded into a Python <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/kantuni/streamlit-elm-chart/app.py" rel="noopener noreferrer">data app</a>.</p><p>Before we start, if you're new to Streamlit and would like to learn more about it - check out these two articles "<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/coding-ml-tools-like-you-code-ml-models-ddba3357eace?sk=f7774c54571148b33cde3ba6c6310086">Intro to Streamlit</a>" and "<a href="https://blog.streamlit.io/introducing-streamlit-components/">Intro to Streamlit components</a>".</p><h2 id="ready-player-one">Ready Player One</h2><p>Here's the "<a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/">Hello World</a>" of Elm examples:</p><pre><code>
import Browser
import Html exposing (Html, button, div, text)
import Html.Events exposing (onClick)

main =
  Browser.sandbox { init = 0, update = update, view = view }

type Msg = Increment | Decrement

update msg model =
  case msg of
    Increment -&gt;
      model + 1

    Decrement -&gt;
      model - 1

view model =
  div []
    [ button [ onClick Decrement ] [ text "-" ]
    , div [] [ text (String.fromInt model) ]
    , button [ onClick Increment ] [ text "+" ]
    ]

</code></pre><p>It is a simple counter app that demonstrates the simplicity, robustness, and beauty of The Elm Architecture. </p><p>We're going to build a Streamlit app that will use the above example as a Streamlit component. Streamlit components let you expand the functionality provided in the base Streamlit package. You can use Streamlit components to share any web-based UI, widget, or data visualization code with the broader Python data science community.</p><p>Creating a Streamlit component takes - literally - 2 lines of Python.</p><pre><code>
import streamlit as st
import streamlit.components.v1 as components

counter_component = components.declare_component(
    "counter",
    url="http://localhost:3000/",
)

count = counter_component(key="count", default=0)
st.markdown(f"The value of the counter is **{count}**.")

</code></pre><ul><li>We declare a new component by passing the name and the location of the component front-end files (or the URL of your development server).</li><li>We provide the default value for the counter.</li><li>We make sure that the component does not re-render unnecessarily by providing the <code>key</code>.</li></ul><h2 id="brave-new-world">Brave New World</h2><p>To establish a two-way connection between our app and the component, we are going to add <a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/ports.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">ports</a> to our Elm app.</p><p>To send a message from Elm to Streamlit, let's define a port that receives a number and produces a command.</p><pre><code>
port fromElm : Int -&gt; Cmd msg

</code></pre><p>We will need to send the new value back to Streamlit on <code>Increment</code> and <code>Decrement</code> events. So let's modify our update function to reflect that.</p><pre><code>
Increment -&gt;
    ( { model | count = model.count + 1 }
    , fromElm (model.count + 1)
    )

Decrement -&gt;
    ( { model | count = model.count - 1 }
    , fromElm (model.count - 1)
    )

</code></pre><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="thereandbackagain">There and Back Again</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>To send a message from Streamlit to Elm, let's define a port that receives a number and produces a subscription.</p><pre><code>
port fromJS : (Int -&gt; msg) -&gt; Sub msg

</code></pre><p>Firstly, we will define a new message type.</p><pre><code>
type Msg
    = Default Int
    | Increment
    | Decrement

</code></pre><p>Secondly, we will add a handler for that message type to update.</p><pre><code>
Default value -&gt;
    ( { model | count = value }
    , Cmd.none
    )

</code></pre><p>And finally, we will subscribe to the messages on that port.</p><pre><code>
subscriptions : Model -&gt; Sub Msg
subscriptions _ =
    fromJS Default

</code></pre><p>When a message from JavaScript is sent to that port, the <code>Default</code> event will get a number and set the counter value to that number.</p><p>And that's <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/kantuni/streamlit-elm-counter/app.py">it</a>!</p><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Recording-2020-12-08-at-03.30.25-PM.gif" alt=""></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="foundation">Foundation</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>I hope this tutorial will help you build dazzling components in Elm. I believe there are a lot of incredible Elm packages that would boost the look and feel of Python data apps. To give you an idea, <a href="https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/gampleman/elm-visualization/latest/">elm-visualization</a> would make a fantastic Streamlit Component - and there are many, many more. I'm excited to see more people discover the awesomeness of Elm, and I look forward to seeing what you create!</p><p>P.S. <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/kantuni/streamlit-elm-chart/app.py">Both</a> <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/kantuni/streamlit-elm-counter/app.py">apps</a> are available on GitHub and have been deployed using <a href="https://www.streamlit.io/sharing-sign-up">Streamlit sharing</a>.</p>

December 9, 2020 | https://serokell.io/blog/daml-interview | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://serokell.io/blog/daml-interview">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Digital Asset is a fintech company that helps companies design and run the next generation of business applications. One of their products is <a href="https://daml.com/">DAML</a>, a functional smart contract language.</p><p>While we have already covered Digital Asset in our <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/functional-programming-in-fintech">functional programming in fintech overview</a>, I recently got a chance to talk with Anthony Lusardi, a developer advocate at DAML, and delve deeper into the product. In the interview, we talk about DAML, the benefits and downsides of functional programming languages, and their practical experience while building DAML.</p><p><strong>Hi! Could you shortly explain what DAML is?</strong></p><p>Sure! DAML is an open-source smart contract language with roots firmly planted in Haskell. It’s designed so multiple parties/business entities can perform workflows with high assurances and consistency between parties. So you have this transactional language that is atomic with every update, high level, portable across data persistence backends, and with strongly enforced permissions over who can update data when.</p><p>In more practical terms, imagine you’re managing an operationally complex workflow where multiple different stakeholders (ie. parties) need to see and interact with different parts of the workflow, definitely should not see other parts, and have a complex tree of dependencies. Today implementing such a thing is truly hard to manage with complex access control schemes implemented at a level outside of your program, and substantial difficulties maintaining data privacy. DAML treats these concerns as first-class elements of every class (what DAML calls templates) and thus makes it much easier to implement and manage these types of workflows.</p><p><strong>Why should customers choose DAML over building their project on Ethereum, Tezos, or other public blockchains?</strong></p><p>This really boils down to their needs. If you’re building something that truly needs permissionless, censorship-resistant, and entirely public transactions, then a public blockchain might be a good fit despite what would be substantial tradeoffs for most real-world applications in terms of low data storage, poor privacy, and high cost. DAML, on the other hand, won’t give you a permissionless architecture but will allow you to have high data storage, strong privacy, and significantly lower costs.</p><p>In practice, very few use cases actually need the properties of a permissionless public blockchain. The one that comes to mind for me where a public blockchain is a better fit would be Bitcoin for permissionless value storage/transfer.</p><p>While I think there are some interesting projects on Ethereum, I’m not personally convinced most use cases need Ethereum’s architecture as, with a few exceptions, most have components that in practice are replaceable and centrally administered by their development team. In such cases, these teams are trading off ease of operation for decentralized architectures and really getting neither. That is, of course, open for extensive theoretical debate that is well beyond the scope of this interview :)</p><p><strong>What’s the main thing that separates DAML from other enterprise blockchain platforms like Corda and Hyperledger Fabric?</strong></p><p>DAML applications can be written once and deployed on any supported platform without changing a single line of code. In this way, your code written in DAML is decoupled from the underlying backend allowing for much greater architectural flexibility.</p><p>In fact, DAML actually runs on these platforms (and many others) with a runtime that runs alongside them and uses them for data persistence and consensus. It’ll even run on PostgreSQL. It’s truly platform-agnostic.</p><p><strong>What’s the benefit of basing DAML on functional programming languages like Haskell and Scala?</strong></p><p>Simple. Functional programmers are the best programmers.</p><p>More seriously, though, the language is based on Haskell but has conventions and differences that make it uniquely its own language. The general benefits are a high degree of composability, as anyone who writes in functional languages knows, when your types match your functions and components can easily work together and extend each other. Functional languages are also beneficial for the more distributed applications that DAML is designed for because they reduce bugs and allow for better ensuring that operations will or won’t complete; both of which are big concerns whenever you’re writing a distributed application.</p><p><strong>Are there any features of the language that really help smart contract language development?</strong></p><p>Most definitely. DAML has two features that really help. The first is that all data concerns are laid out in templates and strongly typed. In a lot of ways, these templates are much like classes in imperative languages <strong><em>but</em></strong> they will always do what you expect them to.</p><p>The other feature (and this is really smart-contract specific) is that DAML treats permissions as first-class citizens, so we have observers, signatories, and choices which you can consider respectively akin to UNIX’s <code>rwx </code>permissions. Every template specifies ahead of time who has the authority to read, write, and execute functions on a given instance of that template (what we call a contract in DAML).</p><p><strong>Have you seen any non-technical benefits? ( e.g. is it easier to hire good developers, etc.)</strong></p><p>Reductions in codebase size and operational complexity are definitely benefits. It’s really designed from the ground up to allow developers to focus solely on business logic without having to worry about the backend. These factors, in turn, make DAML applications cheaper to maintain and easier to extend. Basically, all the benefits functional programmers have been touting for a long time.</p><p>One other great benefit is readability. While it takes a programmer to write DAML, many non-programmers can comprehend much of a DAML contract with just a little bit of familiarization. This really comes as a direct consequence of how explicit DAML is about data concerns and permissions. You can check out an example of this readability at <a href="https://beer.woah.xyz/">https://beer.woah.xyz</a>.</p><p><strong>What about downsides? Are there any downsides to choosing a programming language for your project that is not that popular?</strong></p><p>There certainly are, but if you’re reading this blog post, then you probably already use non-mainstream programming languages that are still wonderful and let you get your work done in effective ways that mainstream languages don’t support. Innovation happens at the edges so I think DAML’s benefits in the smart contract space and its enthusiastic and supportive engineers on our forum more than outweigh the tradeoffs.</p><p>Really the biggest concern people have is essentially “if I choose to invest time in learning this language, will it still be there next year?” and for that, the answer is yes. DAML is an open-source language maintained by Digital Asset, which is a company of 140+ people currently and growing. DAML will be here for years to come.</p><p><strong>Do you feel happy about your choice to create an FP language for your project?</strong></p><p>I don’t think you could build a non-functional language that accomplished what DAML does. It’s really a prerequisite for the rest of the stack. So in that sense, yes, and also the decision was made well before I joined Digital Asset.</p><p><strong>If you had to give one tip to customers looking to come into the blockchain/DLT space, what would it be?</strong></p><p>If the app needs you to first buy a token to use it, then run away.</p><hr><p>I would like to thank Anthony for the interview and wish DAML the best of luck in conquering the private blockchain market!</p><p>If you wish to get more details on DAML, go straight to their <a href="https://daml.com/">homepage</a>. You can also follow DAML on <a href="https://twitter.com/damldriven">Twitter</a> for updates and cool blog articles.</p><p>For more interviews with interesting projects in the functional programming space, be sure to check out the <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/interviews">interview</a> section of our blog.</p></div></div>]]>

<p><span>F</span>eel-good moments are difficult to come by on Twitter in Pakistan. In between the political infighting and trolls, though, there was a brief moment where the ugliness the platform often brings out in people gave way to the app’s potential for humanity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October, a Karachi school teacher, Aimun Faisal, tweeted questions from her students about space and space travel. “Do you get scared that your space shuttle might get lost?” one 10-year-old asked. Ms. Faisal tagged NASA and other space agencies in the post, encouraging readers to retweet it and bring it to their attention. <a href="https://gulfnews.com/world/asia/pakistan/nasa-astronauts-scientists-answer-pakistani-fourth-graders-science-questions-on-twitter-1.1602755591289">It worked</a>.</p>



<p>A Canadian astronaut who has flown in a space shuttle twice replied that he wasn’t scared because Earth was nearby, and he could use the stars to find his way. “I felt especially comforted when I flew over home,” <a href="https://twitter.com/Cmdr_Hadfield/status/1316390465277767682?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1316390465277767682%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgulfnews.com%2Fworld%2Fasia%2Fpakistan%2Fnasa-astronauts-scientists-answer-pakistani-fourth-graders-science-questions-on-twitter-1.1602755591289">he tweeted</a>. “Here’s a photo I took of Karachi — can you find your school?”</p>



<p>It’s the kind of interaction that leads one to believe that perhaps all you need in life is a Twitter account and a heart that still beats. The media ate it up too: Ms. Faisal and her tweet were in all the major newspapers and even on TV. We were gushy over Ms. Faisal; we wished there were more teachers like her.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just a few weeks later, people were suggesting that Ms. Faisal should go jump into a river or move to another country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It all turned after — what else? — a series of tweets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One evening this past September, a woman set out in her car on a motorway outside Lahore, her two children in tow. Motorways in Pakistan are safer than most roads there; they have their own police, who have a reputation, unlike other police units, for being well-dressed and resistant to corruption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That evening, the woman’s car ran out of fuel. She locked her car doors and made some phone calls, but the rescue service didn’t answer, and she couldn’t get through to her family. By now, it was past midnight. She made more calls and waited for a friend to come pick her up. While she waited, two men emerged from the darkness, broke her car window, and when she fought back, took her children into some nearby bushes. She scrambled to save them, and while she fought, she was gang-raped.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the pre–social media age, if a rape story ever got more than a couple of column inches on the inside pages of a newspaper, the victim not only had asked for it but, by reporting it and making it public, was asking for something more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an interview with the <em>Washington Post</em>, Pakistan’s former president and army chief Pervez Musharraf (now absconded from the country) once said <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2005/09/19/musharraf-denies-rape-comments/5f2e0d4c-5ff2-4273-81e5-878cd59a1744/">Pakistani women get themselves raped so they can get a Canadian visa</a>. He probably thought he was being funny or insightful. When his office denied his having said it, the <em>Post</em> made the audio public. You can hear one of his aides laughing in the background.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Attitudes toward rape haven’t changed much since the Musharraf days, but there was something about the awfulness of a woman trapped with her children on a motorway at night that struck a chord with the Pakistani public. As the news rippled through Twitter, #LahoreMotorwayIncident became a trending hashtag. The details of the crime were so grotesque that, for a few days, it <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-54186609">seemed the nation actually believed that rape was a crime</a> and that the woman hadn’t asked for it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pakistan’s traditional and social media go into this kind of outrage cycle when children get raped, or get raped and then killed, which happens more often than one can stomach. There was genuine fury across the country when a 7-year-old girl was raped, strangled, and left in a rubbish heap two years ago. <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1439587">Her name was Zainab</a>. On Twitter and Facebook, users argued over whether her rapist and killer should be hanged in public, quartered, doused in acid, or just locked up for life.</p>



<p>After the motorway incident, the usual bloodlust was on display. There were calls for public hangings and for chopping up the culprits. Prime Minister Imran Khan even appeared on a TV interview saying <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/16/asia/imran-khan-chemical-castration-rapists-intl/index.html">he has been contemplating chemical castration as a punishment for such crimes</a>.</p>

<p>And while the Lahore rapists were still on the loose, the newly appointed Lahore police chief appeared on one of the nightly news shows during the wall-to-wall media coverage. In effect, he said he was surprised that a mother of two had decided to take the motorway when another road would have sufficed for her journey. And if she had to take the motorway, he went on to ask, couldn’t she at least have checked her gas tank?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ms. Faisal, the teacher we had fawned over just weeks prior for her tweets about space travel, was outraged. On Twitter, she was one of many to demand the police chief’s resignation, tweeting in disgust at the craven responses to the news she and others were seeing, rhetorical questions as to why the woman had failed to prevent her own assault.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In return, our beloved Ms. Faisal was met with a flood of insults; trolls suggested she leave Pakistan if she had a problem with it. Being stuck on the motorway without gas became an internet meme that small-time politicians and social media trolls lobbed at one another. Somewhere along the way, “Why didn’t she check her petrol tank before leaving her home?” replaced the original question: “What kind of beasts would rape a woman in front of her children?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>How did this horror morph into a meme? Does every one of us carry inside us a bit of General Musharraf, smirking while his aides giggle?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Long before we had social media, Pakistan swam through its sea of miseries on the backs of jokes. The mausoleum of Pakistan’s longest-serving dictator, General Zia’ul Haq, is jokingly referred to as Jaws Square. Guess why? Because, after ruling over us for 11 years, he died in a plane crash, and only his teeth survived.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jokes back then went viral before we ever began to call them “viral.” You would hear one about the dictator in Urdu in Karachi one day, and the next day in Peshawar, someone would tell you it in Pashto. Jokes eased us out of our terror.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But now the jokes themselves have become the terror. You can make a joke about a dead dictator, or Osama bin Laden becoming fish food, but how do you laugh at a joke about a woman raped in front of her children on the side of the motorway in the dead of night? Jokes were meant to subvert the powerful, not kick the poor to the ground.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For a brief moment, social media in Pakistan made it easy to laugh at despots and oppressors. They answered with troll farms, indoctrinating the youth to be subservient to power. Even in the midst of incidents so nauseating that they capture the attention of our fractured social media, the horrors of which seem undeniable, the trolls find ways to mock and belittle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In November, another shocking piece of news roiled Pakistan’s social media: A 4-year-old rape survivor told her gut-wrenching story in a video that went viral. It was so harrowing, I couldn’t bring myself to watch it, even for reporting purposes. In another video, also shared widely online, the doctor who treated her after the assault broke down crying.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Twitter, it’s easy to find redemption in the narrative too. In the middle of the outrage cycle, social media made a hero of the policeman <a href="https://www.gulftoday.ae/news/2020/11/14/pakistani-policeman-uses-own-daughter-as-bait-to-nab-rapists">who had found the girl’s rapist by enlisting his own daughter to lure him</a>. The rapist was killed in a police encounter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The policeman and his underage daughter were forced to take this extreme step because there were no women officers in his district. The prime minister called to congratulate the man, and his daughter was awarded a million rupees as a prize along with a guaranteed college scholarship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ms. Faisal, who by now has endured a litany of abuses online, questioned the collective satisfaction on social media. As proud as we are of the police officer, she tweeted, the story said more about the country’s broken system than it did about heroism. “No police officer should be forced to risk his family to perform his duty,”<a href="https://twitter.com/bluemagicboxes/status/1327209635594588165"> she wrote</a>.</p>



<p>“Tum kabhi khush na hona,” someone tweeted back. “You’ll never be happy.”</p>

        <div><p>Over the past weeks and months, we’ve seen people coming to YouTube to learn more about where and how to vote or learning more about a candidate or an issue. We’ve seen news organizations grow their audience. And we’ve seen people turn to YouTube for the latest election results or simply to follow an historic event with the highest voting turnout in over a century in the U.S.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our main goal going into the election season was to make sure we’re connecting people with authoritative information, while also limiting the reach of misinformation and removing harmful content. The work here is ongoing and we wanted to provide an update.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div>

        <div><h2>Removing content that violates our policies</h2><p>Our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/policies/community-guidelines/">Community Guidelines</a> prohibit spam, scams, or other manipulated media, coordinated influence operations, and any content that seeks to incite violence. Since September, we've terminated over 8000 channels and thousands of harmful and misleading elections-related videos for violating our existing policies. Over 77% of those removed videos were taken down before they had 100 views.&nbsp;</p><p>We also work to make sure that the line between what is removed and what is allowed is drawn in the right place. Our policies prohibit misleading viewers about where and how to vote. We also disallow content alleging widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of a historical U.S. Presidential election. However in some cases, that has meant allowing controversial views on the outcome or process of counting votes of a current election as election officials have worked to finalize counts.&nbsp;</p><p>Yesterday was the safe harbor deadline for the U.S. Presidential election and enough states have certified their election results to determine a President-elect. Given that, we will start removing any piece of content uploaded today (or anytime after) that misleads people by alleging that widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of the 2020 U.S. Presidential election, in line with our approach towards historical U.S. Presidential elections. For example, we will remove videos claiming that a Presidential candidate won the election due to widespread software glitches or counting errors. We will begin enforcing this policy today, and will ramp up in the weeks to come. As always, news coverage and commentary on these issues can remain on our site if there’s sufficient <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/look-how-we-treat-educational-documentary-scientific-and-artistic-content-youtube/">education, documentary, scientific or artistic</a> context.</p></div>

        <div><h2>Connecting people to authoritative information</h2><p>While only a small portion of watch time is election-related content, YouTube continues to be an important source of election news. On average 88% of the videos in top 10 search results related to elections came from authoritative news sources (amongst the rest are things like newsy late-night shows, creator videos and commentary). And the most viewed channels and videos are from news channels like NBC and CBS.</p></div>

Collectively, these information panels have been shown over 4.5 billion times. Starting today, we will update this information panel, linking to the “2020 Electoral College Results” page from the Office of the Federal Register, noting that as of December 8, states have certified Presidential election results, with Joe Biden as the President-elect. It will also continue to include a link to CISA, explaining that states certify results after ensuring ballots are properly counted and correcting irregularities and errors.</p></div>

      <div>
        <div><p>Now let’s look at recommendations, one of the main ways our viewers find content. Limiting the reach of borderline content and prominently surfacing authoritative information are important ways we protect people from problematic content that doesn’t violate our Community Guidelines. Over 70% of recommendations on election-related topics came from authoritative news sources and the top recommended videos and channels for election-related content were primarily authoritative news. In fact, the top 10 authoritative news channels were recommended over 14X more than the top 10 non-authoritative channels on election-related content.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite these encouraging results, we recognize there's always more to do. For example, while problematic misinformation represents a fraction of 1% of what's watched on YouTube in the U.S., we know we can bring that number down even more. And some videos, while not recommended prominently on YouTube, continue to get high views, sometimes coming from other sites. We're continuing to consider this and other new challenges as we make ongoing improvements.&nbsp;</p><p>We understand the need for intense scrutiny on our elections-related work. Our teams work hard to ensure we are striking a balance between allowing for a broad range of political speech and making sure our platform isn't abused to incite real-world harm or broadly spread harmful misinformation. We welcome ongoing debate and discussion and will keep engaging with experts, researchers and organizations to ensure that our policies and products are meeting that goal. And as always, we'll apply learnings from this election to our ongoing efforts to protect the integrity of elections around the world.<br></p></div>

Why? As you will see below, when we use the right data structures it becomes much easier to write functions that operate on them, which in turn leads to fun and profit!</p><p>The goal of this article is to show you an example of how to approach coming up with good data structures. We'll do this by comparing three different data structures for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe">Tic Tac Toe</a> board.</p><p>Here's a sneak peek at them. Which one would you bet your lunch money on?</p><figure><img src="https://monicao.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/2020-11-25/tic_tac_toe_boards_elixir.png" alt="boards"></figure><h2 id="a-quick-real-world-example">A quick real-world example</h2><p>But first, let me describe a problem I ran into in the past. I was building an Elixir/Phoenix application that served as a backend to a React client. One of the API endpoints was designed to serve up a large chunk of the current user's state, because &nbsp; &nbsp;we wanted the React application to be very fast after the initial page load. The initial JSON payload looked something like this:</p><pre><code>{
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "full_name": "Bob Dobolina",
    "email": "bob@dobo.inc",
    "projects": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Project 1",
        "proofs": [
          {
            "id": 1, 
            "title": "A design proof",
            "comments": [...]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
</code></pre><p>On the user's dashboard we show a list of projects, and that's fairly easy to do with this structure. Where things get hairy, is when we render the page that displays a proof along with the comments for that proof. With this deeply nested data structure it would have been a real pain for the React client to traverse the tree and pull the data for a specific proof. The solution was to flatten this data structure and make look-up by id easier. The data structure had to make sense for the main operation we were performing on it, which was data lookup by id.</p><h2 id="the-three-steps">The three steps</h2><p>The examples below are in Elixir, but the general approach applies to any programming language. Here is the general approach:</p><ol><li>Make a list of the operations you will need to perform on the data structure</li><li>Brainstorm some data structures</li><li>Evaluate each data structure by going over the operations you need to perform on them</li></ol><p>At this stage you want to get a sense of whether or not the code will be easy to write and the performance is OK in terms of CPU and memory usage.</p><p>If you are thinking: "I work on web applications for businesses. What could I possibly learn from a Tic Tac Toe game?", I ask for your patience. The takeaways from this article are very relevant to the algorithmic problems we have to solve in our day-to-day work.</p><h2 id="what-are-the-operations-that-will-be-performed-on-the-board">What are the operations that will be performed on the board?</h2><p>First, let's put together a list of the operations that we will perform on the data structure, because without knowing this, we cannot evaluate if the data structures we're coming up with are any good. There are many ways we could represent a 3x3 board, but which one is a good fit for a Tic Tac Toe board? Well, what are some things we need to do with a Tic Tac Toe board?</p><ul><li>Read and write the value at a given coordinate</li><li>Display the board as a 3 x 3 grid in the terminal</li><li>Check the 8 different positions that indicate a win</li><li>Know if the board is full, so we can see if the game is over</li></ul><h2 id="brainstorm-data-structures-and-evaluate-them">Brainstorm data structures and evaluate them</h2><p>For the rest of the article we will be starting off with this board:</p><pre><code>X _ _
_ O _
_ X _
</code></pre><p>Let's try out some data structures and evaluate the pros and cons.</p><h3 id="first-attempt-nested-tuples-of-rows-and-columns">First attempt: Nested tuples of rows and columns</h3><p>Intuitively, when you think of a 3x3 grid you might think of a matrix or two-dimensional array. One way to implement that in Elixir is by using nested <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Tuple.html#content">Tuples</a>.</p><p>Side note: Why not use nested Lists here? For functional data structures, it's recommended to use tuples in situations where the position of a value means something. In this case, the position of the outer tuples represents rows, and the inner tuples represent columns.</p><pre><code>{
  {"X", nil, nil},
  {nil, "O", nil},
  {nil, "X", nil}
}
</code></pre><p>Seems like a good start.</p><p>Let's look at our list of operations and get a sense of how easy it will be to write these as functions.</p><p><strong>Reading and writing the value at a given coordinate.</strong></p><p>It's the second player's turn and they want to write an O in the top corner of the board at row 1, col 3.</p><p>To do this we might write a function like <code>write(board, row: 1, col: 3, move: "O")</code>.</p><p>How would you implement this function?</p><p>Since data structures in Elixir are immutable, it means we have to re-create the tuple for row 1 and re-create the board tuple to return an updated board. This is not hard to do, but it's clunky and the code is not very readable.</p><p>We don't have to write out the function to know that this would be unwieldy to implement.</p><p><strong>Displaying the board as a 3x3 grid</strong></p><p>This seems like it will be pretty straightforward if we flatten the nested tuples into a list and iterate over each element.</p><p><strong>Checking the 8 different positions that indicate a win</strong></p><p>Thanks to Elixir's pattern matching, checking if a board has a winning line is fairly easy to read and implement. For example, if you wanted to check if the middle row has a winning line you could write.</p><pre><code>def find_winner(
  {
    {_, _, _},
    {a, b, c},
    {_, _, _},
  }
) when a == b and b == c and !is_nil?(a), do: a</code></pre><p><strong>Knowing if the board is full</strong></p><p>To check if the board is full we can count up all the free tiles, which are represented as <code>nil</code>:</p><pre><code>def board_full?(board)
  num_free_tiles = board
    |&gt; Tuple.to_list
    |&gt; Enum.reduce(0, fn(row, free_spots) -&gt;
      free_in_row = row |&gt; Tuple.to_list |&gt; Enum.count(&amp;is_nil/1)
      free_in_row + free_spots
    end)
  num_free_tiles == 0
end</code></pre><p>Maybe there's a better implementation here, but so far, the code above is not looking very easy to read and maintain.</p><p>Overall, one of the weaknesses of this data structure seems to be that it is nested and accessing a value requires reading two tuples. Also tuples are not that easy to iterate over as we have to convert them to lists, if we want to use those juicy <code>Enum</code> functions.</p><h3 id="second-attempt-map-with-coordinates-as-keys">Second attempt: Map with coordinates as keys</h3><p>In the tuple data structure our biggest issue seemed to be making it easy to access values at a given row and column. Let's try making that easier by creating a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Map.html#content">Map</a> where the keys are the <code>{row, col}</code> coordinate.</p><pre><code>{
  {1, 1} =&gt; "X",
  {1, 2} =&gt; nil,
  {1, 3} =&gt; nil,
  {2, 1} =&gt; nil,
  {2, 2} =&gt; "O",
  {2, 3} =&gt; nil,
  {3, 1} =&gt; nil,
  {3, 2} =&gt; "X",
  {3, 3} =&gt; nil
}
</code></pre><p><strong>Reading and writing to a position</strong></p><p>This becomes easier with this data structure.</p><p>For reading the item at row 1, column 1 we can simply do a lookup by key:</p><pre><code>%{{1, 1} =&gt; val} = board
</code></pre><p>To update the value at row 1, column 3 we can use <code>Map.put</code>:</p><pre><code>Map.put(board, {1, 3}, "O")
</code></pre><p><strong>Checking the 8 different positions to win</strong></p><p>We can apply the same strategy for reading a single value to reading a group of values. For example, here's what it would look like if we used pattern matching to check if the first row had equal values.</p><pre><code>@doc ~S"""
  Takes in a board and returns either "X" or "O" if there is a winner or nil.
  
  Example
  
  iex&gt; TicTacToe.find_winner(
      {
        {1, 1} =&gt; "X", {1, 2} =&gt; "O", {1, 3} =&gt; nil,
        {2, 1} =&gt; nil, {2, 2} =&gt; "X", {2, 3} =&gt; nil,
        {3, 1} =&gt; nil, {3, 2} =&gt; "O", {3, 3} =&gt; "X"
      }
    )
  "X"

"""
# checks if the first row has the same tile 
def find_winner(%{{1, 1} =&gt; a, {1, 2} =&gt; b, {1, 3} =&gt; c})
  when a == b and b == c and !is_nil(a), do: a # check first row
def find_winner(%{{1, 1} =&gt; a, {2, 2} =&gt; b, {3, 3} =&gt; c})
  when a == b and b == c and !is_nil(a), do: a # check \ diagonal
def find_winner(%{{1, 3} =&gt; a, {2, 2} =&gt; b, {3, 1} =&gt; c})
  when a == b and b == c and !is_nil(a), do: a # check / diagonal
# ... and so on for the remaining 5 cases
def find_winner(_board), do: nil
</code></pre><p>This is easy enough to implement, but the code itself is not all that easy to read, in my opinion. From reading the first clause, it's not that easy to see that it deals with checking if the first row has the same tiles. It's always a bit of &nbsp;a code smell to me when I have to add a comment to explain what a line does. Also, the board itself is not very readable in the doctest, not to mention that when you <code>IO.inspect</code> it in IEx it will be even less readable, because each key will be printed on a new line.</p><p><strong>Displaying the board as a 3x3 grid</strong></p><p>Maps in Elixir are not ordered, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40392012/is-ordering-of-keys-and-values-preserved-in-elixir-when-you-operate-on-a-map">even though it seems like they are because IEx displays them in order</a>. This means we can't just iterate over the keys and print out the values.</p><p>To display the board we can use a nested loop of row and column ids and look up the values that way.</p><p>This is not ideal. Let's see if we can come up with something better.</p><h4 id="third-attempt-list-of-positions">Third attempt: List of positions</h4><p>Instead of thinking of the board in terms of rows and columns, what if we think of the board with positions from 0 to 8?</p><pre><code>0 1 2
3 4 5
6 7 8
</code></pre><p>In Elixir, we could use a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/List.html#content">List</a> to represent this.</p><pre><code>[
  "X", nil, nil,
  nil, "O", nil,
  nil, "X", nil
]
</code></pre><p>This feels like a better fit than the other two! Are your intuition butterflies fluttering yet? Let's double check this intuition by reviewing the operations.</p><p><strong>Reading and writing to a position</strong></p><p>Instead of saying <em>"Player 1 marked X at row 1 column 3"</em>, we would think of it as <em>"Player 2 marked O at position 2"</em>, which is as simple as <code>List.update_at(board, 2, "X")</code>.</p><p>To check if position 2 has already been taken, it's as easy as <code>Enum.at(board, 2)</code>, which is an O(n) operation, but we don't need to worry about the time complexity for this problem at all, because we are dealing with such a small data set.</p><p><strong>Checking the 8 different positions to win</strong></p><p>Just as with the nested tuple example, checking if there is a winning line on the board we can use pattern matching. Let's say you wanted to check if the second row has all the same numbers:</p><pre><code>[
  _, _, _,
  a, b, c,
  _, _, _
] = board
</code></pre><p>How about a diagonal?</p><pre><code>[
  a, _, _,
  _, b, _,
  _, _, c
] = board

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>‍<em>Lots of interesting Deep learning applications rely on the use of complex architectures fueled by large datasets. With the growing storage capacities and ease of data collection [1], it is very easy to build a large dataset. However, when doing so, one ends up with lots of redundancies within the dataset. Many of these redundancies are systematically introduced by the data collection process: consecutive frames extracted from a video, very similar images collected from the web.</em></p><p>‍</p><p><em>In this blog post, we present the results of a benchmark study showing the benefits of filtering redundant data.</em></p><p>‍</p><p>Redundancies can take multiple forms, the simplest one is having exact image duplicates. Another form is near-duplicates, i.e images shifted with few pixels across some direction or images having slight light changes. These redundancies not only lead to biased results of the model’s performance, be it accuracy or mean average precision mAP score, but also lead to high annotation costs. In addition, redundancies have also been observed in very known academic datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet [2,3].</p><p><em>This benchmark study investigates the effect of redundancies in the image-based datasets collected by AI Retailer Systems (AIRS), an innovative start-up developing a checkout-free solution for retailers, which concentrates to answer “who picks up what?”. In this study, we consider an object detection task. An intelligent vision system recognizes products on a shelf or on a customer’s hand. This study was done as part of my role as a machine learning engineer at Lightly, a tech-based start-up that provides a solution to improve the Machine Learning workflow by finding and removing redundancies in unlabeled data.</em></p><p>This blog post will be structured as follow, we start by describing the dataset, we list the methods used in this study. We present the results obtained and finally, we discuss the importance of filtering redundant data.</p><p>‍</p><h3>AI Retailer System dataset</h3><figure id="w-node-fb91938a7325-e7e87989"><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7ac1d59a6fc121dde87967/5f7ac1d59a6fc116f1e87ac1_1*d-3gi2AuKFbrOm7UnfCIQg.gif"></p><figcaption>Short video sample extracted from AIRS video.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>The dataset used consists of images extracted from short videos capturing a customer grabbing different products. There are two different cameras recording videos of the shelf, each camera has a different angle of view. There are 12 different kinds of products -12 classes.</p><p>The dataset has been manually annotated using the open-source annotation tool Vatic, we measured the annotation rate: number of frames per time unit. In our case this was 2.3 ± 0.8 frames per minute, given that there are 51 objects on average in each image, this is equivalent to 0.51 seconds for each bounding box.</p><figure id="w-node-16a5839147a8-e7e87989"><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7ac1d59a6fc121dde87967/5f7ac1d59a6fc10ddee87ac3_1*Yzs8PZV1FB_MJ5b38ngf-A.png"></p><figcaption>Sample image from Camera 1 with annotations: the box color does not represent the article class.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-ff8edff111f8-e7e87989"><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7ac1d59a6fc121dde87967/5f7ac1d59a6fc1e0c0e87ac4_1*_dvPbzOu1xxvWH3otGcalA.png"></p><figcaption>Sample image from Camera 2 with annotations: the box color does not represent the article class.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>The annotated dataset has 7909 images. The training dataset has 2899 images, 80% of these images are from camera 2 and 20% from camera 1. For the test dataset, it has 5010 images and all of them from camera 1.</p><figure id="w-node-da318627f465-e7e87989"><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7ac1d59a6fc121dde87967/5f7ac1d59a6fc1f6afe87ad4_1*bI7L8tkO5M0ohX70o-MqYg.png"></p><figcaption>Visualization of the train-test setting for AIRS dataset.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>This specific design of the train and test datasets was motivated by the following points: First, we build an imbalanced dataset with a high fraction of images coming from one camera. Second, we make the object detection task hard for the model. With this train-test setting, we can calculate the fraction of images from Camera 1 in the filtered data. Therefore, we can see if there is any re-balancing that is introduced by the different filtering methods used.</p><p>Next, we present the methods used in this case study.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Active learning and Sampling methods</h3><p>To probe the effects of filtering the dataset, we borrowed ideas from the field of <strong>Active learning</strong>.</p><figure id="w-node-04f7b8ea6774-e7e87989"><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7ac1d59a6fc121dde87967/5f7ac1d59a6fc1a186e87ae5_1*OQsiXePTV5fesdkxPB-sIw.png"></p><figcaption>Active learning loop used in this case study.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>Active learning aims at finding a subset of the training data achieving the highest possible performance. In this study, we used the pool-based active learning loop that works as follows: Start with a small fraction of the training dataset called the labeled pool. Train a model on this labeled pool. Then, use the model along with a filtering method to select new data points that should be labeled. Add the newly selected samples to the labeled pool and finally train the model from scratch on the updated labeled pool. After each cycle, we report the model’s performance on the test dataset for each filtering method used. In our case, we used 5% of the training data as the initial labeled pool, we trained the model for 50 epochs, and we added 20% of the training data in each active learning loop.</p><p>The object detection model used in this benchmark study is YOLO V3 (You Only Look Once) [4]. We used the implementation provided by the Ultralytics Github repository. The code was slightly modified in order to introduce the active learning loop.</p><p>As for the filtering methods, we used four different filtering methods provided by Lightly:</p><ul role="list"><li>“<strong>RSS</strong>”: Refers to random sub-sampling which will be used as a baseline.</li><li>“<strong>WTL_unc</strong>”: This method refers to Lightly uncertainty based sub-sampling, it selects difficult images that the model is highly uncertain about. The uncertainty is assessed using the model’s predictions.</li><li>“<strong>WTL_CS</strong>”: This method uses image representations to select images that are both diverse and difficult. It combines uncertainty-based sub-sampling with diversity selection. The image representations are obtained using state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods using the PIP package Boris-ml. The advantage of self-supervised learning methods is that they don’t require annotations to generate image representations.</li><li>“<strong>WTL_pt</strong>”: Relies on pre-trained models to learn image representations, the filtering is performed by removing the most similar images. Similarity in this case is given by the L2 distance between image representations.</li></ul><p>Both methods “<strong>WTL_unc</strong>” and “<strong>WTL_CS</strong>” use active learning since they use the deep learning model to decide which data points to filter. Whereas the “<strong>WTL_pt</strong>” method does require neither labels nor a deep learning model to filter the dataset. For curious readers, this article presents a comprehensive overview of different sampling strategies used in active learning.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Benchmark study results</h3><p>We present the results of these experiments below.</p><figure id="w-node-08c3a0c158ed-e7e87989"><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7ac1d59a6fc121dde87967/5f7ac1d59a6fc18dece87ae7_1*e7rBEziO4Nc3Ci_SqTlAjQ.png"></p><figcaption>Averaged mAP score for different fractions of the training dataset using 4 seeds.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>We see that the mAP score is low at small fractions of the training dataset. We observe that mAP score saturates when using only 25% of the training data and reaches a value of 0.8. Above the saturation point, the mAP score increases very slowly until it reaches its highest value of 0.84. The saturation at low fractions of the training dataset indicates that there are lots of redundancies in the dataset.</p><p>We notice that for small fractions, i.e 5%, the “<strong>WTL_CS</strong>” filtering method is significantly better than the random baseline. As for high fractions, i.e 85%, the “WTL_pt” is able to <strong>achieve the same performance achieved when using the full training dataset</strong>. The “<strong>WTL_unc</strong>” method is on par or worse with the random sub-sampling method “<strong>RSS</strong>”.</p><p>Given that the saturation is reached within a small fraction of the training dataset, we perform a “Zoom-in” experiment where we evaluate the model’s performance using fractions of the training dataset between 5% and 25%. In this experiment, we drop the “<strong>WTL_unc</strong>” for its poor performance.</p><figure id="w-node-21c991b3b9ce-e7e87989"><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7ac1d59a6fc121dde87967/5f7ac1d59a6fc1bf0be87ae9_1*7MHwyOMtGEauLxja2J9LjA.png"></p><figcaption>Zoom-in experiment: Averaged mAP score for different fractions of the training dataset using 4 seeds.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>We see in the results above that the sampled subsets using “<strong>WTL_CS</strong>” and “<strong>WTL_pt</strong>” methods consistently outperform random sub-sampling. In addition, using only 20% of the training dataset, the “<strong>WTL_CS</strong>” sampling method is able to achieve a mAP score of 0.80. <strong>We achieve 90% of the highest mAP score using only 20% of the training dataset</strong>.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Why “WTL_CS” and “WTL_pt” perform better than random sub-sampling “RSS”</h3><p>To answer this question, we make a simple comparison between the images selected with the “<strong>RSS</strong>” method with the images selected with “<strong>WTL_CS</strong>” and “<strong>WTL_pt</strong>”. For this purpose, we compute the fraction of images from camera 1 in the selected samples for different fractions of the training dataset and for different filtering methods. This comparison is done in both the normal and the zoom-in experiments. Note that in the training dataset, the original fraction of images from Camera 1 is around 20%.</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-75ccc62a0fd7-e7e87989"><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7ac1d59a6fc121dde87967/5f7ac1d59a6fc1ea99e87aeb_1*lQiGxxeXL_KGcJHNKR1FSQ.png"></p><figcaption>The fraction of Camera 1 images in the sampled images as a function of fraction of the training dataset.</figcaption></figure><figure id="w-node-d81505eb589c-e7e87989"><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7ac1d59a6fc121dde87967/5f7ac1d59a6fc1624be87aea_1*6qU_7ccA6-ic0C4ZgQWuNg.png"></p><figcaption>Zoom-in experiment: Fraction of Camera 1 images in the sampled images as a function of the fraction of the training dataset.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>We see that the sampling methods “<strong>WTL_CS</strong>” and “<strong>WTL_p</strong>t” select more samples from Camera 1 and therefore, they re-balance the sub-sampled training dataset. This explains the gain in performance obtained using different samplings other than random sub-sampling. Since both “<strong>WTL_CS</strong>” and “<strong>WTL_p</strong>t” methods select non-redundant data, they choose more images from camera 1, and therefore the sub-sampled dataset is more diverse.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Summary and outlook</h3><p>In this case study, we have seen the importance of filtering the redundancies within a dataset. We have found the following results:</p><ul role="list"><li>The AIRS dataset contains lots of redundant images.</li><li>Achievement of the highest mAP score using only 85% of the training dataset.</li><li>Achievement of 90% of the highest mAP using only 20% of the training dataset.</li><li>Filtering re-balanced the AIRS dataset.</li></ul><p>This benchmark study showed the importance of filtering redundant data. With Lightly filtering methods, it was possible to achieve <strong>annotation costs reductions between 15% and 80%</strong>. We found lots of redundancies in the AIRS dataset even though it was collected in a controlled environment: There is at least one customer in each video and the customer grabbed different products. We expect the redundancies to be more pronounced in a general uncontrolled case where different customers grab products at a supermarket.</p><p>Anas, Machine Learning Engineer,<br>lightly.ai</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>[…</p></div></div></div></div>

                <p>Ruby 3x3 announced that Ruby 3.0 would be three times as fast as Ruby 2.0. It was an audacious goal, especially for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)">a language released in 1995</a>.</p>

<p>Ruby 3 is due to be released in less than a month. They’re hard at work on some of the features, but non-JIT performance is pretty close to release speed. If they pull another 5%-10% speed increase at the last minute (which <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14104">happened for Ruby 2.5</a>!) it’ll be surprising. The current performance is basically the “real” Ruby 3 performance.</p>

<p>So… Did it happen? Is Ruby 3 really three times the speed?</p>

<p>The answer is a little complicated, but overall it’s “yes.”</p>

<p>Now: let’s hit the <strong><em>real</em></strong> answer and the details. That’s the fun part.</p>

<h2>Who’s This Guy?</h2>

<p>Why listen to me? Well, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/noahgibbs/rails_ruby_bench">one of the two official Ruby 3 benchmarks</a>. I <a href="https://engineering.appfolio.com/appfolio-engineering/2016/6/3/ruby-fellow-hired">worked for AppFolio on Ruby 3</a> for about three years. I keep track of this stuff pretty closely. But mostly I’ll be linking to other posts I wrote for <a href="https://engineering.appfolio.com/">AppFolio</a> and on <a href="https://fastruby.io/blog">FastRuby</a> and maybe elsewhere. They all have open source code. Feel free to check me!</p>

<h2>What’s Performance, Exactly?</h2>

<p>A language doesn’t have one speed. When somebody says “language X is 2.5 times as fast as language Y,” that’s always an approximation. All languages run “sleep” at exactly the same speed, and two of them may use the exact same regexp library. But maybe variable assignment is way faster in one language than another, while the second language is better at optimising away stack variables.</p>

<p>In other words, performance is a million little things that are faster… or they’re slower or they’re the same. We take an average and hand-wave. That’s okay. It’s how humans deal with complicated things.</p>

<p>Benchmarks are all lies because of this. <a href="https://engineering.appfolio.com/appfolio-engineering/2019/1/7/microbenchmarks-vs-macrobenchmarks-ie-whats-a-microbenchmark">Little operations make for dramatic benchmarks, and big operations make (if you’re lucky) representative “workload benchmarks.”</a> We can’t make a benchmark <strong><em>not</em></strong> lie. We can only pick our favourite lie.</p>

<h2>What’s Our Favourite Lie?</h2>

<p>Here are two favourite lies, embodied by my benchmark (Rails Ruby Bench) and <a href="https://twitter.com/mametter">Mame-san’s</a> benchmark, <a href="https://github.com/mame/optcarrot">OptCarrot</a>.</p>

<p>One favourite lie is this: Ruby performance means Rails performance. How is Ruby 3’s Rails performance?</p>

<p>It turns out it <a href="https://www.fastruby.io/blog/rails/performance/ruby/hows-the-performance-of-ruby-3.0.0-preview1.html">hasn’t changed significantly</a> <a href="https://engineering.appfolio.com/appfolio-engineering/2019/12/27/ruby-270s-rails-ruby-bench-speed-is-unchanged-from-260">since Ruby 2.6</a>. It also turns out <a href="https://engineering.appfolio.com/appfolio-engineering/2019/3/7/ruby-speed-roundup-20-through-26">it <strong><em>got far better</em></strong> from Ruby 2.0 to 2.6</a>.</p>

<p>We don’t know the exact final performance of Ruby 3.0. Watch for a benchmark from me in January! But it’s going to look a lot like Ruby 2.6 and Ruby 2.7.</p>

<p>And that means a large Rails app’s performance has increased by over 70% since Ruby 2.0.</p>

<p>Let’s be clear: <strong><em>that’s a lot</em></strong>.</p>

<p>That’s total end-to-end performance to handle HTTP requests in parallel. It uses the same exact Ruby code with the same exact SQL queries, attached to Redis and Postgres and real service with a <a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse">real big open-source Rails app</a> that people actually use.</p>

<p>In other words, <strong><em>the Ruby part of that performance has increased by a lot more than 70%</em></strong>, because everything that isn’t Ruby is the exact same in my tests.</p>

<p>A lot of a Rails app isn’t Ruby time. It’s waiting for the database. It’s waiting for the disk. The web server is serving static files. A Rails app does a lot of non-Ruby stuff, and it should.</p>

<p>A Rails app wasn’t going to triple in speed. It’s doing too much non-Ruby stuff. Realistically, the Ruby part hasn’t tripled in speed. I don’t have exact numbers, but it would be fair to estimate around 2.5x. It would be very hard to get an accurate only-the-Ruby-parts number, for all kinds of good reasons.</p>

<p>Still, 2.5x is very, very good. Ruby 3.0 will have a big jump in Rails performance, but most people are already using it.</p>

<p>Ractors (a new Ruby 3 concurrency primitive) will also pave the way for later speedups if Rails takes advantage of them. Like threads, it’ll take time and changes to the framework. And right now, <a href="https://www.fastruby.io/blog/ruby/performance/how-fast-are-ractors.html">Ractors’ performance is underwhelming</a>. But they’re also a not-yet-released new feature, so there’s a lot of room to improve.</p>

<h2>Our Other Favourite Lie</h2>

<p>Other than Rails performance, what matters?</p>

<p>One other answer is “straight-line CPU performance on a CPU-intensive benchmark.” And for that we’ll turn to OptCarrot, an <a href="https://engineering.appfolio.com/appfolio-engineering/2017/9/22/optcarrot-an-excellent-cpu-benchmark-for-ruby-3x3">excellent Ruby 3 benchmark</a>. It runs a headless Nintendo (NES) emulator as fast as it can, which is a fun way to measure.</p>

<p>Rails didn’t benefit from <a href="https://engineering.appfolio.com/appfolio-engineering/2019/7/18/jit-and-rubys-mjit">Ruby’s new-ish opt-in JIT system</a>. MJIT is <a href="https://engineering.appfolio.com/appfolio-engineering/2019/7/19/how-mjit-generates-c-from-ruby-a-deep-dive">a complicated beast</a> with interesting trade-offs. If you turn it on then Rails Ruby Bench gets slower, not faster.</p>

<p>But OptCarrot is exactly what MJIT was designed for and it does really well with it.</p>

<p><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/k0kubun/ruby-3-dot-0-jit-on-rails?slide=9">Ruby 3.0 recently hit 3x Ruby 2.0’s performance with JIT</a>. We’re there. Assuming they can keep performance that good for the actual release, Ruby 3.0 manages 3x the frames that Ruby 2.0 did.</p>

<p>The answer, then, is a straightforward “yes.”</p>

<p>Note that JIT does <strong><em>not</em></strong> “make Ruby three times faster.” It’s that Ruby 3.0, which is already a lot faster than Ruby 2.0, is three times as fast <strong><em>as Ruby 2.0</em></strong> with JIT turned on. It’s fast without JIT, but not a full three times the speed of Ruby 2.0.</p>

<p>Make sense?</p>

<h2>What’s the Score, Then?</h2>

<p>It’s been nearly eight years since Ruby 2.0. There have been a lot of performance changes. The generational garbage collection in Ruby 2.4 is <strong><em>hugely</em></strong> faster than the much simpler 2.0 GC. <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/bootsnap">BootSnap</a> has made bootup in Rails far faster. If you remember back to Ruby 1.8.7 in 2008, Ruby has more-than-doubled in speed to Ruby 2.0, and then tripled again for Ruby 3.0. The OptCarrot results are more like 10x from Ruby 1.8.7 to Ruby 3. A 10x speedup in 10 years? Not bad for a language that just turned 25.</p>

<p>It’s been a long trip. And that’s without going into the other two parts of Ruby 3 — concurrency and type safety, both of which are separate major efforts.</p>

<p>Is Ruby 3 really three times the speed of eight-years-ago Ruby? Day-to-day, yes, it absolutely is. The Rails speedup is more like double than triple in practice since a lot of Rails time isn’t Ruby. But double isn’t bad! And CPU-intensive code is now solidly three times the speed.</p>

<p>You can judge the concurrency and type-safety of Ruby 3 for yourself. But <em>I’m going to call the performance goal a solid success</em>.</p>

<p>Sure, we have to wait a month. Ruby 3 will actually be released on 25th December of 2020. But all the signs are good.</p>

<p>You can also play with <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2020/09/25/ruby-3-0-0-preview1-released/">Ruby 3.0.0-preview1</a> right now, and I’m sure there will be at least one more before the final release.</p>

<p>Ndarray is the n-dimensional array object defined in the numpy. It stores the collection of elements of the same type. Elements in the collection can be accessed using a zero-based index. Each element in an ndarray takes the same size in memory.</p>
<h2>Create a Numpy ndarray object</h2>
<p>A Numpy ndarray object can be created using <span>array()</span> function. A list, tuple or any array-like object can be passed into the array() function to convert it into an ndarray. The syntax for using the function is given below:</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<div>
<pre>numpy.array(object, dtype=None, copy=True, order='K', subok=False, ndmin=0)
</pre>
</div>
<br><h3>Parameters</h3>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td><code>object</code></td>
<td><code>Required. </code>Specify the collection object to be converted into ndarray. It can be list, tuple, set, dictionary etc.</td></tr>    
<tr><td><code>dtype</code></td>
<td><code>Optional. </code>Specify the desired data type. It is used to change the data type of the array element.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>copy</code></td>
<td><code>Optional. </code>Specify True to copy the object, False otherwise.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>order</code></td>
<td><code>Optional. </code>Specify order. It can take four possible values.
<ul>
	<li>'C' - for C order (row major).</li>
	<li>'F' - for F order (column major).</li>
	<li>'A' - unchanged if copy=False. If copy=True, F and C order preserved.</li>
	<li>'K' - unchanged if copy=False. If copy=True, When the input is F and not C then F order otherwise C order.</li>
</ul>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>subok</code></td>
<td><code>Optional. </code>Specify True to make the returned array sub-classes pass through. By default, the returned array forced to be base class array.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>ndmin</code></td>
<td><code>Optional. </code>Specify the minimum dimension of the array.</td></tr>
</tbody></table><br>

<h3>Example: Create 1-D Array</h3>
<p>In the below example, a list is used to create a 1-D numpy array.</p>

<div>
<pre>import numpy as np
MyList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
npArray = np.array(MyList)
print(npArray)
</pre>
</div>
<p>The output of the above code will be:</p>

<br>

<h3>Example: Create 2-D Array</h3>
<p>In this example, a list of lists is used to create a 2-D numpy array. </p>
<div>
<pre>import numpy as np
MyList = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
npArray = np.array(MyList)
print(npArray)
</pre>
</div>
<p>The output of the above code will be:</p>

<br>

<h3>Example: Create 2-D Array using ndmin parameter</h3>
<p>A n-dimensional array can be created using <span>ndmin</span> parameter of the array function. Like, in this example, it is used to create 2-D array. </p>
<div>
<pre>import numpy as np
MyList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
npArray = np.array(MyList, ndmin=2)
print(npArray)
</pre>
</div>
<p>The output of the above code will be:</p>

<br>

<h3>Example: Create 1-D Array with dtype parameter</h3>
<p>The <span>dtype</span> argument is used to change the data type of elements of the ndarray object. </p>
<div>
<pre>import numpy as np
MyList = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
npArray = np.array(MyList, dtype=bool)
print(npArray)
</pre>
</div>
<p>The output of the above code will be:</p>
<div>	
<pre>[ True False False  True False]
</pre>
</div>

  <div>
    <section>
      <a name="question1"></a>
      <h3>1. What does it mean to be a business in the UK?</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <b>In summary:</b> A business is a legally recognised unit producing goods or services and usually paying taxes. They are categorised by a series of defined codes. Business statistics make use of a register, referenced as
          <em>enterprises</em> or they are <em>estimated</em>, this is because some are too small to be registered.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Being a business first invovles a type of registration or formation. There are three common ways people go about doing this in the UK:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Individuals can do business by registering as a <em>sole trader</em>.</li>
        <li>Individuals or groups can incorporate a <em>company</em>.</li>
        <li>Groups can come together and register as a <em>partnership</em>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are lots more business structures available. People choose a structure that works best how they plan to operate, how many people are responsible and other considerations.</p>
      <p>Due to the variety of ways a business can operate and the need for alignment to the same concepts, the core sets of UK statistics make use of two elements the Inter-Departmental Business Register (<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/paidservices/interdepartmentalbusinessregisteridbr">IDBR</a>) and the Business
              Population Estimates <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/business-population-estimates-2019">(BPE)</a> to <em>analyse</em> businesses as a whole.</p>
      <p>When using data that uses the IDBR in particular and refering to a single business in the UK, we are actually
        refering to an <em>enterprise unit</em>.</p>
      <blockquote cite="https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/business/activitysizeandlocation/bulletins/ukbusinessactivitysizeandlocation/2019">
        <p>
          The term “business” is used to represent an enterprise. An enterprise can be defined as the smallest combination of legal units (generally based on VAT and/or PAYE records) that is an organisational unit producing goods or services, which
          benefits from a certain degree of autonomy in decision-making, especially for the allocation of its current resources. <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/business/activitysizeandlocation/bulletins/ukbusinessactivitysizeandlocation/2019">via ONS</a>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>However businesses can be so small that the register may not include them, which is where we can make use of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/business-population-estimates-2019">Business
          Population Estimates</a> (BPE):</p>
      <blockquote cite="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/business-population-estimates-2019">
        <p>[As] there is no single database in the UK which contains details of every active
          business. The [BPE] takes data on businesses on the IDBR, and then <em>estimates the number of additional very small businesses
            unregistered for VAT or PAYE</em> <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/836574/METHODOLOGY___QUALITY_NOTE_BPE.pdf">via BEIS</a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>So we can use <em>both</em> these data sets to get a general picture of what's happening in the UK. For more on the differences <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/guide-to-business-statistics">this guide</a> offers a good overview. More detail on the data used is available <a href="https://logikblok.github.io/sketches/ukbusiness/data.html#IDBRandBPE">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Next, we also need to consider Standard Industrial Classifications or (<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/ukstandardindustrialclassificationofeconomicactivities/uksic2007">SIC codes</a>). Just like
        the variety of structures there are a large number of things a business can do to meet the needs of it's customers. So to capture what businesses typically do, SIC codes are used to classify economic activites.</p>
      <blockquote cite="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/ukstandardindustrialclassificationofeconomicactivities/uksic2007">
        <p>A Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) was first introduced into the UK in 1948 for use in classifying business establishments and other statistical units by the type of economic activity in which they are engaged.<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/ukstandardindustrialclassificationofeconomicactivities/uksic2007">via ONS</a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Let's explore some of these now. Press the button below to see an example SIC code and it's description.</p>
      
      <code>
        <p id="sicCode">1110,Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds</p>
      </code>
      
      <p>As you can see the codes have a number and a description. The number code can be used to identify the activities of a business into an area and the descriptions can provide further context.</p>
      <p>These activities are organised into <em>classes or subclasses</em>, <em>groups</em>, <em>divisions</em>, <em>sections</em> and <em>broad industry groups (BIG)</em>. The chart below provides an outline of the breakdown with the number of each
        categorisation level and an example
        using <em>25.91 Manufacture of steel drums and similar containers</em>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Complex businesses can apply multiple SICs to themselves. For example, a software firm might list themselves engaging in design, software
        development, professional services and more. Here's another example using a popular UK super market store:</p>
      <blockquote cite="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/00519500">
        <p> <em>TESCO STORES LIMITED Company number 00519500</em></p>
        <p>
          Nature of business (SIC):
        </p><ul> 47110 - Retail sale in non-specialised stores with food, beverages or tobacco predominating </ul>
        <ul>47290 - Other retail sale of food in specialised stores</ul>
        <ul>47710 - Retail sale of clothing in specialised stores</ul>
        <ul>47750 - Retail sale of cosmetic and toilet articles in specialised stores</ul>
        <a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/00519500">via Companies House</a>
        
      </blockquote>
      <p>For the majority of our purposes, we'll mainly be looking at things at the <em>Broad Industry group</em> level which is the highest categorisation available.</p>
      <p>The chart below shows all the Broad Industry Groups (BIG) and their breakdown composition below them. Most BIGs have one <em>section</em> and a number of <em>divisions</em> below them. As you can see Production is the most complex, with two
        layers structured below it.</p>
      
      <p>This higlights an overall indication of how the UK business landscape is structured, at least statistically speaking.
        The SIC hierarchy can be explored <a href="https://onsdigital.github.io/dp-classification-tools/standard-industrial-classification/ONS_SIC_hierarchy_view.html">further here</a>.</p>

      <h3>2. How many businesses are there?</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <b>In summary:</b> As of 2019 over 5.8 million business are estimated to be present in the UK.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The estimation is called out specifically because there are are a vast number of businesses too small to be registered using the IDBR, more detail on the data differences is available <a href="https://logikblok.github.io/sketches/ukbusiness/data.html#IDBRandBPE">here</a></p>
      <p>The chart below shows the difference between the data sets of registered enterprises versus the estimated numbers by industry groups. </p>
      
      <p>The differences above are expected as each data set serves different purposes. However overall both correlate to show similar patterns that the UK has prominent numbers of businesses in industries related to construction and proffesional services.</p>
      
      <p>The chart above shows the total estimated number of businesses highlighting the growth of the UK business population across a six year range.</p>

      <p>As a quick reminder the The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK) is shaped liked the below. The UK consists of four countries: England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>England is split into smaller 9 regions whilst Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are treated as individual regions, bringing up the total number of regions to be <em>12</em>.</p>
      
      <p>The chart below shows the number of businesses by region. It highlights the  higher number of businesses towards the south of the UK with London first, followed by the South East and the East of England.</p>

      <p>The chart below tries to show the regional differences in the concentraion of <em>enterprises</em>. It's using 2019 ONS data on activity and size.
</p>
      
      <p>Couple of interesting points above:
        </p><ul>
          <li>Construction and professional services are fairly consistently spread across the UK.</li>

																										<p><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/04/1013294/google-ai-ethics-research-paper-forced-out-timnit-gebru/">Last week, news broke that Google fired the co-lead of its ethical AI team, Dr. Timnit Gebru</a>. Since then, the artificial intelligence community has been taking stock of a host of issues. Chief among them is the intersection of corporate power and research institutions: can a company effectively question its own products? Under the surface of this firing are long-standing and intensifying questions about the ethical implications of artificial intelligence that have yet to fully translate to the wider public.</p>
<p>Dr. Gebru’s departure was precipitated by a paper she co-authored with four other Google employees. The draft paper, titled “On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?” examines the potential multifaceted hazards of a new class of large machine learning models that are widely used by Google and other large technology companies.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JeffDean/status/1334953632719011840">Jeff Dean, head of Google AI, stated that the paper was submitted for review with little notice and that it “didn’t meet our bar for publication.”</a> Further, Dean claimed that the paper had overlooked scholarship that mitigated the concerns detailed by Dr. Gebru and her co-authors. The conflict eventually led Dr. Gebru to request a set of specific conditions in order to continue her employment at Google. Dean ultimately declined and interpreted her message as an immediate resignation. Gebru has since explained that she was effectively terminated before she had an opportunity to negotiate the timing of her exit.</p>
<p>The news of her departure has sparked an intense reaction in the tech community.<a href="https://googlewalkout.medium.com/standing-with-dr-timnit-gebru-isupporttimnit-believeblackwomen-6dadc300d382"> As of the time of writing, nearly 2,000 Google employees and 3,000 others have signed a letter of protest to Dr. Gebru’s firing</a>. The letter accuses Google of retaliatory practices and of censoring a line of research that is critical of some of its core products.</p>
<p>Since her firing, Dr. Gebru and her colleagues’ paper has leaked online. Unlike recent years, where we have seen public fretting <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/maximizing-paper-clips/">from figures like Elon Musk</a> that<a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2016/06/23/frankensteins-paperclips"> rogue AI would somehow turn the world into paper clips,</a> the paper by Gebru et al. is grounded in present-tense issues. Throughout, I will occasionally refer to Dr. Gebru in the singular for the sake of simplicity; please keep in mind that she had several co-authors on this paper. Their identities are being protected as current employees of Google.</p>
<p>The paper centers around problems that are inherent in a quickly evolving class of artificial intelligence techniques that attempt to model human language. In simplified terms, these models are designed to do one of two tasks: they either predict what comes next after a string of text, or they predict what should go in the middle of a sentence. While this may sound less than exciting, it is massively important—it is a core part of the technology that powers machine translation, automated speech recognition, and virtually anything else to do with language. Imagine something like a sophisticated statistical “Mad Lib” solver and you’re on the right path.</p>
<p>In recent years, these technologies have grown vastly more powerful due to a confluence of factors that constitute a familiar story: ever-larger datasets help to train bigger and more complex models enabled by radical improvements in computer infrastructure.</p>
<p>At present, the largest of these models is OpenAI’s GPT-3. The model uses some 175 billion parameters, and each must be tuned or “trained” on example data via an iterative process. In the case of GPT-3, that data is 570 gigabytes of text data drawn from a variety of sources from the Internet. The previous largest model, Microsoft’s T-NLG announced in February of this year, used less than 10% of the parameters and 30% of the training data. In short, this is a very quickly moving space.</p>
<p>Dr. Gebru and her colleagues ask a straightforward but provocative question: How big is too big? To understand that, we have to look closely at what it means to train a machine learning model.</p>
<p>Machine learning researchers and computer scientists tend to divide calculation of costs between “training” time and “inference” time. Training refers to the process of “teaching” the model on the basis of large datasets. That process is typically iterative; it takes many cycles of repetition to develop a robust model. Researchers must also be careful that the training data is diverse enough that models don’t “overtrain” and become fixated on idiosyncratic patterns.</p>
<p>For example, imagine you have a set of “noisy” points like the black dots below:</p>
<p><img src="https://thedebrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Overfitted_Data.png" alt="" width="377" height="256" srcset="https://thedebrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Overfitted_Data.png 377w,https://thedebrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Overfitted_Data-300x204.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 377px) 100vw, 377px" data-srcset="https://thedebrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Overfitted_Data.png 377w, https://thedebrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Overfitted_Data-300x204.png 300w" data-src="https://thedebrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Overfitted_Data.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></p><p>Your goal is to come up with a function that will predict a new set of points in the future from the same underlying process — recognizing that this particular collection of black dots has some measurement error and uncertainty in it.</p>
<p>The two lines show two possible solutions. The first is a very simple line. While it doesn’t perfectly “fit” the dots, it captures the basic trend. The second is the blue line, which perfectly fits each and every dot, and relies on a more complicated function. If you measure the accuracy of these two models on just this data, the blue line is better. In fact, it is technically perfect.</p>
<p>But is it? You can imagine that over time, with new datasets that won’t have the dots in exactly the same place, the simple line will actually be more accurate. The simple line is less complex, but actually captures the data better by not being overly influenced by just one example.</p>
<p>Finding the right balance in model complexity is difficult work. Too simple, and the model can’t capture important nuances—too complex and it becomes fragile, or at worst a mere portrait of the training data. The goal, as in so many things, is to find the sweet spot in the middle: a tool that is general enough to handle the messiness of the real world without sacrificing too much in terms of accuracy.</p>
<p>Finding that sweet spot often requires vast computational resources, particularly in the modern context. This is partly due to the inherent need for repetition in “teaching” the model, and also the need to ensure that the model doesn’t become too dependent on one narrow slice of training data.</p>
<p>In comparison to training, “inference” — that is, actually using the model to make a prediction — is much cheaper. The expensive part is finding the right values for all those parameters discussed above. Once you have them, making predictions with the model is relatively easy.</p>
<p>If you squint, a rough analogy can be made to raising children. The cost of raising an infant to school age is profound in comparison to babysitting a kid for a day. The hard part is teaching an infant all the basics of human life: not to touch the stove and stick fingers in the electrical sockets. Once the child, or the model, has reached maturity, it “operates” relatively cheaply in comparison to the cost of its upbringing.</p>
<p>This brings us back to Dr. Gebru’s work. One of her arguments is that “raising” AI is expensive in terms of raw energy. She cites the work of<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02243"> Dr. Emma Strubell and others</a>, who<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/06/06/239031/training-a-single-ai-model-can-emit-as-much-carbon-as-five-cars-in-their-lifetimes/"> demonstrated that training big models can emit as much carbon as five cars</a> do over their full lifetime of use. That fantastically powerful computer infrastructure comes at a cost.</p>

However, Dr. Gebru rightly points out that the wider enterprise of cloud computing is not necessarily carbon neutral, whatever Google’s particular commitments may be.</p>
<p>She further argues that the benefits and costs of these models are lopsided. Is it fair to ask residents of the Maldives, expected to be underwater before the end of the century, to foot the environmental bill for marginally improved language models — particularly when those language models don’t include Dhivehi? In short, the people most exposed to the risks of climate change are some of the least positioned to benefit from technologies like Google Home or Amazon’s Alexa.</p>
<p>Put more pointedly: What good is a Siri that doesn’t understand your language when the water is rising?</p>
<p>Should we hasten the flood so that gadgets become slightly less stupid? How about when such machines do other more important work,<a href="https://thedebrief.org/deepminds-ai-makes-history-by-solving-protein-folding-problem/"> like predicting the structure of medically relevant proteins</a>? To be sure, these are not easy questions — but they are important ones, and ones that should be widely assessed.</p>
<p>Next among Dr. Gebru’s concerns is “unfathomable” training data. Those 570 gigabytes of Internet data referenced above largely come from sources that represent a very narrow slice of society. In the analogy above between training a model and raising a child, imagine a child raised largely by Reddit or Twitter, with occasional babysitting from Wikipedia. Are you confident that a well-rounded, tolerant person would result? Would you take that teenager to an important company dinner, trusting that they wouldn’t say anything offensive or laughably wrong?</p>
<p>The deeper problem Dr. Gebru raises is that the training datasets themselves are too large to effectively audit or even fully understand as a researcher. How can we assess the ethics of something so vast we can’t effectively explore it? The risk, Gebru’s team and others argue, is that by averaging together such sources, models will come to “encode hegemonic worldviews.”</p>
<p>The risk only becomes more pronounced as the models become increasingly convincing. Advances in language models have enabled automated text that seems coherent across sentences and even paragraphs.</p>
<p>Take this example of GPT-3 answering questions about the Russian private military company, the Wagner Group:</p>

				<p><em>Take lessons from high stakes monitoring in the physical world (electrical grids, nuclear power plants, oil rigs, data centers) and apply them to a pure software stack.</em></p><p><em>Karl Lehenbauer is FlightAware</em>’<em>s Chief Technology Officer. </em></p><p>Little is worse for someone committed to providing reliable service than to have your customer call you to tell you your service isn’t working. It’s a double whammy. You’re broken and you don’t know you’re broken. You hate that. So do we. Worse, we have service level agreements with many of our customers— if a service isn’t working for long enough, we have to start dishing out refunds.</p><p>But far more important than that, if we’re down our customers don’t know where their airplanes are. This can be a regulatory violation. It can also mean that the line service technicians aren’t available to meet the plane (if you travel much at all you’ve heard the pilot come on the PA and announce, “Well folks, we’ve arrived but the ground crew isn’t here to help get us into the gate”). Then you sit on the plane in the alleyway until the wing walkers, jetway driver, baggage handlers, etc., show up to guide the plane in.</p><p>But more than that, we provide Global Aviation Distress and Signaling System (GADSS) <a href="https://globalbeacon.aero/">surveillance</a> to lots of airlines as mandated by the International Civil Aviation Organization. They might literally not know that one of their airplanes is in distress or has some kind of incident or even has crashed if our stuff isn’t working properly. People’s lives are on the line.</p><p>Let’s go back in time a bit.</p><h2 id="monitoring-the-real-world">Monitoring the Real World</h2><p><br>I got my start in control systems, first at a power company, monitoring and controlling electrical power generation, transmission and distribution. Later, I went to work at a vendor of those systems, followed by a stint at GE Aircraft Instruments working on turbine engine monitoring.</p><p>By the early 1990s I was leading the engineering team for a very early Internet Service Provider.</p><p>One day, our air conditioning failed. The computer room overheated, we lost some disk drives, and I resolved that we should be alerted if it ever started happening again.</p><p>This was before you could read the air inlet temperature off of your high-end router or from your fancy air conditioner or from one of the inexpensive SNMP-enabled temperature monitoring solutions of today.</p><p>So we came up with a clever solution. We’d use an old school thermostat, wire the transmit pin of a computer’s serial port through the thermostat’s mercury switch to the port’s receive pin, and we’d send a character through the serial port every few seconds. If the computer room went above a threshold temperature, the blob of mercury would complete the circuit and we’d start reading the characters back from the serial port. Then our little program would recognize this and start sending messages to peoples’ pagers using a modem.</p><figure><img src="https://flightaware.engineering/content/images/2020/12/Image-1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://flightaware.engineering/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Image-1-.png 600w, https://flightaware.engineering/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Image-1-.png 1000w, https://flightaware.engineering/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Image-1-.png 1600w, https://flightaware.engineering/content/images/2020/12/Image-1-.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Fine.</p><p>Lo and behold, one day we partially lost cooling in the data center, only we didn’t get any callouts. An investigation revealed that one of the wires had gotten janked, and though the blob of mercury made contact, no characters were received by the monitoring program.</p><p>Meditating on this led to a critical insight. <em>We had it backwards! </em>Rather than completing the circuit when there was a problem, we needed instead to make the circuit normally closed and open it when there was a problem. Instead of wiring into the air conditioning contacts of the thermostat we would wire into the heating ones. We would receive the characters we were sending as long as everything was OK. If the temperature rose past a threshold, the blob of mercury would pull away from the contacts, breaking the circuit, so whenever our program <strong>stopped</strong> seeing the characters, the alarm would be raised.</p><p>By flipping it like this, if one of the wires got inadvertently pulled or whatever, we’d immediately get the alarm.</p><p>In other words, <strong>the lack of a signal telling you everything is OK means something is wrong.</strong></p><h2 id="on-the-trail-of-monitoring-your-applications">On the Trail of Monitoring Your Applications</h2><p>Now, consider we have a service and we want to make sure it’s working. Can I ping the machine or machines? Great. The machine is up. Or is it? Ping is pretty basic in the network stack; ping packets are typically responded to directly from the kernel. We’ve seen machines that are pretty crashed and won’t run programs that will still ping.</p><p>OK, so we’ll ping the machine, but we’ll have some kind of agent program that runs on the machines that we’ll talk to over the network. If we can talk to the agent, then we know a little more that the machine is working. But does the machine have enough storage? Does it have enough memory? OK, we’ll make our agent check and alert us if the machine is low on storage or memory, if the swap utilization is abnormally high, etc.</p><p>But is the program running? Sure, no problem. We’ll add some code to our agent to read the process table and see if the program shows up there. If it doesn’t, we’ll alarm.</p><p>But is the program getting work done? The process might exist, but it might not be doing anything. Well we could read the program’s CPU time repeatedly and see if it’s accumulating time.</p><p>But does that mean it’s working? No, it doesn’t. Maybe it’s lost its database connection. Maybe it’s accumulating CPU time but because it wasn’t written defensively enough, it’s trying to do database updates and failing and logging errors but not reconnecting to the database.</p><p>Maybe it’s got a good connection to the database server but it’s not receiving any messages.</p><p>You can keep increasing the sophistication of your agent. You can keep adding new checks as you discover (usually the hard way) new failure modes you missed, but with this approach you’re vulnerable to any new or unanticipated breakdowns. You might never be completely sure work is getting done.</p><h3 id="in-the-loop-monitoring">In-the-Loop Monitoring</h3><p>I assert that you can’t know your program is doing the work it’s supposed to be doing unless it’s telling you that it is. Call this “in-the-loop” monitoring. If a program is expected to repeatedly receive input messages and update a table in a database, then every time it has done this it should send a message to monitoring software reporting that it has successfully done it.</p><p>It should only send the success message to the monitoring program upon completion of the work. So once an input message has been received, successfully processed, and the database updated, a separate message is sent to the monitoring software saying it has succeeded. If no input message is received or the database update fails, the message should not be sent to the monitoring software.</p><p>To reiterate, you make a call from inside the program to send a message to your monitoring software every time the program succeeds in doing a parcel of work.</p><p>Meanwhile, if a certain amount of time passes without the monitoring program receiving a “work completed” message, it raises an alarm that something is wrong.</p><p>The beautiful thing here is that the monitoring program doesn’t have to know why it didn’t receive a message. We don’t have to try to check for every possible reason. All we have to do is recognize that we stopped being told it was OK. The machine may have crashed, the router may have failed, the program may have lost its receive socket or its database connection. The program feeding data to our program may have stopped sending, the ethernet cable may have gotten pulled, a circuit breaker may have tripped, the program may have divided by zero or gotten a memory protection violation, there could have been an earthquake, a flood… locusts! We don’t have to check for all those things. All we have to do is recognize that the program stopped telling us it was OK.</p><h3 id="watchdog-timers">Watchdog Timers</h3><p>What I’m describing is a variation of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchdog_timer">watchdog timer</a>, technology common in real-time systems, space probes, satellites, etc., where software on a computer periodically resets a hardware timer. The hardware timer counts down, but every time the reset signal is received the counter is reset. If for any reason the software stops resetting the hardware timer, the counter eventually reaches zero and triggers a reboot or some other corrective action. Our variation is much more granular and is software-based, but the principle is the same.</p><h2 id="on-the-trail-of-watchdog-resets-in-the-modern-production-software-stack">On the Trail of Watchdog Resets in the Modern Production Software Stack</h2><p>Now, if your program is processing 40,000 messages a second, it needn’t send 40,000 messages a second to your monitoring system saying it’s completed work. So the watchdog reset subroutine can have a threshold and only send a completion message once a second or whatever, regardless of how many messages it processed. Fine.</p><p>Also, the watchdog reset subroutine must never break the program! So if it can’t reach the monitoring server, the program should keep going regardless. The program shouldn’t freeze if the monitoring software stops responding. For this reason our in-the-loop code has been kept very simple, and uses UDP datagrams to send watchdog resets to the monitoring software. It also makes sure that even if there is an error returned, which can happen even with UDP if the sender and recipient are on the same LAN, that it doesn’t stop or break the program.The watchdog reset message should identify the program, the machine (typically), and perhaps the activity within the program that has succeeded. Examples include the receipt of a message from the FAA, from Aireon’s Space-Based ADS-B network, from our provider of airline schedules, from each of our multiplexing agents that aggregate data from our tens of thousands of ADS-B ground stations, or from <a href="https://flightaware.com/about/datasources/">HyperFeed</a>®, our suite of programs that process all the input data to produce our coherent feed of what is happening with all the aircraft that are in the air or moving on the ground in the world.</p><figure><img src="https://flightaware.engineering/content/images/2020/12/Image-2-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://flightaware.engineering/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Image-2-4.png 600w, https://flightaware.engineering/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Image-2-4.png 1000w, https://flightaware.engineering/content/images/2020/12/Image-2-4.png 1330w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Watchdog reset call in Python – If one of our 12M+ users hasn’t logged into the website in the last 15 minutes, something’s wrong.</figcaption></figure><p>Creation of watchdog entries in the monitoring software should be zero config.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://fleek-team-bucket.storage.fleek.co/thumbnails-blog/Space%20Ethereum.jpg" alt="Ethereum keys in Space Storage"></p>
<p>In our last piece, we talked about the <a href="https://blog.space.storage/posts/the-dweb-protocols-behind-space" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Dweb protocols </a>behind the building of Space, and how each of them allows us to take our platform further away from Web 2.0 and into Web 3.0.</p>
<p>One of those protocols is Ethereum, which we think of as the centerpiece of our user’s accounts. We want to tie each user to an ETH key/address, whether they sign up using email and social accounts (via Torus); or by linking their own ETH wallet (via MetaMask or Wallet Connect).</p>
<p>Why? There are many reasons behind this choice. The first and most immediate one is that we think Ethereum keys are the future of authentication. The second one is a long term one. When we think about the future of Space and the Dweb, we see Ethereum as the main connection point for a wide array of tools and use cases that benefit from pairing with a user-owned platform.</p>
<p>Let’s go over a couple reasons and what they mean for us…</p>
<h2 id="exploring-the-future-of-authentication"><a href="#exploring-the-future-of-authentication" aria-label="exploring the future of authentication permalink"></a>Exploring the Future of Authentication</h2>
<p><img src="https://fleek-team-bucket.storage.fleek.co/Blog%20Inline/Enter%20Password.gif" alt="Authentication"></p>
<p>At Space, we’ve discussed several times about what the future of authentication looks like. Whether you sign up using email, social media, or an ETH wallet, we all agree with one thing: public/private key pairs proved to be a solid alternative to passwords, and an overall better authentication model.</p>
<p>So far, key pairs have addressed key issues in the authentication process, and many core negative aspects of the Web 2.0 auth paradigm.</p>
<p>We can see this from the get go if we compare both models. With passwords, authentication is handled from the platform’s end, with the user having to expose their main credentials every time to the platform, who also keeps these credentials on their end.</p>
<p>Key pairs, on the other hand, allow for blind verification of a user’s identity, since they don’t need to expose their private key but sign proof that the platform can verify by just knowing the user’s public key.</p>
<p>This means there’s a lot less instances the user has to worry about when it comes to their credential’s security.</p>
<p>However, we do also understand that key pairs fundamentally change the user’s experience entirely. Generating, saving, and safekeeping keys is not the standard experience everyone, and making a hard switch would mean exposing users to a new model that has its own security needs, and ways of handling/storing/backuping than passwords.</p>
<p>Convenience is a known security killer, and we don’t want users to make sacrifices either in their safety, or their experience.</p>
<p><img src="https://fleek-team-bucket.storage.fleek.co/Blog%20Inline/Change.gif" alt="Experience changes"></p>
<p>That’s why we’re focusing on finding a place in-between for users to leverage the best aspects of key-pair based authentication, and still maintain a seamless and known login experience. We want to provide a wide selection to cover the spectrum, for both those who simply want to use their email as a login, for example, and those who want to handle their ETH keys with a crypto wallet.</p>
<p>Torus helps us achieve that for the first group, by abstracting key management and letting us provide users with a known sign in experience in the front (using Twitter, or Email magic links, etc.), while abstracting and securely retrieving the users Ethereum private key in the background, via a distributed, non-custodial, sharded key network (the Torus network) that a user can authenticate to with any of their usual, and quick login options.</p>
<p>That way, we can provide a flexible flow for each user without having to grandfather the platform to an authentication model that we think is not the future, and we can build the platform from the ground up so that every user can transition to key-pair auth more easily.</p>
<h2 id="rethinking-account-ownership"><a href="#rethinking-account-ownership" aria-label="rethinking account ownership permalink"></a>Rethinking Account Ownership</h2>
<p><img src="https://fleek-team-bucket.storage.fleek.co/Blog%20Inline/Account%20Ownership.jpg" alt="user-owned accounts"></p>
<p>There’s another reason, other than security, behind our choice to work with Ethereum key pairs.</p>
<p>Today, accounts in services are usually centralized, and tied in exclusivity/ownership to the platform itself, and not to the user. That’s why in Web2 we have an endless stream of different accounts for each service, all bound to the platform’s existence.</p>
<p>We see Ethereum keys as the opportunity to switch accounts from entity/platform controlled to completely user owned and controlled. Where instead of a platform authorizing you to use their platform internally, you -as your own entity- would authorize different platforms to access your own personal account and permission each platform to access just the specific data it needs in order for you to use the service.</p>
<p>In the storage world itself this has a special connotation, because today not only is your account tied to a specific storage platform, but your storage/files/data are as well.</p>
<p>As we move forward towards distributing storage (on IPFS, Textile, Filecoin, etc), we want to give users the chance to truly own their account and storage, and be able to choose how they want to access it, and where.</p>
<p>We view files stored in Space as platform and interface agnostic, and in that vision, Ethereum keys play a part in building user-owned accounts that are not siloed or specific to the Space interface itself, but rather existing on an open global data network (or the user’s hands) for the user to own.</p>
<p>It’s an ever evolving and improving concept, but we are looking to break the traditional way of handling storage, where companies own the data/accounts, and move towards a place where platforms just become interfaces for a user to surface, manage, and interact with their files/data that live on this open global file/data layer (powered by IPFS and Textile).</p>
<h2 id="opening-up-to-ethereum-use-cases"><a href="#opening-up-to-ethereum-use-cases" aria-label="opening up to ethereum use cases permalink"></a>Opening up to Ethereum Use Cases</h2>
<p><img src="https://fleek-team-bucket.storage.fleek.co/Blog%20Inline/Ethereum%20Keys.jpg" alt="ethereum use cases"></p>
<p>The final and longer term reason for using Ethereum keys in our architecture, is to serve as a seamless bridge between Ethereum based use cases, and their potential data/file storage, hosting and access needs.</p>
<p>Ethereum is a melting pot of decentralized use cases and possibilities that benefit a lot from integrating with each other.</p>
<p>From tokens, DAOs, NFTs, to the wonderful array of Dapps that are growing each day, it’s simply natural to think that any of these could benefit from being able to interact directly with distributed and user-owned (or ETH wallet or contract owned) files/data.</p>
<p>For us, Ethereum is the base layer that everything will be controlled from in the future (using ETH wallets or contracts), and so having an ETH key/wallet associated with each user allows us to explore combining and integrating different ETH use cases (tokens, DAO’s, NFT’s, etc.) into Space without having to rebuild the wheel and isolate our platform from an already thriving decentralized environment.</p>
<p>For example, by enabling ETH and ERC20 payments, in the future that could evolve into users being able to seamlessly create paywalls or different access token based mechanisms in front of files or content stored in Space.</p>
<p>Or by taking the “user-owned” nature of NFTs to a new level, and allowing users to store/serve the image/file related to their NFT (which lives on IPFS) in the same account as the token itself (which lives on Ethereum) - rather than just relying on NFT platforms to keep the NFT image/file pinned and existing on IPFS forever.</p>
<p>There’s definitely a lot of exciting opportunities for Space to grow, and for the developer community to build on Space and take some of these ideas to the next level (using the SpaceSDK for web or mobile apps or Space Daemon for desktop apps).</p>
<p>Storage is the cornerstone, and from there, there’s a lot of Space to explore! 🚀🚀</p>

              <article><p>The most notable feature in <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/11/endbasic-0.3.html">EndBASIC 0.3</a> is its new full-screen console-based text editor. It took longer than I wanted to start developing this, in part because I was busy moving, and in part because I <em>dreaded the thought of having to unit test the text editor</em>. (Yes, EndBASIC is a personal project and I develop it in my free time, but that doesn’t mean I don’t want it to be properly engineered!)</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://jmmv.dev/images/2020-12-08-endbasic-welcome.gif">
  <figcaption>The text editor we will be unit-testing, in action.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the end, I rolled up my sleeves, got to work, and achieved reasonable test coverage. In fact, the tests have already paid off by uncovering various bugs and inefficiencies, so the effort was well-spent. Developing these tests was non-trivial, though, so here is an overview on <em>why</em> it is worthwhile to unit-test a full-screen console app and <em>how</em> to go about it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The key insight, unsurprisingly, is to <strong>design for testability</strong>. I knew I wanted to unit-test the text editor from the beginning, so I had to come up with a design that allowed for this. Retrofitting tests into code that never considered testing is very difficult.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As usual, while the specific code I’m going to show you is in Rust, you can easily apply these ideas to your favorite language. All you need is a mechanism to express an abstraction layer between your app and the console manipulation code—and you could do that even in the shell.</p>

<p>Command-line applications typically interact with the console by reading from their standard input (stdin) and writing to their standard output (stdout). Both stdin and stdout are “streams”: you can read from and write to them, but these I/O operations are sequential. The streams do not know anything about where the cursor is or how to change colors or anything like that. And this makes sense because if stdin and stdout are connected to files, what does it mean to “clear the screen”?</p>
<p>If that’s the case, though, how does a console program manipulate the screen to, for example, clear it and position the cursor at an arbitrary location? Well, the answer is that… it depends.</p>
<p>On Unix-like systems, the application writes special collections of bytes, known as <strong>escape sequences</strong>, to stdout. How the escape sequences look like and what they mean depends completely on what stdout is attached to. Again, if stdout is attached to a file, these sequences mean nothing more than a sequence of bytes. Contrariwise, if stdout is attached to a terminal, then the terminal interprets them and performs certain actions.</p>
<p>The most obvious escape sequence you can think of is the line terminator, or <code>\n</code>. On its own, <code>\n</code> is nothing more than ASCII byte 10. But when the terminal sees this byte, the terminal knows that it has to advance the cursor to the next line <em>and</em> move it to the first column. But the semantics of what <code>\n</code> does vary across systems: Windows interprets <code>\n</code> as <em>just</em> moving the cursor one line down, not rolling it back go the first column.</p>
<p>There are more complex escape sequences, of course. This is why you can trivially (assuming you know what terminal type you are talking to) embed escape sequences in <code>printf</code> or <code>echo -e</code> invocations to control how things look like. You essentially use escape sequences as a way to mark up the text:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://jmmv.dev/images/2020-12-08-escape-sequences.png">
  <figcaption>Two `printf(1)` command invocations showing how escape sequences change the color of the printed text.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For completeness, I’ll also mention that the terminal emulator is usually in the kernel, which is what allows you to have full-screen text apps in the text mode console, but it can also be implemented in <em>hardware</em> (where the concept originated), and thus also in user space, which is what graphical programs like <code>xterm</code> used to do before PTYs (and is why they are called terminal <em>emulators</em>).</p>
<p>If you haven’t connected the dots yet, this is precisely what the ancient <code>TERM</code> environment variable is about: it tells the console applications what specific terminal it is talking to so that the application itself can generate the correct escape sequences to control it. Nowadays, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code">ANSI escape sequences</a> are almost universal, but they weren’t always. <code>terminfo</code>/<code>termcap</code> and <code>(n)curses</code> are libraries to abstract all these details away and offer the programmer a generic console-manipulation interface that works across <code>TERM</code> variants.</p>
<p>This is all about Unix though. On Windows, things are different (and my knowledge is very limited). Command-line applications communicate with the Console Window Host (<code>conhost.exe</code>) by means of <code>ioctl</code>-like calls. In other words: console manipulation happens out of band and isn’t part of what goes into stdout. Or at least that’s the only way it used to be: the new console host supports ANSI escape sequences too, presumably to facilitate interop with WSL.</p>
<p>Anyhow. We don’t care about how the console is updated from a testing perspective: we want to know how the console changes, but not exactly how that’s done by the OS. Therefore, I’m going to refer to the escape sequences and/or the <code>ioctl</code>s sent to the console as <strong>console manipulation commands</strong> or <strong>console commands</strong> in the text below.</p>

<p>Testing a full-screen console app—which some people refer to as a <strong>Text User Interface</strong> or <strong>TUI</strong> for short—exposes essentially the same difficulties as testing a GUI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are trying to write tests for something that <strong>responds to user input</strong>, and every user interaction causes <strong>changes that are inherently visual</strong> and require the human eye for interpretation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s break these problems down into pieces and see how we can approach them.</p>
<p>First and foremost: we have to ensure that the <em>outcome</em> of our input (key presses) has the right effect on the program <em>state</em>. Given that we are testing a text editor, this is easy: we can populate the editor’s buffer with some text, let the editor process a set of key presses, and then verify that the contents of the editor’s buffer match a golden text. Not very different from other, more traditional tests.</p>
<p>Second, we need to worry about user input. After all, the TUI is interactive and reacts to user key presses, so our tests will have to drive the TUI. This is easier than dealing with the visual console updates, as all we have to do is represent the sequence of key presses to send to the app and then feed those to it in some way. Again, this is not very different from other tests: we have an algorithm and we inject some input.</p>
<p>And third, we have to worry about how things look like, which is the most interesting part of this problem. Because, after all… we can write a test to verify that a piece of code selects the blue color and then clears the screen, but unless we <em>see</em> the result, we don’t know if the screen was all emptied with a blue background or not.</p>
<p>Well, we <em>could</em>. Presumably, we could capture the raw screen contents (or poke at them if we were in the DOS era; <code>0xB8000</code> anyone?) and compare those against golden “screenshots” after every key press. This would do the trick and would result in tests that are completely decoupled form the way the screen is updated… which actually sounds like a good idea. The problem with this approach of comparing screen contents is that we would need a terminal emulator to “render” the console from the console commands that the application emits, and a terminal emulator isn’t a trivial piece of software.</p>
<p>The alternative to this idea of comparing screen <em>contents</em> is to capture the console commands that the app emits and compare those to expectations. This is easier to implement but has different fidelity tradeoffs as we shall see below.</p>

<p>If we follow the ideas presented above, we will end up with a bunch of tests that inject key presses into the TUI and, for each of them, we will capture which console manipulation commands were emitted and we will compare them against expectations.</p>
<p>Which… sounds fragile and not particularly useful, doesn’t it? As mentioned earlier, a sequence of commands is meaningless <em>unless we humans see the visual results</em> once a terminal emulator has processed the commands. You could then say that these tests are pointless. But these tests provide three separate benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Corner-case and regression validation.</strong> In the scenario we are looking at, a lot of the editor behavior is obvious: if we press the right arrow key, we know that the cursor has to move one position to the right if the line of text permits. If we break the way this works, the breakage will be extremely visible once we do any kind of manual test.</p>
<p>But… what happens if the cursor is located in the middle of the last visible line of text, with the viewport scrolled to the right because the line was extremely long, and we press enter to split it? That’s not something you usually do, so what’s the expected behavior there? We need to make sure that, once this works as we intend, it doesn’t unexpectedly break, and we don’t want to have to manually verify this every time we change the editor logic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Behavior documentation.</strong> The collection of test cases for the TUI will serve us as the documentation of all cases we must care about in the code if we are doing any kind of refactoring, for example. As illustrated above, there are a lot of corner cases to deal with, and unless they are tracked somewhere, it’s too easy to forget about them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Efficiency measures.</strong> The last benefit these tests give us is a way to measure efficiency. By capturing the sequence of commands emitted by the TUI logic, we can see if those commands are <em>minimal</em>. Because if they are not, the TUI will flicker.</p>
<p>For example: an easy way to implement the TUI is to refresh the whole screen after every key press—and while that will yield updates that <em>look</em> correct (and that would pass a testing model where we verify screen contents), the app will be doing too much work to update the screen. We need to worry about only doing partial screen updates (clearing a single line, using terminal scrolling features, etc.), and to that end, capturing the sequence of commands lets us do that.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The downside of this testing approach is that, again, we …</p></article></div></div></div>

Migrate is based on the <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema#example">Prisma schema</a> – a declarative data model definition that codifies your database schema.</p><p>This Preview release is the evolution of the Experimental version of Migrate that we released last year. Since then, we've been gathering feedback from the community and incorporating it into Prisma Migrate.</p><h3 id="making-schema-migrations-predictable"><a href="#making-schema-migrations-predictable" aria-label="making schema migrations predictable permalink"></a>Making schema migrations predictable</h3><p>Database schema migrations play a crucial role in software development workflows and affect the most critical component in your application – the database. We've built Migrate to be predictable while allowing you to control how database schema changes are carried out.</p><p>Prisma Migrate generates migrations as plain SQL files based on changes in your Prisma schema. These SQL files are fully customizable and allow you to use any feature of the underlying database, such as manipulating data supporting a migration, setting up triggers, stored procedures, and views.</p><p>Prisma Migrate treads the balance between productivity and control by automating the repetitive and error-prone aspects of writing database migrations while giving you the final say over how they are executed.</p><h3 id="integration-with-prisma-client"><a href="#integration-with-prisma-client" aria-label="integration with prisma client permalink"></a>Integration with Prisma Client</h3><p>Prisma Migrate integrates with Prisma Client using the Prisma schema as their shared source of truth. In other words, both Prisma Client and migrations are generated based on the Prisma schema. This makes synchronizing and verifying database schema changes in your application code easier by leveraging Prisma Client's type safety.</p><h3 id="prisma-migrate-is-ready-for-broader-testing"><a href="#prisma-migrate-is-ready-for-broader-testing" aria-label="prisma migrate is ready for broader testing permalink"></a>Prisma Migrate is ready for broader testing</h3><p>Prisma Migrate has passed rigorous testing internally and is now ready for broader testing by the community. You can use it with PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and SQL Server. <strong>However, as a Preview feature, it is not fully production-ready yet.</strong> To read more about what Preview means, check out the <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/more/releases#preview">maturity levels</a> in the Prisma docs.</p><p>Thus, we're inviting you to try it out and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/4531">give us feedback</a> so we can bring Prisma Migrate to General Availability. 🚢</p><p>Your feedback and suggestions will help us shape the future of Prisma Migrate. 🙌</p><hr><h2 id="how-does-prisma-migrate-work"><a href="#how-does-prisma-migrate-work" aria-label="how does prisma migrate work permalink"></a>How does Prisma Migrate work?</h2><p>Prisma Migrate is based on the <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema">Prisma schema</a> and works by generating <code>.sql</code> migration files that are executed against your database.</p><p>The Prisma schema is the starting point for schema migrations and provides an overview of your desired end-state of the database. Prisma Migrate inspects changes in the Prisma schema and generates the necessary <code>.sql</code> migration files to apply.</p><p>Applying migrations looks very different depending on the stage of development. For example, during development, there are scenarios where resetting the database can be tolerated for quicker prototyping, while in production, great care must be taken to avoid data loss and breaking changes.</p><p>Prisma Migrate accommodates for this with workflows for local development and applying migrations in production.</p><h3 id="evolving-the-schema-in-development"><a href="#evolving-the-schema-in-development" aria-label="evolving the schema in development permalink"></a>Evolving the schema in development</h3><p>To use the new version of Prisma Migrate, you should have at least version <code>2.13.0</code> of the <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-cli/installation"><code>@prisma/cli</code></a> package installed.</p><p>During development, you first define the Prisma schema and then run the <code>prisma migrate dev --preview-feature</code> command, which generates the migration, applies it, and generates Prisma Client:</p><p><span><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9dee8cc50b930a017447904d95e15e0e82f9a3bf/426d4/blog/posts/2020-12-migrate-development-workflow.png" alt="Development workflow"><span>Development workflow</span></span></p><p>Here is an example showing it in action:</p><p><strong>1.

By allowing you to inspect and edit the migration SQL, you can decide whether to rename the column (and retain the data in the column) or drop it and add a new one.</p><p>If you're upgrading Prisma Migrate from the Experimental version, check out the <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/prisma-guides/prisma-migrate-guides/add-prisma-migrate-to-a-project">upgrade guide</a>.</p><hr><h2 id="whats-next"><a href="#whats-next" aria-label="whats next permalink"></a>What's next</h2><p>This Preview version of Prisma Migrate lays the foundations for the upcoming General Availability release.

      <section>
        <p>In my <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/how-first-principles-thinking-fails/">last post</a> I examined how first principles thinking fails. This post is going to be about a single, concrete example — about an argument that started me down this path in the first place.</p><p>A couple of months ago, a friend sent me a blog post titled <em><a href="https://ensorial.com/2020/dont-raise-money/">Startups Shouldn’t Raise Money</a></em>, over at a website called ensorial.com. I thought that the post was tightly argued and reasonably put together, with each proposition leading logically and coherently to the next. I also noticed that the author had taken the time to construct their argument from first principles … which meant it was difficult to refute any individual clause in their chain of reasoning.</p><p>But I also thought it was wrong. I told my friend as much.</p><p>“How is it wrong?” he immediately challenged.</p><p>“Well …” I began. And then I stopped. I realised I didn’t have a good argument for <em>why</em> it was wrong. Every axiom and intermediate proposition were ideas that I agreed with. And it wasn’t so simple as the conclusion being flat out mistaken — you <em>could</em> probably run a small, successful internet business using the ideas laid out in the posts’s argument (internet-based businesses tend to be simpler to manage, and there are many niches you can occupy).</p><p>But I felt uneasy because I thought the framing wasn’t as <em>useful</em>. This was a more complex thing to debunk.</p><h2 id="the-setup">The Setup</h2><p>It’s easy to think that arguments have just three terminal truth values: right, maybe, and wrong. In practice, arguments (and in particular, the sort of argument that we use to justify actions) have many possible truth values. These include things like ‘got the details wrong, but is by-and-large correct’, or ‘is correct but for a <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-right-level-of-abstraction/">different level of abstraction</a>; doesn’t apply here’, or ‘is partially correct, but isn’t as useful compared to a different framing of things.’ The ensorial.com piece is interesting because I think it is an instance of that last one. It was what pushed me to start thinking about all the various ways first principles thinking could go wrong.</p><p>The author’s argument unfolds as follows:</p><ol><li>Startups are risky.</li><li>Raising capital to do a startup reduces skin in the game (you’re spending other people’s money, after all).</li><li>Once you have less skin in the game, it is easier to make bad decisions. The author argues this is due to a) having a capital buffer to cushion you, and b) having more time to waste.</li><li>The alternative is to forego raising venture capital and to create a sustainable business from the beginning, ‘growing linearly with the number of people that give you money for your product.’</li><li>This aligns incentives: you grow only by solving customer problems that they would pay you for. And you’ll pick the shortest path, because you don’t have the luxury of time given to you by an infusion of other people’s money.</li><li>Therefore: startups shouldn’t raise money.</li></ol><p>At first glance, there doesn’t seem to be anything that’s explicitly <em>wrong</em> with this argument. I agree with all the base ideas, and I found myself nodding to the intermediate propositions. The logical correctness of the argument wasn’t a problem. No, my unease stemmed from experience: I <em>knew</em> this wasn’t the right way to think about raising capital. But I couldn’t begin to construct an argument that went against it.</p><figure><img src="https://commoncog.com/blog/content/images/2020/12/argument_chain.f369ba07141442ea959636c21f56e207.png" alt=""></figure><p>My friend and I spent no more than 10 minutes discussing this piece. But in the months after our conversation, I continued to return to the author’s argument. I thought it was interesting because it represented a type of thinking error that you and I are likely to encounter in our lives. The form of the error is subtle, and therefore more difficult to detect; the best description I have for it is: ‘perfectly rational, logically constructed, and not really <em>wrong</em> — but not as useful or as powerful as some other framing.’</p><p>Of course, my obsession was for instrumental reasons: how might you recognise a better framing when you found one? I’ll admit that I was a little naive here: I thought that if I could generalise the structure of this argument, I would be better able to recognise similar errors in the future. Alas, I have not been able to do this to my satisfaction.</p><p>(In practice, most of the older entrepreneurs I know seem to understand the problems with such sensemaking. Plausible arguments are dealt with in a simple manner: you try the recommendations that unfold from the analysis, but you remain alert to see if they give you exactly the results you want. If they don’t, you keep the frame for the time being, but you continue to look out for a better explanation. And how would you know if you have found a better way of thinking about your situation? Simple: you listen carefully. In the words of Malaysian magnate Robert Kuok, “you learn to distill wisdom from the air.”)</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The most I’ve been able to do is to articulate <em>how</em> the author messed up — and therefore how first principles thinking may fail — something that I <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/how-first-principles-thinking-fails/">explored in my previous post</a>. The core idea is simple: I believe the author started from a limited set of axioms. If you start from a wrong set of axioms, you would eventually end up with a flawed conclusion. In this case, I think the ensorial.com author started from a deficient understanding of business.</p><p>To generalise a little, people with limited understanding of business think that business is all about making profits. But those who actually run businesses know that running a business is all about managing cash flows.</p><p>And the ensorial.com author’s argument fails because he doesn’t appear to understand this.</p><h2 id="john-malone-and-the-invention-of-ebitda">John Malone and the Invention of EBITDA</h2><p>In 1972, a 32 year old man named John Malone was offered the top job at Tele-Communications Inc (TCI), a cable company. He took charge on April Fool’s Day, 1973.</p><p>At the time of his hiring, Malone was president of Jerrold Electronics, a division of General Instrument that supplied cable boxes and credit to the cable systems companies. He had been offered the Jerrold Electronics job when he was 29 years old, just two years earlier. Before JE, he was at McKinsey Consulting. And before McKinsey, he had a job at AT&amp;T’s famed Bell Labs, where he applied operations research to find optimal company strategies in monopoly markets. Malone concluded that AT&amp;T should increase its debt load and aggressively reduce its equity base through share repurchases — a highly unorthodox recommendation at the time. His advice was delivered to AT&amp;T’s board and then promptly ignored.</p><p>Malone had been thinking about the interplay between debt, profit, cash flow, and corporate taxes for some time. In 1972, when he was first offered the TCI job, he had already noticed a number of structural properties in the cable industry that piqued his interest:</p><ol><li>The cable industry had highly predictable subscription revenues. Cable television customers in the 60s — especially those in rural communities — were eager to upgrade to cable for better TV reception. These subscribers paid monthly fees and rarely cancelled.</li><li>Cable franchises were essentially a legal right to a local monopoly, which meant that cable system operators had limited competition once it established itself in a given locale.</li><li>The industry itself had very favourable tax characteristics — smart cable operators could shelter their cash flow from taxes by using debt to build new systems, and by aggressively depreciating the costs of construction. Once the depreciation ran out on particular systems, they could then sell them to another operator, where the depreciation clock would start anew.</li><li>Most importantly, the entire market was growing like a weed: over the course of the 60s and into the start of the 70s, subscriber counts had grown over twentyfold.</li></ol><p>Of course, Malone didn’t have much time to reflect on these observations. He landed at TCI and found the company at the brink of bankruptcy.</p><p>Bob Magness, the founder of TCI, had grown the company over the course of two decades using a ridiculous pile of debt — about 17 times revenues, at the time of Malone’s hiring. Malone spent his first couple of years at TCI fighting to keep the company alive. He flew into New York every couple of weeks, hat in hand, renegotiating <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/covenant.asp">covenants</a> and asking for extensions on debt repayments. At one point during a meeting with TCI’s bankers, Malone threw his keys on the table and threatened to walk, leaving the company to the banks. The bankers capitulated, granting TCI a much needed extension.</p><p>Malone and Magness also had to worry about hostile takeovers, given TCI’s low stock price in the early 70s. They executed a series of complicated financial manoeuvres a year or so after Malone took over, placing a large chunk of stock in a holding company to grant them majority control. Later, they created a separate class of voting stock. These moves gave them hard control of the company, allowing Malone the freedom to focus on righting its finances.</p><p>After three years of hell, TCI was finally pulled back from the brink of financial disaster. And then Malone got to work.</p><p>Malone understood a few things about the cable industry that many outsiders didn’t. First, he understood that cable was like real estate: incredibly high fixed costs up front as you built or bought the systems, and then highly predictable, monopoly cash flows for a long time afterwards. He understood that if he used debt to finance acquisitions, he could keep growing the company, and use the depreciation on acquired systems (plus the write-offs from the loans itself) to delay paying taxes on that cash flow. Third, Malone understood that untaxed cash flows from all of those cable subscribers could be used to a) service the debt, b) pay down some of those loans — only when necessary; Malone wanted to keep the debt-to-earnings ratio at a five-to-one level — but more importantly c) demonstrate to creditors that TCI was a worthy debtor. And finally, Malone understood the benefits of size: the larger TCI got, the lower the cost of acquiring programming (i.e. shows and programs), because it could amortise those costs across its entire subscriber …</p></section></div></div>

        <p>Opening a page in the Google Cloud Console always takes a long time.</p>
<p>Here are some metrics I collected on a high-end 2018 MacBook Pro on a UK-based Gigabit internet connection.</p>

</div>
<p>Download size is the compressed size, JavaScript size is uncompressed. Main Content is the time when e.g. the Cloud Functions become visible, Fully Loaded is when no more changes are made to the UI.</p>

<p>We can see that each page loads over 15 MB of JavaScript code. A look at the performance timeline in Chrome DevTools confirms that running this code is the primary cause of the poor page performance.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/timeline.png" alt="DevTools CPU timeline showing a large amount of JavaScript work"></p>
<p>This article will take a closer look at the page load process of the Google Cloud Functions page, and examine how it could be sped up.</p>
<p>You can use these strategies to investigate and improve the performance of the apps you're working on.</p>
<h2 id="loading-the-html-document">Loading the HTML document</h2>
<p>The initial HTML request is very fast and only takes about 150ms. It contains an embedded SVG spinner that shows while the first chunk of JavaScript code is loading.</p>
<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="">
    <source src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/gcp-spinner.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<h2 id="loading-the-initial-java-script-bundles">Loading the initial JavaScript bundles</h2>
<p>These are the first two JavaScript bundles the page starts loading.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>routemap</strong> 21 KB (103 KB uncompressed)</li>
<li><strong>core,pm_ng1_bootstrap</strong> 1.3 MB (4.8 MB uncompressed)</li>
</ul>
<p>These files don't take too long to download, but running the code freezes the UI for a while. The spinner SVG becomes stuck at this point, until it's replaced by a skeleton UI for Google Cloud Console page.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/gcp-initial-load.png" alt="Filmstrip showing initial rendering of the GCP page"></p>
<p>Here's what happens when the browser wants to run some JavaScript code.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Parsing</strong> (done lazily at first, and then as needed later on)</li>
<li><strong>Compilation</strong> (also happens lazily)</li>
<li><strong>Initialization</strong> –&nbsp;the browser runs module initialization code, i.e. code that runs when loading a module rather than when calling one of its functions</li>
<li><strong>Running core app code</strong> – renders the application using the initialized modules</li>
</ol>
<p>For the whole Google Cloud page, just parsing the source code takes 250ms, and compilation takes another 750ms (not including the 113 ms spent on "Compile Script").</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/devtools-profile.png" alt="DevTools profile showing a breakdown of CPU activity"></p>
<p>The initial render of the Angular app takes about 1s.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/initial-bundle.png" alt="JavaScript execution flamechart"></p>
<p>Eventually we start to see a new spinner.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/second-spinner.png" alt="Page frame and new spinner"></p>
<h2 id="loading-page-bundles">Loading page bundles</h2>
<p>Once the generic Google Cloud UI is rendered the page starts loading 18 additional JavaScript files with an overall size of 1.5 MB.</p>
<p>Making a lot of separate requests isn't actually a problem though – it can improve performance by increasing the likelinhood of cache hits, and splitting up bundles makes it easy to load only necessary code.</p>
<p>After loading the first set up bundles the app starts making fetch requests and loads 3 more bundles at a total size of 6 MB.</p>
<p>When loading the page on my normal network the requests all kind of blurred together and it was hard to see which requests were sequential. So this screenshot shows the request chart on a throttled connection.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/more-page-bundles.png" alt="Request waterfall showing three sets of JavaScript being loaded sequentially"></p>
<h2 id="loading-the-list-of-cloud-functions">Loading the list of Cloud Functions</h2>
<p>The request loading the list of Cloud Functions takes about 700ms. But it doesn't start as soon as the bundles are loaded, in part because there's a <code>testIamPermissions</code> request that needs to finish first.</p>
<p>As a result the CPU ends up being idle for half a second –&nbsp;this time could be used better if the request started sooner.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/loading-functions.png" alt="Waterfall showing requests made to load the list of cloud functions"></p>
<p>Finally the app re-renders and we get the list of Cloud Functions we wanted to see.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/cloud-functions.png" alt="Page showing GCP Cloud Functions"></p>

<p>Chrome DevTools has a code coverage tool tracks which parts of the code actually run on the current page. This can help identify code that doesn't have to be loaded.</p>
<p>The Cloud Functions page runs 53% of the JavaScript code it downloads. This is actually a bit disappointing, as it means that even if only necessary code is loaded it would still only cut the total JavaScript size of the page in half.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/code-coverage.png" alt="Chrome DevTools Code Coverage tool"></p>
<h2 id="moving-configuration-into-json">Moving configuration into JSON</h2>
<p>A good amount of the code actually consists of configuration objects. For example, this 200 KB object with 4997 keys.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/configuration.png" alt="Configuration object in a JavaScript bundle"></p>
<p>Loading this as a JSON string with <code>JSON.parse</code> could be faster, as JSON is simpler to parse than a JavaScript object. This would be easy to do, but might not result in a huge performance improvement.</p>
<p>Ideally the app wouldn't need to load the full list on the client, but this would be harder to implement.</p>
<h2 id="reduce-code-duplication">Reduce code duplication</h2>
<p>The 200KB JSON object above is actually included in two of the JavaScript bundles. Breaking it out and reusing it would save download and processing time.</p>
<p>The same seems to apply to a bunch of UI components, like this one.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/code-duplication.png" alt="Duplicate code in DevTools code search"></p>
<h2 id="prioritize-primary-content">Prioritize primary content</h2>
<p>The Google Cloud page loads a large initial JavaScript bundle. The longer it takes to load and initialize this code, the longer it takes to load page-specific code and to render the list of Cloud Functions the user wants to see.</p>
<p>But the initial bundle also contains secondary content, like the complex navigation sidebar. This menu becomes functional before the main page content is loaded, but it should only be loaded after the primary content.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/prioritize-primary-content.png" alt="Sidebar menu is open while main content is still loading"></p>
<p>Google Cloud already does this in some cases. For example, the page initially renders a simpler version of the header and then loads more complex features later on.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/header.png" alt="Header doesn't show project dropdown at first and then shows it later"></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>While the performance of static pages tends to be dominated by render-blocking network requests, single-page apps are often blocked by JavaScript execution or loading account data.</p>
<p>Downloading large amounts of code can hurt performance on slow connections, but due to compression and caching CPU processing often has a greater impact.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>As we know from the previous parts of this series, the execution of a Python program consists of two major steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-2-how-the-cpython-compiler-works/">The CPython compiler</a> translates Python code to bytecode.</li>
<li><a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-1-how-the-cpython-vm-works/">The CPython VM</a> executes the bytecode.</li>
</ol>
<p>We've been focusing on the second step for quite a while. In <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-4-how-python-bytecode-is-executed/">part 4</a> we've looked at the evaluation loop, a place where Python bytecode gets executed. And in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-5-how-variables-are-implemented-in-cpython/">part 5</a> we've studied how the VM executes the instructions that are used to implement variables. What we haven't covered yet is how the VM actually computes something. We postponed this question because to answer it, we first need to understand how the most fundamental part of the language works. Today, we'll study the Python object system.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In this post I'm referring to CPython 3.9. Some implementation details will certainly change as CPython evolves. I'll try to keep track of important changes and add update notes.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Consider an extremely simple piece of Python code:</p>



<p>To compute the function <code>f</code>, CPython must evaluate the expression <code>x + 7</code>. The question I'd like to ask is: How does CPython do that? Special methods such as <code>__add__()</code> and <code>__radd__()</code> probably come to your mind. When we define these methods on a class, the instances of that class can be added using the <code>+</code> operator. So, you might think that CPython does something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>It calls <code>x.__add__(7)</code> or <code>type(x).__add__(x, 7)</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>x</code> doesn't have <code>__add__()</code>, or if this method fails, it calls <code>(7).__radd__(x)</code> or <code>int.__radd__(7, x)</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reality, tough, is a bit more complicated. What really happens depends on what <code>x</code> is. For example, if <code>x</code> is an instance of a user-defined class, the algorithm described above resembles the truth. If, however, <code>x</code> is an instance of a built-in type, like <code>int</code> or <code>float</code>, CPython doesn't call any special methods at all.</p>
<p>To learn how some Python code is executed, we can do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disassemble the code into bytecode.</li>
<li>Study how the VM executes the disassembled bytecode instructions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's apply this algorithm to the function <code>f</code>. The compiler translates the body of this function to the following bytecode:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ python -m dis f.py
...
  2           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)
              2 LOAD_CONST               1 (7)
              4 BINARY_ADD
              6 RETURN_VALUE
</pre></div>


<p>And here's what these bytecode instructions do:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>LOAD_FAST</code> loads the value of the parameter <code>x</code> onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>LOAD_CONST</code> loads the constant <code>7</code> onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>BINARY_ADD</code> pops two values from the stack, adds them and pushes the result back onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>RETURN_VALUE</code> pops the value from the stack and returns it.</li>
</ol>
<p>How does the VM add two values? To answer this question, we need to understand what these values are. For us, <code>7</code> is an instance of <code>int</code> and <code>x</code> is, well, anything. For the VM, though, everything is a Python object. All values the VM pushes onto the stack and pops from the stack are pointers to <code>PyObject</code> structs (hence the phrase "Everything in Python is an object").</p>
<p>The VM doesn't need to know how to add integers or strings, that is, how to do the arithmetic or concatenate sequences. All it needs to know is that every Python object has a type. A type, in turn, knows everything about its objects. For example, the <code>int</code> type knows how to add integers, and the <code>float</code> type knows how to add floats. So, the VM asks the type to perform the operation.</p>
<p>This simplified explanation captures the essence of the solution, but it also omits a lot of important details. To get a more realistic picture, we need to understand what Python objects and types really are and how they work.</p>
<h2>Python objects and types</h2>
<p>We've discussed Python objects a little in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-3-stepping-through-the-cpython-source-code/">part 3</a>. This discussion is worth repeating here.</p>
<p>We begin with the definition of the <code>PyObject</code> struct:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>_object</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>_PyObject_HEAD_EXTRA</span> <span>// macro, for debugging purposes only</span>
    <span>Py_ssize_t</span> <span>ob_refcnt</span><span>;</span>
    <span>PyTypeObject</span> <span>*</span><span>ob_type</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It has two members:</p>
<ul>
<li>a reference count <code>ob_refcnt</code> that CPython uses for garbage collection; and</li>
<li>a pointer to the object's type <code>ob_type</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We said that the VM treats any Python object as <code>PyObject</code>. How is that possible? The C programming language has no notion of classes and inheritance. Nevertheless, it's possible to implement in C something that can be called a single inheritance. The C standard states that a pointer to any struct can be converted to a pointer to its first member and vice versa. So, we can "extend" <code>PyObject</code> by defining a new struct whose first member is <code>PyObject</code>.</p>
<p>Here's, for example, how the <code>float</code> object is defined:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span> <span>// expansion of PyObject_HEAD macro</span>
    <span>double</span> <span>ob_fval</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyFloatObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>A <code>float</code> object stores everything <code>PyObject</code> stores plus a floating-point value <code>ob_fval</code>. The C standard simply states that we can convert a pointer to <code>PyFloatObject</code> to a pointer to <code>PyObject</code> and vice versa:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>float_object</span><span>;</span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>obj_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>&amp;</span><span>float_object</span><span>;</span>
<span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>*</span><span>float_obj_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>obj_ptr</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The reason why the VM treats every Python object as <code>PyObject</code> is because all it needs to access is the object's type. A type is also a Python object, an instance of the <code>PyTypeObject</code> struct:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>// PyTypeObject is a typedef for "struct _typeobject"</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>_typeobject</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyVarObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span> <span>// expansion of PyObject_VAR_HEAD macro</span>

<p>By the way, note that the first member of a type is not <code>PyObject</code> but <code>PyVarObject</code>, which is defined as follows:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span>
    <span>Py_ssize_t</span> <span>ob_size</span><span>;</span> <span>/* Number of items in variable part */</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyVarObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Nevertheless, since the first member of <code>PyVarObject</code> is <code>PyObject</code>, a pointer to a type can still be converted to a pointer to <code>PyObject</code>.</p>
<p>So, what is a type and why does it have so many members? A type determines how the objects of that type behave. Each member of a type, called slot, is responsible for a particular aspect of the object's behavior. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tp_new</code> is a pointer to a function that creates new objects of the type.</li>
<li><code>tp_str</code> is a pointer to a function that implements  <code>str()</code> for objects of the type.</li>
<li><code>tp_hash</code> is a pointer to a function that implements  <code>hash()</code> for objects of the type.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some slots, called sub-slots, are grouped together in suites. A suite is just a struct that contains related slots. For example, the <code>PySequenceMethods</code> struct is a suite of sub-slots that implement the sequence protocol:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>lenfunc</span> <span>sq_length</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>sq_concat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_repeat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_item</span><span>;</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>was_sq_slice</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeobjargproc</span> <span>sq_ass_item</span><span>;</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>was_sq_ass_slice</span><span>;</span>
    <span>objobjproc</span> <span>sq_contains</span><span>;</span>

    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>sq_inplace_concat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_inplace_repeat</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PySequenceMethods</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If you count all the slots and sub-slots, you'll get a scary number. Fortunately, each slot is very well <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html">documented</a> in the Python/C API Reference Manual (I strongly recommend you to bookmark this link). Today we'll cover only a few slots. Nevertheless, it shall give us a general idea of how slots are used.</p>
<p>Since we're interested in how CPython adds objects, let's find the slots responsible for addition. There must be at least one such slot. After careful inspection of the <code>PyTypeObject</code> struct, we find that it has the "number" suite <code>PyNumberMethods</code>, and the first slot of this suite is a binary function called <code>nd_add</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_add</span><span>;</span> <span>// typedef PyObject * (*binaryfunc)(PyObject *, PyObject *)</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_subtract</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_multiply</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_remainder</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_divmod</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// ... more sub-slots</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyNumberMethods</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It seems that the <code>nb_add</code> slot is what we're looking for. Two questions naturally arise regarding this …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>16 Aug 2020 • 5 min read</p><p>Have you been struggling to study effectively? Sometimes it seems as if we have more pages to read than time on the clock. However, if you decide to study smart instead of studying hard, you are more likely to get the outcome that you desire. In this article, you will be given strategies on how to study effectively.</p><picture><source media="(min-width: 1100px)" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/how-to-study-effectively/studying-920.jpg, https://productive.fish/blog/how-to-study-effectively/studying.jpg 2x"><source media="(max-width: 1099px) and (min-width: 421px)" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/how-to-study-effectively/studying-640.jpg, https://productive.fish/blog/how-to-study-effectively/studying-1280.jpg 2x"><source media="(max-width: 420px)" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/how-to-study-effectively/studying-420.jpg, https://productive.fish/blog/how-to-study-effectively/studying-840.jpg 2x"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/how-to-study-effectively/studying.jpg" alt="Illustration of studying person"></picture><h2 id="organize-your-learning-process">Organize your learning process</h2><p>Organizing your entire learning process is the very first step that you need to take in studying more effectively. You will need to assign a particular place in your home where you get your studying done, determine a schedule that guides your study time, and you will need to decide whether or not you will be studying in a group or by yourself. You will also need to determine what study style is best for you. Having this in place helps you to approach your studying in a more systematic and efficient manner.</p><p>Let’s take a look at approaches that can help you to better understand how to learn effectively.</p><h3 id="spaced-repetition">Spaced Repetition</h3><p><a href="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition">Spaced repetition</a> refers to the practice of allowing space between each study session. By integrating time intervals in your study schedule, you will be able to retain more even if you spend less time studying.</p><p>This works by tapping into the potential of what is called the spacing effect. This speaks to the fact that our brain is better able to learn new concepts by using intervals between exposure to the information.</p><p>How to study more effectively with this method? Let’s say you have an exam scheduled for next week. You should have a study session today. Your next study session would be two days from today. You should then have a final study session the day before the test.</p><h3 id="active-recall">Active recall</h3><p>Another way to learn effectively is to employ the principles of active recall. This approach has been found to be the most effective, efficient, and quickest way to study materials. This approach holds that in order to get the best out of studying, you need to actively stimulate your memory. This moves students from a passive approach to studying such as simply reading silently to an approach where the student interacts with the material.</p><p>This includes asking and answering questions about the material read and many other tactics. You will find that there are a number of different ways to implement active recall. Two popular methods of active learning are the Read-Recite-Review (3R) method and the Feynman Technique.</p><h3 id="pomodoro-technique-and-the-importance-of-study-breaks">Pomodoro Technique and the Importance of Study Breaks</h3><p>The struggle we all have with procrastination is real and should not be overlooked. One of the best strategies for minimizing distractions is the <a href="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique">Pomodoro technique</a>. This approach helps to keep you from becoming overwhelmed by studying and from burnouts. It includes stipulated work intervals and breaks.</p><p>An example of studying effectively with the Pomodoro technique is as follows:</p><ul><li>Study for 25 minutes</li><li>Distractions will come. When they do, write them down on a piece of paper.</li><li>At the end of the 25-minute period, place a check mark on your paper.</li><li>Break from studying for 5 minutes.</li><li>After doing this 4 times, take a 30-minute break.</li><li>Repeat the entire process.</li></ul><p>This method was developed by Francesco Cirillo. This time management technique was inspired by the popular tomato-shaped kitchen timer.</p><p>Breaks are critical to learning effectively. These breaks help to maintain performance while studying, reduce the stress associated with studying, increase focus, and help with memory retention.</p><h3 id="bite-sized-learning">Bite-sized learning</h3><p>Another method to consider when trying to uncover how to study better is bite-sized learning. This method means just what the name suggests – studying information in small bits or spending very short periods studying at a time.</p><p>With the constant reduction of attention span among humans in the 21st century, it is becoming more and more important that you spend 1-15 minutes at a time on any given learning objective. The focus that you will have in this short period of time makes learning more effective.</p><h2 id="take-notes-the-right-way">Take notes the right way</h2><p>There are many powerful reasons that all students should actively take notes in class and while studying. These reasons include:</p><p>Taking notes is helpful in keeping your mind alert. By actively writing notes, you are interacting with the information. This helps to reduce drowsiness and prevents distractions. The act of deciphering what information to jot down helps to keep your mind engaged in what you are reading or listening to. Taking notes gives you an opportunity to highlight or emphasize certain bits of information. It also helps with the organization of said information. The highlighted and organized information that you take during class or in a study session helps to make your future study sessions or review of class information much more effective. Taking good notes in class or during a study session provides you with an abbreviated yet potent set of information for effective studying. When it becomes necessary to study for an exam or a test, you can easily draw on your notes and spend less time reinforcing the most important points.</p><p>Let’s look at some note-taking techniques to help you effectively study.</p><h3 id="the-cornell-note-taking-system">The Cornell Note Taking System</h3><p>This system of note-taking was developed by Walter Pauk in the 1940s. This approach to notetaking is systematic and more condensed. It can be used by high school students or students at the college level.</p><p>This method entails a student dividing a page into three sections. A keyword section, the notes section, and a section for a summary of the lesson. In this method, long sentences are avoided while taking notes to reduce the bulk. The keyword section only features words or questions that are most important , which students can easily reflect on when reviewing their notes.</p><h3 id="the-outlining-method">The Outlining Method</h3><p>This method is ideal for you when your are trying to discover how to study more effectively. It includes creating an outline of the course, article or a book. In this method, information is summarized in brief bullet points. The major points are at farthest to the left while minor points are indented.</p><h3 id="the-mapping-method">The Mapping Method</h3><p>The mapping method involves the use of a graphic representation of that which is being studied. It shows how the various pieces of information to be absorbed relates to each other. The <a href="https://productive.fish/blog/mind-mapping-software">mind mapping method</a> can be coupled with the outline method or the Cornell note-taking system quite effectively.</p><h2 id="teach-someone-else">Teach someone else</h2><p>It is always said that the best way to better learn a subject is to teach it to someone else. One of the most effective ways to retain information is to share it with others. You could develop a habit of mentoring students in your class who are having a hard time grasping the concepts being taught.</p><p>Another creative way to deepen your understanding of a subject by teaching others is by starting a blog series on the topic that you are studying. You will be able to edify others while being better prepared to succeed in your next exam.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Learning to study more effectively is a critical part of student success. While all of these methods have been proven to be effective, everybody learns differently; therefore, it is best for you to try each of these methods to see which is most effective for you. Fight the temptation to be lazy in this process. By finding the approach that is best for you, your entire academic life can become much smoother.</p></article></div>]]>

					<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>We’re sharing a raft of new performance results for our MK2 IPU-based machine intelligence systems today. You’ll see our IPU-M2000 system significantly outperforms the Nvidia A100 DGX across the board, with orders of magnitude performance improvements for some models.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Graphcore customers are already making big leaps forward with our second generation IPU systems – whether they prioritise faster time to result, model accuracy, better efficiency, lower TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) or the chance to make new breakthroughs in AI with the IPU.</p>
<p>We’ve chosen a range of the most popular models our customers frequently turn to as proxies for their proprietary production AI workloads in natural language processing, computer vision and more, both in training and inference.</p>
<p>We are also delighted to share results in this blog using our new PyTorch framework support. We are continuing to develop and expand this capability – you can find out more in our blog <a href="https://www.graphcore.ai/posts/introducing-pytorch-for-the-ipu"><span>here</span></a>. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The results are measured on IPU-M2000 &amp; IPU-POD<sub>64</sub> platforms. Wherever possible, we compare IPU performance against performance numbers published by NVIDIA for the A100 GPU as part of the DGX A100 platform. It’s notoriously hard to find an exact apples-to-apples comparison for very different products and chip architectures, so we compare against the closest platform in terms of price and power. Where NVIDIA has not published results for a particular model, measured results are used.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Code for all of our benchmarks is available from the examples repo on the <a href="https://github.com/graphcore"><span>Graphcore GitHub</span></a> site where you can also find code for many other model types and application examples.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>We’ve included notes for each chart to explain our methodology and to provide additional information about batch sizes, data sets, floating point arithmetic, frameworks etc. In addition to publishing our benchmarking charts in this blog and on our <a href="https://www.graphcore.ai/benchmarks" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a>, we are also publishing performance data in <a href="https://www.graphcore.ai/performance-results" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tabular format </a>for IPU-M2000 and IPU-POD systems on our website. We’ll add more and update the results regularly.</p>
<p>Finally, we’ve also joined <a href="https://mlcommons.org/en/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MLCommons</a>, the governing body for the independent benchmarking organisation, MLPerf. We will be participating in MLPerf in 2021 – starting with the first training submission in the Spring – as well as continuing to build out our own performance results.</p>
<p><strong><span>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</span>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>BERT-Large Training</strong></p>
<p>BERT-Large <span>(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)</span> is established as one of the most widely used models for NLP.</p>
<p>The IPU-POD<sub>64 </sub>is over 5x faster than a DGX A100 system for end-to-end BERT-Large Training to convergence to reference accuracies. To provide consistency in the comparisons used in our other charts, we also show time-to-train for a 2x DGX A100 system.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>BERT-Large Inference</strong></p>
<p>The goal in inference production systems is typically to achieve the highest possible throughput at the lowest possible latency. For example, search engine companies and many automated services using inference need to respond in near real time.</p>
<p>For BERT-Large Inference, the IPU-M2000 delivers 3.4x higher throughput at the lowest latency compared to the A100.</p>

<p><strong>Computer Vision&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>ResNet-50 Training</strong></p>

<p><strong>EfficientNet Training</strong></p>
<p><span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946">EfficientNet</a></span> uses innovative techniques like group separable and depth-wise convolutions to deliver far higher accuracy per parameter than legacy image classification models like ResNet-50.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Group and depth-wise convolutions use smaller kernels which are not well suited to GPUs and this has limited their adoption to date.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>By contrast, a fine-grained processor like the IPU, with its unique MIMD architecture, is much better suited to group convolution, depth-wise convolution and more generally sparse models which inherently do not use dense, contiguous data structures.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Probabilistic Learning</strong></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Probabilistic models are used in applications where the underlying system is inherently stochastic. They are widely used in the financial sector and as well as in scientific research. However, many varieties of probabilistic models do not fit well with the SIMD/SIMT architecture of GPUs and run far too slowly to be of use. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Training</strong></p>
<p>Using an off-the-shelf TensorFlow Probability (TFP) library to assess the performance of probabilistic models on IPU, we see that a financial MCMC workload trains in less than 3 hours on the IPU-M2000 platform, 17x faster than the 48 hours measured on the latest GPU.</p>

<p><strong>Speech Processing</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Converting written text into speech is a challenging but highly valuable area of speech technology research, with a wide variety of use-cases across most industry verticals.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>A number of text-to-speech models have risen to prominence, including Tacotron from Google, Deep Voice from Baidu and FastSpeech from Microsoft, enabling high-quality, end-to-end speech synthesis.</p>
<p><strong>Deep Voice 3 Training</strong></p>
<p>Here we focus on the third Deep Voice iteration.

<p><span><strong>Time Series Analysis</strong></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Time series forecasting models can predict future values based on previous, sequential data. LSTM is one of the most widely used time series analysis models. Financial companies in particular rely on LSTMs for modelling and predicting financial data such as stock prices. The use of LSTM-based methods in the finance industry is highlighted in this <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.06848.pdf"><span>arxiv paper</span></a>.</p>
<p><strong>LSTM Inference</strong></p>
<p>The chart below compares throughput vs latency across a range of batch sizes for the IPU-M2000 vs the latest GPU for an LSTM 2-Layer Inference model. Across a range of batch sizes the performance advantage is apparent. At the lowest latency achievable by the GPU, the IPU-M2000 is capable of achieving 600x higher throughput at a lower latency.</p>

<p><strong>Future Breakthroughs with the IPU</strong></p>
<p>As we have seen, the IPU delivers state of the art performance on established image processing and language models such as ResNet and BERT.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>It is also clear that the IPU can deliver huge performance gains in several new or currently under-utilised model types which are indicative of the future trend in machine intelligence, like EfficientNet, ResNeXt and MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) probability-based methods.</p>
<p>We are also working on some exciting developments with sparse models, and are introducing a preview version of our generalized sparse library support in <a href="https://www.graphcore.ai/posts/introducing-pytorch-for-the-ipu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Poplar SDK 1.4</a>, which was released today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Machine intelligence innovation is still in the early stages and we expect to see many new innovations developed over the next few years. The IPU has been designed to help innovators create these new breakthroughs.</p>

And still is! The specification was just the trigger of a snowball effect. What's the spec for if you can't do anything with it? Tooling is as important as the specification. However, tooling is a number of times more complex than the specification. We engineers don't want to abandon our favorite programming language and framework, therefore, it's AsyncAPI's responsibility to integrate with the existing tools in the market. <strong>The specification (and tools) should work for the user, not the other way around.</strong> Partnering with Postman allows us to boost the development of more and better tools to help engineers create and maintain Asynchronous APIs while using their favorite programming languages and frameworks.</p><p><strong>Our goal is to make Asynchronous APIs as successful and mature as REST APIs.</strong> We are aware this is a long journey but, with Postman's help, we'll be able to grow the team and continue working on the AsyncAPI specification and all the necessary tools to create a delightful developer experience. The AsyncAPI Initiative team is fully committed to open source software (OSS), and the partnership with Postman will help us keep doing our job with freedom and independence.</p><h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2><p>We want to make the AsyncAPI Initiative a neutral and independent place for collaborating on defining the future of Asynchronous APIs. Next step for us is to host the project in a neutral foundation to guarantee the long-term success of the initiative. We're currently in conversations with different actors of the OSS world to make sure the initiative remains independent.</p><p>Also, we want you to work with us. <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/jobs">We are hiring</a> at Postman to work full-time on AsyncAPI. In the first half of 2021, we'll open a bunch of positions, including Software Engineers, Graphic Designers, Technical Writers, and more. Make sure you don't miss them!</p><div><h3>Receive an email when we publish a new job offer:</h3><p>We respect your inbox.

And of course, a huge shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/derberq">Łukasz Gornicki</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/e_morcillo">Eva Morcillo</a> for their tireless support. None of these would be possible without their help.</p><p>There's a bright future ahead for Asynchronous APIs. 2021 will be the year of AsyncAPI, the year of you, our beloved open-source community.</p><p><undefined>Cheers! <span role="img" aria-label="clinking beer mugs">🍻</span></undefined></p></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>He couldn't believe it. This certainly couldn't be true. Someone else must have made a mistake here. He read the email a second time. Maybe he missed something and the whole thing was just a big misunderstanding? But he didn't, of course. He is the kind of person who always pays attention to typos, therefore reading it again was quite pointless. Anger started spreading through him. How dare they? It felt so incredibly stupid and unfair. Especially considering he was such a law-abiding citizen. He despised those who didn't follow rules. They couldn't possibly mean that he was one of them? Yet this is exactly what the email was saying: "We can inform you that you unfortunately have used the wrong licence plate in the app, which is why you have been given a fine. In this case the fine is issued on <strong>AB12345</strong>, while parking was activated for <strong>AB1234</strong> in the app.". Filled with rage, he locked his phone and shoved it back into his pocket. He missed one bloody number!</p>
</section><article><section><h2>Validation to the Rescue</h2>
<p>In Norway, license plates for cars follow a certain pattern: they consist of two letters and five digits (there are some exceptions, such as personal license plates). Considering this, we realize that the above scenario could have been avoided merely by adding some form validation! For this, we will utilize <a href="https://react-hook-form.com/">React Hook Form</a>, which has become quite popular over the last year. React Hook Form is easy to use, quite lightweight and very performant. It has built-in validation, but also supports schema-based form validation with other tools such as <a href="https://github.com/jquense/yup">Yup</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/superstruct">Superstruct</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sideway/joi">Joi</a>.</p>
<p>Let's assume we have this very basic skeleton for a parking app:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>function</span> <span>App</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>onFormSubmit</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>e</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> e<span>.</span><span>preventDefault</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>h1<span>&gt;</span>Parking App<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>h1<span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>form onSubmit<span>=</span><span>{</span>onFormSubmit<span>}</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>label<span>&gt;</span>License number<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>label<span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>input name<span>=</span><span>"licenseNo"</span> placeholder<span>=</span><span>"AA11111"</span> <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>button<span>&gt;</span>Start parking<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>button<span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>form<span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The app contains a form with a text input and a button. We also added an <code>onSubmit</code> method that prevents the form from being submitted and the page from being refreshed. Apart from that, the app doesn't really do anything meaningful. Let's add some validation:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>function</span> <span>App</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>{</span> handleSubmit<span>,</span> register <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>useForm</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>onFormSubmit</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>data<span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>h1<span>&gt;</span>Parking App<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>h1<span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>form onSubmit<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>handleSubmit</span><span>(</span>onFormSubmit<span>)</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>label<span>&gt;</span>License number<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>label<span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>input name<span>=</span><span>"licenseNo"</span> placeholder<span>=</span><span>"AA11111"</span> ref<span>=</span><span>{</span>register<span>}</span> <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>button<span>&gt;</span>Start parking<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>button<span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>form<span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, we don't need to add much code to set up React Hook Form. We have to call the <code>useForm</code> hook which returns a bunch of methods. For the time being, we simply use <code>handleSubmit</code> and <code>register</code>. We then wrap the <code>onFormSubmit</code> method into the <code>handleSubmit</code> method. This will take care of only invoking <code>onFormSubmit</code> and pass the form data when all fields are valid (it also prevents the form from submitting, so we don't need to explicitly call the <code>preventDefault</code> method). Finally, we need to set the <code>register</code> method as the input field's ref attribute. But this is not the end of the story! The form allows any input, even if it is left empty. This is why we have to specify some validation rules:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>&lt;</span>input 
  name<span>=</span><span>"licenseNo"</span> 
  placeholder<span>=</span><span>"AA11111"</span> 
  ref<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>register</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
    required<span>:</span> <span>"You must enter a license number."</span><span>,</span>
    pattern<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      value<span>:</span> <span>/^[a-z]{2}\d{5}$/i</span><span>,</span>
      message<span>:</span> <span>"The license number must be a combination of two letters and five digits."</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>}</span>
<span>/</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When registering the input field, we can add several options to adjust how the field should be validated. In the above example, we tell our form that the field is required and that the value must match a specific regex pattern. We also define some error messages. If we try to submit the form, but validation fails, the error message is returned by <code>useForm</code> as an object called <code>errors</code>. Every form field gets its own error message corresponding to the field's <code>name</code> attribute:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>{</span>errors<span>.</span>licenseNo <span>&amp;&amp;</span> errors<span>.</span>licenseNo<span>.</span>message<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Alternatively, we can use a simple component, <code>ErrorMessage</code> (we must first install a separate NPM package):</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>&lt;</span>ErrorMessage
  errors<span>=</span><span>{</span>errors<span>}</span>
  name<span>=</span><span>"licenseNo"</span>
<span>/</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is all we need to avoid registering an invalid license number! However, there are some more concepts we should have a look at.</p>
<h2>Controlled vs. Uncontrolled</h2>
<p>React Hook Form is designed to work best with <em>uncontrolled components</em>. This means that form data is handled by the DOM itself and can be accessed directly using refs (which is why we put the <code>register</code> method there). <em>Controlled components</em> on the other hand, use event handlers such as <code>onChange</code> to update values at state change. Many third-party libraries use controlled components, and luckily there is a way we can use those together with React Hook Form:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>&lt;</span>Controller
  <span>as</span><span>=</span><span>{</span>ReactSelect<span>}</span>
  name<span>=</span><span>"fuelType"</span>
  rules<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>{</span> required<span>:</span> <span>"You must select a fuel type."</span> <span>}</span><span>}</span>
  options<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>[</span>
    <span>{</span> value<span>:</span> <span>"electric"</span><span>,</span> label<span>:</span> <span>"Electric"</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
    <span>{</span> value<span>:</span> <span>"petrol"</span><span>,</span> label<span>:</span> <span>"Petrol"</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
    <span>{</span> value<span>:</span> <span>"diesel"</span><span>,</span> label<span>:</span> <span>"Diesel"</span> <span>}</span>
  <span>]</span><span>}</span>
  isClearable
<span>/</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We add a <a href="https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select">React Select</a> for choosing the cars fuel type by wrapping it inside a <code>Controller</code> component using the <code>as</code> prop. The Controller automatically injects the <code>onChange</code>, <code>onBlur</code> and <code>value</code> props into the wrapped component. The same applies to other props that may be required by the underlying component (in this case the props <code>options</code> and <code>isClearable</code>). Validation rules are applied by setting the <code>rules</code> prop. Although this is the preferred syntax, you sometimes need to use the <code>render</code> prop instead of the <code>as</code> prop, which lets you customize events, value and ref:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>&lt;</span>Controller
  name<span>=</span><span>"fuelType"</span>
  rules<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>{</span> required<span>:</span> <span>"You must select a fuel type."</span> <span>}</span><span>}</span>
  render<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> onChange<span>,</span> onBlur<span>,</span> value<span>,</span> ref <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span>ReactSelect
      options<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>[</span>
        <span>{</span> value<span>:</span> <span>"electric"</span><span>,</span> label<span>:</span> <span>"Electric"</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
        <span>{</span> value<span>:</span> <span>"petrol"</span><span>,</span> label<span>:</span> <span>"Petrol"</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
        <span>{</span> value<span>:</span> <span>"diesel"</span><span>,</span> label<span>:</span> <span>"Diesel"</span> <span>}</span>
      <span>]</span><span>}</span>
      onChange<span>=</span><span>{</span>onChange<span>}</span>
      onBlur<span>=</span><span>{</span>onBlur<span>}</span>
      inputValue<span>=</span><span>{</span>value<span>?.</span>key<span>}</span>
      inputRef<span>=</span><span>{</span>ref<span>}</span>
    <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>)</span><span>}</span>
<span>/</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Form Context</h2>
<p>When moving input fields to shared components in order to make them reusable, you can of course pass all neccessary methods from <code>useForm</code> as props. In many cases, it would be a more elegant solution to put the whole form into a <code>FormProvider</code> and access the context of the form with <code>useformContext</code>:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> methods <span>=</span> <span>useForm</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span>FormProvider <span>{</span><span>...</span>methods<span>}</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>form onSubmit<span>=</span><span>{</span>methods<span>.</span><span>handleSubmit</span><span>(</span>onSubmit<span>)</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>LicenseNoInput <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>button<span>&gt;</span>Start parking<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>button<span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>form<span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>FormProvider<span>&gt;</span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>LicenseNoInput</code> component can then access the form methods as simple as this:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>{</span> errors<span>,</span> register <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>useFormContext</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let's pack it all up, add a little more logic and styling and voilà – we have a parking app with form validation that actually works!</p>

<h2>Like a Swiss Army Knife</h2>
<p>There is so much more you can do with React Hook Form! It's too bad I can't cover it all in a single article. I can recommend a look at the <a href="https://react-hook-form.com/api/">official documentation</a>, which also provides many useful examples. Personally, I have been using this tool for about a year now and have never been in a situation where it couldn't solve a problem. If you are still not convinced, the fact that TypeScript is fully supported will hopefully change your mind.</p></section></article></div>]]>

I’ve written this on the whiteboard next to my standing desk in the home office/guitar studio/mancave/junk room.&nbsp;</p><p>I heard this statement earlier on in the year. Must have been around May or June, it instantly struck a chord with me.</p><p>Working full time and trying to get no less than 3 side hustles and a podcast off the ground is a big ask.&nbsp;</p><p>I have used the progress over perfection mantra before. It was worded slightly differently; I can’t remember the exact statement.</p><p>However, I hadn’t fully embraced the concept.&nbsp;</p><p>When it came to my core skill of software development, I could easily apply this principle.&nbsp;</p><p>Every other part of the side hustle lifestyle was still “I got to make sure this is the best it can be”.</p><h2 id="h-already-integrated-into-my-9-5"><span id="Already_Integrated_into_My_95"></span>Already Integrated into My 9-5<span></span></h2><p>Like I’ve just touched on. I’ve used progress over perfection, day to day with my software development ‘hat’ on.</p><p>I’m going to sound arrogant now. Having spent 14+ years developing software, I’m confident in my skills and the fact I can get stuff done and out the door, quicker than a lot of my “development” peers.</p><p>By using this principle, I can get the feature ‘X’ out to the world. Start feature ‘Y’ and deliver that in rapid time. Same too with Feature ‘Z’</p><p>Then go back to feature ‘X’ and make it better.

I decided to use the “progress over perfection” mantra by making sure the uploading, editing, removing, and retrieving of the photos, from a functionality point of view, was “perfect”</p><p>However, the way the user uploaded the photos and then viewing them was shocking, “perfect” was just a dot on the horizon.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, I went with it as I wanted to get the app published on both the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1519992229">Apple App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.phhdigital.baitcamp">Google Play</a> as quickly as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>5 months after the initial idea came to me, I had published the app on both platforms. WAHOO!</p><p>After feedback from people testing version 1. And the fact I wasn’t happy with the photo upload/viewing features. I have been able to start work on version 1.1 to sort this problem out.</p><p>Another day or two and I will have a slick way of managing the photos. Be able to release an update very quickly. As well as ironing out a few bugs that have come to light.</p><p>I genuinely believe if I had kept on working on the app until I was entirely happy with the photo functionality, I wouldn’t have it published or have people downloading the app and using it.</p><p>The key here was “progress over perfection” to get something live that was usable, then go from there.</p><h2 id="h-side-hustling-and-what-you-need-to-learn"><span id="Side_Hustling_and_What_You_Need_To_Learn"></span>Side Hustling and What You Need To Learn<span></span></h2><p>When it comes to other aspects of side hustling, I’m still “newborn” in a lot of the skills you need.&nbsp;</p><p>Writing blog posts, writing social media posts, copywriting, creating nice-looking webpages, building sales funnels, creating ads, shooting walkthroughs for YouTube, recording video sales letters, editing videos, coming up with offers, researching, scheming and plotting, creating eBooks, creating eBook covers, creating eBook mock-ups, recording podcasts, editing podcasts.</p><p>How did I come up with that list of things to do? I looked at my planner at what tasks I wanted to achieve over the last 2 weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s on top of coding 3 software products by myself. Working 8-4 Monday through Thursday. And, having a life, like spending time with my wife, playing guitar, and going fishing.</p><p>It can be very overwhelming.&nbsp;</p><p>You see how great other people are at all these other things and want your stuff to be as “perfect” as theirs</p><p>That’s why this new mantra has been a bit of a breakthrough for me.</p><h2 id="h-progress-over-perfection-and-switching-your-mindset"><span id="Progress_Over_Perfection_and_Switching_Your_Mindset"></span>Progress Over Perfection and Switching Your Mindset<span></span></h2><p>As I’ve touched upon. For certain aspects of my day to day I would apply “progress over perfection”. Not all aspects though.</p><p>Hearing this really got me thinking about what I wanted to achieve.&nbsp;</p><p>One thing it also did was remove some fear I had around things.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, I had started digging deep into the concept of creating online sales funnels to promote my products and reach my “golden goose” of 350 paying customers.</p><p>My dream is to work for myself running a software product. After a bit of number crunching, I worked out I would need 350 monthly subscribers for me to realize my dream.&nbsp;</p><p>Sales funnels could help me achieve this.</p><h3 id="h-sales-funnel-progress-over-perfection"><span id="Sales_Funnel_Progress_Over_Perfection"></span>Sales Funnel Progress Over Perfection<span></span></h3><p>This is where the fear kicked in. I was worried that I would create a sales funnel, it would completely bomb, and I would feel like a failure.&nbsp;</p><p>I wanted my sales funnels to be successful as soon as I start driving traffic to it. If this were a software product, I wouldn’t think like that. I know they will be some bugs and users would probably want something different than what I had built.</p><p>After consuming a lot of content around the sales funnel process and how even the most experienced “funnel hackers” can’t get their funnel to work out of the gate.&nbsp;</p><p>I decided that I just need to get it out there and see what “feedback” I get.</p><p>So, I continued to put it together as best I could, giving myself a time constraint that it must be done by the end of that week. Then the week after I could drive some paid traffic to it.</p><p>I got the opt-in page up and running, where someone could submit their details and in return get a free eBook user guide.</p><p>Next, I spent most of my time working on the sales page and putting together an offer and pricing.&nbsp;</p><p>Thirdly, I added a “One Time Offer” that the person would be shown if they subscribed to the product I was promoting on the sales page.</p><p>Finally, I put together an email sequence that would be sent to anyone who opted in for the free eBook, as a follow up to get them to revisit my funnel.</p><p>The next week I created a Facebook ad campaign and got loads of people into the funnel. Guess how many sales I made?</p><p>ZERO.</p><h3 id="h-analyzing-the-results"><span id="Analyzing_the_Results"></span>Analyzing the Results<span></span></h3><p>Sounds terrible right? It was, but I wasn’t downhearted.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking into the stats, the opt-in page was working. I was getting almost 45% of the visitors to put in their email address and request a copy of the eBook.</p><p>Yes, no one bought from me. I knew that part of my sales funnel did work. However, I was building an email list of people that I could keep in contact with, which I hadn’t be able to do before.</p><p>“Progress over perfection”.</p><p>I ended up scrapping this funnel as I still didn’t ‘convert’ after a few attempts at rewriting parts of the sales page.</p><p>Taking the learnings from the opt-in success, I created a brand-new funnel. This targeted a different group of people. Again, this funnel wasn’t the success I wanted. My opt-in rate was still high, 35% and I got my first ever paying customer.</p><p>Someone signed up and subscribed to <a href="https://outflash.xyz/">my software product called Outflash</a>. They even took my up one-time offer.</p><p>I was blown away. Yes, it wasn’t the riches you pray for, but I had made progress on this skill.</p><p>Progress! Progress towards what I deem successful.</p><h2 id="h-podcasting-and-getting-yourself-out-there"><span id="Podcasting_and_Getting_Yourself_Out_There"></span>Podcasting and Getting Yourself Out There<span></span></h2><p>A problem with being a developer, is you think it will be like the movie Field of Dreams. “Build it and they will come”. With a software product, this NEVER happens.</p><p>Someone said if you want to get yourself out there to promote your products and services. Use a platform or media that you enjoy yourself. For me this was podcasting.</p><p>I’m an avid podcast listener. Whether it be working out, going for a run, listening while coding. I even put a podcast on while cooking a Sunday Dinner.</p><p>Starting a podcast can be scary though. What do I talk about? Do I have enough content to get past the first 10 episodes? How do I even publish a podcast? Which platforms do I publish to?</p><h3 id="h-excuses-excuses-just-do-it"><span id="Excuses,_Excuses,_Just_Do_It"></span>Excuses, Excuses, Just Do It<span></span></h3><p>Having mild success with the sales funnels gave me a lot of belief in the saying “Just Do It”.</p><p>One of the podcasts I listen to is by two guys that have launched their own podcasting hosting and publishing platform. I know, a bit Inception right!</p><p>So, I decided to use their platform to publish and host <a href="https://www.philliphughes.co.uk/podcast/">my podcast</a>. Which platforms to publish to? Their service had guides on how to publish to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/find-your-side-hustle/id1523991465">Apple</a> and <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy50cmFuc2lzdG9yLmZtL2ZpbmQteW91ci1zaWRlLWh1c3RsZQ?sa=X&amp;ved=0CBUQ27cFahcKEwiIrMe2-eLqAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAQ">Google podcasts</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/19pwsqTl75RSGrhhrsFIWW">Spotify</a>, and <a href="https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/find-your-side-hustle">Stitcher</a>. I didn’t overthink it, I registered with those 4 providers first and thought, “progress over perfection”, I can publish to more platforms later.</p><p>People also think they need a mass of equipment to record and edit a podcast.

December 8, 2020 | https://cgamesplay.com/post/2020/12/09/iterm-notifications/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://cgamesplay.com/post/2020/12/09/iterm-notifications/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For some reason, I've found that in my career a lot of the work I do ends up involving slow REPL loops: I make a change, run a command, wait for it to finish, and repeat. While I'm sitting there waiting, it's easy to be distracted by things, and I want my task to bring itself back to my attention when it's ready. This desire has led me on a multi-year quest to tailor my notifications perfectly, and in this post I'm going to share what I've come up with.</p>
<p>Here are the features I want my notifications to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>I should be able to activate them from anywhere in the terminal: in bash, from the ruby console, over SSH, or anywhere else I find myself (in the terminal).</li>
<li>They should be subtle so they don't get too annoying, but noticeable enough that I don't miss them.</li>
<li>The should only fire when I want them: too many notifications will cause me to ignore all of them.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The early days</h2>
<p>Back in 2015 or so, my company was writing scrapers to extract detailed, structured information from hundreds of websites. Each website was different and since we needed the information to be structured, we had to write a different scraper for each one. A single site could be scraped in about 5 minutes, and the data only changed a few times each year. Still, the sites would change often enough that I frequently found myself sitting in the office until late at night, mostly waiting for these scrapers to break so I could make one small fix, and repeat. Five minutes for each change really adds up when you have to repeat the entire scraper to test a single-line change.</p>
<p>Fortunately, writing scrapers is pretty easy technically, so I didn't need to be 100% focused as I was working on them. That meant that while I was waiting on the latest change I'd made to a scraper, I was able to focus on other high-value activities like shooting for a high score in Peggle Nights.</p>
<p><img src="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201201-1309-peggle-small.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Peggle Nights"></p>
<p>But sometimes, when I was planning a tough shot on a high-scoring round, I could forget that I was still at the office waiting for my scraper to crash so I could fix it. That's why I wanted a simple way to get notified when it was waiting for me. My first-ever attempt at building a notifications system used a feature built-in to Mac OS: the <code>say</code> command.</p>
<pre><code>long_running_command<span>;</span> say <span>"done"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This command uses the system's text-to-speech to play through your computer speakers. The scrapers I was writing were mostly in Ruby, so if I were in IRB I could still get the notification:</p>
<pre><code>my_scraper<span>.</span>run_main <span>rescue</span> ex <span>=</span> $<span>!</span><span>;</span> `say done`
</code></pre>
<p>This will play the notification even if the scraper fails, and preserve the raised exception in the <code>ex</code> variable. Neat!</p>
<p>I used this solution for a few months, but I always felt that the text-to-speech was a little unpleasant. I decided to switch out the <code>say</code> command for the built-in audio file player, <code>afplay</code>, and I used one of the default sounds that comes with Mac OS.</p>
<pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ding</span> <span>{</span>
  afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff
<span>}</span>
long_running_command<span>;</span> ding
</code></pre>
<p>That makes this sound, which is a little more subtle than a robotic voice shouting at me.</p>
<p><audio controls="" src="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201125-1600-iterm-sounds-glass.aiff"><a href="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201125-1600-iterm-sounds-glass.aiff">Click to download</a></audio></p>
<p>These two tricks got me along just fine for years. I felt like I had solved the problem and didn't need to think about it any more. Well, except when I started a command that I thought would be fast but it instead took an hour to run. But I developed a trick for that: if you press <code>^Z</code> (Ctrl-Z) to pause the job, then you can use <code>fg; ding</code> to resume it  and ding when it finishes. There. Now it's perfect.</p>
<h2>Improving on perfection</h2>
<p>One day I learned about <a href="https://iterm2.com/documentation-shell-integration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iTerm2 shell integration</a>. This provides a bunch of neat features, and one of them is about notifications! It's not very well documented, but if you use Edit ► Marks and Annotations ► Alerts ► Alert on Next Mark, or the much-easier-to-remember Option-Command-A, you'll get a native notification when the currently running command finishes. I installed the shell integration and to this day I use this feature more than anything else that it provides.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2020 and I've changed roles again. This time, I find myself automating cloud server provisioners, and waiting for the machines to come up isn't fast. Sadly, the iTerm shell integration has to be installed on each server, and my perfect notification scripts don't work over SSH. Realizing that perfection is a journey and not a destination, I set out to improve my notifications once again. Except this time, I was going to go industrial-strength.</p>
<p>When I was learning about the iTerm2 shell integration, I also found out about <a href="https://cgamesplay.com/post/2020/11/25/iterm-plugins/">a bunch of other features that iTerm2 supports</a>. If you want to follow along with me, read over that post and install <code>PlaySound.py</code>, <code>iterm_notify</code>, <code>iterm_badge</code>, and <code>iterm_bounce</code> on your computer. These new features had already made my notifications more powerful and SSH-compatible, but I had set my sights beyond a simple "ding!" sound. I wanted a smart notification system that would "ding" when the command completed, but "bonk" when it failed. But first I needed to find the right sounds to use.</p>
<p><img src="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201201-1344-oot-navi.jpg" alt="The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time"></p>
<p>The first sound that came to mind was the iconic "Hey! Listen!" from Ocarina of Time. If you played this game, then you probably know exactly how that sounds. I found a gallery of <a href="http://noproblo.dayjo.org/ZeldaSounds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sounds from the Zelda games</a> and searched for some appropriate ones. Eventually I settled on these two, for my "good" and "bad" sounds:</p>
<p><audio controls="" src="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201201-1347-ootpressstart.wav"><a href="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201201-1347-ootpressstart.wav">Click to download</a></audio></p>
<p><audio controls="" src="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201201-1349-mmtatlalarm.wav"><a href="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201201-1349-mmtatlalarm.wav">Click to download</a></audio></p>
<p>The first thing to do is wrap them up in scripts to make them easy to use. I put them in my sound library (which is listing in <a href="https://github.com/CGamesPlay/dotfiles/blob/bee7d071a7b85f7becc696edc0b328677eb16c40/macos/Library/Application%20Support/iTerm2/Scripts/AutoLaunch/PlaySound.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlaySound.py</a>) and wrote these:</p>
<pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ding</span> <span>{</span>
    iterm_sound OOT_PressStart
<span>}</span>

<span>function</span> <span>bonk</span> <span>{</span>
    iterm_sound MM_Tatl_Alarm.wav
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now I can run my provisioning script like this:</p>
<pre><code>./provision.sh <span>&amp;&amp;</span> ding <span>||</span> bonk
</code></pre>
<p>If the script succeeds, the <code>&amp;&amp; ding</code> will run, resulting in a pleasant chime. Otherwise the <code>|| bonk</code> sound will run and I'll hear a nervous fairy. But I can do better! This is too much to type, and I want to leverage all of my notification channels, not just sound. So I wrote this function:</p>
<pre><code><span>function</span> <span>sound_status</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>local</span> <span>last_status</span><span>=</span><span>$?</span>
    <span>test</span> <span>$last_status</span> -eq <span>0</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> ding <span>||</span> bonk
    iterm_bounce
    <span>if</span> <span>test</span> -z <span>"<span>$@</span>"</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
        iterm_notify <span>"Command finished with status <span>$last_status</span>"</span>
    <span>else</span>
        iterm_notify <span>"<span>$@</span> finished with status <span>$last_status</span>"</span>
    <span>fi</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>$last_status</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This function has 3 important qualities:</p>
<ol>
<li>It automatically chooses the sound to play.</li>
<li>It also shows a system notification, with an optional custom message.</li>
<li>It passes on the exit code, so you can run it in a pipeline.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, I can use it like this:</p>
<pre><code>./provision.sh<span>;</span> sound_status <span>"provision.sh"</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>ssh</span> myhost
</code></pre>
<p>Because it passes on the exit status, the <code>&amp;&amp; ssh</code> will only happen when the command succeeds, just like if the <code>; sound_status</code> hadn't been there at all.</p>
<h2>The little things in life</h2>
<p>This notification script feels great: simple, only when requested, and with just a bit of "fun" flavor. But there is another area where I think that a subtle audio cue would help streamline my workflow. Sometimes I need to type 3 or 4 quick commands back-to-back. Has this ever happened to you?</p>
<pre><code>$ <span>git</span> commit -m <span>"respond to feedback"</span>
no changes added to commit <span>(</span>use <span>"git add"</span> and/or <span>"git commit -a"</span><span>)</span>
$ <span>git</span> push
Everything up-to-date
</code></pre>
<p>I run these commands, see that it succeeded, shut my laptop, and head out to lunch. Later that day I wonder why nobody has reviewed my code, only to find that the second command had failed because I never staged those files, so I never pushed any changes at all. If I had been more careful, this wouldn't have happened. As a substitute for being more careful, I can have the computer tell me when my commands fail!</p>
<p>When I want is a subtle ping to tell me that something bad happened, every time a command fails. A lot of times this notification will be unnecessary. For example, if  <code>make</code> fails with a compile error, I don't really need a sound to tell me about that. So I wanted a "negative" sound that wasn't too distracting. I eventually settled on this one.</p>
<p><audio controls="" src="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201201-1409-alert-destroyed.wav"><a href="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201201-1409-alert-destroyed.wav">Click to download</a></audio></p>
<p>Can you recognize it? It's a sound you'll have heard pretty often if you've ever played Factorio: the notification that a building you own has been destroyed. In the game, you'll often hear this sound altering you of an attack while you're working on some other task. Generally, it indicates a problem, but not necessarily an urgent one. I thought it would be perfect. Since I'm a user of <a href="https://fishshell.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fish shell</a>, I rigged up the notification like this:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>if</span> <span>test</span> -z <span>$beep_command</span>
  <span>set</span> beep_command <span>"printf <span title="\a">\a</span>"</span>
end
<span>set</span> beep_primed <span>""</span>
<span>function</span> beep_preexec --on-event fish_preexec
  <span>set</span> -g beep_primed <span>1</span>
end
<span>function</span> beep_postexec --on-event fish_postexec
  <span>set</span> -l last_status <span>$status</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>test</span> <span>!</span> -z <span>$beep_primed</span> -a <span>!</span> -z <span>$argv</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> -a <span>$last_status</span> -ne <span>0</span>
    <span>eval</span> <span>$beep_command</span>
  end
  <span>set</span> -g beep_primed <span>""</span>
end
</code></pre>
<p>There's a few things worth mentioning here:</p>
<ul>
<li>To set the beep command, I used <code>set -U beep_command "iterm_sound Factorio/alert-destroyed.wav"</code>. This sets a "<a href="https://fishshell.com/docs/current/#variable-scope" target="_blank" rel="noopener">universal variable</a>" in fish, so it's permanent and system-wide. This lets me change the sound easily whenever I want.</li>
<li>The <code>fish_postexec</code> command runs even if you didn't run a command (pressed enter at an empty prompt), so we use the <code>-z $argv[1]</code> to filter that out.</li>
<li>The <code>beep_primed</code> variable is needed to ensure that the sound only happens once when the command fails. This is necessary to avoid some awkward situations that come up when you press Ctrl-C to cancel a command.</li>
</ul>
<p>So that's where I am today. I am very happy with how my notifications work and I'm glad I was able to add a unique bit of flavor to them by sampling from some nostalgic video games. Thanks for reading! If you want to set up something like this and are having problems, feel free to <a href="https://cgamesplay.com/contact">reach out to me</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<br><a href="https://cr.yp.to/writing.html">Notes on writing papers</a>

Here's a quote from the paper "Document Production: Visual or Logical?"
in Notices of the American Mathematical Society (June 1987), pages 621-624,
by LaTeX author Leslie Lamport:
<blockquote>
The purpose of writing is to convey ideas to the reader.
The worst aspect of visual systems
is that they subvert the process of communicating ideas
by encouraging the writer to concentrate on form rather than content.
Ideas are conveyed by the logical structure of the text;
the function of the visual format is to display this structure.
The author should be concerned with the structure,
not any particular visual representation.
</blockquote>
Here's another quote:
<blockquote>
Document design is a skill acquired through training and experience.
A logical system can apply the skill of a trained designer
to the formatting of a document.
</blockquote>
<p>
Let's see how well this worked for one of my papers,
a paper that was forced to switch visual formats.

But then I found out that the book containing my paper
would use the "msripub" format
designed by MSRI book editor Silvio Levy.
Here's what happens when the same document is formatted
with "msripub" rather than "amsart":

Wow, that's a really pleasant document to read!
I love the huge chunks of white space,
the visually stunning bibliography,
the completely non-functional citations to that bibliography,
the entertaining little black boxes everywhere,
and the line on page 24 sticking not merely into the margin but beyond the printed area of the page.
I'm glad that I concerned myself solely with the structure of my document,
and not with any particular visual representation.
</p><p>
This document must have been first seen by Levy,
who was not merely the skilled "msripub" designer
but also the editor of this particular book.
Surely he was inspired by the document's near-perfect beauty
and thought that a few additional tweaks
would produce a truly stunning work of art.
The scientific editors of the book waited for Levy to act.
But Levy did nothing.
Perhaps the explanation lies in Lamport's wise words:
</p><blockquote>
A logical system forces the writer
to think in terms of the document's logical structure;
it doesn't give him the illusion
that he is accomplishing anything with cosmetic formatting changes.
</blockquote>
<p>
In any event,
I wasn't able to see the "msripub" version of the document until April 2007.
Levy never sent me a copy.
You might think that I could simply change "amsart" to "msripub"
in my own copy of the document,
but "msripub" is a proprietary format:
Levy keeps it to himself.
Eventually the scientific editors convinced Levy to send "msripub" to me.
I fed my document through "msripub" and admired the output.
</p><p>
Beautiful!
</p><p>
I returned to Lamport's article
and discovered that he allowed certain minor exceptions to his "illusion":
</p><blockquote>
Achieving the highest possible quality
requires the ability to make changes to the system's output.
This will be a matter of fine tuning,
changing such things as page breaks and figure placement. ...
[However:]
The changes will generally be of such a minor nature
that they are not worth bothering with
in a preliminary version intended for a small audience,
nor for any document that is not widely distributed.
...
I usually spend less than two minutes per page
doing the final formatting to produce camera-ready output.
This is insignificant compared with the two to eight hours per page I spend writing.
</blockquote>
"Highest possible quality" sounds desirable,
and "two minutes" sounds tolerably small,
so I decided to edit the "msripub" version of my document.
<p>
You might like to pause at this point to contemplate the goals of scientific publication.
Isn't it wonderful to see science propelled forward
by something as small and simple as the switch from "amsart" to "msripub"?
</p><p>
Back to the story.
After many, many, many hours of work I had a new version of the document:

I had changed more than 100 separate lines of the main text,
not to mention the introductory figures, the bibliography, etc.
Many of those lines were quite difficult to adjust:
eliminating one bad line break
often meant experimenting with several different wordings and inspecting the output of each.
"Two minutes" is, I regret to report, a rather severe underestimate.
Could it be that Levy had a different reason for doing nothing at all with this paper?
</p><p>
I spent a few more hours carefully checking the paper
against the old "amsart" version
to see whether any bugs had been introduced by this flood of changes.
I ended up fixing two obsolete cross-references and two typos.
And so, finally, the conversion from "amsart" to "msripub" came to an end.

<p>In 2017, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Attention Is All You Need</a> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in neural machine translation by stacking only (self-)attention layers. Compared to recurrent neural networks, Transformer models exhibit efficient parallel processing of tokens, leading to better modeling of long-range correlations and, most importantly, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favorable scaling in terms of data and compute</a>. Since then, Transformers seem to have taken over natural language processing. Widespread adoption of attention-based architectures seems likely given recent work like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale</a> and the flurry of developments addressing the architecture’s quadratic scaling bottlenecks.</p>
<p>Recently, the papers <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02217" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hopfield Networks is All You Need</a> <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06996" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Large Associative Memory Problem in Neurobiology and Machine Learning</a> <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> provided complementary post-facto explanations of some of the success of Transformers from the perspective of energy-based models. In this post, I provide a biased overview of (self-)attention in Transformers and summarize its connections to modern Hopfield networks. Along the way, I look for intuition from physics and indulge in hand-wavy arguments on how an energy-based perspective can shed light on training and improving Transformer models.</p>

<p>Let’s start off with an overview of the components in a vanilla Transformer model. Since our focus is on (self-)attention, I am going to assume some prior knowledge<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> and skip comprehensive architecture descriptions and experimental results. In <a href="#3-from-hopfield-networks-to-transformers">Section 3</a>, we will start from scratch and use Hopfield networks to build back up to the attention module described below.</p>
<h2 id="vanilla-transformers">Vanilla Transformers</h2>
<p>The proto-Transformer was introduced in an encoder-decoder context for machine translation in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Attention Is All You Need</a>. The original motivation seems to have been mostly driven by engineering efforts to model long-range correlations in sequence data and the recent successes of attention mechanisms stacked on top of recurrent neural networks. The main contribution and selling point of the paper was making an attention-only approach to sequence modeling work.</p>
<p><img src="https://mcbal.github.io/post/an-energy-based-perspective-on-attention-mechanisms-in-transformers/vanilla_transformer.png" alt="alt text" title="Vanilla Transformers encoder-decoder architecture"></p>
<p>Let’s focus on the encoder on the left and ignore the decoder on the right. Transformer models accept (batches of) sets of vectors, which covers most inputs people care about in machine learning. Text can be modelled as a sequence of embedded tokens. Images can be viewed as a snaky sequence of embedded pixels or embedded patches of pixels. Since sets have no notion of ordering, learned or fixed positional information needs to be explicitly added to the input vectors.</p>
<p>The main module in the Transformer encoder block is the multi-head <em>self-attention</em>, which is based on a (scaled) dot-product attention mechanism acting on a set of $d$-dimensional vectors:</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Attention}\left( \mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{K}, \mathbf{V} \right) = \mathrm{softmax} \left( \frac{\mathbf{Q} \mathbf{K}^T}{\sqrt{d}} \right) \mathbf{V}
\label{eq:vanilla-attention}
\end{equation}</p>
<p>Here, queries $\mathbf{Q}$, keys $\mathbf{K}$, and values $\mathbf{V}$ are matrices obtained from acting with different linear transformations — parametrized respectively by weights $\mathbf{W}_{\mathbf{Q}}$, $\mathbf{W}_{\mathbf{K}}$, and $\mathbf{W}_{\mathbf{V}}$ — on the same set of $d$-dimensional inputs. <em>Cross-attention</em> takes the inputs for its queries from a different source than for its keys and values, as can be glimpsed from the decoder part of the architecture on the right.</p>
<p>For every input query, the updated output query of \eqref{eq:vanilla-attention} is a linear combination of values weighted by an attention matrix quantifying the overlap of the input query with the keys corresponding to these values. Since all objects are vectors and the attention mechanism is just a dot product between vectors, we can think of the attention module as matching query vectors to their “closest” key vectors in latent space and summing up contributions from value vectors, weighted by the “closeness” of their keys to the queries.</p>
<p>The remaining components of the Transformer encoder block are needed to make the module work properly in practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>multi-headedness</em> of the attention module refers to chunking up the dimension of the vector space and having multiple attention operations running in parallel in the same module, yet with each acting on a lower-dimensional segment of the full space. This is a trick to (1) get around the fact that every input vector only couples to one query at a time to calculate its attention coefficient, and (2) provide multiple starting points in the subspaces for the queries, which might help to avoid bad local minima in parameter space during optimization.</li>
<li>A positional feed-forward network, made up of two linear layers with a non-linearity in between, is inserted at the end of the module. Folklore wisdom tells us that the feed-forward layer needs to blow up the dimension of the latent space by a factor of four for it to be able to “disentangle” the represention. More likely though, it’s a way to increase model capacity and warp latent spaces since the attention modules on their own are pretty much linear apart from the $\mathrm{softmax}$-operator used to obtain the normalized attention coefficients.</li>
<li>Residual connections are added to control the flow of gradients.</li>
<li>Layer normalisation is used to control learning dynamics and keep vector norms from exploding.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="beyond-vanilla-confronting-quadratic-scaling">Beyond vanilla: confronting quadratic scaling</h2>
<p>Most architectural variations of the vanilla Transformer are targeted at the attention module, which scales poorly with respect to the input sequence length $N$. Since the overlap of all queries with all keys is required, calculating a dense attention matrix scales like $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ in time and space. Limits on the context window of the attention mechanism during training prevent the model from learning how to deal with long sequences and long-range correlations. The majority of post-vanilla Transformer species can be classified into one of the following buckets<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low-rank approximations: truncate the matrix product $\mathbf{Q} \mathbf{K}^T$ since it’s likely not full rank for structured data</li>
<li>Sparsification: reduce the attention calculation from all query-key pairs to a subset because not all of them feel the need to talk to each other</li>
<li>Recurrence: keep track of a (compressed) history of context</li>
<li>Kernels: approximate the attention operation with kernel methods</li>
</ul>
<p>For the remainder of our discussion, we will focus on vanilla Transformers. One of the goals of this blog post is to explore how a different perspective on the <em>function</em> of attention-based algorithms might lead to qualitatively different improvements beyond what is possible by relying on scaling and reducing computational complexity alone.</p>

<p>In this section, we provide a short history of Hopfield networks and gradually build up intuition until we can recognize the Transformer self-attention mechanism for what it really is. We refer to the <a href="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> accompanying <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02217" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hopfield Networks is All You Need</a> for more details and insightful visualizations of pattern storage and retrieval.</p>
<h2 id="classical-discrete-hopfield-networks">Classical discrete Hopfield networks</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopfield_network" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hopfield network</a> is a simple model for associative memory popularized by John Hopfield in his 1982 paper <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/79/8/2554.full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neural Networks and Physical Systems with Emergent Collective Computational Abilities</a><sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. The task of an associative memory is to store and retrieve patterns, preferably in a way that allows one to recover stored patterns quickly with a low error rate.</p>
<p>The basic idea of the Hopfield network — and other energy-based models like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boltzmann machines</a> — is to construct an <em>energy function</em> which defines an <em>energy landscape</em> containing basins of attraction around patterns we want to store. Starting at any pattern, we want to have an update rule pointing towards the closest stored pattern, guided by a scalar “closeness” score provided by the energy function.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopfield_network" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://mcbal.github.io/post/an-energy-based-perspective-on-attention-mechanisms-in-transformers/energy_landscape.png" alt="alt text" title="Toy energy landscape of a Hopfield Network"></a></p>
<p>Let’s make this a bit more formal but not too formal. Consider trying to store a set of $N$ binary patterns $\{\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\}_{i=1}^{N}$ where each pattern $\boldsymbol{x}_{i}$ is a $d$-dimensional vector whose entries are either $-1$ or $1$. For example, in the case of storing black-and-white images, every image would correspond to a string of pixel values, a binary pattern $\boldsymbol{x}_{i}$.</p>
<p>For any query $\boldsymbol{\xi} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$, or <em>state pattern</em>, we want to find a way to retrieve the closest <em>stored pattern</em>. In his paper, Hopfield considered the energy function</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
E = - \frac{1}{2} \boldsymbol{\xi}^{T} \boldsymbol{W} \boldsymbol{\xi} + \boldsymbol{\xi}^{T} \boldsymbol{b} = - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{d} \sum_{j=1}^{d} w_{ij} \xi_{i} \xi_{j} + \sum_{i=1}^{d} b_{i} \xi_{i} ,
\label{eq:ising}
\end{equation}</p>
<p>where $\boldsymbol{b} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ denotes a bias vector and the weights $\boldsymbol{W} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ are set to the sum of the outer products of the patterns we want to store</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{W} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \boldsymbol{x}_{i} \otimes …</p></div></div>

<blockquote>
<p>“Most of all, there is this truth: No matter how great your teachers may be, and no matter how esteemed your academy’s reputation, eventually you will have to do the work by yourself. Eventually, the teachers won’t be there anymore. The walls of the school will fall away, and you’ll be on your own.” - <a href="https://amzn.to/2TtGVsm">Elizabeth Gilbert, Big Magic</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am very intentional about cultivating peers and mentors who I trust. When I <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/cto-writer">left my job to start a business</a> earlier this year, one of the first things I did was create a list of informal advisors - mostly experienced entrepreneurs who I could count on for candid feedback.</p>
<p>Still, when I meet with one of my mentors to ask them a specific question, I start the conversation with a warning:</p>
<p>“I have a question, but just so you know, you’re not the only person I’m asking. If I don’t take your advice, I don’t want you to take it personally, okay?”</p>
<p>Every one of them appreciates this caveat because <strong>giving advice is really hard.</strong> In fact, I am starting to realize that you should be wary of people who are too quick to offer it.</p>
<p>The further I go in my career, the more skeptical I am of “experts.” While people with experience may generally make better decisions, I don’t know if their advice transfers the way they think it does.</p>
<p>Now, I realize the irony in offering advice to ignore advice, but my goal is to make you reconsider all advice - including the advice I give.</p>
<p>Above all, I hope this makes you think before you blindly follow others.</p>
<h2 id="1-experts-overgeneralize-their-experience">1. Experts Overgeneralize Their Experience</h2>
<p>Many legitimately successful people got lucky once.</p>
<p>You see this a lot in Silicon Valley-style businesses where a single expert or lucky investment might lead to generational wealth. These successful and wealthy people feel that they’ve discovered the “secret” to building a business based on a single runaway success.</p>
<p>This bias is called <a href="http://iameduard.com/overgeneralization/">overgeneralization</a>, and both advice givers and receivers fall into it.</p>
<p>For example, if you’ve read <a href="https://amzn.to/3oy8DSY">Walter Isaacson’s biography</a>, you know that Steve Jobs was a ruthless boss and obsessive about details. Jobs was amazingly successful as an entrepreneur and executive; therefore, you should be ruthless and obsessive if you want to be a successful entrepreneur and executive.</p>
<p>The logical fallacy here is obvious - we can point to dozens of counterpoints - but it illustrates the danger in overgeneralizing an expert’s advice or behavior.</p>
<p>Part of the reason we fall prey to experts who overgeneralize their experience is that as humans, <a href="https://manuel.friger.io/blog/advice">we really like stories</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We love anecdotes so much because it’s often much easier for people to believe someone’s testimony as opposed to <strong>understanding complex data and variation across a continuum</strong>. Anecdotes exempt us from having to prove our point: it’s happened once; that’s solid proof as far as I’m concerned.” - <a href="https://manuel.friger.io/blog/advice">Manuel Frigerio</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Manuel cites Jeanne Calment, who lived to 116 years old and smoked every day of her adult life. Jeanne Calment is one data point. <strong>What worked for one person one time many years ago will not work for everyone for all time.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_11C9E1C44BCB40F0FE12CD8C443C12B2DA5D48417F2028A6D847E5BE71580EB1_1603765436506_ovg.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Additionally, many experts <a href="https://twitter.com/KarlLHughes/status/1284104244891721730">rewrite their stories in their minds</a>.</p>
<p>Take Brian Williams, once an upstanding NBC news anchor and respected journalist. He told a complete fabrication of his experience in Iraq multiple times, including in an especially vivid recounting at a hockey game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The story actually started with a terrible moment a dozen years back during the invasion of Iraq when the helicopter we were traveling in was forced down after being hit by an RPG.” - <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/2/5/7987439/brian-williams-iraq-apology-helicopter">Brian Williams</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t know if Williams knew he was lying or not, but if you want to believe his apology, he mistakenly inserted himself into a true story that he had seen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I think the constant viewing of the video showing us inspecting the impact area — and the fog of memory over 12 years — made me conflate the two.” - Brian Williams (later apologizing)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whatever the details of Williams’ story, it’s easy to imagine that most professionals with 10+ years of experience will misremember or rewrite parts of their own experience when asked. This problem gets compounded when beginners ask for advice from experts because they can’t discern the misremembering from the truth.</p>
<p>Beginners don’t have enough experience to call bullsh** on experts.</p>
<h2 id="2-inherent-survivorship-bias">2. Inherent Survivorship Bias</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>The Misconception:</strong> You should focus on the successful if you wish to become successful.</p>
<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> When failure becomes invisible, the difference between failure and success may also become invisible.” - <a href="https://youarenotsosmart.com/2013/05/23/survivorship-bias/">David McRaney</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Survivors become experts</strong>, regardless of their skills, knowledge, or the repeatability of their experience.</p>
<p>Survivorship bias is one of the most dangerous ones in finance, and it’s one of the easiest traps to fall into when you look for advice. By taking only the positive cases (i.e.: people who succeeded in your field), you are unable to tell which factors were vital to their success and which factors were unrelated to it.</p>
<p>You hear the same thing from people who claim, “they sure don’t make ‘em like they used to.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A commonly held opinion in many populations is that machinery, equipment, and goods manufactured in previous generations often is better built and lasts longer…because of the selective pressures of time and use, it is inevitable that only those items that were built to last will have survived into the present day.</p>
<p>Therefore, most of the old machinery still seen functioning well in the present day must necessarily have been built to a standard of quality necessary to survive. All of the machinery, equipment, and goods that have failed over the intervening years are no longer visible to the general population as they have been junked, scrapped, recycled, or otherwise disposed of.” - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias">Wikipedia, Survivorship Bias</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_11C9E1C44BCB40F0FE12CD8C443C12B2DA5D48417F2028A6D847E5BE71580EB1_1603765755896_survivor.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>When survivors give advice, they conflate correlation and causation. Was the fact that <a href="https://tim.blog/about/">Tim Ferriss</a> executed his book launch a certain way the reason it succeeded? Or was the fact that Tim Ferriss had a massive audience of followers before his latest book launch the real reason?</p>
<p>We can’t know <a href="https://pjrvs.com/survivorship">because Tim Ferriss is a survivor</a>. He is one of the few authors who has “made it” to the level he has. By virtue of surviving this far, we have to take all of his marketing advice with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>The danger of survivorship bias is that it’s tough to combat. People <a href="https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/want-to-really-help-others-talk-about-your-failures-not-successes.html">don’t like to talk about their failures</a>, and failures are subject to the same overgeneralization biases that successes are. In other words, <strong>even if someone tells you why they think they failed, they’re probably wrong.</strong></p>
<h2 id="3-the-expert-beginner-experience-gulf">3. The Expert-Beginner Experience Gulf</h2>
<p>Knowledge isn’t discrete - it’s a continuum.</p>
<p>Experts tend to forget that they have a considerable base of knowledge that beginners lack. This experience gap means that realizations the expert recently had will be useless (or even harmful) to beginners who lack the same foundational understanding.</p>
<p>For example, a friend of mine recently graduated from a coding bootcamp and asked me what podcasts I listen to.</p>
<p>I thought about it for a while. Are the software architecture and management podcasts I listen to going to help this guy? There weren’t many programming podcasts around when I learned to code, so I can’t tell him which ones helped me when I was just starting out. Should I selfishly send him the podcast that recently invited me on as a guest?</p>
<p>I struggle with advising new programmers because the gulf between my current level of experience and theirs is too broad. I don’t remember what I didn’t know when I was just starting out; plus, the world has changed. The books I read back then are hopelessly out of date, and the books I read now are hopelessly indecipherable to most new programmers.</p>
<p>This chart illustrates the problem. When you’re just starting to learn about a topic, you start in the bottom-left, and over time you move to the top right:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zxD9C4I.png" alt="Knowledge contimuum"></p>
<p>Beginners need to grasp relationships and patterns, while experts are interested in uncovering principles. The advice experts give often comes from their higher-level understanding.</p>
<p>What’s more insidious about the expert-beginner gulf is that people’s brains actually <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/03/financebrain/"><em>shut down</em> when given advice from an expert</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When thinking for themselves, students showed activity in their anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex — brain regions associated with making decisions and calculating probabilities. When given advice from Noussair, activity in those regions flat lined. - <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/03/financebrain/">Brandon Keim, Wired</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if the advice makes sense given the expert’s current level of understanding, the beginner may not grasp the underlying patterns required to make good use of the advice.</p>
<p>For example, we typically tell new drivers to stop at red lights. This is good generalized advice, but a beginner may not realize that there exceptions to this rule. What if the light is flashing red? What if it’s red, but no traffic is coming, and you want to turn right? What if you have a medical emergency?</p>
<p>Experienced drivers can make judgment calls based on advice and experience, but beginners cannot. They haven’t developed the filters to process and individualize advice.</p>
<h2 id="4-they-might-be-charlatans">4. They Might Be Charlatans</h2>
<p>It’s hard to believe I’ve gotten this far without mentioning experts who are blatantly slanting their advice towards profit, but I’ll get to it now.</p>
<p>First, what is a <em>charlatan?</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A person who pretends or claims to have more knowledge or skill than he or she possesses; quack.” - <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/charlatan">Dictionary.com</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right now, most online courses are sold by charlatans. I’m not saying you can’t learn anything from them, but most people selling them don’t have much more knowledge than you do; they just offer their advice more confidently.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We now live in a time where information is becoming less and less commoditized and learning is becoming freer by passing days. So, it’s surprising that institutes and “experts” still exist and charge big money for courses.” - <a href="https://thatnameasif.medium.com/digital-marketing-courses-scam-be96464c12e2">Asif Ali</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ironically, most charlatans don’t even know …</p></div></article></section></div>

</p><p><b>The Webless Initiative</b> is a campaign to make the modern Web a more
livable place. We aim to accomplish this by:
</p><ul>
	<li>Discouraging useless "style" or "interactive" features
	</li><li>Encouraging fast, portable, readable pages, with simpler HTML
</li></ul>
<p>This should:
</p><ul>
	<li>Make web browsers potentially a lot smaller, faster and comfortable<br>
	(realistically, make it possible to use existing small web browsers)
	</li><li>Drastically lessen the necessary bandwidth, making more room for real content
</li></ul>
<p>We plan to provide a set of rules and recommendations for anyone who wishes
to make their web page conformant. There will be an automatic validator for this
ruleset.
</p><p>We plan to create and maintain <b>two lists of websites</b>, with an appropriate
label or banner site owners can publish to indicate their membership:
</p><ul>
<li><b><a href="http://repo.hu/projects/webless/friends.html">Friends of Webless</a></b>
<p>
Simply by expressing their wish, anyone can be part of this list. The only
condition is that their site is <b>comfortably usable with a small web browser</b>.
</p><p>This might be manually checked, and Webless might refuse to keep the site listed,
if we perceive that it does not meet <a href="http://repo.hu/projects/webless/rules-friends.html">this rule</a>.

Membership on this list is per request. The site will be checked
(and may be periodically rechecked) against the <a href="http://repo.hu/projects/webless/rules-validated.html">Webless Rules.</a>
Only sites passing these tests will be listed.
</p></li></ul>
<p>
We ask that listed (friends and validated) sites place a link on this page.
This is not mandatory; and the link might serve as a disclaimer for when
visitors are asking why your page is lacking all the modern whizbang.

      <h2>Statistics about the survey</h2>
      
      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <p>There is a lot of data to look at in many different ways. For now, I performed a simple question-by-question analysis using a <a href="https://github.com/abrochard/emacs-survey/blob/main/2020/Emacs%20User%20Survey%202020.ipynb">Jupyter Notebook</a>.</p>
      <p>Also, since free text was available for most questions, it can be hard to categorize some of the results. For multiple choice questions, I did a best effort attempt to bundle responses with low cardinality into an "other" section, which can get quite big in some cases! I also did not attempt to graph anything for pure free text questions. I encourage anyone who is curious to inspect the full responses, either in the notebook or looking at the data directly. The omitted free text questions are:
        </p><ul>
          <li>If you use org-mode, for what purpose?</li>
          <li>Do you use a language server with lsp-mode or eglot? With what languages?</li>
          <li>Do you use an Emacs debugger interface? What do you use? (Gdb, dap-mode etc)</li>
          <li>What are some of the Emacs improvements you are the most interested in?</li>
          <li>What do you think are Emacs' greatest strengths?</li>
          <li>Can you recall any difficulties you faced initially learning Emacs?</li>
          <li>What is the one thing you would like Emacs to do differently?</li>
          <li>If there is another survey in 2021, would you be opposed to it containing optional &amp; general demographics questions?</li>
          <li>Do you have a preferred platform for filling out the survey in the future?</li>
          <li>Do you have general feedback about the survey process?</li>
        </ul>

It's supposed to give them a good quality, high-speed internet connection, but it's not cheap and some say the low-orbit Starlink satellites are ruining their view of the night sky.<!-- --> <!-- -->2:06</span></span></span></p><p><span><p>When Vernon Kejick got a first taste of Starlink satellite internet on the Pikangikum First Nation, his initial review was succinct.</p>  <p>"All I can say is it's a lot faster than what I had before," he said. Kejick's response highlights a long-running disparity that may finally have met a resolution.</p>  <p>Starlink, the new high-speed internet service provided by Elon Musk's U.S.-based SpaceX firm, and recently <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/elon-musk-tesla-starlink-low-earth-orbit-high-speed-rural-internet-rockets-satellite-1.5768338"><u>approved</u></a> by the CRTC, does have drawbacks. It's expensive. And stargazers fear it will ruin the night sky.</p>  <p>But for users in rural and remote areas who've long struggled to obtain internet access on equal footing with Canadians in urban areas, Starlink is offering hope. The service was recently made available to select users for "beta testing," with the promise of wider availability in 2021.&nbsp;</p>  <p>In Pikangikum, a fly-in community of 2,800 residents in northwest Ontario, Kejick said he'd become accustomed to download speeds of only 2 megabits per second —&nbsp;a fraction of the 50 megabits per the second the federal government considers a standard minimum for broadband.</p>    <p>At work, Kejick couldn't open large email attachments. He described the service as "deplorable."</p>  <p>At the end of November, Pikangikum became the first Indigenous community to get connected to Starlink, with 60 dishes reserved for homes and businesses in the community in the initial phase of installation, and potentially another 40 by the end of December.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5831800.1607376960!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/tesla-musk-germany.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5831800.1607376960!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/tesla-musk-germany.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5831800.1607376960!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/tesla-musk-germany.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5831800.1607376960!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/tesla-musk-germany.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5831800.1607376960!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/tesla-musk-germany.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5831800.1607376960!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/tesla-musk-germany.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>Elon Musk's SpaceX firm has promised Starlink internet will provide 'near global coverage of the populated world' in 2021.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Hannibal Hanschke/Pool via REUTERS)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Now, Kejick said his devices have been reaching 144 megabits per second. Not only can he quickly download attachments, Kejick said his wife has finally been able to chat with relatives in the Philippines over FaceTime.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"It's as if you're sitting in the same room," he said.</p>  <p>In Pikangikum, however, Starlink could offer more fundamental changes. Kejick, a victim services advocate with the Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General, said he hopes victims of crime will&nbsp;now be able to testify virtually, lessening the burden on them.</p>  <p>Members of the remote Ojibwe community hope the faster internet will remove barriers to access virtual healthcare services and education, too.</p>    <p>"It's doing everything that people are asking it to do," said David Brown, CEO of FSET Information Technology in Kenora, Ont. His firm had been working with Pikangikum for several years to try to improve their connectivity.&nbsp;</p>  <p>When he heard about Starlink, Brown jokingly promised his staff he would directly contact SpaceX's Musk —&nbsp;who recently surpassed Microsoft founder Bill Gates as one of the world's richest people, second only to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768390.1603139721!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/spacex-starlink.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768390.1603139721!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/spacex-starlink.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768390.1603139721!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/spacex-starlink.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768390.1603139721!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/spacex-starlink.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768390.1603139721!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/spacex-starlink.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768390.1603139721!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/spacex-starlink.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>A SpaceX craft launches a cluster of 60 Starlink satellites.

FSET recently helped install the first batch. And the result, Brown said, was better than he expected.</p>  <p>Starlink is "a wonderful thing," he said. "It's going to change the world for people."</p>  <h2>Rural, remote areas lack broadband</h2>  <p>Across Canada, only 40.8 per cent of rural communities have access to adequate broadband, according to federal <a href="https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/internet/internet.htm"><u>data</u></a>.</p>  <p>Greg Rekounas, a database administrator who has long worked from home, said he contacted various service providers and could never find suitable broadband for his house on New Brunswick's Kingston Peninsula, near Saint John.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5818012.1606424644!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/greg-rekounas.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5818012.1606424644!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/greg-rekounas.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5818012.1606424644!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/greg-rekounas.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5818012.1606424644!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/greg-rekounas.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5818012.1606424644!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/greg-rekounas.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5818012.1606424644!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/greg-rekounas.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Greg Rekounas tests download and upload speeds via his newly installed link to Starlink low earth orbit satellites. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Greg Rekounas, submitted)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>The quality of his home connection suffered under the strain of increased streaming and surfing during the pandemic. So when he heard about Starlink, he signed up in November to become one of the company's Canadian beta testers. Rekounas received an email saying he'd been selected, and received the installation kit within days.</p>  <p>"I've been waiting for something like this for a long time," he said. There have been some hiccups with certain streaming apps, but Rekounas said "in general, it's been fantastic."</p>  <p>SpaceX said&nbsp;there are bound to be interruptions while its service is in beta testing, which it describes as "Better Than Nothing Beta."</p>  <p>Not everyone who registers to become a tester is selected to take part. SpaceX did not respond to emailed questions about the number of Canadians testing its service, or when exactly the firm expects to make Starlink available to the general public.</p>  <p>The cost alone is bound to turn off some consumers. Delores Waye of Taymouth, N.B., north of Fredericton, recently received an invitation from Starlink after her son had made the request. She was interested in signing up, until Waye saw the price at the bottom of the email.</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH |&nbsp;Starlink satellites spotted over New Brunswick:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="Starlink satellites spotted over New Brunswick" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1828820035953-metadata-" title="Starlink satellites spotted over New Brunswick"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/227/715/1-STARLINK-OVER-FREDERICTON.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>Michael Stemm captured low orbit SpaceX Starlink satellites over Fredericton on the evening of June 4, 2020.<!-- --> <!-- -->0:51</span></span></span></p>  <p>Buying the dish and other gear needed for the Starlink service costs $649, plus tax. Rekounas said he paid $820 in total. Users are expected to install the kit themselves. Then, it's $129 per month for the service.</p>  <p>"I was floored," Waye&nbsp;said. "When you're doing beta testing, you would expect the company to at least provide you with the equipment. It just seems crazy."</p>  <h2>Trouble above</h2>  <p>There's also another kind of cost to consider: the lasting impact of thousands of low Earth orbit satellites sent into the sky. Starlink satellites orbit the Earth at an altitude of 550 kilometres. That's thousands of kilometres lower than conventional satellites — reducing&nbsp;the distance the signal must travel.&nbsp;</p>  <p>SpaceX has been launching up to 60 satellites at a time, with hundreds already in orbit.

            <p>In <a href="https://www.saastr.com/whats-your-moat/">What's Your Moat</a>, Jason Lemkin lists several moats (sources of defensibility) that apply to SaaS businesses. I categorised them based on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/7-Powers-Foundations-Business-Strategy-ebook/dp/B01MRLFFQ7">7 Powers</a> framework by Hamilton Helmer and found two powers missing (Cornered Resource and Process Power).</p><p>While Cornered Resources (such as a strong early team) are commonly considered doctrine rather than a moat, the omission of process power was more interesting.</p><h3 id="what-is-process-power">What is Process Power?</h3><p>Helmer describes companies with Process Power as follows:</p><blockquote>Benefit. A company with Process Power is able to improve product attributes and/or lower costs as a result of process improvements embedded within the organization. For example, Toyota has maintained the quality increases and cost reductions of the TPS over a span of decades; these assets do not disappear as new workers are brought in and older workers retire.<p>Barrier. The Barrier in Process Power is hysteresis: these process advances are difficult to replicate, and can only be achieved over a long time period of sustained evolutionary advance.</p></blockquote><p>He admits that process power is rare and difficult to achieve. But is it too rare to apply to SaaS companies?</p><p>On one hand, the path to growing a SaaS business is <a href="https://stripe.com/gb/atlas/guides/business-of-saas">well benchmarked</a> and there are processes describing anything from finding leads to deploying reliable infrastructure.</p><p>But there are companies that get very different results.</p><h3 id="the-process-outliers">The process outliers</h3><p><a href="https://ahrefs.com/">Ahrefs</a> is a popular SEO tool with a fifth of the engineering resources of their biggest competitor Moz. They <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/keywords-explorer-3-0/">claim to achieve this by using an OCaml based stack</a> also favoured by Wall Street traders <a href="https://www.janestreet.com/">Jane Street</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.tinycapital.com/">Tiny</a> is a start-up conglomerate that uses several ideas like simple positioning and No Code to quickly spin up new businesses in record speed. They also run one of the leading design and development studios <a href="https://www.metalab.com/">Metalab</a>, and one of the earliest No Code agencies <a href="https://www.8020.inc/">8020</a>, ensuring excellence in both areas.</p><p>Does this mean that every SaaS company should use OCaml and Webflow or is there a way to create process advantages organically?</p><p>In an industry that speeds things up traditionally with investment, we have ignored frameworks that build process advantages in a capital-agnostic way.</p><h3 id="improving-process">Improving process</h3><p>I'll offer three examples.</p><p>The first is the Theory of Constraints, a framework introduced in <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement/dp/0566086654">The Goal</a>. The Theory of Constraints predicts that every company is usually constrained by one bottleneck at a time, called a “constraint” and releasing that constraint is the key for increasing output.</p><p>Another theory, promoted by Douglas Engelbart is the <a href="https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/192/165/">ABCs of Organizational Improvement</a>. Engelbart argues that we should manage not only core activities (also known as “A activities” or “Business as usual”) but have explicit roadmaps for both B activities (“improving how we do A”) and C activities (“improving how we improve”). By focusing on process improvement explicitly, we can create compounding leverage for core activities.</p><p>A more modern example of continuous process improvement is described in the <a href="https://medium.com/quantumblack/the-protocol-series-how-formula-1-pitstop-teams-inspired-the-codification-of-our-ways-of-working-7b59b40a8fa1">Protocol Series</a> by QuantumBlack.</p><p>To summarise, having a great process is not the same as having great execution and we should not neglect that, even in SaaS.</p><hr><p><strong>P.S.</strong> Here is the categorization of the SaaS moats I went with. The high-level categories are from 7 Powers, the bullets are from Lemkin.</p><p>Counter-positioning</p><ul><li>“No Contract at all” easy on-boarding</li></ul><p>Network effects</p><ul><li>Data</li><li>Structured Data</li><li>Partners + Ecosystem</li><li>Agencies and Implementation Partners</li></ul><p>Switching costs</p><ul><li>Integrations</li><li>“Most Enterprise” Vendor</li><li>Long Term Contracts</li></ul><p>Economies of scale</p><ul><li>Using massive amounts of capital to play in every segment</li></ul><p>Brand</p><ul><li>Brand</li></ul><p>Cornered resource</p><ul><li>???</li></ul><p>Process power</p><ul><li>???</li></ul>
