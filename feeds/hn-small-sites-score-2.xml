<p>This is just a story of my day. It was an incredibly boring day. Why do I write about it? I analyzed why it was so dull and uncovered a great insight. What is the most critical factor in software engineering productivity? I think it is the time it takes to deploy your app.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Beautiful start of the day</h2>

<p>I woke up at around 10 am. Not too bad, given that I’ve stayed late the night before – I have been trying to solve an engineering problem at work. The problem was adding a new feature to the gigantic project with a not so scalable architecture. The project was born out of the hackathon, so it’s nobody’s fault… Anyway, the engineering problem. It wasn’t even that hard because as soon as I woke up, I had it all figured out in my head. I just needed my morning coffee first.</p>



<p>I started coding right after my first sip. Something really happened in my head during sleep, because it felt so easy to write code. The solution was pretty obvious, and it did not introduce any unneeded complexity to an already chaotic code base. It looked good, so I ran the code locally. Oh, yes, I forgot to import the module here. Oops, this variable is NULL now, let’s fix that. Okay, it seems to work now. So I committed changes to my branch and created a PR. It’s 11 am on the clock. Pretty sweet as a start of the day, ha? Now what? Even if I solved the problem, it’s not going to do much good without getting into production. Now it’s time to get my code to the finish line.</p>



<p>My open PR had automatically triggered tests. We have all kinds of tests: unit, integration, code style, you name it. I knew I had some time because this process is not usually fast. However, I didn’t have enough time to shift my focus to another task or fully relax. So I kept on checking my messengers, social apps, and news feed. Then a message arrived in Slack. “Lint-check failed.” Oh, I hate those! I thought I had everything right! Okay, it looks like I forgot to remove this import, and it’s not used anymore. I removed one line from the code and committed my changes. 5 minutes wait, again. What’s going on on Twitter?</p>



<h2>We all hate waiting</h2>



<figure><img src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-40a3cf24fa0ff15d8ce804678017d6d3.jpg" alt="The picture of a man looking at his phone waiting for the code deploy to finish." srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-40a3cf24fa0ff15d8ce804678017d6d3.jpg 900w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-40a3cf24fa0ff15d8ce804678017d6d3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-40a3cf24fa0ff15d8ce804678017d6d3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-40a3cf24fa0ff15d8ce804678017d6d3-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></figure>



<p>I did not notice how 15 minutes passed. Then I got another slack message – integration tests failed. At least my code style is right. So, I spent another 5 minutes fixing the issue (integration test actually did an excellent job catching a tricky bug, so I’m not mad at it). Then I committed my changes and played the waiting game again.</p>



<p>I understand the importance of tests, but 20 minutes, come on! Of course, I could’ve made some progress on another task, meanwhile. No, not really. I don’t know about you, but I hate switching focus. It takes so much time to get into a really focused state. So I’ve checked all my apps on the phone a couple times and found the bottom of the twitter feed before I saw a Slack notification about the successful deployment of my code. </p>



<p>Just to be safe, I need to test the app on production to see if the new feature works. From first glance, it did, but there was a small glitch. I had to update the code in the UI of a web application, nothing fancy, just changing a string. This turned out to be a header on the page, and I added redundant whitespace at the beginning, so now it looks weird. Okay, here we go again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now all tests passed, but the deployment took forever. I’m not sure what kind of computation is involved in moving a folder with files around 10 megabytes from my laptop to the server, but it sure feels like it could’ve trained a conscious AI by now. I don’t remember how much time it took for me to refresh the page and finally see the whitespace disappear, but it definitely took another cup of coffee. I managed to check my emails during this time, so I was productive, I guess. Anyway, it’s 2 pm, and it’s time for lunch.</p>



<h2>How much time we waste</h2>



<figure><img src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-5dffa44220fae3cb575331fd82a7013a.jpg" alt="The picture of a clock to illustrate time we waste when the deploy is slow." srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-5dffa44220fae3cb575331fd82a7013a.jpg 900w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-5dffa44220fae3cb575331fd82a7013a-300x200.jpg 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-5dffa44220fae3cb575331fd82a7013a-768x512.jpg 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-5dffa44220fae3cb575331fd82a7013a-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></figure>



<p>As you may have noticed, I’m complaining. That day I really spent around 1 hour actually solving an engineering problem, including bug-fixing time. But it took me 4 hours until I saw my changes in production. There are many days like this, so time adds up. I feel righteous anger because this thing is common in the industry, and many people experience the same thing.</p>



<p>So, what’s the solution? Not writing tests? Of course, not, tests are freaking great. The issue is more generic – it’s all those inefficiencies that are easy to introduce to the deploy time (I bundle tests and all CI/CD stuff in the deploy time). It’s easy to write an inefficient CI/CD job. Its intent could be positive, and at the time, it may seem like a great idea. But a little delay is multiplied by the number of people working on the project and frequency of changes they make. Because deploy time affects EVERY contributor and EVERY code change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Slow deploy means slow feedback loops. Imagine you’re an artist. Now imagine each time you move your brush on the canvas, you need to wait 5 minutes before the paint appears. That would be the most annoying thing ever.</p>



<h2><strong>The feedback loop (deploy) has to be fast</strong></h2>



<figure><img src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-3b673bff843c3985e1f74841e58ef65d.jpg" alt="The picture of an artist that compares painting and seeing result with the feedback loop of software deploy." srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-3b673bff843c3985e1f74841e58ef65d.jpg 900w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-3b673bff843c3985e1f74841e58ef65d-300x169.jpg 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-3b673bff843c3985e1f74841e58ef65d-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></figure>



<p>I believe that each developer who likes to solve creative problems needs to have a fast feedback loop. You change the code – “snap” – it’s updated on the server – “snap” – you see the result.</p>



<p>Please think about this next time you want to add something to the deploy time. And also, think about improving deployment speed next time you work on technical debts. If you cut just 1 minute for a project with 5 contributors, each of them contributing once a day (only on workdays), it saves more than 100 hours a year. And I don’t know how to count improved productivity because of not having to switch the focus, but for me, it would multiply this time by 2 at least. To create better software, we need to improve how we write software.</p>



<p>PS. There is a great talk that inspired me&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/36579366">https://vimeo.com/36579366</a>. You should check it out, it’s mind-blowing.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This is a post in a series of posts :</p>
<br>
<div><p>
As my regular readers know I reluctantly trust anything that isn't tested and battle proof. In the last 2 years, I applied the same logic that I apply to vulnerability research to the Data Privacy environment and proceeded to test a broad range of Data Subject Rights. Expect a few disclosures following this one.</p><p>

In true Information Security Fashion (insiders will understand) have attributed this weakness the ID :</p><ul>
<li><b>CDPWE-0001 - Does not designate a Representative in the European Union</b></li>
</ul>
<h3>
Introduction</h3>
<br></div>
<p>
When I searched Google for my name an interesting website came up in the results. A company called "Rocket Reach" allowed others to buy access to my personal data. I was intrigued as I have never given any consent for Rocketreach to store (or even sell) my data and I saw no other legal basis for RocketReach processing of my data.</p>
<div>

<p>
"Rocket Reach" a data broker that describes it's service as :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"Connect directly with the right decision makers, using the world's largest and most accurate database of emails and direct dials.&nbsp;Real-time verified data for 430 million professionals across 17 million companies, worldwide.Trusted by over 5.0 million users — powering sales, recruiting, and marketing at companies large and small.</p>
<p>
Prospect, connect and converse with your leads at scale."</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>



<h3>
Issuing a DSAR</h3>
</p>
<p>
On the <b>5th of April&nbsp; 2019</b>, I asked Rocketreach access to my personal data (Data Subject Access Request) and asked for the purpose and the legal basis of processing. Instead of giving me access to my data and reply adequately, RocketReach decided to <b>delete/remove all traces of it </b>and informed me that it did so the same day.</p>

<p>
While it might be surprising to some, this is actually a common reaction to DSARs when the Data Controller realizes the data they have may have no real legal basis.</p>
<br>
<h3>
Filing a complaint&nbsp;</h3>
<p>
On the <b>05th of April 2019</b>, I filed a complaint with the Luxemburgish Data Protection Agency (CNPD). The reference for this complaint is #3018 (For those that want to request information/documents from the CNPD).</p>

<h3>
Waiting for roughly a year</h3>
<br>
<h3>
"We agree with you but we can't do anything, sorry, move on"</h3>
<p>
On the <b>6th of March 2020</b>&nbsp;(<span>1 year!</span>) the CNPD responded as follows (Original Version on top, the Translated version at the bottom).</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p><span lang="FR">Monsieur Zoller,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="FR">La
 Commission nationale pour la protection des données (CNPD) se permet de
 revenir vers vous concernant votre réclamation du 5 avril 2019 à 
l’encontre de la société RocketReach.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="FR">Dans le cadre de l’instruction de votre réclamation, la 
société RocketReach nous a communiqué qu’elle considère que ce sont les 
utilisateurs de ses services, et non elle-même, qui sont les 
responsables du traitement pour ce qui concerne les
 données à caractère personnel traitées sur son site internet. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="FR">Par ailleurs, il ressort également de cette instruction 
que la société RocketReach est une société située aux Etats-Unis 
d’Amérique <b>ne disposant pas d’un représentant dans l’Union au sens de 
l’article 27 du règlement général sur la protection
 des données (RGPD). </b><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="FR">Au sujet des responsables du traitement établis dans des
 pays tiers, comme les Etats-Unis d’Amérique, nous souhaitons attirer 
votre attention sur le considérant (116) du RGPD qui précise que:</span></p>
<p>
«&nbsp;<i>Lorsque
 des données à caractère personnel franchissent
 les frontières extérieures de l'Union, cela peut accroître le risque 
que les personnes physiques ne puissent exercer leurs droits liés à la 
protection des données, notamment pour se protéger de l'utilisation ou

 De même, les autorités de contrôle peuvent être confrontées à 
l'impossibilité d'examiner des réclamations ou de mener des enquêtes sur
 les activités exercées en dehors de leurs frontières. Leurs efforts 
pour collaborer dans le contexte transfrontalier peuvent
 également être freinés par les pouvoirs insuffisants dont elles 
disposent en matière de prévention ou de recours, par l'hétérogénéité 
des régimes juridiques et par des obstacles pratiques tels que le manque

<p><span lang="FR">Dans le cas de votre réclamation cela signifie que, <b>bien
 que nous ne partagions pas le point de vue de RocketReach et que nous

<blockquote><b>English Translation</b><p>
Mr. Zoller, </p><p>The National Commission for Data Protection (CNPD) would like to get back to you regarding your complaint of 5 April 2019 against the company RocketReach. </p><p>Rocket Reach has informed us that <b>it considers that it is the users of its services, and not itself, who are responsible for processing personal data processed on its website</b>.  Furthermore, it also emerges from this instruction that RocketReach is a company located in the United States of America that does not have a representative in the Union within the meaning of Article 27 of the General Regulation on Data Protection (RGPD).&nbsp;</p> <p>As regards data controllers established in third countries, such as the United States of America, we would like to draw your attention to recital (116) of the DPMR which states that: 'When personal data crosses the external borders of the Union, this may increase the risk that individuals may not be able to exercise their data protection rights, in particular to protect themselves against unlawful use or disclosure of such information.</p><p>Similarly, supervisory authorities may be faced with the impossibility to investigate complaints or activities outside their borders. Their efforts to work together in the cross-border context may also be hampered by insufficient preventive or remedial powers, heterogeneous legal regimes and practical obstacles such as lack of resources. »&nbsp;</p> <p>In the case of your complaint, this means that, although <b>we do not share RocketReach's view and to the contrary believe <span>that RocketReach is the data controller</span> </b>for the processing of personal data on its website, <b>we are unable to take any further action in relation to your complaint.</b> We do not have the authority to investigate and enforce any decision we would have to take in the United States of America.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>We regret to inform you that we consider it impossible for us to proceed with the processing of your case.</b></p></blockquote>
<div><p>In Summary -&nbsp; Rocketreach has <b>not met the requirement</b> of the GDPR to name an EU representative (Art27) to account for the processing of European Personal Data. <b>In their answer, the CNPD makes it sound like it is optional, it isn't.</b> Instead of pursuing Rocketreach locally on that basis alone, the CNPD just gives up arguing it has no jurisdiction in the US.</p></div>

<p><span>In other words, just don't designate a representative in Europe, build your business model around the exploitation of data from millions of European data subjects and you are fine?</span></p>

<p>
I&nbsp; am fully aware that I could engage in legal procedures myself.&nbsp; That's not in my interest (in this case). The overall question you should ask is: Do we need a European Institution that handles extra-territorial investigations and fines? <b>Why should it take the time, money, and energy from an individual when the DPA is supposed to defend the rights of the data subjects</b>?</p>
<p>
What the CNPD could have done according to [1]</p><ul>
<li><span><span>to impose a temporary or definitive limitation including a ban on processing;</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>to order the suspension of data flows to a recipient in a third country or to an international organisation.</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>to impose an administrative fine pursuant to Article 83, in addition to, or instead of measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the circumstances of each individual case;</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>to order the controller or processor to bring processing operations into compliance with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate, in a specified manner and within a specified period;</span></span></li>

		<p>I was on <a href="https://www.insideedition.com/zombie-animals-encounters-terrifying-creatures-rise-42966">Inside Edition last week to talk about zombies</a>.</p>
<p>That’s a weird sentence to type.</p>
<p>While the story was dramatic, television clips are notoriously difficult to discuss anything of real significance. I had two main messages I wanted to get across.<strong> One</strong>, that we can’t be sure what these animals are suffering from just by appearance (this message kind of got missed in the clips they chose) and because of that, message <strong>two</strong>: you shouldn’t approach a potentially diseased animal yourself, but instead call animal control or your local wildlife professionals to come help (at least they did include me saying not to approach these animals).</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/lGACWoZL0-PNLWs0LGJsYz8XoSs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WHSNF332IQZR5MZDXT5VKCWWTA.jpg" alt="" width="322" height="410"><figcaption>A “zombie” raccoon, probably infected with canine distemper virus. Photo by Robert Coggeshall.</figcaption></figure>
<p>In all likelihood, most of the animals they showed and that have been recently been <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/zombie-raccoons-are-terrorizing-city-youngstown-ohio-180968704/">“terrorizing” individuals in Youngstown, Ohio</a> are suffering from infection with <a href="https://www.avma.org/public/PetCare/Pages/Canine-Distemper.aspx">canine distemper virus</a>. This is a virus related to human measles, and like measles, is very contagious. From the name, it obviously affects dogs, but isn’t limited to only dogs. It can also infect raccoons, foxes, opossums, ferrets, and even wild <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/extinction-countdown/canine-distemper-could-wipe-out-siberian-tigers/">tigers</a>. Among animals, the distemper virus can be transmitted by bites or simple close contact, so it can spread quickly within groups of animals living together. The infected animals then either recover and develop immunity, or pass away from the infection.</p>
<p>The animals exhibiting “zombie” symptoms like those shown in the clip are just the tip of the iceberg. It’s likely that many other animals in the local population are also ill, but perhaps not dramatically so; like any infectious disease, there will be a spectrum of symptoms in infected individuals, so not every wild animal infected with canine distemper will “go zombie.”</p>
<p>Wildlife authorities have noted that these outbreaks of animals acting like “zombies” happen every few years: the virus will sweep through a population lacking <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-unforgiving-math-that-stops-epidemics-20171026/">herd immunity</a>, infect many of the individuals, and those who are infected but recover will be immune. A few years later, when the population again contains large numbers of susceptible individuals due to births of new animals, the virus can again cause an outbreak—and the cycle continues over and over.</p>
<p>While canine distemper infection doesn’t cause symptoms in humans, <a href="https://www.avma.org/public/Health/Pages/rabies.aspx">rabies absolutely does</a>—and that’s a key reason people need to avoid these animals and leave them to the professionals. Based on the symptoms alone, you can’t tell if an aggressive, strangely-behaving animal is suffering from distemper or rabies. And while distemper isn’t harmful to humans (though it <a href="https://pets.webmd.com/dogs/canine-distemper#1">definitely could be to your dog</a> if they’re not up-to-date on their vaccinations), rabies is almost 100% fatal if not quickly treated with anti-rabies immunoglobulin and prophylactic vaccination. In the rare cases who have survived after symptoms developed, it was only with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5350a1.htm">extreme interventions</a> which are <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/six-year-old-dies-rabies-after-experimental-treatment-milwaukee-protocol-fails-782168">not always able to be replicated</a>.</p>
<p>Expect to see these epidemics of “zombie animals” on a regular basis in different locations around the country—but don’t try to be a hero. That never turns out well in the movies.</p>

<h4>Gout termed as rich man’s disease caused a significant impact in Europe and US&nbsp;history.</h4>

<p>The king of the Holy Roman Empire laid siege on the city of Metz in France. The blockade would have been an instant victory if the king had barged into the city. Severe pain in his feet delayed the king to start an offensive. The delay caused the king to lose the battle. The entire European monarchy crashed with it. The Kings’s pain was due to a disease that impacted European history for years to come. The condition was Gout, also called as Foot grabber.</p>



<p>Gout has been part of the royal disease list for centuries. Gout is inflammation in bone joints and termed as the Arthritis of the rich. Gout has affected a meager portion of the world population but has influenced some of the world’s significant political events. Gout occurs due to excessive meat and alcohol consumption, which is the trademark of Europe’s aristocratic life. Gout is mostly formed in the feet and caused unbearable pain.</p>



<h4>Charles V’s Gout Problem and Fall of&nbsp;Europe:</h4>



<figure><img src="https://interestinghistoryforall.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/00cf6-0pfleiado4dmcexib.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Charles V.Source-Wikipedia</figcaption></figure>



<p>Charles V was the Holy Roman Empire in Europe and waged war against the French and led a successful crusade. During one of his campaigns, Charles V laid siege on the crucial town of Metz in France. Metz was the last major town in French control. Charles V had the habit of exhaustive drinking and meat consumption due to which Gout developed in his leg. On the siege day due to unbearable Gout pain, Charles V stopped the offensive and took rest. During the period of rest, the French reinforced the town. When he recovered and went for an invasion, Charles V lost the battle. After the loss and due to Gout pain Charles V abdicated the throne and split the Holy Roman Empire among his son and brother. Gout brought in the Holy Roman Empire’s downfall and cut Europe into two factions the Spanish Habsburgs and Austrian Habsburgs.</p>

<h4>William Pitt, the Elder, and US Independence:</h4>



<figure><img src="https://interestinghistoryforall.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/55a30-0khp28bejfttz7dm5.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>William Pitt, the Elder.Source-Wikipedia</figcaption></figure>



<p>William Pitt, the Elder, was a British parliamentarian who influenced the British parliament. He was the grandson of the famous Thomas Diamond Pitt. William had Gout from a young age and skipped college graduation due to it. William Pitt spoke for the rights of the people in the American colony. When the British parliament voted on imposing taxes on tea, William Pitt spoke against the bill. He convinced many members to vote against the law. Unfortunately, on the final day of the debate, William could not attend the session, which passed the tax bill.<br>The high tax on tea created the Boston tea party and ultimately sown the seeds for the American revolution. Had Gout not caught William that day, American independence would not have happened.</p>



<p>Other famous personalities who had Gout are Cosmo de Medici, Benjamin Franklin, and Henry VIII.</p>



<p>Physicians came up with remedies to the Gout issue with stool or glass boot, but the relief was temporary. Gout got its portrayal as a rich man’s disease due to its patient history.</p>

            <p>
	Churches in Montreal are becoming concerned about hosting community groups after being hit with bills for municipal taxes.</p>
<p>
	Joel Coppetiers, the Minister at the Cote des Neiges Presbyterian church, was shocked when his institution first received a municipal tax bill in early 2015.</p>
<p>
	It was "the first indication that something had changed," said Coppetiers.</p>
<p>
	Provincial law exempts churches and manses from paying municipal taxes but Coppetiers was told that if a manse is vacant for several months between ministers, it's taxable.</p>
<p>
	Following that, city officials arrived for an inspection of every room in the church and how they were used.</p>
<p>
	"The indication is there's not an exemption for the church as a whole, there's only an exemption for those areas used for public worship and things directly related to it," said Coppetiers.</p>
<p>
	As a result, many churches in Montreal that host community groups, such as food banks, or Girl Guides or Boy Scouts, are facing mounting tax bills.</p>
<p>
	Coppetiers says the city has changed how it interprets the law.</p>
<p>
	"We're there to care and serve the community and this is part of it," said Coppetiers.</p>
<p>
	Coppetiers says taxes are due even when services are suspended for renovations.</p>
<p>
	The amount owed in taxes can increase swiftly if a church closes its doors.</p>
<p>
	When <a href="http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/trinity-memorial-church-in-ndg-closes-its-doors-1.3302321">Trinity Memorial Church in NDG </a>closed earlier this year, the city started enacting taxes immediately following the last service.</p>
<p>
	As a result churches feel pressured to sell swiftly, with Trinity Memorial being sold to Stanford Properties Group within two months.</p>
<p>
	The issue of places of worship owing taxes and fighting the city's exemptions office came as a surprise to city politicians, including Councillor Peter McQueen.</p>
<p>
	"Already our churches are in danger, they're having a number of financial problems and this is a further low blow," said McQueen.</p>
<p>
	The NDG councillor said his party, Projet Montreal, will study the exemption issue, but he said Montreal's Executive Committee needs to step up.</p>
<p>
	"If we don't do something you're going to see churches closed, churches possibly torn down, heaven forbid, certainly converted away from community use," said McQueen.</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile churches across the island are praying that the city will cease surprising them with taxes they can't afford.</p>
                                              </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      

<p>Last Sunday the 19th July 2020 I launched <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a>, a Decentralised, Self-Hosted, Twitter™-like microBlogging Platform.</p>

<p>You can read about my previous <a href="https://www.prologic.blog/2020/07/20/ann-announcing-twtxtnet.html">Announcing twtxt.net post</a>.</p>

<p>Today however I want to share more about <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> and the software behind it <a href="https://github.com/prologic/twtxt">prologic/twtxt</a>; Why I’ve done all this, Why it is important to me and Why you should care.</p>

<p>——</p>

<h2 id="background-story">Background Story</h2>

<p>So before we go into the Why and How, let’s first of all talk about how we go here in the first place.</p>

<p>Back in ~2015 I got head hunted by <a href="https://facebook.com/">Facebook</a>™ and after turning them down twice (<em>three was a bit much!</em>) I accepted the offer and relocated my family to the Bay Area at the Menlo Park HQ ala Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>There I spent ~3.5yrs as a Production Engineer (<em>Google it, or think DevOps/SRE if you’re unfamiliar, but not an apt description</em>).
Meanwhile, while I was <em>trying</em> to be good at my new found ay job, interesting developments were happening in the Social Media industry. Not only was Facebook copping flack for the Cambridge Analytics series of events, but <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>™ was going through some changes as well…</p>

<p>Twitter (_allegedly, although I never really got into Twitter myself…)( was introducing new automated algorithms to change what users on their platform saw on their timeline. This has significant impact on usability of the original intended use of the platform. Naturally <em>some</em> users did not like this and sought out other avenues and solutinos.</p>

<p>One such avenue was <a href="https://github.com/bucket">bucket</a>’s <a href="https://twtxt.readthedocs.org/">twtxt</a>. As I understand it he created a very simple file format specification, a canonical client and unleashed this onto the world! 👏</p>

<p>This was all around ~2016. I was too busy at Facebook to notice :)</p>

<h2 id="present-day-2020">Present Day (2020)</h2>

<p>Fast forward to ~2020 (<em>20th July 2020 to be exact</em>) and a few weeks earlier while I was on holidays I was up late one night just poking around on the Internet (<em>as you do</em>) and looking for “Decentralized Social Media” software. I found quite a few; here are some of the better known ones:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://diasporafoundation.org/">Diaspore</a></li>
<li><a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Some other not so well known ones:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">ScuttleButt</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gnusocial.network/">GNU Social</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This this very blog’s underlying platform <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> where I now write and publish longer pieces like on my <a href="https://prologic.blog/">Blog</a></p>

<p>There’s even an article on Wired entitled <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/decentralized-social-networks-sound-great-too-bad-theyll-never-work/">Decentralised Social Networks Sound Great. Too Bad They’ll Never Work</a>! Well I’m here to tell you  I formally challenge this and am here to throw the gauntlet down! 🧤</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By the way… I <em>might</em> have caught twtxt sooner back in ~2018 when I got back from the US, but I was also (<em>at that time</em>) too busy moving around, working and trying to get bak into our family home that was still being rented at the time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As I said I launched <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> (<em>the first of what I hope will be many instances</em>) on Sunday the 19th July 2020. I wrote the software <a href="https://github.com/prologic/twtxt">prologic/twtxt</a> in just a few short weekends in my “spare time” and licensed it under the very permissive MIT license.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>📕 If you haven’t already checked it out, created an account and played around. I would encourage you to do so! I run a freely available for anyone to use instance over at <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are non-technical and read this far… Firstly congratulations I like you already! Second, don’t worry, <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> is just a platform to voice/share your thoughts, wisdoms, rambling, short-form text or anything else you want. Think of it like a miniature Facebook or Twitter but without all the advertising or tracking.</p>

<p>I believe in this very simple analogy:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you buy a diary and a Parker™ Pen.
If you then write down your thoughts, wisdoms, experiences, rambling or whatever you want to and share this with others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who owns what you have written? The manufacturer of the paper? The manufacturer of the diary? The manufacturer of the pen?</p>

<p>🤔</p>

<h3 id="so-why-why-should-i-use-twtxt-net">So why? Why should I use twtxt.net?</h3>

<p>You should use <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> if you are the type of person that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enjoys writing and sharing interesting things with others.</li>
<li>Just have interesting things to say in general. Knowledge and Wisdom should be shared!</li>
<li>Are tired of all the issues of all the <strong>BIG</strong> Social Media giants that now plague the f<em>, g</em> and t*.</li>
<li>No longer <em>wish</em> to be the product of Facebook or Twitter and want to <strong>own</strong> your own posts and interactions.</li>
</ul>

<p>See whilst <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> is brand spanking new, there are a few principles that will always remain true even now and going forward:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>NO</strong> User behaviour tracking of any kind.</li>
<li><strong>NO</strong> Advertising anywhere  of any kind.</li>
<li>Absolutely <strong>must</strong> be capable of being self-hosted.</li>
<li>Absolutely <strong>must</strong> allow users to take their data somewhere else and use another <a href="https://twtxt.readthedocs.org/">twtxt</a> client</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="so-how-will-you-make-any-money">So how will you make any money?!</h3>

<p>Good question! Glad you asked. I probably won’t! But one of my primary goals is for users to “Self Host”.</p>

<p>What does this mean?</p>

<p>Well it simply means that you run your own server instance of the software that is behind <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a non-technical person (<em>which would be true of most people as there are only about ~1M software developers in the world</em>) then you’re probably asking yourself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But how do I do this?! I don’t know anything about computers! I just use apps!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well don’t worry. Even through (<em>at the time of writing this</em>) it’s really early days for <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> there are plans for the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>A paid single-user instance of <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> that is <strong>your very own</strong>, personalised to you, with your own domain name but with all the same features.</li>
<li>A paid multi-user instance of <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> with all the same features but more suitable to small communities, schools, villages, neighbourhoods, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>How much will this cost when it becomes available? Short answer is I don’t know. But I can tell you this, it will cost you less than what you are paying for Facebook and Twitter today (<em>remember that even through the f<em>, t</em>, g* are all FREE, there is an implicit cost, which is to say that you are implicitly paying for it as you are their product!</em>).</p>

<p>Let’s just say that once we’re ready to launch single-click hosted instances for the masses that it will cost you next to nothing. And if you can’t pay for your own instance, just use a friend’s instance or jump on any other instance you can find like <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a>!</p>

<h2 id="twtxt-net-today">twtxt.net Today</h2>

<p>So let’s talk about what <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> can do for you today.</p>

<p>Today you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Signup as a new user at <a href="https://twtxt.net/register">https://twtxt.net/register</a></li>
<li>Login at <a href="https://twtx.net/login">https://twtx.net/login</a></li>
<li>Make your first post by entering some prose of wisdom in the text box and hitting Submit!</li>
<li>You can follow other feeds by entering a Nickname for the feed and their URL in <a href="https://twtxt.net/follow">https://twtxt.net/follow</a></li>
<li>You can discover other users on the same instance as you by going to <a href="https://twtxt.net/discover">https://twtxt.net/discover</a></li>

        <div>

<p>Last week, my dad was asking me why I was proud of this triangle on my laptop.</p>
<p><img src="https://liamhinzman.com/img/vkTriangle.jpg"></p>
<p>I told him that rendering a triangle is complicated: it took me 3 days, and 1000+ lines of code to create the above image. This just made him more confused.</p>
<p>So I wrote this article explaining what the Vulkan graphics API is, how it works, and everything that goes into rendering a triangle with your GPU.</p>
<h2 id="what-vulkan-is">What Vulkan Is</h2>
<p>Vulkan is a graphics API that is designed to provide an accurate abstraction of how modern graphics processing units (GPUs) work. Unlike OpenGL, Vulkan is very verbose. Every detail related to the graphics API needs to be set up from scratch. The upsides to this are that you only use what you choose to, and you can better understand what’s going on in your application and in doing so achieve much higher performance.</p>
<p>This article is intended to be a concise overview of the fundamentals of Vulkan. It was written for somebody who knew Vulkan but has forgotten many of the details (i.e.&nbsp;future me). Most of the information here comes from the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2/html/vkspec.html">Vulkan 1.2 Spec</a>.</p>
<p>Note: This article uses the <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Hpp/">C++ bindings</a> for Vulkan</p>
<h2 id="vulkan-in-a-nutshell">Vulkan in a Nutshell</h2>
<p><em>From a bird’s eye view, here’s how a Vulkan application works:</em></p>
<p>Vulkan can access <strong>devices</strong>, which let you control one or more <strong>queues</strong>. Queues are how you send a list of commands to the GPU, and they can be members of one or more <strong>queue families</strong>, each of which can do different things (e.g.&nbsp;draw the vertices of a 3D model).</p>
<p><strong>Command buffers</strong> are how you submit commands to a queue. Device commands are ‘recorded’ to a command buffer through Vulkan API calls, and can then be submitted once or many times (e.g.&nbsp;once every frame) to a queue to be executed.</p>
<p>That’s the TL;DR - now it’s time to dive into the details!</p>
<h2 id="genesis">Genesis</h2>
<p><strong><em>Instances and Devices</em></strong></p>
<p><em>In the beginning there was the Vulkan API. And the API was made flesh through <code>vk::Instance</code>, and from it sprung all per-application state.</em></p>
<p>You initialize Vulkan by creating an instance, which contains application state - information like what version of the Vulkan API you’re using, your application’s name, and which extensions and layers you want to enable. Extensions and layers provide behavior that isn’t included by default in Vulkan, like extended error checking and call logging.</p>
<p>With an instance you can examine the <strong>physical devices</strong> (usually GPUs) that are available. A machine might have multiple physical devices, and each of their properties (such as being a dedicated graphics card) can be inspected.</p>
<p>A common pattern for physical device selection is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>List all of the physical devices</li>
<li>Score each physical device on desired properties</li>
<li>Give physical devices without required properties a score of 0</li>
<li>Pick the physical device with the highest score</li>
</ul>

</details>
<p>With a physical device you can create a <strong>logical device</strong>.</p>
<p>Physical devices represent the GPU, and logical devices are what you use to create resources and access <strong>queues</strong>.</p>
<p>Keeping the logical device separate from the physical device is also useful because it allows you to have multiple logical devices, each with their state and resources, for a single physical device. One example of where this would be useful is if you had a Vulkan rendering application that also used a UI Toolkit (also running on Vulkan) that was completely separate. They’d each need their own logical devices to operate, but they’re both using the same physical device.</p>
<p>Logical device creation is also where you create queues.</p>
<h2 id="making-stuff-happen">Making Stuff Happen</h2>
<p><strong><em>Queues, Command Buffers, and Render Passes</em></strong></p>
<p>A queue is a list of commands that the GPU executes.</p>
<p>Each queue can only have certain types of commands (some can have multiple types, others just one), and this is specified when a queue is created.</p>
<p>The four types of queue operations are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Graphics</strong> —&gt; Drawing the vertices of a model</li>
<li><strong>Compute</strong> —&gt; Ray tracing, cloth simulation</li>
<li><strong>Transfer</strong> —&gt; Loading textures and buffers</li>
<li><strong>Sparse</strong> —&gt; Loading part of a ‘mega-texture’</li>
</ul>
<p>A physical device will give you access to several queues of different <strong>queue families</strong>, and when you create a queue it will be an index to a queue of a matching queue family on the device. Queue families are queues that have the same properties as one another (e.g.&nbsp;perform both graphics and compute operations).</p>
<p>Commands are submitted to queues by first recording a series of commands into a command buffer and then submitting the entire command buffer to a queue with <code>vk::Queue::submit()</code>.</p>
<p>Note: Ideally you should reuse command buffers, but generally you can re-record them every frame without a large performance hit, and it makes some things easier (e.g.&nbsp;sending uniform buffers to shaders).</p>
<p>Also, you can submit multiple command buffers to a single queue. One reason why this is useful is that it <em>can</em> allow you to ensure that one set of commands from a command buffer completes execution before another command buffer in the queue starts (more on this later).</p>
<p>Finally, commands recorded in command buffers can perform:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Actions</strong> —&gt; draw, dispatch, clear, copy, query operations etc</li>
<li><strong>State setting</strong> —&gt; bind pipelines / buffers, push constants etc</li>
<li><strong>Synchronization</strong> —&gt; set / wait events, pipeline barriers etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Some commands perform just one of these tasks, while others do several. A <strong>render pass</strong> is needed to execute certain commands, including drawing.</p>
<h3 id="render-passes">Render Passes</h3>
<p>A render pass consists of one or more <strong>subpasses</strong>, along with several <strong>framebuffers</strong>. Framebuffers represent a series of memory attachments (e.g.&nbsp;color, depth etc) that each subpass can read from and write to.</p>
<p>A command in a subpass might write to a color buffer, which will allow for later subpasses / render passes to read from it. This allows for techniques like deferred rendering.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://learnopengl.com/img/advanced-lighting/deferred_g_buffer.png" alt=""><figcaption>Color attachments after initial render pass in deferred rendering (LearnOpenGL)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Deferred rendering is a story for another day, but the gist of it is that you can store most of the geometry information in an initial render pass, and <em>defer</em> expensive rendering operations like lighting for later.</p>
<details>
<summary><b> Example code for recording to a command buffer and render pass </b></summary>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>// Create a command buffer</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a>vk::CommandBuffer cmd;</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4"></a><span>// Start recording to the command buffer and render pass</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5"></a>cmd.begin(vk::CommandBufferBeginInfo());</span>
<span id="cb2-6"><a href="#cb2-6"></a>cmd.beginRenderPass(vk::RenderPassBeginInfo();</span>
<span id="cb2-7"><a href="#cb2-7"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-8"><a href="#cb2-8"></a><span>// Bind a graphics pipeline (covered later)</span></span>
<span id="cb2-9"><a href="#cb2-9"></a>cmd.bindPipeline(vk::PipelineBindPoint::eGraphics, graphicsPipeline);</span>
<span id="cb2-10"><a href="#cb2-10"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-11"><a href="#cb2-11"></a><span>// Bind vertex buffers containing info needed to draw vertices</span></span>
<span id="cb2-12"><a href="#cb2-12"></a>cmd.bindVertexBuffers(<span>0</span>, <span>1</span>, vertexBuffers, offsets);</span>
<span id="cb2-13"><a href="#cb2-13"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-14"><a href="#cb2-14"></a><span>// Draw the buffer currently bound to this command buffer</span></span>
<span id="cb2-15"><a href="#cb2-15"></a>cmd.draw(vertices.size(), <span>1</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>0</span>);</span>
<span id="cb2-16"><a href="#cb2-16"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-17"><a href="#cb2-17"></a><span>// Stop recording to the render pass and command buffer</span></span>
<span id="cb2-18"><a href="#cb2-18"></a>cmd.beginRenderPass(vk::RenderPassBeginInfo();</span>
<span id="cb2-19"><a href="#cb2-19"></a>cmd.end();</span></code></pre></div>
</details>
<p>Last thing! Some commands that perform actions (e.g.&nbsp;draw vertices) do so based on the current state (e.g.&nbsp;the currently bound array of vertices) set by commands since the start of the command buffer. This means that in the above code example, <code>cmd.draw()</code> will operate on the current state set by <code>cmd.bindVertex()</code> in the previous line. This “synchronization guarantee”, that one command will finish executing before the next one starts, is usually not true.</p>
<h2 id="synchronization">Synchronization</h2>
<p>GPUs are optimized for operation throughput, and because of this (with a few exceptions) <strong><em>commands are not executed in the order they were recorded in.</em></strong> The first command that performs an action in a command buffer isn’t guaranteed to finish executing before the last action command in that buffer. The first command buffer submitted to a queue won’t necessarily finish any commands before a later command buffer starts. The same thing applies to command buffers submitted on different queues and multiple subpasses.</p>
<p>At places the Vulkan spec is confusing on this topic, but the TL;DR is that this is true unless a <strong>synchronization object</strong> is used (or with state setting commands within a single command buffer).</p>
<p>There are a few different types of synchronization objects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Fences</strong> (GPU to CPU sync) —&gt; EX: ensure there are only two rendered frames at a time in the swap chain (i.e.&nbsp;double buffering)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Semaphores</strong> (GPU to GPU sync across queues) —&gt; EX: wait for frame to finish rendering before presenting it</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Barriers</strong> (Synch within a command buffer / pipeline) –&gt; EX: start compute shader execution as soon as the vertex shader is finished</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Subpass Dependencies</strong> (Synch between subpasses) –&gt; EX: wait for the normal and albedo attachments to complete before starting the lighting rendering subpass.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Synchronization is closely tied to the <strong>graphics pipeline.</strong></p>

<h2><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadavlev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nadav Lev</a> is far from your average VP of R&amp;D</strong></h2>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><em>Nadav, pictured left, with his dev team celebrating an FC Barcelona win in Barcelona on the Axonius company retreat.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>His first “job” writing code was in the elite Israeli military intelligence agency <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_8200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unit 8200</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similar in function to the United States NSA, 8200 has been called&nbsp; “the foremost technical intelligence agency in the world.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every Israeli serves in the military after high school. Only a select few get into 8200.</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>I’ve been working with Nadav for about 15 months. I knew right away he was different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His brain moves fast and his speech is efficient – even when speaking with me in English which is his second language. He’s tough like you would expect from a military man. But also warm. After his team had been using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linearb.io/" target="_blank">LinearB</a> for a few months, he would ask me <em>“do you want this feedback the Israeli way or the American way?”</em> I’m pretty sure he reserves the “Israeli way” for people he trusts so I chose to take it as a compliment 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p>His approach to building elite dev teams is different too. He’s not afraid to run his own playbook.</p>







<h3><strong>“Elite” software development team defined&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Before we get into Nadav’s leadership and team building secrets, it helps to understand how he thinks about elite teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Nadav’s top 6 not-so-obvious characteristics of an elite dev team:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>The team exhausts themselves to find the best solution to problems, not just any solution</li><li>“Automation-first” is built into the culture and day-to-day decision making of everything</li><li>Important ideas and steps get documented with a high level of quality and reverence&nbsp;</li><li>Discussions are mostly about the future, sometimes about the present, and rarely about past&nbsp;</li><li>When mistakes are made the first instinct is to create new process (not accuse)&nbsp;</li><li>They <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linearb.io/blog/how-to-introduce-data-driven-culture-to-your-dev-team/" target="_blank">align engineering metrics to business goals</a>&nbsp;</li></ul>



<figure><blockquote><p>His #1 characteristic of a great team: <strong>They make other teams around them better.&nbsp;</strong></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Nadav played basketball growing up. He talks about great dev teams the way basketball analysts describe great point guards. <em>“Their play and their leadership make everyone around them better.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><em>Steph, Kemba, and Dame are three of the best.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>“It’s also important to look at the elite team through the eyes of the developer.”</em> Nadav said. <em>“Not everyone knows how it feels.” </em>Nadav pointed out some not-so-obvious things that feel differently about being a member of an elite dev team:&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Journey from top secret to top start-up</strong></h3>



<figure><p><strong>ALERT: </strong>Nadav’s story and secrets outline an actionable playbook for the following audiences:&nbsp;<br><strong>➜</strong> Developers looking for the path to get <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linearb.io/blog/promoted-from-dev-to-team-lead-8-things-they-didnt-tell-me/" target="_blank">promoted to team lead</a><br><strong>➜</strong> Engineering leaders getting ready to scale up their existing team<br><strong>➜</strong> Engineering leaders coming in to build a new team from scratch<br><strong>➜</strong> Dev teams looking to advance from good to great</p></figure>



<p>Today, Nadav is Vice President of Research &amp; Development for the hot security start-up <a href="https://www.axonius.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Axonius</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was curious about his journey to get there so I asked him about his first project in 8200. He gave me a wry smile and said <em>“<strong>classified</strong>.”</em> It involved writing code and he was by himself. That’s all he could tell me without killing me 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>It must have gone well because after that first project he got to choose what he wanted to work on next and they assigned a second person to help him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It continued like that for a while. He kept impressing his bosses with cool, top secret tech. They kept assigning more people to help him on his next project.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“I started almost every team I was on but was never the formal leader. I got offers to be a team lead but I refused. <strong>I was having too much fun doing cool, hands-on shit</strong>.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Why did he keep moving from project to project? If the project went well, why not stay on to maintain it? <em>“<strong>Builders gotta build</strong>.<strong>”</strong></em>  Yes. They surely do 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nadav stayed with his unit for 6 years – double the required term of 3 years. During that time he met <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deansysman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dean Sysman</a>. Later, when Dean was CTO of a security start-up called Cymmetria, he recruited him to join.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“The final project I started in the army eventually had 50 people working on it. I felt great about what I accomplished and I was ready for a different challenge.”</em> It was time to build something new. He joined Cymmetria as senior developer.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Early on, I figured out that while we have awesome technologists, probably among the brightest in the world, <strong>no one knew how to manage development, release, and write good code. So I took charge</strong>.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sound familiar? This time when Nadav was offered the role of team lead he took it. <em>“The change was minimal. I was already documenting all of our sprint processes, leading our ceremonies, our testing approach… doing it de facto.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I asked if he liked being a lead, his eyes lit up and he got closer to the camera.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>He liked it. They raised series A funding and he scaled the dev team from 2 to 10. After three years they had built every feature on their wish list and the company was succeeding. Nadav wanted a new project and decided it was time to move on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eventually, he got in touch with Dean Sysman again who was now CEO of a new security start-up called Axonius. Dean didn’t want Nadav to be a dev or team lead. He wanted him to be his VP of R&amp;D.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Things moved even faster this time. In the 24 months after Nadav joined, Axonius exploded:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>The number of people in Axonius grew by 5X</li><li>Nadav scaled the number of people in R&amp;D by 5X</li><li>They won the <a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/about/press-releases/axonius-named-most-innovative-startup-at-2019-rsa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coveted RSAC most innovative start-up award</a></li><li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/axonius-nabs-58m-for-its-cybersecurity-focused-network-asset-management-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">They raised a whopping $95 million dollars</a> from top-tier investors&nbsp;</li></ul>







<h2><strong>7 secrets from 8200 for building elite dev teams</strong></h2>



<p>Naturally, after hearing this impressive story, I asked Nadav what he learned on the journey. Many of his fundamental beliefs for building and scaling teams trace back to his days in 8200.</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>**Name Redacted**, Captain Nadav Lev, and **Name Redacted**</figcaption></figure>







<h3><strong>Secret #1: Learn to lead without a mandate or official title&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Leading people without title or authority…&nbsp; Easy to say. Incredibly hard to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“I had to learn to get developers to do what I think was right without formal authority over them.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>So how exactly does he do it?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Nadav explains indirect leadership and how it can help you build teams and get promoted.</em></strong></p>



<iframe width="560" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HjI5uUuV6Qw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>







<h3><strong>Secret #2: “If you can’t stand the heat then don’t get into the kitchen.”&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Part of leading, especially when you don’t have the title, is putting in the work. <em>“Initially, at Cymmetria, I was doing my job plus creating process documents, writing training guides, building automation, helping everyone… It worked for me in the army so I did it again.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Isn’t that a lot of hours? I asked.<strong> </strong><em>“If you can’t stand the heat then don’t get into the kitchen.”</em></p>



<p>Ladies and gentlemen, that was Nadav giving it to me the “Israeli way” 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Nadav shares the truth about how much time indirect leadership takes.</em></strong></p>



<iframe width="560" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NaJcEtRYdVI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>







<h3><strong>Secret #3: The smarter the person, the more “why” matters&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>According to Nadav <em>“It’s easier to influence average employees. They’re more likely to follow your requests on face value. Your best people are actually harder to manage because they will push back if they don’t understand why you’re asking them to do something.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Nadav explains how to manage highly intelligent people using “why”</em></strong></p>



<iframe width="560" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yH9OBaGysZ4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>







<h3><strong>Secret #4: Become great at every job yourself before you hire anyone&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p><em>“I had a boss in the army tell me ‘if you want to be the best leader you can be, you must know the job of every person you work with, better than that person.”</em></p>



<p><em>“I was furious with this because it contradicted every leadership idea I knew of.”</em> I get it. I can think of about eight Harvard Business Review articles I’ve read that might disagree.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But over time Nadav saw the merit in this approach. Remember, your best employees will push back until they know why 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nadav explains <em>“In order to work with people effectively you have to understand them completely. In order to understand them, you have to understand their job. What are their difficulties? What are they trying to achieve? How are they being measured? How do they perceive you? If you walk a mile in their shoes, you will find that understanding them becomes much easier.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Now I understand. It’s not about control. It’s about empathy. It also doesn’t mean you have to DO every job better than the people that work for you. You just have to KNOW every job better. Like a coach of a basketball team. They understand what great looks like even if they never played at a high level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Nadav started at Axonius, he took this idea to the extreme, and started his tenure there in the most contrarian way I can imagine.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“My plan was to spend my first few weeks meeting everyone, learning, getting comfortable with the people. However, I realized that if I do that, I won’t have the time then to build all the processes and infrastructure we need. So I discarded my initial plan and put my heart and soul into personally building everything our team needed to succeed.”</em> </p>



<p>In two weeks he:</p>



<ul><li>Wrote 200 pages of code for an end-to-end, automated product testing mechanism</li><li>Integrated coding standard enforcement tools for consistency and shorter reviews.&nbsp;</li><li>Remodeled the Confluence knowledge base to make it easier to find stuff.&nbsp;</li><li>Wrote a guide instructing how to set up a new environment.&nbsp;</li><li>Configured Jira for maximum ease and transparency.&nbsp;</li><li>Wrote a 20 page training program from scratch.</li></ul>







<p>He literally told the CEO <em>“I’m going to start but please don’t put me in charge of the team yet.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is that crazy or genius? Nadav argues it was the best thing he could have done.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>

	<div>
	<p>It's worth discussing <em>how</em> all this works so you understand the 
	challenges that are being overcome here. The ability to run multiple DOS 
	programs at once is a pretty neat trick, given that this software heralds 
	from an era of computing that was <em>just barely</em> ahead of what the 
	Apple ][ was doing in 1978. If you want to skip this, <a href="#Windows_1.0">go ahead</a>.</p>
	<p>The root of the problem is that the IBM PCs basic architecture 
	crystallized a very long time ago, in 1981. In a world where ten kilobytes of RAM counted for 
	about what a gig does now, there was not a lot of room for "overhead" and 
	the idea that you would run two programs simultaneously was generally 
	unrealistic except at the high end of the computing world, which most PC 
	buyers were nowhere near. You needed every bit (<em>ha</em>) of memory you could get, and when 
	memory became more affordable a few years later, it was too late 
	to change anything.</p>
	<p>After just a couple years on the market, MS-DOS had become the 
	unquestioned OS of choice for the PC<a href="#footnote1">*</a> 
	and developed a monumental stable of software, every bit of which<em> </em>
	was essential to someone, somewhere, and could not be easily replaced. Thus 
	began one of the longest tails in technology history, as the PC industry and 
	Microsoft began contorting themselves to try not to 
	break compatibility with old software while still moving forward with advanced 
	functionality.<br>
	<sub><a name="footnote1">*</a>(specifically, since there were MS-DOSes for 
	other architectures, and other OSes for the PC)</sub></p>
	<p>Because DOS was developed under constraints very similar to those 
	in the 
	late '70s that gave us the "bitty boxes" (C64, Apple ][, ZX 
	Spectrum, etc.) it was not built with any kind of "supervision" in mind. In 
	other words, there was no abstraction level above the current running program. 
	DOS was more like a set of tools than what we think 
	of as an operating system now - specifically, it had no "process management"; no concept of "processes" at all, in fact.</p>
	<h2><strong>DOS</strong></h2>
	<p>When the machine booted, the part of DOS that was considered "the OS" - 
	the code for accessing disk drives, writing text to screen, etc. - was copied 
	into memory, and then execution was handed off to the command interpreter, COMMAND.COM, 
	which was an application like any other, at which point you could begin 
	entering commands to use the computer.</p>
		<p>At this point, DOS was no longer "running" in 
	any meaningful way. The code was "resident," meaning it was present in the 
		computer's memory, but 
	the processor wasn't&nbsp; executing any of it. Instead, the CPU was busy executing 
	whatever the current program was - if you were at the command prompt, then 
		all the code the PC was executing was part of COMMAND.COM. When you launched another application, COMMAND.COM was 
	vacated and replaced by that other application.</p>
	<p>In other words, while an application was running, DOS was almost totally out of 
	the picture. The only time execution returned to DOS itself was when the 
	application requested a "service" from DOS, like accessing a disk drive, at 
	which point it would tell the CPU to go execute one of DOS' stored routines 
	for this, and when that routine was done, control would return to the 
	application. This meant that,<em> generally speaking</em>,<em> </em>the current 
	program 
	had absolute control of the PCs execution and it's memory. It could in fact choose to 
	overwrite DOS itself, obliterating it out of memory, and DOS couldn't do a damn thing about it.</p>
	<p>The currently running app also had the option to speak directly to hardware. 
	The 
	whole purpose of DOS was to abstract things like that so programs wouldn't 
	need to know the details of the system they were running on, but since the 
	IBM PC was <em>extremely</em> consistent hardware-wise in its early 
	incarnations, it was entirely 
	optional for developers to take advantage of that, and often 
	there were reasons - of performance, perhaps - to bypass DOS and do things 
	directly.</p>
		<p>DOS provided disk access routines, 
	but the app could blow right by them and shoot commands straight to the 
	floppy drive if it wanted. DOS provided routines for printing text and clearing the 
	screen, but the app could just write directly to video memory. I can't speak to how common this kind of behavior actually was, but it 
	certainly wasn't rare, and it speaks to a larger problem - DOS apps simply 
	expect total control over the system.</p>
		<p>If you run two DOS apps at once, they're 
	going to stomp on each other, because each one thinks it's in charge of the 
		whole machine. The first one would store data in the same spot that the 
		second one stored program code, and thus one would overwrite the other 
		and crash it. So DOS was a single-tasking operating system - you could 
		run one program at a time, and when you wanted to run another, you had 
		to exit, return to the command prompt, and then launch your other app.</p>
		<p>Consequently, if you were working on something 
	in Microsoft Multiplan and wanted to go look up some data in dBase, you had to quit completely 
	out of Multiplan and then start dBase, which would take over the system and totally 
	overwrite the previous app. To get back to where you were you'd have to exit 
		dBase, restart Multiplan, load your document and find your place again - 
		in the process, totally forgetting what you were there to do in the 
		first place, because it's so many steps and takes so long.</p>
	<p>Right from the get-go, PC users wanted to be able to look at one program, then rapidly 
	switch to another. On its face this seems to mean "run two programs at once," 
	which is what we do now, but that's not quite the full story. Let's touch on how 
	that works nowadays, however.</p>
	<h2><strong>Multiprocessing</strong></h2>
	<p>To be clear, you <em>cannot</em> run two programs "at once" on a 
	computer. Some would call this semantics, but it's important in a very real 
	way, <em>especially</em> when talking about 80s-era PCs.</p>
		<p>Modern multicore CPUs get very close to true parallel processing by 
		letting separate programs run on separate cores, but of course, nobody has a CPU so big 
	that they have one core per process. And even if you did, programs still 
		have to share other 
	resources - the system bus, hard drives, and so on. Access to these 
	resources has to be carefully managed so that only one application can use 
		them at a time, and each one has to be cleaned up after before another 
		one can use the same resources. Otherwise, one program could leave the 
		hardware in a state where the commands that the next program sends put 
		it in an unusable state and crash the machine, or corrupt data.</p>
	<p>Even with all our modern pipelined cleverness, you have the 
	fundamental problem that a CPU, and a computer in general, has a limited 
	amount of physical hardware and can't dedicate some to each individual 
	program that's running. When you have more processes running than you have silicon, the only option left is to share 
	resources by dividing up the amount of time that each process gets to use the hardware 
	- this is one of the oldest concepts in computing, and goes back to the late '50s.</p>
	<p>The fundamentals of this process are simple: At 
	any given moment, one program has near-total control of the entire 
	system, to execute its code and use all the resources, and then after it 
	executes for a bit, it goes into a paused state and control is handed off to 
	the next program, which does its work and then hands off to the next. This 
	continues in a round-robin fashion, so that every program gets to use the 
	hardware for a certain portion of every second.</p>
	<p>Modern implementations take this to a fever pitch with all the complex 
	machinations used to make this process efficient, but the fundamentals have 
	never changed; this is how your PC is operating right now.</p>
	<p>One big hurdle to overcome in implementing this is that programs don't just execute 
	instructions in a vacuum. As code is executed, there are side 
	effects. Some are values internal to the CPU, like the&nbsp; status of CPU registers and the current 
	position of the instruction pointer. This is called "CPU state," amd is specific to 
	each running program. When you switch from one program to another, you have to 
	save that information - called "context switching" - and restore it when you 
	come back. Storing this info takes extra time and memory.</p>
		<p>Another hurdle is the state of other hardware. If two programs are 
		talking to the hard drive, you can't let them both just blindly issue 
		commands every time they get control of the CPU. The first process might 
		start a data read that the second process interrupts with a data write, 
		confusing the hard drive controller. So when switching from one process 
		to another, you also have to save the state of these other hardware 
		resources - and possibly even delay switching tasks until those hardware 
		requests are complete.</p>
	<p>If you have enough RAM to store this state, and if your apps don't need too many cycles per second to appear responsive, you can do all this and the user 
	will feel like they're "running multiple programs at 
	once."</p>
	<p>Now, in business applications - the 
	driving force behind the first couple decades of computing - actual 
	"multiprocessing" of this type is not as important as simple usability - users 
	just don't want to have to close one program in order to open another, as they 
	did throughout the DOS days. That, ultimately, is the goal: it 
	doesn't matter if the computer is perfectly speedy, or if programs can run 
	simultaneously, it just matters that 
	users not have to lose all their work in one program simply in order to look 
	at another.</p>
	<h2>Multitasking</h2>
	<p>This desire was of course tremendous right from the start of computing. Who wants to 
	be stuck in one program at a time? So, almost from the 
	earliest days of the IBM PC, software was created to enable task switching 
	with various degrees of success.</p>

When programming for full operating
systems, like any desktop, mobile, or higher-end embedded platforms, the answer is easy—threads.
They're built into the OS, and you typically <em>have</em> to use them to take advantage of features like
multiple CPU cores. Or, when programming for an embedded target, you may reach for a lightweight
<abbr title="Real-Time Operating System">RTOS</abbr> like <a href="https://freertos.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">FreeRTOS</a>, which gives you full threads without much work.</p>
<p>But what if you have a 16MHz microcontroller with 2 KB of RAM?</p>
<p>The Arduino Uno is known for being ubiquitous, cheap, and easy to program. Although there are more
and more reasons to use competing products, such as the various ARM Cortex-M and Espressif boards
(which I use almost exclusively), the Microchip (formerly Atmel) ATMega series is sometimes still
preferred for low power applications, cutting cents off a <abbr title="Bill of Materials">BOM</abbr>, and its widespread support.</p>
<p>Typically, one checks in a loop repeatedly to see if the task is ready to activate. This can be
checking if there's data in a serial buffer, if a certain time period has passed, or a <abbr title="General-Purpose Input/Output">GPIO</abbr> pin has
toggled. However, I'm going to present an alternative to doing this—<code>async</code>/<code>await</code>.</p>

<p>Many modern languages are implementing <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>. C# was one of the first big languages to do
it, and then Python, JavaScript, Dart, Kotlin quickly followed. The big difference between threads
and <code>async</code> functions is that <code>async</code>hronous code is handled by the program itself, usually
cooperatively, while synchronous operations on threads rely on the OS to do it. The first obvious
reason for it, then, is when threads aren't available—just like what we're about to get into soon.
However, asynchronous code is typically faster than synchronous code because it is able to avoid the
overhead of spawning threads and context switches, as well as the memory overhead, as the amount of
space needed on the stack can be calculated ahead of time.</p>
<p>Internally, the compiler turns the code into a state machine, typically using the language's
generators feature if it has one. Here, every time you write <code>.await</code> and the data is not available
immediately, the compiler inserts a <code>return</code> statement, and adds a parameter that allows you to jump
right back to where it was. Rust uses <code>Pin</code>ning, where it is guaranteed that the generated struct
that holds the stack will always be in the same place in memory at all times. This avoids a problem
where a pointer is taken to a local variable, the function returns and comes back, and is suddenly
pointing to something completely different.</p>

<p>C++20 has similar features to Rust's <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> with the <code>co_await</code> keyword, although the
<a href="https://blog.panicsoftware.com/co_awaiting-coroutines/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">available documentation</a> is <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/02_execution/04_executor.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">not quite as good as Rust's</a>.
However, there's a total of... <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/search?q=%22co_await%22&amp;tab=forum" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">1 search result</a> on the Arduino forums, <em>and</em> it's
in German with no code. And even if there <em>was</em> code, it would be largely unaccessable as Arduino
ships with an old compiler:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>❱ ~/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avr-gcc/*/bin/avr-gcc --version
avr-gcc <span>(</span>GCC<span>)</span> <span>7.3</span>.0
Copyright <span>(</span>C<span>)</span> <span>2017</span> Free Software Foundation, Inc.</code></pre></div>
<p>GCC 7.3.0 ships with <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html#cxx17" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">"almost full support"</a> for C++17 (although not by default), but a
total of 0 C++20 additions. And if you're on PlatformIO, you'll have even less luck:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>❱ ~/.platformio/packages/toolchain-atmelavr/bin/avr-gcc --version
avr-gcc <span>(</span>AVR_8_bit_GNU_Toolchain_3.6.2_1759<span>)</span> <span>5.4</span>.0
Copyright <span>(</span>C<span>)</span> <span>2015</span> Free Software Foundation, Inc.</code></pre></div>
<p>However, Rust has been able to compile <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> code for <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/11/07/Async-await-stable.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">almost a year now on the <em>stable
compiler build</em></a>. There's been steadily increasing interest in using these
features on embedded platforms with Rust, and many projects have been using it as a result.</p>
<h2 id="pseudo-asyncawait">Pseudo-<code>async</code>/<code>await</code></h2>
<p>These libraries actually implement a <em>very</em> similar thing to <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> with a state machine,
and jumping to different positions in code based on where it's already been. For example,
<a href="https://github.com/bxparks/AceRoutine" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AceRoutine</a> has a macro, <code>COROUTINE</code>, that internally converts the function into a state machine
that jumps to different places using <code>goto</code>. This is actually almost identical to how tools like
Babel in the JavaScript world convert <code>async</code> functions to traditional functions that can be used
with old browsers.</p>
<p>However, there are a few very critical problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local variables are not preserved across yields</strong>.</li>
<li>You can't use certain statements in some libraries (not AceRoutine), such as <code>switch</code>.</li>
<li>Destructors don't run properly, and will <strong><code>free</code> uninitialized memory</strong> if not done correctly
(due to the first point).</li>
<li>Tasks can't return values.</li>
</ul>
<p>These limitations are because simple preprocessor macros, which is the only option in C/C++, are
only "glorified copy-paste", and have no real computing power. Although <code>async</code> is built into the
Rust compiler, it wasn't before, and a (less-than-ideal, but still usable) macro could implement
most of the feature itself. Hopefully, new C++20 features will lead to more use in the embedded
world.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>It looks like there's a few packages (known as "crates" in the Rust world) to interface with the
hardware:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/avr-rust/ruduino" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ruduino</a>, which only supports the Arduino Uno</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Rahix/avr-device" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">avr-device</a>, which provides low-level hardware control</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">avr-hal</a>, which provides higher-level board and <abbr title="Microcontroller">MCU</abbr> support, and depends on avr-device</li>
</ul>
<p>Although <a href="https://github.com/avr-rust/ruduino" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ruduino</a> is by the avr-rust team that worked on getting Rust working on AVR, I ultimately
decided to go with <a href="https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">avr-hal</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It supports many more boards, and has a structure that allows it to expand further</li>
<li>
<p>It supports <a href="https://docs.rs/embedded-hal/0.2.*/embedded_hal/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">embedded-hal</a>, which allows us to share code between boards: for example, the
<a href="https://docs.rs/apa102-spi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>apa102_spi</code></a> crate will let us control APA102 LED strips on an Arduino Uno and a Raspberry Pi
running Linux, using the exact same code!</p>
<ul>
<li>embedded-hal also has a bigger focus on nonblocking operations, which is exactly what we're
looking for</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It has a cleaner and safer API</li>
</ul>
<p>To set that up:</p>
<p><strong>(Update 2020-07-26)</strong>: this is much simpler now with the latest nightly. All that is required:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>rustup <span>install</span> nightly
rustup +nightly component <span>add</span> rust-src</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="compiling-and-running">Compiling and Running</h2>
<p>We can compile by running</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>cargo +nightly build -Z build-std<span>=</span>core --release --target avr-atmega328p.json

cargo +nightly build --release</code></pre></div>
<p>Then, to upload it to a device, assuming that you have <code>avrdude</code> installed, run:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>avrdude -v -patmega328p -carduino -P/dev/ttyACM0 -b115200 -D -Uflash:w:target/avr-atmega328p/release/examples/serial.elf:e</code></pre></div>
<p>Change the upload path (<code>target/avr-atmega328p/release/examples/serial.elf</code>) to meet what you want
to upload.</p>
<h2 id="if-you-only-have-the-arduino-ide-installed">If you only have the Arduino IDE installed</h2>
<p>Enable "Show verbose output during: upload" in the Arduino IDE. Observe the build logs for an
<code>avrdude</code> command—it should look something like:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>/path/to/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino17/bin/avrdude -C/path/to/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino17/etc/avrdude.conf -v -patmega328p -carduino -P/dev/ttyACM0 -b115200 -D -Uflash:w:/tmp/arduino_build_721874/Blink.ino.hex:i</code></pre></div>
<p>Copy that command, but delete everything after <code>-Uflash:w:</code>. Then, without spaces, add the path to
your binary. This will typically be <code>target/avr-atmega328p/release/project_name.elf</code>, or
<code>target/avr-atmega328p/release/examples/example_name.elf</code>. Finally, add <code>:e</code>. Your final command
will probably look something like:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>/path/to/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino17/bin/avrdude -C/path/to/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino17/etc/avrdude.conf -v -patmega328p -carduino -P/dev/ttyACM0 -b115200 -D -Uflash:w:target/avr-atmega328p/release/project_name.elf:e</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="what-about-converting-to-hex-first">What about converting to hex first?</h3>
<p>Arduino typically converts the compiled binary to raw hex, and many AVR-Rust projects have
<a href="https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal/blob/bfc5dfe67107a68b4a673e54532354af126cb3ba/mkhex.sh#L32" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">followed that pattern</a>. However, there's generally no need to do that, as <code>avrdude</code>
has the ability to upload ELF binaries directly.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="onto-async-operations">Onto <code>async</code> operations</h2>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, <a href="https://docs.rs/embedded-hal/0.2.*/embedded_hal/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">embedded-hal</a> is implemented in such a way that asynchronous operations is
quite easy. When you attempt to read or write a value, you can get three results:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>WouldBlock</code>: I can't complete this operation right now.</li>
<li><code>Ok</code>: The operation succeeded. If reading something, this gives you the read value.</li>
<li><code>Err</code>: An error occurred while performing this operation.</li>
</ul>
<p>This maps very nicely to Rust's <code>Future</code> trait, which is used to implement asynchronous code. For
example, reading from a serial port is implemented like this:</p>
<div data-language="rust"><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>poll_read</span><span>(</span>
    <span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>:</span> Pin<span>&lt;</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>Self</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    cx<span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> Context<span>&lt;</span><span>'_</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    buf<span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>[</span>u8<span>]</span><span>,</span>
<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> Poll<span>&lt;</span>Result<span>&lt;</span>usize<span>,</span> T<span>::</span>Error<span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>match</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>Ok</span><span>(</span>byte<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>*</span>ptr <span>=</span> byte<span>;</span>
                Poll<span>::</span><span>Ready</span><span>(</span><span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
            <span>}</span>
            <span>Err</span><span>(</span>nb<span>::</span>Error<span>::</span>WouldBlock<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> Poll<span>::</span>Pending<span>,</span>
            <span>Err</span><span>(</span>nb<span>::</span>Error<span>::</span><span>Other</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> Poll<span>::</span><span>Ready</span><span>(</span><span>Err</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
        Poll<span>::</span><span>Ready</span><span>(</span><span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Although there's a bit of weirdness in terms of checking if the buffer is big enough, for the most
part, this works pretty well.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="why-do-i-always-return-1-byte-read">Why do I always return 1 byte read?</h3>
<p>I'm mostly mirroring the <code>AsyncRead</code> and <code>AsyncWrite</code> in the <code>futures</code> crate, which typically is
used on machines with full operating systems. Typically, the overhead of a syscall is somewhat
high, so you might request e.g. 1024 bytes at a time. Obviously, that isn't the case for an 8-bit
<abbr title="Microcontroller">MCU</abbr>. However, I'm keeping that pattern for ease of porting and to allow for networking, e.g. the
Arduino Ethernet shield.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, I copied and pasted the <code>AsyncReadExt</code> and <code>AsyncWriteExt</code> traits from the <code>futures</code> crate as
well. The way this is set up is that you just implement the low-level functions, and the <code>Ext</code>
traits take care of the more user-friendly functions. This is done instead of default
implementations to allow the main trait to be small in case it is added to the standard library,
much like how <code>Future</code> is in <code>std</code>/…</p></div></div>

July 25, 2020 | https://chris124567.github.io/2020-07-25-analysis-commercial-fingerprinting-service/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://chris124567.github.io/2020-07-25-analysis-commercial-fingerprinting-service/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190503172035/https://www.augur.io/">Augur</a> (2013-2017) was a commercial browser fingerprinting service, offered primarily to AdTech companies.  In this post I will analyze their tracking script and describe how it works and what information it collects.  The original copy of the script (<a href="https://cdn.augur.io/augur.min.js">https://cdn.augur.io/augur.min.js</a>) is no longer up; however, the Internet Archive still has a copy at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609184536js_/https://cdn.augur.io/augur.min.js">https://web.archive.org/web/20170609184536js_/https://cdn.augur.io/augur.min.js</a>.</p>

<h2 id="deobfuscating">Deobfuscating</h2>
<p>A first glance at the script shows a bunch of seemingly random characters (including emojis).  The was a hint to me that they were probably passing a big string into some deobfuscation function and <code>eval</code>ing it.  Passing the script through <a href="https://beautifier.io/">beautifier.io</a> shows exactly that.  The deobfuscation function has the following contents:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>        ...
        if (!''.replace(_(12), String)) {
            var z = {};
            for (i = 0; i &lt; 686; i++) {
                var y = x(i);
                z[y] = r[i] || y
            }
            t = _(15);
            y = function(a) {
                return z[a] || a
            };
            o = o.replace(t, y)
        } else {
            for (j = a[a.length - 1] - 1; j &gt;= 0; j--) {
                (r[j]) ? o = o.replace(new RegExp('\b' + (j &lt; 63 ? c.charAt(j) : c.charAt((j - 63) / 63) + c.charAt((j - 63) % 63)) + '\b', '\x67'), r[j]): 0
            }
        }
        return o.replace(_(11), "\n").replace(_(16), "\"")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To get the deobfuscated output, we can just copy the return statement but replace <code>return</code> with <code>console.log</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>        console.log(o.replace(_(11), "\n").replace(_(16), "\""));
        return o.replace(_(11), "\n").replace(_(16), "\"")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, we can just run the script in our browsers developer console and copy-paste the large output. The deobfuscated version can be found at <a href="https://pastebin.com/5Gdgxkxu">https://pastebin.com/5Gdgxkxu</a>.</p>

<h2 id="fingerprinted-attributes">Fingerprinted Attributes</h2>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I was shocked to find that Augur was silently collecting user’s Facebook information and all emails put in forms.  Apparently, this has been reported on <a href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2018/04/18/no-boundaries-for-facebook-data-third-party-trackers-abuse-facebook-login/">before</a>.  Otherwise, their fingerprinting was pretty comprehensive, but did not really feature any innovative or novel techniques.</p>

<h3>
What is Nintendo playing at?
</h3>
</div><div>
<div id="post-body-8506159587861018996">
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kNtacp8-GoI" width="320" youtube-src-id="kNtacp8-GoI"></iframe></p><p>Nintendo's latest Direct hit yesterday to mixed reactions. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNtacp8-GoI" target="_blank">video</a>, at the time of writing, has 68,000 dislikes and 87,000 likes. Fans were disappointed at the lack of any major announcements given the drought in Nintendo Directs in recent months. The showcase highlighted <i>Shin Megamei Tensei 5</i>, <i>Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster</i>, some DLC for <i>Cadence of Hyrule</i>, <i>Rogue Company</i> and&nbsp;<i>WWE2K Battlegrounds</i>. That was it. No <i>Doom Eternal</i>, no <i>Bravely Default II</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>While I expect Nintendo will undoubtedly release more smaller Nintendo Directs in due course, there is a much greater issue here.&nbsp;</p><h3>Everyone is talking about the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X</h3><p>Nintendo needs to step up to get gamers talking about the Switch again. Right now, the hot topics are the next generation of consoles coming later this year. <a href="https://www.staticcatgames.com/2020/07/will-july-23rd-mark-success-or-failure.html" target="_blank">Microsoft's event on the 23rd</a> is on everyone's lips, for example. If Phil Spencer and co show off a lot of gameplay for <i>Halo: Infinite</i> and other first party games, this could turn out to be an incredible event.&nbsp; Microsoft's Xbox Series S/Project Lockhart is supposedly going to be unveiled in August, adding even more impetus.&nbsp;</p><p>I wouldn't be surprised if Sony released more information to combat the impact of Microsoft's event, perhaps even the price and launch date.&nbsp;</p><h3>What can Nintendo do to get the buzz going again?</h3><div><ul><li>Mario games in celebration of the 35th anniversary.</li><li>Announce <i>Breath of the Wild 2</i>.</li><li>Nintendo 64 games coming to the Switch.</li><li>New [insert old IP] here - imagine the reaction if a new <i>Wave Race</i> or <i>F-Zero </i>was announced?</li><li>Announce a Game Boy Classic.</li><li>Announce<i> GoldenEye 007</i> coming to the Switch.</li><li>Say "<a href="https://www.staticcatgames.com/2020/07/what-next-for-nintendo.html" target="_blank">Switch Pro</a> - coming 2021"</li></ul><p>What about Todd Howard showing a video of him playing <i>Fallout 3</i> (or 4) on the Switch? That would be incredible.&nbsp;</p><p>If Nintendo really wanted to do something EPIC, all it has to do is release a video of Phil Spencer playing <i>Halo: Infinite</i>...on a Switch running xCloud.&nbsp;</p></div><p><b>BOOM!&nbsp;</b></p><p>And the crowd goes wild.</p><h3>Closing thoughts</h3><p>There is always the risk of complacency. Nintendo could decide not to do anything until September, which might be damaging. I expect Sony will release more info about the PlayStation 5 at some point, especially since we don't know the price or launch date. There might be more gameplay footage to come. Microsoft might have a busy August if they announce the Xbox Series S/Project Lockhart then. Nintendo could make a splash by announcing <i>Super Mario Galaxy 1 &amp; 2 </i>on the Switch or S<i>uper Mario Sunshine Remastered. </i>That would guarantee a lot of interest and pre-orders.&nbsp;</p><p>What do you think? Is Nintendo on the right track or should it do more to get everyone talking about the Switch and their games?</p><h2>If you liked reading this post, please check out some of my others</h2>

July 25, 2020 | https://pdimov.github.io/blog/2020/07/24/compilers-do-static-analysis/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://pdimov.github.io/blog/2020/07/24/compilers-do-static-analysis/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <div>
  
  <p><span>24 Jul 2020</span></p><p>Let’s take the following code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>int * f()
{
    int x = 2;
    return &amp;x;
}

int g( int * p  )
{
    return 3 + *( p? f(): p );
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It has two errors in it. First, <code>f</code> returns a pointer to a local variable,
which goes out of scope. Second, the check in <code>g</code> is reversed; in the case
<code>p</code> is a null pointer, it dereferences it, instead of doing the opposite –
dereference <code>p</code> only when it’s not null.</p>

<p>This is what <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/rbn9KP">GCC emits</a> for <code>g</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>g(int*):
        mov     eax, DWORD PTR ds:0
        ud2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That is, it can obviously see that <code>g</code> will either dereference a null pointer
(undefined behavior), or an invalid pointer (undefined behavior), so it generates
code that dereferences a null pointer (<code>mov eax, [0]</code>), which crashes, and then
emits the guaranteed-invalid instruction <code>ud2</code>, which crashes.</p>

<p>(You can’t be too sure, is GCC’s motto.)</p>

<p>And this is what <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/zW5dzY">Clang emits</a> for the same function:</p>



<p>Presumably, the logic here is that one of the branches leads to undefined behavior,
and the other also leads to undefined behavior, so we might as well remove the whole
thing, it’s not going to get called anyway in a correct program. (But if it does, let’s
just return, as crashing would be gauche.)</p>

<p>Now, I don’t know about you, but I’m left wondering here; if the compilers can clearly
see that all possible code paths through this function lead to undefined behavior,
why don’t they <em>tell us that</em>? Something like “Warning: function invokes undefined behaviour
on all control paths, you might want to check your code, mate”, except less formal.</p>

<p>Who cares about that, some might say, nobody writes such code anyway, this will catch
no bugs. Well, I have obviously oversimplified a bit. Let’s take a slightly more
realistic example, such as this one:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>int slice_sum( std::vector&lt;int&gt; const&amp; v, int i, int n )
{
    int s = 0;

    for( int j = 0; j &lt; n; ++j )
    {
        assert( i+j &gt;= 0 );
        assert( i+j &lt; v.size() );
        
        s += v[ i+j ];
    }

    return s;
}

int f()
{
    std::vector&lt;int&gt; v{ 1, 2, 3, 4 };
    return slice_sum( v, 3, 2 );
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What does <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/5YGYYd">GCC do</a>?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>.LC0:
        .string "int slice_sum(const std::vector&lt;int&gt;&amp;, int, int)"
.LC1:
        .string "./example.cpp"
.LC3:
        .string "i+j &lt; v.size()"

f():
        sub     rsp, 8
        mov     ecx, OFFSET FLAT:.LC0
        mov     edx, 11
        mov     esi, OFFSET FLAT:.LC1
        mov     edi, OFFSET FLAT:.LC3
        call    __assert_fail
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Goes straight to <code>__assert_fail</code>, without passing Go and collecting $200.</p>

<p>What does <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/aP5qEW">Clang do</a>? Same thing.</p>

<p>Again, if the compilers can clearly see that calling <code>f</code> produces a guaranteed
assertion failure, why don’t they tell us?</p>

<p>Because we are put here on this planet to suffer, that is why.</p>

<p>(Also because <code>assert</code> is a macro that the compilers do not even see, and they
don’t know that <code>__assert_fail</code> is the assertion failure handler, and contracts,
which would have allowed us to write <code>[[assert: i+j &lt; v.size()]]</code> , were removed
from C++20 as being too useful, but those are just random second-order
manifestations of the cosmic need for suffering.)</p>

</p><p>
According to a report in The Information, an internal programme at Google known as "Android Lockbox" gives employees access to data on how Android users interact with popular, non-Google apps like </p><keyword keytype="UnKnown" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="TikTok" actualkeyword="TikTok">TikTok</keyword><p>, </p><keyword keytype="UnKnown" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="Facebook" keynameseo="facebook" actualkeyword="facebook">Facebook</keyword><p> and </p><keyword keytype="Company" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="Instagram" actualkeyword="Instagram">Instagram</keyword><p>.
</p><p>
    "When YouTube was planning the rollout of its rival to TikTok in India earlier this month, employees turned to a valuable source of market research: how people in the country were using TikTok and its competitors on Android", the report claimed.
</p><p>
<span>Advertisement</span></p><hr><p>The programme works via Google Mobile Services (GMS).
</p><p>
    "In some cases, such as YouTube in India, this data helps Google advance its own competing apps, say the people, all of whom requested anonymity to speak freely," the report added.
</p><p>
The Google employees can reportedly see "sensitive" data about other apps, including how often they're opened and for how long they're used.
</p><p><span>Advertisement</span></p><hr><p>Google-owned YouTube is working on a TikTok rival called Shorts, to be introduced by the end of this year.
</p><p>
"Google is also thought to have used the internal programme to plan the launch of its TikTok competitor called Shorts", according to the report.
</p><p>
    "Android Lockbox" works after Google users agree to share information as part of the Android setup process.
</p><p>
<span>Advertisement</span></p><hr><p>Users are told that this data allows Google to offer a more personalised experience. According to the report, it also provides data for competitive research.
</p><p>
    Google admitted that it has access to usage data from rival apps.
</p><p>
A Google spokesperson told The Verge in a statement: "Since 2014, the Android App Usage Data API has been used by Google and Android developers who have been authorized by Android OEMs or users to access basic data about app usage -- such as how often apps are opened -- to analyze and improve services".
</p><p>
<span>Advertisement</span></p><hr><p>"The API doesn't obtain any information about in-app activity and our collection of this data is disclosed to and controllable by users," the spokesperson was quoted as saying.
</p><p>
The US government is set to grill Google along with other tech giants over its dominance in their fields of Search and anti-market practices. The panel announced its antitrust probe into the tech giants in June last year.
</p><p>
    Google isn't the only company that's been accused of such data gathering practices.
</p><p>
<span>Advertisement</span></p><hr><p>In 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported that Facebook used a VPN service called Onavo to monitor rival services.
</p><p>
    Onavo Protect -- a Facebook's software that was going to get the functionality -- was billed as a piece of VPN software. Onavo was used primarily to gather information about what other apps Facebook users were using on their mobile devices.

The app was shut down in 2019.

				<p>

<span><img src="https://pavelfatin.com/images/typometer.png" alt="Technical drawing of keyboard keys" title="Typometer"></span>Typometer is a tool to measure and analyze visual latency of text / code editors.</p>
<p>Editor latency is delay between an input event and a corresponding screen update, in particular case – delay between keystroke and character appearance. While there are many kinds of delays (caret movement, line editing, etc.), typing latency is a major predictor of editor usability.</p>
<p>Check my article <a href="https://pavelfatin.com/typing-with-pleasure">Typing with pleasure</a> to learn more about editor latency and its effects on typing performance.</p>
<p>Project source code is available as a <a href="https://github.com/pavelfatin/typometer">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p>Download: <a href="https://github.com/pavelfatin/typometer/releases/download/v1.0.1/typometer-1.0.1-bin.zip">typometer-1.0.1-bin.zip</a> (0.5 MB)</p>
<p>Java 8 or latter is required to run the program. You can <a href="https://java.com/download">download Java</a> from the official site.<br>
<span id="more-1135"></span></p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux).</li>
<li>Native API calls for faster screen access.</li>
<li>Synchronous / asynchronous modes.</li>
<li>Import / export of CSV data.</li>
<li>Summary statistics, frequency distribution.</li>
<li>Line / bar charts (including comparative ones).</li>
<li>Chart image export (with legend).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Screenshots</h3>
<p>Main window:</p>
<p><img alt="Typometer, main window" title="Typometer, main window" src="https://pavelfatin.com/images/typometer/typometer-window.png"></p>
<p>Frequency distribution chart:</p>
<p><img src="https://pavelfatin.com/images/typometer/typometer-distribution.png" alt="Typometer, frequency distribution chart" title="Typometer, frequency distribution chart"></p>
<h3>Principle</h3>
<p>The program generates OS input events (key presses) and uses screen capture to fully automate the test process.</p>
<p>At first, a predefined pattern (“<code>.....</code>“) is inserted in editor window in order to detect screen metrics (start position, step, background, etc.).</p>
<p>After that, the program types a predefined number of “<code>.</code>” characters into the editor (with given periodicity), measuring delays between key presses and corresponding character drawings.</p>
<p>To achieve high accuracy of measurement, only a single pixel is queried for each symbol. Moreover, the program can use fast native API (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_API">WinAPI</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xlib">XLib</a>) calls on supported platforms, offering <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/Robot.html">AWT robot</a> as a fallback option.</p>
<p>There are two modes of testing available:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Synchronous</strong> – the program always waits for typed character to appear before making a pause and typing the next character. It’s the most accurate method (because there’s no threading overhead).</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous</strong> – the program types and recognizes characters independently. This method is slightly less accurate, but it’s useful for testing rapid typing, when editor drawing might easily lag by multiple characters.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>To register only essential editor latency, text must be rendered directly to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framebuffer">framebuffer</a>, without intermediate image processing that might introduce additional delay. Prefer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacking_window_manager">stacking window managers</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing_window_manager">compositing window managers</a> for the testing purposes, particularly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch to Classic theme in Windows. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Aero">Windows Aero</a> enforces internal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_television#Vertical_synchronization">vertical synchronization</a>, which leads to minimum 1 frame lag (about 17 ms for 60 Hz monitor refresh rate) and delay discretization. It’s also possible to disable the compositing directly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021060058/http://www.softwareaudioconsole.com/Tweaking_Windows_7.htm">in Windows 7</a> and <a href="http://www.rlauncher.com/wiki/index.php?title=Input_Lag_Checklist#Disable_Desktop_Composition_in_Windows_8_and_8.1">in Windows 8</a>.</li>
<li>Use Linux distributive with lightweight <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager">window manager</a>, like <a href="http://lubuntu.net/">Lubuntu</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openbox">Openbox</a>). Complex, 3D-based windows managers might substantially increase system rendering latency, for example, on my hardware, Ubuntu’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiz">Compiz</a>, adds ~10 ms unavoidable lag.</li>
</ul>
<p>Close all programs that add system-wide keyboard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooking">hooks</a>, as they might process the keyboard events synchronously and affect the results (for example, <a href="http://www.workrave.org/">Workrave</a> is known to noticeable increase the typing latency).</p>
<p>You may consider switching your machine in a particular hardware mode (power scheme, integrated / discrete graphics, etc.). In power save mode (and on battery), for example, editor responsiveness is usually much lower, so it’s possible to detect significant performance glitches which are less frequently observable otherwise.</p>
<p>Before you start benchmarking, make sure that other applications are not placing noticeable load on your system. It’s up to you whether to “warm up” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine#Process_virtual_machines">VM</a>-based editors, so they can pre-compile performance-critical parts of their code before proceeding.</p>
<p>If possible, enable non-block caret (i. e. underline / vertical bar instead of rectangle) in editor. This might increase measurement accuracy.</p>
<p>Typical action sequence is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Specify a measurement title, like “HTML in Vim” <em>(optional, can be set later)</em>.</li>
<li>Configure test parameters <em>(optional)</em>.</li>
<li>Launch an editor, maximize its window.</li>
<li>Open some data in the editor, for instance, a large HTML file <em>(optional)</em>.</li>
<li>Place editor caret in desired context (like comment, etc.), at the end of short / empty line.</li>
<li>Start benchmarking process in the program.</li>
<li>After a corresponding prompt, transfer focus to the editor window.</li>
<li>Wait for test completion, don’t interfere with the process.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can always interrupt the testing process simply by transferring focus back to the program window.</p>
<p>After test result is acquired, you may either analyze the singular data by itself or perform additional tests (different editors / conditions) to do comparative analysis.</p>
<p>Both source- and aggregate data is easily accessible, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>copy table content  as text,</li>
<li>save chart to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics">PNG</a> file (with legend and summary stats),</li>
<li>export raw data in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a> format (for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice_Calc">Calc</a> or <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, if you fancy).</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s possible to merge results either by inserting data from an existing CSV file, or by appending data to a CSV file on saving.</p>
<h3>Recipes</h3>
<p>Here are a few tips on how you can use the tool to detect performance bottlenecks in text / code editors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check whether number of lines influences the latency. If so, typing might “lag” inside a large file.</li>
<li>Check whether editor window size influences the latency. If so, the editor probably does excessive repainting instead of drawing only a newly inserted symbol.</li>
<li>Check whether latency depends on horizontal symbol position. Ideally, that correlation should be undetectable.</li>
<li>Try to enable highlighting / autocomplete / folding / spellchecker / etc. Those features should be processed asynchronously, without affecting the typing as such.</li>
<li>Try to run the test in power-saving mode. Ideally, typing should be handled decently even on less powerful hardware.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re implementing a text / code editor, take a look at the <a href="https://pavelfatin.com/low-latency-painting-in-awt-and-swing/">programming techniques</a> to significantly reduce the drawing latency.</p>
<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>To make benchmarking possible, correct screen metrics must be detected at the initial step. The program attempts to recognize a custom pattern (5 new dots) in order to determine the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>starting position,</li>
<li>horizontal step,</li>
<li>background color,</li>
<li>line length,</li>
<li>caret type.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because there are many editors (and multiple versions of each editor), which looks different on different platforms, and there are many possible color schemes and fonts, the metrics recognition algorithm has to be very flexible. While the program sources contain a great deal of test cases, some glitches are still probable.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of typical problems and corresponding solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Editor background is non-uniform (gradient, picture) – set solid color background.</li>
<li>Characters are too low-contrast and obscure – use a crisp color scheme.</li>
<li>Dot characters merge with the caret – increase font size.</li>
<li>Editor replaces multiple dots with ellipsis – disable that auto-correction.</li>
<li>Spaces between dots are uneven – use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font">monospaced font</a> in the editor.</li>
<li>Editor has a left panel that melds with the text area – hide the panel.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Concurrency is hard to get <em>correct</em>, at least for those of us unlucky enough to be writing in languages which expose directly the guts of concurrent hardware: threads and shared memory. Getting concurrency correct <em>and</em> fast is hard, too. Your knowledge about single-threaded optimization often won’t help you: at a micro (instruction) level we can’t simply apply the usual rules of μops, dependency chains, throughput limits, and so on. The rules are different.</p>

<p>If that first paragraph got your hopes up, this second one is here to dash them: I’m not actually going to do a deep dive into the very low level aspects of concurrent performance. There are a lot of things we just don’t know about how atomic instructions and fences execute, and we’ll save that for another day.</p>

<p>Instead, I’m going to describe a higher level taxonomy that I use to think about concurrent performance. We’ll group the performance of concurrent operations into six broad <em>levels</em> running from fast to slow, with each level differing from its neighbors by roughly an order of magnitude in performance.</p>

<p>I often find myself thinking in terms of these categories when I need high performance concurrency: what is the best level I can practically achieve for the given problem? Keeping the levels in mind is useful both during initial design (sometimes a small change in requirements or high level design can allow you to achieve a better level), and also while evaluating existing systems (to better understand existing performance and evaluate the path of least resistance to improvements).</p>

<h3 id="a-real-world-example">A “Real World” Example</h3>

<p>I don’t want this to be totally abstract, so we will use a real-world-if-you-squint<sup id="fnref:realworld"><a href="#fn:realworld">1</a></sup> running example throughout: safely incrementing an integer counter across threads. By <em>safely</em> I mean without losing increments, producing out-of-thin air values, frying your RAM or making more than a minor rip in space-time.</p>

<h3 id="source-and-results">Source and Results</h3>

<p>The source for every benchmark here is <a href="https://github.com/travisdowns/concurrency-hierarchy-bench">available</a>, so you can follow along and even reproduce the results or run the benchmarks on your own hardware. All of the results discussed here (and more) are available in the same repository, and each plot includes a <code>[data table]</code> link to the specific subset used to generate the plot.</p>

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>

<p>All of the performance results are provided for several different hardware platforms: Intel Skylake, Ice Lake, Amazon Graviton and Graviton 2. However except when I explicitly mention other hardware, the prose refers to the results on Skylake. Although the specific numbers vary, most of the qualitative relationships hold for the hardware too, but <em>not always</em>. Not only does the hardware vary, but the OS and library implementations will vary as well.</p>

<p>It’s almost inevitable that this will be used to compare across hardware (“wow, Graviton 2 sure kicks Graviton 1’s ass”), but that’s not my goal here. The benchmarks are written primarily to tease apart the characteristics of the different levels, and <em>not</em> as a hardware shootout.</p>

<h2 id="level-2-contended-atomics">Level 2: Contended Atomics</h2>

<p>You’d probably expect this hierarchy to be introduced from fast to slow, or vice-versa, but we’re all about defying expectations here and we are going to start in the <em>middle</em> and work our way outwards. The middle (rounding down) turns out to be <em>level 2</em> and that’s where we will jump in.</p>

<p>The most elementary way to safely modify any shared object is to use a lock. It mostly <em>just works</em> for any type of object, no matter its structure or the nature of the modifications. Almost any mainstream CPU from the last thirty years has some type of locking<sup id="fnref:parisc"><a href="#fn:parisc">3</a></sup> instruction accessible to userspace.</p>

<p>So our baseline increment implementation will use a simple mutex of type <code>T</code> to protect a plain integer variable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>T</span> <span>lock</span><span>;</span>
<span>uint64_t</span> <span>counter</span><span>;</span>

<span>void</span> <span>bench</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>lock_guard</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>holder</span><span>(</span><span>lock</span><span>);</span>
        <span>counter</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll call this implementation <em><abbr title="Uses a std::mutex and std::lock_guard to protect a plain integer counter.">mutex add</abbr></em>, and on my 4 CPU Skylake-S i7-6700HQ machine, when I use the vanilla <code>std::mutex</code> I get the following results for 2 to 4 threads:</p>



<p>The reported value is the median of all trials, and the vertical black error lines at the top of each bar indicate the <em>interdecile range</em>, i.e., the values at the 10th and 90th percentile. Where the error bars don’t show up, it means there is no difference between the p10 and p90 values at all, at least within the limits of the reporting resolution (100 picoseconds).</p>

<p>This shows that the baseline contended cost to modify an integer protected by a lock starts at about 125 nanoseconds for two threads, and grows somewhat with increasing thread count.</p>

<p>I can already hear someone saying: <em>If you are just modifying a single 64-bit integer, skip the lock and just directly use the atomic operations that most ISAs support!</em></p>

<p>Sure, let’s add a couple of variants that do that. The <code>std::atomic&lt;T&gt;</code> template makes this easy: we can wrap any type meeting some basic requirements and then manipulate it atomically. The easiest of all is to use <code>std::atomic&lt;uint64&gt;::operator++()</code><sup id="fnref:post"><a href="#fn:post">4</a></sup> and this gives us <em><abbr title="Uses an atomic increment on a single shared counter.">atomic add</abbr></em>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>uint64_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>atomic_counter</span><span>{};</span>

<span>void</span> <span>atomic_add</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>atomic_counter</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The other common approach would be to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap">compare and swap (<abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr>)</a> to load the existing value, add one and then <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> it back if it hasn’t changed. If it <em>has</em> changed, the increment raced with another thread and we try again.</p>

<p>Note that even if you use increment at the source level, the assembly might actually end up using <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> if your hardware doesn’t support atomic increment<sup id="fnref:atomicsup"><a href="#fn:atomicsup">5</a></sup>, or if your compiler or runtime just don’t take advantage of atomic operations even though they are available (e.g., see what even the newest version of <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/5h4K7y">icc does</a> for atomic increment, and what Java did for years<sup id="fnref:java"><a href="#fn:java">6</a></sup>). This caveat doesn’t apply to any of our tested platforms, however.</p>

<p>Let’s add a counter implementation that uses <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> as described above, and we’ll call it <em><abbr title="Uses a CAS loop to increment a single shared counter.">cas add</abbr></em>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>uint64_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>cas_counter</span><span>;</span>

<span>void</span> <span>cas_add</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>uint64_t</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>cas_counter</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>();</span>
        <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>cas_counter</span><span>.</span><span>compare_exchange_weak</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>))</span>
            <span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s what these look like alongside our existing <code>std::mutex</code> benchmark:</p>



<p>The first takeaway is that, at least in this <em>unrealistic maximum contention</em> benchmark, using <abbr title="Uses an atomic increment on a single shared counter.">atomic add</abbr> (<a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/xadd"><code>lock xadd</code></a> at the hardware level) is significantly better than <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr>. The second would be that <code>std::mutex</code> doesn’t come out looking all that bad on Skylake. It is only slightly worse than the <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> approach at 2 cores and beats it at 3 and 4 cores. It is slower than the atomic increment approach, but less than three times as slow and seems to be scaling in a reasonable way.</p>

<p>All of these operations are belong to <em>level 2</em> in the hierarchy. The primary characteristic of level 2 is that they make a <em>contended access</em> to a shared variable. This means that at a minimum, the line containing the data needs to move out to the caching agent that manages coherency<sup id="fnref:l3"><a href="#fn:l3">7</a></sup>, and then back up to the core that will receive ownership next. That’s about 70 cycles minimum just for that operation<sup id="fnref:inter"><a href="#fn:inter">8</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Can it get slower? You bet it can. <em>Way</em> slower.</p>

<h3 id="level-3-system-calls">Level 3: System Calls</h3>

<p>The next level up (“up” is not good here…) is level 3. The key characteristic of implementations at this level is that they make a <em>system call on almost every operation</em>.</p>

<p>It is easy to write concurrency primitives that make a system call <em>unconditionally</em> (e.g., a lock which always tries to wake waiters via a <code>futex(2)</code> call, even if there aren’t any), but we won’t look at those here. Rather we’ll take a look at a case where the fast path is written to avoid a system call, but the design or way it is used implies that such a call usually happens anyway.</p>

<p>Specifically, we are going to look at some <em>fair locks</em>. Fair locks allow threads into the critical section in the same order they began waiting. That is, when the critical section becomes available, the thread that has been waiting the longest is given the chance to take it.</p>

<p>Sounds like a good idea, right? Sometimes yes, but as we will see it can have significant performance implications.</p>

<p>On the menu are three different fair locks.</p>

<p>The first is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticket_lock">ticket lock</a> with a <code>sched_yield</code> in the spin loop. The idea of the yield is to give other threads which may hold the lock time to run. This <code>yield()</code> approach is publicly frowned upon by concurrency experts<sup id="fnref:notwhat"><a href="#fn:notwhat">9</a></sup>, who then sometimes go right ahead and use it anyway.</p>

<p>We will call it <abbr title="A ticket lock that calls sched_yield in a spin loop while waiting for its turn.">ticket yield</abbr> and it looks like this:</p>



<div><div><pre><code><span>/**
 * A ticket lock which uses sched_yield() while waiting
 * for the ticket to be served.
 */</span>
<span>class</span> <span>ticket_yield</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>size_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>dispenser</span><span>{},</span> <span>serving</span><span>{};</span>

<span>public:</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>lock</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>auto</span> <span>ticket</span> <span>=</span> <span>dispenser</span><span>.</span><span>fetch_add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_relaxed</span><span>);</span>

        <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>ticket</span> <span>!=</span> <span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_acquire</span><span>))</span>
            <span>sched_yield</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>void</span> <span>unlock</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>store</span><span>(</span><span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_release</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s plot the performance results for this lock alongside the existing approaches:</p>



<p>This is level 3 visualized: it is an order of magnitude slower than the level 2 approaches. The slowdown comes from the <code>sched_yield</code> call: this is a system call and these are generally on the order of 100s of nanoseconds<sup id="fnref:spectre"><a href="#fn:spectre">10</a></sup>, and it shows in the results.</p>

<p>This lock <em>does</em> have a fast path where <code>sched_yield</code> isn’t called: if the lock is available, no spinning occurs and <code>sched_yield</code> is never called. However, the combination of being a <em>fair</em> lock and the high contention in this test means that a lock convoy quickly forms (we’ll describe this in more detail later) and so the spin loop is entered basically …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>What does it mean to have freedom of speech? Naively, it means that you have the right to express ideas without fear of governmental retaliation or censorship. But that’s not worth much in a vacuum. Free speech is valuable when you are communicating with others: abstractly, freedom of speech means the right to distribute information to an audience.</p> <p>If you frame freedom of speech not in terms of what comes out of your mouth, but in terms of the interaction between yourself and another party,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> then edge cases rapidly emerge. For example, suppose that you are on the street, lawfully raising a protest sign supporting X. You are hoping to persuade passers-by. The government sends in <em>five hundred</em> counter-protestors, peacefully raising <em>not X</em> signs. Your voice is drowned out in the crowd. You are unable to reach the passers-by; it’s as if you were not there. Is this censorship? I am no constitutional lawyer, but the effect is undeniably censorious – it is practically as if you had been sent home by the police.</p> <p>Historically, I haven’t seen this type of scenario give rise to much concern among constitutional scholars – perhaps for reasons of practicality. Perpetually mobilizing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing">astroturf</a> brigades to drown out individual voices is hardly practically feasible.</p> <p>However, this has dangerously changed as discourse has moved online. The real-world constraints to astroturfing do not exist online. With <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-text-generator-gpt-3-learning-language-fitfully/">GPT-3</a>, the marginal cost of distributing astroturfed propaganda online has firmly hit zero. GPT-3 represents the newest generation of text-generating AI, and it is extremely good – perfectly indistinguishable from a human in short form, articulate, detailed, and capable of infinite variety in style and tone. Now it is actually possible for any online group discussion to be brigaded by thousands of automated users – indistinguishable from real humans – twisting the conversation, while drowning out the voices of real humans.</p> <p>This will become common in no time. It’s too effective a weapon for malicious states to pass it up. Manual online astroturfing is already widespread. Both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Water_Army">China</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Research_Agency">Russia</a> pay thousands of state employees to spread propaganda online. As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections">Russiagate</a> and the now widespread conspiracy theories on Antivax, 5G, COVID-19, etc. show, it’s very effective: social media platforms have enabled divide-and-conquer strategies at unprecedented scale and granularity. They have become a battleground for the opinions of people in the West, and these people haven’t realized it yet. Using fully automated, infinitely scalable tools to infect the minds of your opponents with malicious ideas and sow discord offers an unprecedentedly high ROI to the villains of the world.</p> <p>Thus, we are moving into a world where bad actors can interfere with free speech with a new form of censorship: the use of automated voices, indistinguishable from real ones, to overpower genuine voices online, and to shape the appearance of public discourse according to their goals. If you believe, as many scholars do, that democratic societies are critically reliant on your freedom to distribute information, then this poses a severe threat.</p> <p>The abstract problem is that on the internet, we don’t have a good way to tell real humans from fake ones. The current state-of-the-art tests are CAPTCHAs with challenges that “only humans could pass”: read the word, click all the squares with traffic lights, and so forth. Obviously these aren’t going to resist automation for long. They will be useless across the board in a few years, once general image recognition tools are as good as some substantial minority of humans.</p> <p>In the long term, AI will be effectively impossible to distinguish from humans online. The only solution is to use what we have and they don’t – real-world identification. A real-world ID could correspond to some set of private keys, so you could sign your online actions to prove their human authenticity. You could have a large number of private keys, so as to enable ample pseudonymity. However, true anonymity – not leveraging real-world identity in some sense – becomes impossible<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> without opening up the possibility of mass creation of automated trolls.</p> <p>In conclusion: free speech is not just about freedom from straight-forward censorship, but about your ability to participate in discourse without state interference. GPT-3 marks a new generation of tools enabling states to interfere in online discourse with unprecedented scale and persuasiveness, enabling great damage at low cost. It is clear that on the internet, AI will become indistinguishable from genuine humans in the next few years. To that extent, we have to protect our freedom of speech. It seems like requiring real-world IDs and coupling them with public key cryptography is the only way out, which keeps pseudonymity but loses anonymity.</p> <p>Losing anonymity to protect free speech is counter-intuitive and somewhat repulsive. I believe in individual freedom as the highest ideal. I used to think anonymity was one of the greatest values provided by the internet. And I acknowledge that eliminating anonymity to protect free speech comes with its own issues in the long run: for example, a malicious government could abuse the real-world-ID-to-private-key link to very effectively crack down on free speech. I don’t <em>like</em> the solution I am advocating, but it’s a difficult trade-off.</p>  <hr>  <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> DevOps doesn’t have to be all work and no play. I built 5 stupid (but fun!) GitHub actions… because <em>why not</em>?</p>
<p>The full code for these actions can all be found in this <strong><a href="https://github.com/sidpalas/stupid-actions">GitHub repo</a></strong>. I encourage you to fork and/or add issues/PRs with impractical actions of your own!</p>
<p>I also recorded a video about this project on <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-ugGAYVCo">YouTube</a></strong>. ← Check out the video and subscribe if you are into this sort of thing 🙏</p>

<h2 id="what-is-github-actions">What is GitHub Actions?</h2>
<p>GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform built into GitHub. It can be used to automate things such as building, testing, and deploying code and can be triggered by any GitHub event.</p>
<p>There is also a <a href="https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions">marketplace</a> where developers can publish their actions for others to use.</p>
<p>While I have used many CI/CD systems including Jenkins, Google Cloud Build, and CircleCI, prior to this project I hadn’t explored GitHub Actions, so I thought I would try it out and have some fun along the way.</p>
<p>Enough preamble, let’s get to the stupid stuff!</p>
<h2 id="the-actions">The Actions</h2>
<h3 id="1----holiday-reminder">1 – Holiday Reminder</h3>
<p>Starting simple with this first action, I take advantage of the fact that actions can be triggered on a cron schedule to create the following 10 line action:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>name</span>: holiday-reminder-happy-new-year
<span>on</span>:
  <span>schedule</span>:
    - <span>cron</span>: <span>'0 0 1 1 *'</span>
<span>jobs</span>:
  <span>happy-new-year</span>:
    <span>runs-on</span>: ubuntu-latest
    <span>steps</span>:
    - <span>name</span>: throw error
      <span>run</span>: exit <span>1</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The action will run at midnight on New Year’s day and fail every time due to the non-zero exit code. This will cause GitHub to send me an email wishing me a Happy New Year 🎉🎉🎉.</p>
<h3 id="2----recursive-action">2 – Recursive Action</h3>
<p>The next idea was proposed by a friend and former colleague (<a href="https://scotchka.github.io/)">https://scotchka.github.io/)</a>. He suggested that I make an action which triggers itself, thus creating an infinite chain of actions.</p>
<p>Given that the GitHub documentation explicitly states <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#triggering-new-workflows-using-a-personal-access-token">“To minimize your GitHub Actions usage costs, ensure that you don’t create recursive or unintended workflow runs,"</a> this seemed like a sufficiently stupid idea. To achieve this, I created an action triggered by commits that makes and commits a code change of its own.</p>
<p>There are two interesting parts to this action:</p>
<ol>
<li>GitHub helps prevent users from accidentally doing this by not triggering actions based on events associated with the default <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code>. In order to get around this, I created a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token">personal access token</a>. See the <a href="https://github.com/sidpalas/stupid-actions/blob/master/.github/workflows/recursive.yml">action yaml file</a> for how this gets used.</li>
<li>In order to prevent the infinite action chain, I persist a count of the action executions within a file in the repo and increment it with each execution. This allows me to terminate the action chain when I reach a specified limit.</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">COUNTER_FILE<span>=</span>./recursive/counter.txt
MAX_COUNT<span>=</span><span>5</span>

count<span>=</span><span>$(</span>cat <span>"</span>$COUNTER_FILE<span>"</span><span>)</span> 
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>(</span> $count &gt; $MAX_COUNT <span>)</span><span>)</span>;
<span>then</span> 
    echo <span>"Count too high... exiting"</span>;
<span>else</span>
    echo <span>"Count okay... continuing"</span>;
    echo <span>$((</span> $count <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>))</span> &gt; $COUNTER_FILE
    git config --global user.email <span>"<a href="https://devopsdirective.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="e99a808da98d8c9f86999a8d809b8c8a9d809f8cc78a8684">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>"</span>
    git config --global user.name <span>"sid"</span>
    git add $COUNTER_FILE
    git commit -m <span>"Incremented counter file"</span>
    git push 
<span>fi</span>; 
</code></pre></div><h3 id="3----exponential-action">3 – Exponential Action</h3>
<p>The previous action has the potential to run indefinitely, but only one instance executes at a time, so it could be stopped manually if necessary. What if instead, the action triggered itself multiple times? This way, if it got out of hand there would be no stopping the exponential growth 😰. That sounds dumb… lets do it!</p>
<p>The file counter trick from before no longer works because multiple actions would be executing in parallel, all trying to modify and commit simultaneously causing conflicts. Instead, I stored the state in Git tags!</p>
<p>A random UUID is used as the base for the tag and the current iteration is appended to prevent collisions. The current implementation only support single digits, but if I make it past 9 iterations of exponential growth that means I messed up 💀.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>function</span> increment_tag_push <span>{</span>
    uuid<span>=</span><span>$(</span>uuidgen<span>)</span>
    suffix<span>=</span><span>$((</span> $count <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>))</span>
    tag<span>=</span>$1.$uuid.$suffix
    git tag -a $tag -m <span>"New UUID tag"</span>
    git push origin $tag
<span>}</span>

count<span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span>echo -n $GITHUB_REF| tail -c 1<span>)</span><span>"</span>

echo $GITHUB_REF
echo $count

sleep <span>10</span> <span># In case something goes wrong (this saved me during development 😳)</span>
MAX_COUNT<span>=</span><span>2</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>(</span> $count &gt; $MAX_COUNT <span>)</span><span>)</span>;
<span>then</span> 
    echo <span>"Count too high... exiting"</span>;
<span>else</span>
    echo <span>"Count okay... continuing"</span>;
    git config --global user.email <span>"<a href="https://devopsdirective.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="592a303d193d3c2f36292a3d302b3c3a2d302f3c773a3634">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>"</span>
    git config --global user.name <span>"sid"</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>(</span>i <span>=</span> 1; i &lt;<span>=</span> $1; i++ <span>)</span><span>)</span>;
    <span>do</span>
    increment_tag_push $i
    <span>done</span>
<span>fi</span>; 
</code></pre></div><p>If you are looking for a quick way to burn through your 2000 free tier minutes… this is definitely the way to go!</p>
<h3 id="4----smart-lights">4 – Smart Lights</h3>
<p>Thus far, these actions have been implemented in small bash scripts. In order to actually explore the capabilities of GitHub actions I decided the next action should utilize <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-docker-container-action">Docker</a>.</p>
<p>I had a couple of WiFi smart plugs from VeSync that I received as a gift a few years ago and found a <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyvesync/">python client for their API</a>. This made it simple to create an action which turns the lights on for a short period of time after each commit (what better way to incentivize code velocity?!💡)</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://devopsdirective.com/posts/2020/07/stupid-github-actions/images/lights-off.gif" alt="images/lights-off.gif">
<figcaption>Lights on... Lights off!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The code for this one isn’t particularly interesting, but because the action is using more than just bash, it requires an <code>action.yml</code> file in which we can see how inputs get passed into the action:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>name</span>: <span>'Turn on Lights'</span>
<span>description</span>: <span>'Turn on smart home lights for a few seconds'</span>
<span>inputs</span>:
  <span>VESYNC_PASS</span>:  
    <span>description</span>: password for VESYNC_PASS
    <span>required</span>: <span>true</span>
<span>runs</span>:
  <span>using</span>: <span>'docker'</span>
  <span>image</span>: <span>'Dockerfile'</span>
  <span>env</span>:
    <span>VESYNC_PASS</span>: ${{ inputs.VESYNC_PASS }}
</code></pre></div><h3 id="5----tic-tac-toe">5 – Tic-Tac-Toe</h3>
<p>With the team starting to get a bit burnt out having to commit code constantly just to keep the lights on, I decided to implement a game of Tic-tac-toe to let them burn off some steam. The trick is that the computer player for this game executes within an action!</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://devopsdirective.com/posts/2020/07/stupid-github-actions/images/tic-tac-toe.png" alt="images/tic-tac-toe.png">
<figcaption>Command line interface + board state file</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I wanted to try out the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-javascript-action">Javascript runtime</a>, so I built the game with Node, persisting the board state in a text file. Since the point of this game was to learn about actions the computer’s strategy is random, but this has the added benefit of letting the human win, boosting morale 🤔.</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>Overall, GitHub Actions turned out to be fairly easy to work with and the option Dockerize the action steps ensures that it should be able to support pretty much any CI/CD need. Also, GitHub has made sharing and reuse of actions a core part of the experience through the Marketplace.</p>
<p>While I’m won’t be rushing off to port existing CI/CD workloads onto GitHub actions, I will certainly consider it for future greenfield projects!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in March, my kids were super excited for a few days off for their Spring Break. I took a week off so I could be home with them and not have to worry about work. I still haven’t been back to the office, and they haven’t been back to their school.</p>

<p>I doubt there’s anybody that’s not aware of the current world situation regarding COVID-19. In March, my kids’ school decided that the risk of having all those kids in one place was too great, and they moved to a “School from Home” setup. My work did pretty much the same thing.</p>

<p>I’ve been pretty fortunate in that my work supports a “From Home” option, and I’ve been full time from home before. I was already setup to do anything and everything I needed to do for my job right from my house.</p>

<p>My company offered basic supplies to take home if we needed them. Keyboards, mice, monitors, even chairs. I passed on pretty much all of that because I already have a good setup at home to work with. My laptop is all I need to work from pretty much anywhere in my house.</p>

<p>It’s been four months now. I confess, I’m burning out.</p>

<p>I recently attended a conference called SRE From Home, which was really interesting to me. One of the things said in one of the presentations stuck with me. To paraphrase, the reason we’re all burning out isn't because we’re working from home, it’s because we’re living at work.</p>

<p>That really struck home for me. I took a step back and really looked at how I’ve been doing this.</p>

<p>Before the pandemic, I got up in the morning at a fixed time. I showered, got myself and my kids fed, the kids off to school, and then I drove in to work. I plopped my laptop down on my desk at work and <em>that</em> is when my work day started. I did my job until the end of the day, and then I packed up my stuff into my laptop bag and I drove home. I picked up my kids, got dinner ready, did homework with them, and got them to bed. I’d sit with my wife on our couch and watch a TV show or two and then go to bed.</p>

<p>Now, during the pandemic, my schedule is entirely different. I still get up at a fixed time, but the kids don’t go to school and I don’t go to work. I walk the required fifteen steps from my bedroom to my office and I plop down at my desk with my computer already running and open. It never closes anymore. It’s always there. I go grab a quick lunch, but rarely actually take a lunch <em>break</em>. I eat in my office at my desk. When my kids come grab me to tell me they’re hungry, I fix them something to eat, and then I’m right back at my desk. Dinner time roles around, and it’s the same routine. Even after they’ve gone to bed, the computer is still there, open and waiting. I’ll check my email in the evening and manage some small tasks right up until the point I go to bed.</p>

<p>Looking at this now, I realize that I <em>never stop</em> working. If I’m awake, I’m at work.</p>

<p>This is something I’m going to have to change.</p>

<p>I did something different today. I have to work tomorrow for server upgrades, so I “left” early. I closed my laptop down at three o’clock, and I went and took a nap. I haven’t looked at my computer since. It’s still sitting there on the desk, but the lid is closed, and I’m not going to open it until tomorrow night for the upgrades. When those are done, the lid will close again, and I’m sleeping in on Monday.</p>

<p>There are four hours of work scheduled for me Saturday night to Sunday morning, and those are not going to be “Free Work Hours”.</p>

<p>I need to start setting boundaries. There needs to be a line between “work” and “not work”. If I can’t draw that line, I’m going to drive myself crazy.</p>

July 25, 2020 | https://blog.quidsentio.com/posts/building-a-shareable-personal-journal/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.quidsentio.com/posts/building-a-shareable-personal-journal/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have wanted to build a social network for 8 years, but it was much harder to
make software for the web back then. Also, 8 years ago, I was not even a
software developer yet, so there is that. But now I am (thanks
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp.org</a>!), and we are living in the
easiest time to be a software developer since Jeff Goldblum uploaded a virus to
an alien mothership.</p>
<h2>Quid Sentio</h2>
<p>The time was kind to my idea of what a social network should be too. It aged
well, and now it's time to uncork it. I am building <a href="https://www.quidsentio.com/">Quid
Sentio</a>, a shareable personal journal. I am not
calling it a social network site, but it is. Well, it will be. It's just the
basics now but open in public beta in the hopes someone will care.</p>
<p>What I am building now is much more mature than what I envisioned back then. The
core idea is the same -- keeping in touch with real friends, the closest friends
and family-- but the foundation is much more robust these days. In the meantime,
Path has come and gone, people saying they have quit Facebook have come and
gone, data leaks and privacy abuses have come and stayed.</p>
<p>I want to build Quid Sentio upon the principle of privacy. Privacy as freedom
from being observed. From being observed by non-friends, from being observed by
companies, from being observed by people who bought your data in the deep web
after a database leak.</p>
<p>The first two are just consequences of design and business choices. Adding a
little bit of friction for adding friends -- so no one can spam-add all their
contact list; keeping shared posts visible only by your direct friends -- so no
virality or friends of friends stalking you. A subscription-based business model
-- so no ads, no invasive tracking. The third level of privacy is not that
simple.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity is one thing that gets harder and harder to do in software
development. At the same time, services that do it better than me are more
accessible. This is the first reason why I decided to build my project using
other people's infrastructure.</p>
<p>The second reason is that I want to limit how many things I have to juggle in my
mind while building it. I read in Sapiens that the Cognitive Revolution started
70,000 years ago. I am pretty sure it ended when I made 40. Some things look
attractive from afar, but I can pass without them, and I am happy enough just
hearing people talking about it. Things that fall into that bucket are Finnegans
Wake, EVE Online, Dwarf Fortress, and Vim. Other things I cannot pass by
without, and I have no idea how to do it myself.</p>
<p>The inevitable implication is that I had to find other people to do my job for
me. I wanted to focus on building the UI, creating the application logic,
designing the experience that would make my product unique. Not the devops, not
the infra, not the data plumbing, none of those solved problems. I found people
that do these better than I could possibly ever do in Netlify and FaunaDB. There
is also other software taken for granted that are worthy, but not newsworthy at
this point. Like Stripe, AWS S3, and the plethora of open-source software that
are the buried giants whose shoulders I am standing on while pretending to be in
a mountain that I climbed all by myself.</p>
<p>Economics teaches you about comparative advantage. People in those companies
have the advantage of being smart; I have the advantage of using their service's
free tiers. Not sure I got that economics thing right.</p>
<p>The defining technical characteristic of my application is using good things
with bad names. I built it on a serverless architecture, which is the same as
calling food delivery "kitchenless food". I am using JAMstack, which is an
acronym for static websites or dynamic web apps using a stack with Javascript,
APIs and markup language but not like all those other websites and web apps that
also use Javascript, APIs and markup language in a totally different way. I
would be much happier calling serverless architecture, “Boaty”, and JAMstack,
“McBoatface”.</p>
<p>Still, just like Panama hats from Ecuador, they are great things. They are
powerful ideas, implemented, and popularized by great companies that I am using
to build mine.</p>
<h3>Netlify Build and Netlify Functions</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> is famous for how simple and intuitive it is
to create static sites that have hosting, continuous deployment, and CDN without
any hassle. With Netlify Functions, I can go one step further; I can make my
React site a dynamic application using APIs. Their serverless Functions make
creating an API a breeze; I drop a javascript function in a folder, deploy, and
I have an API.</p>
<p>Serverless is great for its smaller upfront costs (for low traffic, you are
usually still in free tier range) and zero infrastructure management needs.
Pay-as-you-go is a risk if you go too fast, but that’s not something I am
expecting. With Netlify Functions encapsulating the not that simple AWS Lambda
Functions, it has the extra bonus of keeping me away from the AWS Management
Console interface.</p>
<p>I have a fast CRUD app deployed in my domain, with minimal cognitive overhead.</p>
<h3>Fauna</h3>
<p><a href="https://fauna.com/">FaunaDB</a> is a distributed NoSQL database that is very well
suited to plug into serverless applications. NoSQL, with its flexible schema, is
a blessing for building new projects that will change a lot and quickly. I am
not building a typical social network; I am implementing original ideas that
might or might not work, that have changed and will continue to change as my own
ideas evolve and I get users' feedback. The data structure will reflect that. I
am a Javascript developer; I like how javascript notates its objects; it is
easier for me to understand and change a JSON object. It is also the obvious
solution for going serverless.</p>
<p>I have a safe, reliable, and fast database, with minimal cognitive overhead.</p>
<p><em>update: In the first version of this post I was using Userbase as
authentication solution. Since then, I decided to concentrate more on FaunaDB
tech, including their built-in user authentication.</em></p>
<h3>Putting everything to work</h3>
<p>Quid Sentio core entity is the journal entry. An entry can contain text, audio
recorded by the user, an image, a mood number selected from a range from -100 to
100, and custom tags. Each entry can also be shared and commented by friends.
This data looks like this for the user:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-demo-01.png" alt="Text entry screenshot">
<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-demo-02.png" alt="Audio entry screenshot">
<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-demo-03.png" alt="Image entry screenshot">
<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-demo-04.png" alt="Mood entry screenshot">
<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-demo-05.png" alt="Tags entry screenshot">
<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-demo-06.png" alt="Sharing entry screenshot">
<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-demo-07.png" alt="Commenting entry screenshot"></p>
<p>The entry data is pretty suitable for a JSON structure, as I have to fit all of
these, with its inherent grouping, in one database item. Images and audios are
stored at AWS S3, their URLs are stored at the database item too.</p>
<p>Another advantage is that I can -- and I will -- add more types of content that
the user can add to an entry. Audio, image, and custom tags were all added after
I launched the alpha version. I still consider video, maybe stickers, or other
more creative inputs that I learn from my users. The flexibility of adding more
properties to an entry while keeping it backward-compatible comes much more
naturally to NoSQL.</p>
<p>Quid Sentio is also social. The user creates an entry in their journal and can
then choose with whom, among their friends, they want to share it and allow to
comment on it. The user will also view all of their friends’ entries that were
shared with them. Each entry contains its permissions of access and list of
comments.</p>
<p>I keep the user’s list of friends as one of the profile properties that I keep
in a "Users" collection in FaunaDB. After user authentication I can access it
and then I can keep it in the state of my application. It is basically a list of
userIds, so no big deal. The tricky thing is to make the request that returns
only the entries from those friends who are authorized to be seen by the user.</p>
<p>This is where FQL shines. FQL is FaunaDB’s own query language, but I could use
GraphQL (also supported by FaunaDB) with similar results. I can easily create a
query from a Netlify Function that only brings the authorized entries without
the need of writing a lot of code with the logic required to not expose
unauthorized entries to the client. So it ends up being pretty fast and simple
to get the user’s friends’ entries and show this:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/screenshot-friends-entries.png" alt="Text entry screenshot"></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I had many technical obstacles between me and the social network that I wanted
to build. Then modern services started to arrive, one by one, and, with more
ease than expected, I got it done. I create-react-apped an app, deployed with
Netlify, wrote Netlify functions for the basic operations, integrated with
Fauna's NoSQL serverless database, including its built-in user authentication,
inserted a Stripe handled checkout page and voilà. The only thing in front of me
now is my vision. And I have all my cognitive resources preserved to reach it.
Or to be consumed trying to write smart comments on Hacker News. Only time will
tell.</p>

<p>My brain basks in this planning process. It feels so productive, but it involves minimal mental effort.</p>
<p>Time and time again this cycle occurs. When it comes to getting down to real work, the euphoric rush fades. It turns out planning is easy and action is hard.</p>
<p>Before long, my interest dies down and it’s onto the next topic. And so the cycle continues.</p>
<p>This happened until I heard a story of two men learning to fish. The first fisherman heads to the marina and buys the best fishing boat money can buy. He specs out a custom carbon fiber rod and spends thousands on a deep-water GPS. He spends time reading up on different casting, reeling, and baiting techniques. A few months later, he feels ready to fish.</p>
<p>But by the time he casts his first line, the second fisherman has sucked the lake dry. </p>
<p>On day one, the second fisherman grabbed a shitty rod, sliced up a hot dog, and started fishing. Every day he honed his technique, finding bait which worked a little better or a spot that had a few more nibbles. After three weeks of iteration, he found the winning combo.</p>
<p>Before long, he was hauling in hundreds of fish every day. From there he opened a restaurant to sell his fresh fish. And then he opened a fishing school to teach others his craft. All while the first fisherman gathered gear.</p>
<p>The moral of this story?</p>
<p>Get to action as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><strong> When you find yourself gathering gear, grab a shitty rod and start fishing.</strong></p>

				<div>
					<p>Ever tried dealing with a large company, only to get stonewalled? You're talking to a black box that repeats “Sorry, that’s against policy” or “I can’t do that”</p><p>But if you can open up that box the picture changes. The moving pieces become visible. Watch how each one ticks, and you’ll start noticing the systems at play.</p><p>Leaders design incentives to be armor plating for the company, protecting its interests. They work well for the most part, but all plating has seams.</p><p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1162561822248992768">Dangerous Professional</a> finds those seams and slips between them. &nbsp;They'll dodge gatekeepers and dance around policies, doing whatever it takes to get the job done.</p><p>Companies setup divisions with the job of managing all the incoming complaints. You know them as customer service. &nbsp;Depending on whether you’re that <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/doug-rushkoff-hello-etsy">company’s customer or their product</a>, customer service’s role varies from “keep them happy with minimal effort” to “get these people off our backs.” They’re the ones companies want you to contact.</p><p>When customer service isn’t being that helpful, look for someone else to complain to. Like the CEO.</p><p>Jeff Bezos is famous for reading all customer emails sent directly to him. When a complaint lands in his inbox he forwards it to one of his reports with just a question mark added: ‘?’. Whenever anyone gets this email <a href="https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/5-years-later-jeff-bezos-just-confirmed-jeff-bezos-question-mark-method-that-scares-heck-out-of-everyone-at-amazon-heres-how-it-works.html">they drop everything and scramble</a> to solve that customer’s problem. The customer service department doesn’t have that kind of clout.</p><p>I witnessed this at Microsoft. The VP got a complaint and forwarded it down to his direct report.</p><p>Which got forwarded down again. And again. And again. Each level adding one more manager’s weight. Propelling it faster and faster and faster till it smashed into my team’s inbox at critical velocity. All hands on deck!</p><p>Why did &nbsp;this work? Look at what’s happening behind the scenes. Your message went to someone with just enough time to say "This might be important, I’ll delegate it to the relevant team." And it gets fast tracked through the chain of command</p><p>A funny bit of management psychology comes into play here: If your boss’s boss’s boss tells you to “look into this please,” it jumps to top of your priority list. Usually folks don’t bother to ask if it should be prioritized higher or lower than the large pile already on their plate.</p><p>Achievement unlocked: Teleport to front of line.</p><p>Many businesses have departments tasked with nothing but creating rules other departments must follow. Some of those rules get really weird:</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m continuously amazed by how many people have to ask permission to buy a $50 book, yet are empowered to call a meeting that costs tens of thousands of dollars.</p>— HydroxyCoreyQuinn (@QuinnyPig) <a href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1103868678389420033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 8, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>Once I was going on a business trip to help with a conference. My company had instituted a hotel budget of $250 per day. But this was a BIG conference. Hotel prices were jacked up, and only the sketchiest places met that price point.</p><p>The cheaper hotels were 30 minutes away, but then I’d blow the budget for uber rides. I asked if I'd have to cancel my conference trip.</p><p>Manager: “There’s not actually an uber limit”</p><p>Oh.</p><p>I booked that distant hotel and took an uber everyday. Now here’s the kicker: the hotel + uber cost <em>more </em>than what I would have paid if I had gotten a hotel walking distance from the venue. But that’s too complicated for the finance department to write formal rules around. Imagine if they prevented people from getting a ride when it was <em>really </em>needed!</p><p>Thus the current policy was born.</p><p>It gets better. When you see the policy’s red lines drawn out, you can walk around them like Danny Ocean’s crew navigating a laser maze. </p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mr834Cs9ncs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Good sales reps know this and use it to push deals through. Patrick McKenzie <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1284404823572410369">offers an example</a>:</p><p><em>"Suppose you are selling a $100k product to a director who has $100k budgeted for it. You do the dance. Purchasing says they need a 10% discount because We're Big Enough To Always Demand One.</em></p><p><em>Three days later you submit the following: $100k invoice, discounted 10%, for 1 year of SaaS services. Comes out of software budget. $12k invoice, discounted 10%, for 1 year commitment to professional services. Comes out of consulting budget.</em></p><p><em>Purchasing is *extremely* likely to approve this."</em></p><p>Did the company hire people who couldn’t do basic math? Of course not.</p><p>They pay people who know <em>where their time will be most valuable</em>. Writing a policy that covers 95% of situations will take them 10 hours and saves the companies $XX millions of dollars. Writing policies to cover the remaining 5% will take ten times as long and only offer a tiny fraction of the savings. The cost/benefit analysis doesn’t work out.</p><p>If you learn what was left in that missing 5% you'll have the advantage.</p><p>Remember there is no “company.” All of the company’s decisions are actually individuals acting within their own set of incentives. The “company” is what emerges when those individual incentives interact with each other.</p><p>You don’t have to fight the entire company.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/07/there-is-no-spoon.png" alt=""><figcaption>There is no company</figcaption></figure><p>Hidden incentives exist in your own company too. Is a team resisting doing something you’re asking for? Learn why. Find the fulcrum point. New paths will emerge.</p><p>For example, I used to struggle with people not responding to my emails when I tried to get their approval on a change I was making. “People are busy,” my manager explained. “Instead say, ‘I’ll be making this change on Thursday unless you object before then.’” </p><p>I started doing that.</p><p>The objections were rare. The complaints, non-existent.</p><div><p>You get the best results when you adapt your approach to the person you’re facing</p><p>Now replace "person" with "team" or "department"</p><p>The sentence remains true</p></div><p>Figuring out each team's incentives can <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/whats-it-like-as-a-senior-engineer#research-like-a-detective">take some detective work</a>. But once you understand them you’ll learn what makes each group tick. As you get better at this you’ll find yourself able to collaborate with others much more effectively and Get Stuff Done.</p>

"""

Chaos theory is a branch of mathematics focusing on the study of chaos—states of dynamical systems whose apparently-random states of disorder and irregularities are often governed by deterministic laws that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. Chaos theory is an interdisciplinary theory stating that, within the apparent randomness of chaotic complex systems, there are underlying patterns, interconnectedness, constant feedback loops, repetition, self-similarity, fractals, and self-organization. The butterfly effect, an underlying principle of chaos, describes how a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state (meaning that there is sensitive dependence on initial conditions). A metaphor for this behavior is that a butterfly flapping its wings in China can cause a hurricane in Texas.

Small differences in initial conditions, such as those due to errors in measurements or due to rounding errors in numerical computation, can yield widely diverging outcomes for such dynamical systems, rendering long-term prediction of their behavior impossible in general. This can happen even though these systems are deterministic, meaning that their future behavior follows a unique evolution and is fully determined by their initial conditions, with no random elements involved. In other words, the deterministic nature of these systems does not make them predictable. This behavior is known as deterministic chaos, or simply chaos. The theory was summarized by Edward Lorenz as:

"Chaos: When the present determines the future, but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future."

Chaotic behavior exists in many natural systems, including fluid flow, heartbeat irregularities, weather and climate. It also occurs spontaneously in some systems with artificial components, such as the stock market and road traffic. This behavior can be studied through the analysis of a chaotic mathematical model, or through analytical techniques such as recurrence plots and Poincaré maps. Chaos theory has applications in a variety of disciplines, including meteorology, anthropology, sociology, physics, environmental science, computer science, engineering, economics, biology, ecology, pandemic crisis management, and philosophy. The theory formed the basis for such fields of study as complex dynamical systems, edge of chaos theory, and self-assembly processes.

<p>It must have been about a year ago, just after I moved from San Francisco here to New York. I was having steaks with my good friend and soon to be business partner, Kyle. Kyle and I transferred to Vanderbilt at the same time, were placed a few doors down from each other in an awful, mold-ridden dorm which we would both soon move out of (and which was knocked down by the time we graduated), and spent our first night on campus drinking whiskey together with another future friend of ours. Over the next few years, Kyle and I hung out a lot, studied together often and discussed a lot of business and investing ideas while procrastinating from said studies. This past year, a few months after the aforementioned dinner, we bought in 50/50 on a real estate investment, a multi-family duplex in his hometown of Lexington, Kentucky. I never imagined that I would become a Kentucky homeowner, but because of Kyle, now I am. Our investment is going very well so far and I am confident that Kyle and I will be doing a lot more together in the future, real estate or otherwise.</p>



<p>Going back to that dinner, over my ribeye and glass of wine and his filet and Coca-Cola, Kyle and I discussed where each of us were and where we wanted to be headed, in terms of our careers mostly as the majority time consumers of our lives in general. I was working as many hours as ever in investment banking and he had recently moved on from banking and into equity research. In discussing his decision to make the transition, he made a somewhat obvious point that I think tends to get overlooked and underestimated nonetheless, which is why I am choosing to write about it today. That is, he pointed out that we should be thinking about the value of our time in terms of hours rather than years.</p>



<p>Most career-oriented jobs advertise salary to their prospective applicants. I used to think of my income in investment banking as a combination of salary and bonus because the latter comprises an unusually large percentage of most people’s overall annual income in the industry (i.e. the end of year bonuses are often more or less equal to annual salaries for top performers).</p>



<p>After Kyle’s comment, I started to think about income more often in terms of dollars per hour. Think about the following hypothetical. All other things equal, would you rather work 80 hours per week for $100,000 or 40 hours per week for $75,000? The former pays $24 / hour and the latter pays $36 / hour. Most logical people would opt for the latter as the difference in the hourly rate is just too great. The decision would be more difficult however if the 40 hours per week job only paid $60,000. In that case, the income per hour of the 40 hours per week job ($29) would still be greater than that of the 80 hours per week job ($24), but the larger difference in annual salary becomes a bit more difficult of a pill to swallow ($100,000 – $60,000 = $40,000). I am not advocating for choosing one job over the other, even in this idealistic situation where everything else was somehow exactly equal, which of course in real life it would never be. I am simply advocating for people to more deliberately consider the time they expect to give in exchange for a salary when considering an offer.</p>



<p>Further on the hypothetical situation above, even if you were to take the 40 hour per week job at a salary of $75,000 and you are one of the increasingly popular breed of millennials who wants to work 80 hours per week still, that is totally fine. You can spend your time working on things that you are interested in and passionate about, invest your time in learning new skills and/or subjects, or if short-term income is your primary focus, get another part-time job or create your own side hustle for evenings and/or weekends. If you make more than $12 / hour for 40 additional hours of work, you would make more annually than the 80 hour per week job that paid $100,000.&nbsp; For comparison’s sake, the much debated minimum wage for food service workers in New York City is $15 / hour…</p>



<p>Moreover, as with most other things, when it comes to your free time, or disposable time as I prefer to call it, scarcity increases value. The less disposable time you have, the more precious it becomes, the more valuable it becomes. Think about it in extremes. If you had no disposable time (free time to do with what you wish), you would not be able to sleep at your own discretion (this is unfortunately a reality for some people who work long hour jobs or multiple jobs including night shifts). As such, most people would demand more money in exchange for working their 16<sup>th</sup>, 17<sup>th</sup>, and 18<sup>th</sup> hour of the day than the 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, and 6<sup>th</sup>. They probably have at least six hours set aside to work anyway and will take what they can get in terms of income in exchange for that time. The 16<sup>th</sup>, 17<sup>th</sup>, and 18<sup>th</sup> hours on the other hand cut into the human necessity of sleep and for that reason they are very valuable. The same goes for the less extreme hours in between. There must be a gradual increase in the value of every hour between those two ranges of hours. The less disposable time you have, the more important are the things you have to cut for work such as time for meals with family or friends, time to go to the gym, time to read a book or watch TV, and time to just relax or enjoy your weekends.</p>



<p>Of course, this point about considering income per hour rather than annual salary cannot be considered in a vacuum because there are a host of other related factors that are also important in making decisions around what to do for money. For example, if the day to day composition of your work includes a number of tasks, practices and activities that you like or even love doing or that you might be doing anyway if you had the freedom to choose what to do with your time, then you should be willing to accept less income in exchange for your time because there is less of a difference in the enjoyment or utility of what you have to do for that income versus what you might otherwise be doing.</p>



<p>Once in a while you hear people who love their jobs say things like “I feel like I have never worked a day in my life” or “If money was not a thing, I would be doing exactly the same work that I am doing now”. Those people are mostly outliers and exceptions for now, but the optimist in me convinces the pragmatist that one day in the not too distant future it will become much more common as more menial tasks become automated and some form(s) of universal basic income increasingly provides people with more disposable income/time to live their lives as they please. In the meantime, most of us will continue to feel that we have to make some sort of trade off involving time for money. I suggest that we think about that trade-off in terms of hours as opposed to years. Forget salary.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>At the beginning of this year, I decided it was finally time to port my website from a <span>PHP</span>-based <span>CMS</span><sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> to a JavaScript-based Static Site Generator (<span>SSG</span>). This was for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>After starting out as a ‘full-stack’ developer, I now work solely on the front end: If I need to write custom functionality, I don’t want to write it in <span>PHP</span> when I could be writing it in JavaScript.</li>
<li>I don't need the layers of abstraction or the complexity of a <span>CMS</span> — markdown files are where I'm most comfortable writing content and I’d be happy never to touch a My<span>SQL</span> database or <span>wysiwyg</span> editor again.</li>
<li>I want to improve my site’s performance: static <span>HTML</span> files are, 99 times out of 100, going to be faster than pages built on the fly.</li>
<li>Lastly, there’s the cost benefit: A <span>LAMP</span> stack<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> server costs money every month; Netlify’s free tier (300 build minutes/month) should comfortably cover a personal blog at zero cost.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once I'd decided I want a Static Site Generator and it needed to use JavaScript (which ruled out <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>), I narrowed the list down to two very different contenders:</p>
<h2>“I heard Gatsby was good”</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">the official site</a>, “Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps”. It has a data layer powered by GraphQL and it outputs everything to static files, allowing you to host it pretty much anywhere.</p>
<p>When I first heard that I could write React and use this cool new GraphQL thing, while still outputting static pages that work without JavaScript, I was keen to give it a try. <em>‘This sounds like Progressive Enhancement but without the effort’</em> I thought. Unfortunately, as with most things that sound too good to be true, after some investigation, there turned out to be a catch. Here's what happens the first time a user visits a Gatsby site:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user requests a page</li>
<li>The server sends the statically-generated <span>HTML</span> document to the user’s browser and the browser starts rendering the page.</li>
<li>Now that the <span>HTML</span> document has arrived, the JavaScript bundle (including the React library and any other JavaScript required to render the page) begins downloading, parsing and compiling in the background</li>
<li>The JavaScript is ready to run — the whole <span>DOM</span> gets “hydrated”<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> with React components</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s something not quite right here — Gatsby forces you to load the same page again, but as React components; until that extra step is complete, none of the elements that require JavaScript (e.g. buttons, menus, custom inputs) are actually interactive.</p>
<p>If your site doesn’t have any interactive elements (excluding links, they work without JavaScript, even in Gatsby), your users still have to download this JavaScript anyway, for the sole purpose of turning your site into a Single-Page Application (<span>SPA</span>), which has its own drawbacks as we'll soon discover.</p>
<p>This extra bloat seems to go against one of the main reasons for moving to a <span>SSG</span>: making pages faster. Your flashy Gatsby site might be fast on a $2,000 MacBook, but for someone using a budget smartphone on a 3G connection, it's visible yet unresponsive, for 15 seconds while the user waits for the JavaScript to load. It’s also unnecessarily draining their battery <em>and</em> data allowance.</p>
<p>If the browser needs to parse 296kb of JavaScript<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> to show a list of blog posts, that’s not Progressive Enhancement, it’s using the wrong tool for the job. To use the rather fuzzy website/web app distinction — React is for building web apps: interactive UIs that need to respond to user input or fetch data in real time — your blog is just a website <em>and that’s fine</em>.</p>
<h2>Accessibility in single-page applications</h2>
<p>A single-page application is a website that forgoes the traditional method of navigation on the web, i.e. loading new content by loading a new <span>HTML</span> document; instead it uses JavaScript features like <span>AJAX</span> and the History <span>API</span> to swap in new content without triggering a page load. The goal is to increase perceived performance and make the website feel more like a 'native' app (something you’d download from an app store). The problem with getting rid of full-page reloads is that browsers and assistive technology use page loads as a signal to trigger certain useful behaviours, including announcing the title of the new page or resetting keyboard focus to the beginning of the document.</p>
<p>If you’re an accessibility-conscious developer building a single-page application, you may try to emulate the browser’s behaviour using JavaScript. Gatsby attempts to handle this for you by including a <code>RouteAnnouncer</code> component. This uses an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions"><span>ARIA</span> live region</a> to announce the <code>title</code> or <code>h1</code> of the page, alerting users of screenreader software to navigation changes. This approach, however, is not without its problems: there are still outstanding issues around <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/21059">configuration</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/20801">localisation</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve seen that the Single-page applications have inherent accessibility issues around navigation, but it’s worth bearing in mind that using a front-end framework can make other aspects of accessibility harder too. In a February 2020 survey of one million homepages, WebAIM found that those using React had 5.7% more accessibility errors than average; while those using Vue had 25% more<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup>. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the frameworks caused these errors, but there’s a strong correlation between more JavaScript and worse accessibility.</p>
<h2>Does a blog even need JavaScript?</h2>
<p>Chances are, the first webpage your ever built performed far better than some of the pages you've built since — it consisted of an <span>HTML</span> file and some <span>CSS</span>; maybe it had a few unoptimised images but they didn’t stop the page from loading. If you're anything like me, the moment you started adding JavaScript was the moment the performance of your webpage took a nosedive. Not all bytes are made equal: an image is going to take far less time to decode and render to the screen than the equivalently sized JavaScript file would take to parse, compile, and execute<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>JavaScript is a powerful language that can do some incredible things, but it’s incredibly easy to jump to using it too early in development, when you could be using <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span> instead. Consider the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html">rule of least power</a>: Don’t use the more powerful language (JavaScript) until you’ve exhausted the capabilities of less powerful languages (<span>HTML</span>). To me, it feels that turning a blog into a JavaScript Single-page application is introducing unnecessary complexity.</p>
<p>I don't want this post to come across as a specific attack on Gatsby. There are some clever people behind it, who’ve acknowledged many of the issues mentioned in this article and are trying to solve them. A statically rendered and hydrated page is still infinitely better than a fully client-side rendered React app (like those generated by <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">create-react-app</a>) which is useless without JavaScript. I do have issues with the way that its JavaScript-heavy, Single page app approach is advertised, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-01-30-why-gatsby-is-better-with-javascript/">including in Gatsby’s own marketing</a>, as appropriate for any kind of website. Client-side JavaScript has a cost and developers should be aware of it.</p>
<h2>Building a Gatsby site with less JavaScript</h2>
<p>This brings me to a dilemma: developing sites with Gatsby is an all-round great experience; but Developer Experience (DX) should always be secondary to User Experience (UX) — how do I build a Gatsby site without the issues inherent in Gatsby’s JavaScript heavy approach? By removing as much of it as possible, of course. Fortunately, there are some fantastic efforts going on within the Gatsby community to build faster, more lightweight sites:</p>
<p>Firstly, you could save a few kilobytes by swapping React for Preact, with <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-preact/">gatsby-plugin-preact</a>. I use this on <a href="https://component.gallery/">the Component Gallery</a> and it works seamlessly, instantly knocking ~30kb off the JavaScript payload.</p>
<p>If you want to take a more drastic approach, there's a <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-no-javascript/">plugin which removes <em>all</em> the Gatsby JavaScript from your Gatsby site</a>. Now we’re getting somewhere! You can continue to write react components and GraphQL, even use a CSS-in-JS library (as long as it outputs CSS or inline styles), <em>without</em> sending any JavaScript to the browser. Most of the problems with Gatsby can be solved by throwing out all of its client side JavaScript. <a href="https://gatsby-starter-low-tech-blog.netlify.com/low-tech/">Gatsby Starter Low Tech Blog</a> uses the no-javascript plugin, as well as some other techniques including converting all images to greyscale, to help you create an incredibly lightweight and energy-efficient blog.</p>
<h2>Starting from scratch with Eleventy</h2>
<p>At this point I felt like something was wrong — using a framework that heavily pushes client-side JavaScript, but removing all of that JavaScript seemed like a pretty convoluted way to build a website. I wanted to see whether I could build a fully-featured blog with zero client-side JavaScript and instead of using a plugin to remove it, I wasn’t going to add it in the first place. This is where my other contender comes in:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> encourages you to build your site how you want to. You use the technology you're most comfortable with and it sticks to generating your pages. Eleventy gives you the option of mixing and matching ten different templating languages, including markdown, nunjucks, and liquid; this meant I could copy and paste my old twig templates from Craft, change the file extension, and with some minor tweaks have them running in Eleventy. Instead of adapting my front-end build process to a new bundler I could just drop in my existing webpack file and <code>src</code> folder. Using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently">concurrently</a> package I can run my build script at the same time as Eleventy’s <code>serve</code> process.</p>
<p>Like Gatsby, Eleventy also has an ecosystem of plugins (which is small, but rapidly growing). I’ve picked out a few that I've used which have enabled me to add features without adding client-side JavaScript:</p>
<p>When displaying code snippets in a post, it’s common to include language-specific syntax highlighting. There are a few JavaScript libraries out there that can do it, the most popular of which seems to be <a href="https://prismjs.com/">Prism</a> — normally you’d run this in the client, but because …</p></div></div>

Rankin says that if MacBook owners follow Apple’s advisory, they will lose control over their security.</p><p>“The fundamental flaw with Apple’s approach is that it takes all control over security and privacy away from you. To be secure you must fully trust Apple and their security measures and if anything ever happens to violate that trust, such as a security exploit, there isn’t much you can do about it,” Rankin adds.</p><p>Rankin says that Purism believes in totally opposite concept for providing security to users. While Purism offers users <strong>Kill Switches</strong> to kill their microphone, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, webcam, etc. and be in control, Apple wants to be the sole security custodian for such services. “Apple and Purism take completely different approaches to security. Apple’s approach is to require customers to hand over all trust and control to Apple and depend upon Apple for all of their security. Purism’s approach is to give customers control over their own computers and provide security without depending upon Purism. Webcam security is a great lens through which to view these completely opposite approaches,” Rankin adds, “In the end, your privacy and your computer should belong to you, not the vendor that sold it.”</p><p>Purism is a Linux hardware maker and sells Linux smartphones, tablets, and laptops under the Librem brand. All Librem devices are designed to protect privacy and freedom by avoiding the Intel Active Management Technology. All Librem laptops feature hardware kill switches for the microphone, webcam, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><tr><td>
	<div>
	<p>It's worth discussing <em>how</em> all this works so you understand the 
	challenges that are being overcome here. The ability to run multiple DOS 
	programs at once is a pretty neat trick, given that this software heralds 
	from an era of computing that was <em>just barely</em> ahead of what the 
	Apple ][ was doing in 1978. If you want to skip this, <a href="#Windows_1.0">go ahead</a>.</p>
	<p>The root of the problem is that the IBM PCs basic architecture 
	crystallized a very long time ago, in 1981. In a world where ten kilobytes of RAM counted for 
	about what a gig does now, there was not a lot of room for "overhead" and 
	the idea that you would run two programs simultaneously was generally 
	unrealistic except at the high end of the computing world, which most PC 
	buyers were nowhere near. You needed every bit (<em>ha</em>) of memory you could get, and when 
	memory became more affordable a few years later, it was too late 
	to change anything.</p>
	<p>After just a couple years on the market, MS-DOS had become the 
	unquestioned OS of choice for the PC<a href="#footnote1">*</a> 
	and developed a monumental stable of software, every bit of which<em> </em>
	was essential to someone, somewhere, and could not be easily replaced. Thus 
	began one of the longest tails in technology history, as the PC industry and 
	Microsoft began contorting themselves to try not to 
	break compatibility with old software while still moving forward with advanced 
	functionality.<br>
	<sub><a name="footnote1">*</a>(specifically, since there were MS-DOSes for 
	other architectures, and other OSes for the PC)</sub></p>
	<p>Because DOS was developed under constraints very similar to those 
	in the 
	late '70s that gave us the "bitty boxes" (C64, Apple ][, ZX 
	Spectrum, etc.) it was not built with any kind of "supervision" in mind. In 
	other words, there was no abstraction level above the current running program. 
	DOS was more like a set of tools than what we think 
	of as an operating system now - specifically, it had no "process management"; no concept of "processes" at all, in fact.</p>
	<h2><strong>DOS</strong></h2>
	<p>When the machine booted, the part of DOS that was considered "the OS" - 
	the code for accessing disk drives, writing text to screen, etc. - was copied 
	into memory, and then execution was handed off to the command interpreter, COMMAND.COM, 
	which was an application like any other, at which point you could begin 
	entering commands to use the computer.</p>
		<p>At this point, DOS was no longer "running" in 
	any meaningful way. The code was "resident," meaning it was present in the 
		computer's memory, but 
	the processor wasn't&nbsp; executing any of it. Instead, the CPU was busy executing 
	whatever the current program was - if you were at the command prompt, then 
		all the code the PC was executing was part of COMMAND.COM. When you launched another application, COMMAND.COM was 
	vacated and replaced by that other application.</p>
	<p>In other words, while an application was running, DOS was almost totally out of 
	the picture. The only time execution returned to DOS itself was when the 
	application requested a "service" from DOS, like accessing a disk drive, at 
	which point it would tell the CPU to go execute one of DOS' stored routines 
	for this, and when that routine was done, control would return to the 
	application. This meant that,<em> generally speaking</em>,<em> </em>the current 
	program 
	had absolute control of the PCs execution and it's memory. It could in fact choose to 
	overwrite DOS itself, obliterating it out of memory, and DOS couldn't do a damn thing about it.</p>
	<p>The currently running app also had the option to speak directly to hardware. 
	The 
	whole purpose of DOS was to abstract things like that so programs wouldn't 
	need to know the details of the system they were running on, but since the 
	IBM PC was <em>extremely</em> consistent hardware-wise in its early 
	incarnations, it was entirely 
	optional for developers to take advantage of that, and often 
	there were reasons - of performance, perhaps - to bypass DOS and do things 
	directly.</p>
		<p>DOS provided disk access routines, 
	but the app could blow right by them and shoot commands straight to the 
	floppy drive if it wanted. DOS provided routines for printing text and clearing the 
	screen, but the app could just write directly to video memory. I can't speak to how common this kind of behavior actually was, but it 
	certainly wasn't rare, and it speaks to a larger problem - DOS apps simply 
	expect total control over the system.</p>
		<p>If you run two DOS apps at once, they're 
	going to stomp on each other, because each one thinks it's in charge of the 
		whole machine. The first one would store data in the same spot that the 
		second one stored program code, and thus one would overwrite the other 
		and crash it. So DOS was a single-tasking operating system - you could 
		run one program at a time, and when you wanted to run another, you had 
		to exit, return to the command prompt, and then launch your other app.</p>
		<p>Consequently, if you were working on something 
	in Microsoft Multiplan and wanted to go look up some data in dBase, you had to quit completely 
	out of Multiplan and then start dBase, which would take over the system and totally 
	overwrite the previous app. To get back to where you were you'd have to exit 
		dBase, restart Multiplan, load your document and find your place again - 
		in the process, totally forgetting what you were there to do in the 
		first place, because it's so many steps and takes so long.</p>
	<p>Right from the get-go, PC users wanted to be able to look at one program, then rapidly 
	switch to another. On its face this seems to mean "run two programs at once," 
	which is what we do now, but that's not quite the full story. Let's touch on how 
	that works nowadays, however.</p>
	<h2><strong>Multiprocessing</strong></h2>
	<p>To be clear, you <em>cannot</em> run two programs "at once" on a 
	computer. Some would call this semantics, but it's important in a very real 
	way, <em>especially</em> when talking about 80s-era PCs.</p>
		<p>Modern multicore CPUs get very close to true parallel processing by 
		letting separate programs run on separate cores, but of course, nobody has a CPU so big 
	that they have one core per process. And even if you did, programs still 
		have to share other 
	resources - the system bus, hard drives, and so on. Access to these 
	resources has to be carefully managed so that only one application can use 
		them at a time, and each one has to be cleaned up after before another 
		one can use the same resources. Otherwise, one program could leave the 
		hardware in a state where the commands that the next program sends put 
		it in an unusable state and crash the machine, or corrupt data.</p>
	<p>Even with all our modern pipelined cleverness, you have the 
	fundamental problem that a CPU, and a computer in general, has a limited 
	amount of physical hardware and can't dedicate some to each individual 
	program that's running. When you have more processes running than you have silicon, the only option left is to share 
	resources by dividing up the amount of time that each process gets to use the hardware 
	- this is one of the oldest concepts in computing, and goes back to the late '50s.</p>
	<p>The fundamentals of this process are simple: At 
	any given moment, one program has near-total control of the entire 
	system, to execute its code and use all the resources, and then after it 
	executes for a bit, it goes into a paused state and control is handed off to 
	the next program, which does its work and then hands off to the next. This 
	continues in a round-robin fashion, so that every program gets to use the 
	hardware for a certain portion of every second.</p>
	<p>Modern implementations take this to a fever pitch with all the complex 
	machinations used to make this process efficient, but the fundamentals have 
	never changed; this is how your PC is operating right now.</p>
	<p>One big hurdle to overcome in implementing this is that programs don't just execute 
	instructions in a vacuum. As code is executed, there are side 
	effects. Some are values internal to the CPU, like the&nbsp; status of CPU registers and the current 
	position of the instruction pointer. This is called "CPU state," amd is specific to 
	each running program. When you switch from one program to another, you have to 
	save that information - called "context switching" - and restore it when you 
	come back. Storing this info takes extra time and memory.</p>
		<p>Another hurdle is the state of other hardware. If two programs are 
		talking to the hard drive, you can't let them both just blindly issue 
		commands every time they get control of the CPU. The first process might 
		start a data read that the second process interrupts with a data write, 
		confusing the hard drive controller. So when switching from one process 
		to another, you also have to save the state of these other hardware 
		resources - and possibly even delay switching tasks until those hardware 
		requests are complete.</p>
	<p>If you have enough RAM to store this state, and if your apps don't need too many cycles per second to appear responsive, you can do all this and the user 
	will feel like they're "running multiple programs at 
	once."</p>
	<p>Now, in business applications - the 
	driving force behind the first couple decades of computing - actual 
	"multiprocessing" of this type is not as important as simple usability - users 
	just don't want to have to close one program in order to open another, as they 
	did throughout the DOS days. That, ultimately, is the goal: it 
	doesn't matter if the computer is perfectly speedy, or if programs can run 
	simultaneously, it just matters that 
	users not have to lose all their work in one program simply in order to look 
	at another.</p>
	<h2>Multitasking</h2>
	<p>This desire was of course tremendous right from the start of computing. Who wants to 
	be stuck in one program at a time? So, almost from the 
	earliest days of the IBM PC, software was created to enable task switching 
	with various degrees of success.</p>

July 25, 2020 | https://ui.dev/webpack/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ui.dev/webpack/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lFjinlwpcHY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""> </iframe> </p>
<p>Whenever you’re learning a new tool, you should first ask yourself two questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Why does this tool exist?</li>
<li>What problems does this tool solve?</li>
</ol>
<p>If you can’t answer both of those questions, you may not need the tool in the first place. Let’s take those questions and apply them to webpack.</p>
<h3>Why does Webpack exist?</h3>
<p>At its core, webpack is a module bundler. It examines all of the <a href="https://ui.dev/javascript-modules-iifes-commonjs-esmodules/">modules</a> in your application, creates a dependency graph, then intelligently puts all of them together into one or more bundle(s) that your <code>index.html</code> file can reference.</p>
<div data-language="md"><pre><code>App.js ---&gt;     |         |
Dashboard.js -&gt; | Bundler | -&gt; bundle.js
About.js ---&gt;   |         |</code></pre></div>
<h3>What problem is webpack solving?</h3>
<p>Historically when building a JavaScript application, your JavaScript code would be separated by files (these files may or may not have been actual modules). Then in your <code>index.html</code> file, you’d have to include <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags to every JavaScript file you had.</p>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>body</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

  ...

  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>libs/react.min.js<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>'</span>src/admin.js<span>'</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>'</span>src/dashboard.js<span>'</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>'</span>src/api.js<span>'</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>'</span>src/auth.js<span>'</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>'</span>src/rickastley.js<span>'</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>body</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Not only was this tedious, but it was also error-prone. There were the obvious issues like typos or forgetting to include a file, but more than that, the order of the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags mattered. If you loaded a script that depended on React before loading the React script, things would break. Because webpack (intelligently) creates a bundle for you, both of those problems go away. You don’t have to worry about forgetting a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> and you don’t have to worry about the order.</p>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>body</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

  ...

  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>'</span>dist/bundle.js<span>'</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>body</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>As we’ll soon see, the “module bundling” aspect is just one part of webpack. If needed, you’re also able to tell webpack to make certain transformations on your modules before adding them to the bundle. Examples might include transforming SASS/LESS to regular CSS or “modern JavaScript” to ES5 that the browser can understand.</p>
<h3>Installing webpack</h3>
<p>Assuming you’ve initialized a new project with npm, there are two packages you need to install to use webpack, <code>webpack</code> and <code>webpack-cli</code>.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>npm</span> <span>install</span> webpack webpack-cli --save-dev</code></pre></div>
<h3>webpack.config.js</h3>
<p>Once you’ve installed <code>webpack</code> and <code>webpack-cli</code>, it’s time to start configuring webpack. To do that, you’ll create a <code>webpack.config.js</code> file that exports an object. Naturally, this object is where all the configuration settings for webpack will go.</p>

<p>Remember, the whole point of webpack is to “examine all of your modules, (optionally) transform them, then intelligently put all of them together into one or more bundle(s)” If you think about that process, in order to do that, webpack needs to know three things.</p>
<ol>
<li>The entry point of your application</li>
<li>Which transformations, if any, to make on your code</li>
<li>The location to put the newly formed bundle(s)</li>
</ol>
<h4>The entry point</h4>
<p>Whenever your application is composed of modules, there’s always a single module that is the entry point of your application. It’s the module that kicks everything off. Typically, it’s an <code>index.js</code> file. Something like this.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>index<span>.</span>js
  imports about<span>.</span>js
  imports dashboard<span>.</span>js
    imports graph<span>.</span>js
    imports auth<span>.</span>js
      imports api<span>.</span>js</code></pre></div>
<p>If we give webpack the path to this entry file, it’ll use that to create the dependency graph of our application (much like we did above, except… better). To do that, you add an <code>entry</code> property to your webpack config which points to your entry file.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  entry<span>:</span> <span>'./app/index.js'</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h4>Transformations with Loaders</h4>
<p>Now that webpack knows the entry file, the next thing we need to tell it is what transformations to run on our code. To do this, we’ll use what are called “loaders”.</p>
<p>Out of the box, when webpack is building its dependency graph by examining all of your <code>import</code>/<code>require()</code> statements, it’s only able to process JavaScript and JSON files.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>import</span> auth <span>from</span> <span>'./api/auth'</span> 
<span>import</span> config <span>from</span> <span>'./utils/config.json'</span> 
<span>import</span> <span>'./styles.css'</span> 
<span>import</span> logo <span>from</span> <span>'./assets/logo.svg'</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>There’s a very good chance that you’re going to want your dependency tree to be made up of more than just JS and JSON files - i.e., you’re going to want to be able to import <code>.css</code> files, <code>.svg</code> files, images, etc, as we’re doing above. This is where “loaders” can help us out. The primary purpose of a loader, as the name suggests, is to give webpack the ability to process more than just JavaScript and JSON files.</p>
<p>The first step to adding any loader is to download it. Because we want to add the ability to <code>import</code> <code>.svg</code> files in our app, we’ll download the <code>svg-inline-loader</code> from npm.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>npm</span> <span>install</span> svg-inline-loader --save-dev</code></pre></div>
<p>Next, we need to add it to our webpack config. All of the information for your loaders will go into an array of objects under <code>module.rules</code>.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  entry<span>:</span> <span>'./app/index.js'</span><span>,</span>
  module<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    rules<span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now there are two pieces of information we need to give webpack about each loader. First, the type of file we want to run the loader on (in our case, all <code>.svg</code> files). Second, the loader to use on that file type (in our case, <code>svg-inline-loader</code>).</p>
<p>To do this, we’ll have an object with two properties, <code>test</code> and <code>use</code>. <code>test</code> will be a regex to match the file path and <code>use</code> will be the name of the loader we want to use.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  entry<span>:</span> <span>'./app/index.js'</span><span>,</span>
  module<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    rules<span>:</span> <span>[</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.svg$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'svg-inline-loader'</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now anywhere in our app, we’ll be able to import <code>.svg</code> files. What about our <code>.css</code> files though? Let’s add a loader for that as well. We’ll use the <code>css-loader</code>.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>npm</span> <span>install</span> css-loader --save-dev</code></pre></div>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  entry<span>:</span> <span>'./app/index.js'</span><span>,</span>
  module<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    rules<span>:</span> <span>[</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.svg$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'svg-inline-loader'</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.css$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'css-loader'</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now anywhere in our app, we can import <code>.svg</code> and <code>.css</code> files. However, there’s still one more loader we need to add to get our styles to work properly. Right now, because of our <code>css-loader</code>, we’re able to <code>import</code> <code>.css</code> files. However, that doesn’t mean those styles are being injected into the DOM. What we really want to do is <code>import</code> a CSS file then have webpack put all of that CSS in a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag in the DOM so they’re active on the page. To do that, we’ll use the <code>style-loader</code>.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>npm</span> <span>install</span> style-loader --save-dev</code></pre></div>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  entry<span>:</span> <span>'./app/index.js'</span><span>,</span>
  module<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    rules<span>:</span> <span>[</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.svg$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'svg-inline-loader'</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.css$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>[</span> <span>'style-loader'</span><span>,</span> <span>'css-loader'</span> <span>]</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Notice, because we now have two loaders for our <code>.css</code> rule, we change <code>use</code> to be an array. Also, notice that we have <code>style-loader</code> before <code>css-loader</code>. This is important. Webpack will process those in reverse order. So <code>css-loader</code> will interpret the <code>import './styles.css'</code> line then <code>style-loader</code> will inject that CSS into the DOM.</p>
<hr>
<p>As we just saw with <code>style-loader</code>, loaders can do more than just allow you to <code>import</code> certain file types. They’re also able to run transformations on files before they get added to the final output bundle. The most popular is transforming “next generation JavaScript” to the JavaScript of today that browsers can understand using <a href="https://babeljs.io/" rel="nofollow">Babel</a>. To do this, you can use the <code>babel-loader</code> on every <code>.js</code> file.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>npm</span> <span>install</span> babel-loader --save-dev</code></pre></div>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  entry<span>:</span> <span>'./app/index.js'</span><span>,</span>
  module<span>:</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<hr>
<p>There are loaders for just about anything you’d need to do. You can check out the <a href="https://webpack.js.org/loaders/" rel="nofollow">full list here</a>.</p>
<h4>The output</h4>
<p>Now that webpack knows the entry file and what loaders to use, the next thing we need to tell it is where to put the bundle it creates. To do this, you add an <code>output</code> property to your webpack config.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

<span>const</span> path <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'path'</span><span>)</span>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  entry<span>:</span> <span>'./app/index.js'</span><span>,</span>
  module<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    rules<span>:</span> <span>[</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.svg$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'svg-inline-loader'</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.css$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>[</span> <span>'style-loader'</span><span>,</span> <span>'css-loader'</span> <span>]</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.(js)$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'babel-loader'</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>]</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  output<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    path<span>:</span> path<span>.</span><span>resolve</span><span>(</span>__dirname<span>,</span> <span>'dist'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    filename<span>:</span> <span>'index_bundle.js'</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So the full process looks something like this.</p>
<ol>
<li>webpack grabs the entry point located at <code>./app/index.js</code>.</li>
<li>It examines all of our <code>import</code> and <code>require</code> statements and creates a dependency graph.</li>
<li>webpack starts creating a bundle, whenever it comes across a path we have a loader for, it transforms the code according to that loader then adds it to the bundle.</li>
<li>It takes the final bundle and outputs it at <code>dist/index_bundle.js</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Plugins</h3>
<p>We’ve seen how you can use loaders to work on individual files before or while the bundle is being generated. Unlike loaders, plugins allow you to execute certain tasks <strong>after</strong> the bundle has been created. Because of this, these tasks can be on the bundle itself, or just to your codebase. You can think of plugins as a more powerful, less restrictive version of loaders.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a few examples.</p>
<h4>HtmlWebpackPlugin</h4>
<p>Earlier we saw that the main benefit of webpack was that it would generate a single bundle for us that we could then use to reference inside of our main <code>index.html</code> page.</p>
<p>What <code>HtmlWebpackPlugin</code> does is it will generate this <code>index.html</code> page for us, stick it inside of the same directory where our bundle is put, and automatically include a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag which references the newly generated bundle.</p>
<p>So in our example, because we’ve told webpack to name the final bundle <code>index_bundle.js</code> and put it in a folder called <code>dist</code>, when <code>HtmlWebpackPlugin</code> runs, it’ll create a new <code>index.html</code> file, put it in <code>dist</code>, and include a script to reference the bundle, <code>&lt;script src='bundle_index.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>. Pretty nice, right? Because this file is being generated for us by <code>HtmlWebpackPlugin</code>, even if we change the output path or …</p></div></div></div></div>

I’ve laid out the index of topics covered in the post. </p><p>Depending on the stage of your journey, feel free to skip to the sections that are most relevant to you.<br></p><h3><strong>Topics covered in this post</strong></h3><ol role="list"><li>Why choose Shopify for your first micro-SaaS (and why you shouldn't)</li><li>Discover problems, niches, and Shopify app ideas</li><li>Standing out from competition</li><li>Shopify App Store optimisation basics</li><li>Find your #1 keyword</li><li>Getting customers to review your Shopify app (by delivering great customer support)</li><li>Getting the first customers for your Shopify app</li><li>Finding early users and beta testers for your Shopify app outside the App Store</li><li>Getting listed under the right categories &amp; collections, and getting featured on the Shopify App Store</li><li>The right pricing model for your Shopify app</li><li>Optimising for trials</li><li>Long term game plan in the Shopify App Store</li></ol><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>Why choose Shopify for your first micro-SaaS (and why you shouldn't)</strong></h2><p>Shopify isn’t the only choice when it comes to picking an apps marketplace. There’s </p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://slack.com/apps" target="_blank">Slack</a></li><li><a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/" target="_blank">Atlassian</a></li><li><a href="https://appexchange.salesforce.com/" target="_blank">Salesforce</a></li><li><a href="https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace" target="_blank">GSuite Marketplace</a></li><li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions" target="_blank">Chrome Web Store</a></li><li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a></li><li><a href="https://www.apple.com/in/ios/app-store/" target="_blank">Apple iOS App Store</a></li><li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/genre/mac/id39?mt=12" target="_blank">Mac App Store</a></li></ul><p>All these marketplaces are valid options for you to start. I would lean on a marketplace where there’s a combination of 2 factors</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Familiarity with problems</strong> - You know what the core product is about, you understand or can empathise with its users maybe from using the tool at your previous workplace, you have an idea on the different kind of problems that exist in the ecosystem and don’t find it too boring to solve them</li><li><strong>Skillset to execute</strong> - If you don’t know how to build Android, iOS, or Mac apps, perhaps steer clear of it. Your goal is not to take on a hard challenge, it’s to take on a challenge where you have some advantage from skill and insight. The goal is to win.<br></li></ol><h3>Why you should pick the Shopify app marketplace:</h3><ul role="list"><li><strong>Huge distribution:</strong> Marketing is often a big reason for a business’s failure, the App Store takes care of it. Shopify has 1mn+ merchants and tons of new signups every month who go to the app store browsing for solutions. <br>Shopify promotes apps within its product and has made it an integral part of its user journey. A new app is able to gain traction fairly easily in the app marketplace, which makes it friendly to newcomers. <br>Marketing is often a big reason for a business’s failure, the App Store takes care of it.</li><li><strong>Tons of app opportunities:</strong> E-commerce store owners have 101+ problems to be taken care of, and you can address any one and do a great job at it to build a sustainable business. It’s not hard (relative standards) to gain 200 paying customers paying you $10/mo to earn $2000/mo ($1600 after Shopify’s 20%)</li><li><strong>Ease of development:</strong> Shopify’s documentation and APIs are first-class, they get out of the way allowing you to build fast. Additionally, Shopify’s <a href="https://polaris.shopify.com/" target="_blank">Polaris UI framework</a> makes building app interfaces a piece of cake. It’s based on React and comes with a Sketch/Figma file to help you design and prototype solutions fast.</li><li><strong>Billing taken care of:</strong> Heads up, Shopify takes a 20% commission on all earnings. So if your app’s monthly subscription fees is $10, you get $8. In return, Shopify takes care of billing end to end.<br>You can charge monthly, annually, charge per activity, provide app credit, and issue refunds with very little effort. You don’t need to worry about failed payments, Shopify takes care of it. You don’t even need to generate an invoice, app bills are included in the merchant’s monthly Shopify invoice.</li><li><strong>Familiarity with ecommerce:</strong> If you’re someone who can jump into an industry and learn all about it, great. If not, you would want some familiarity with how an ecommerce store works, what are the typical problems faced by a merchant.<br>You can do this by creating a Shopify store and trying to sell your own products. Or you could have conversations with 10 different store owners and absorb from their experience. You could also find someone who works at an e-commerce agency for valuable insights. It’s not that hard.<br></li></ul><h3>Why you shouldn’t pick the Shopify app marketplace:</h3><ul role="list"><li><strong>Copycat galore:</strong> You’re likely to copy an existing app and make a slight improvement in terms of product, pricing, or both. Guess what, the next smart person with the same idea can do the same to you. If you’re dependent on getting all or majority of your customers from the app store, be ready for stiff competition from copycats. <br>This doesn’t mean you cannot grow your app to $1k or $10k MRR. SaaS is not a winner take all market. It just means that it gets harder to grow as you grow. If this is something you are not mentally prepared for, steer clear. <br>There’s ways you can grow out of this by taking a long term strategy, either by taking a brand-centric approach (brand is not your name, but the experience that customers remember you by for which they’ll choose you over a copycat). <br>Or you can go upmarket and target large volume and Plus merchants, where ticket sizes are $200/mo or higher and switching does not happen often. </li><li><strong>Low-end, high-maintenance customers:</strong> Majority of Shopify merchants are people who don’t want to pay beyond $10-$15/mo and yet they expect world-class customer service. Some will ask for phone support or to jump on a video call. <br>You can tackle this by solving problems where the ticket sizes are higher, in the range of $50-$100/mo, but also expect it to be significantly harder to rank and fight existing competitors in such problem spaces. Example - <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/search?q=page+builder" target="_blank">page builders</a>, <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/search?q=product+reviews" target="_blank">product review</a> apps. <br>You can mitigate this by going in with the mindset that you’ll be serving $15/mo customers, so your app better be self-serve ready, have a dead simple UX and sufficient documentation or walkthrough videos. You can also aim to be the cost-leader of a segment, example - <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/judgeme" target="_blank">Judge.me</a> </li></ul><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>Discover problems, niches, and Shopify app ideas</strong></h2><p>I’ve previously written about <a href="https://www.preetamnath.com/blog/shopify-micro-saas-growth" target="_blank">uncovering opportunities on Shopify</a> and I also shared all my research in my big <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hnpcl1VAlPC9MuFvvsl2UsU0yu1iM6aKR-iK30VtbwA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Shopify app ideas spreadsheet</a>. Let me reiterate on the advice shared there in a more structured manner that will hopefully better answer questions like:</p><ul role="list"><li>“How do you find niches in the app store in the first place?”</li><li>“How to find a problem worth solving within shopify? (worth solving=stressful enough for merchants &amp; competition not too tough)”<br></li></ul><p>There have been people who have asked me what kind of problems to solve, or what are the underserved niches. The thing is - if there's an obviously underserved niche and people have taken the time to research about it, they are probably busy solving it. If it's being posted in any blog post, know that it's no longer an underserved or hidden niche, because clearly anyone could find it.</p><p>Ultimately, only you can find an idea that you find worthy enough to pursue, whose various pros and cons are justified in your mind. And therefore, I can only provide a directional framework towards evaluating ideas. I can't list out ideas.</p><p>The best use of a directional framework is to</p><ol start="" role="list"><li><strong>First</strong> - cast a wide net, get to know what's out there</li><li><strong>Second</strong> - narrow down your search based on parameters you have decided</li></ol><p>This first section of the article will help you with casting a wide net. </p><p>As you go further along the article, I've shared ideas and techniques which you can use to narrow down your search.<br></p><h3>1- Browse the entire App Store</h3><p>I recommend this as the starting point for anyone new to the Shopify ecosystem. Start by browsing all the categories &amp; sub-categories of apps on the app store. You can do the same on <a href="https://sasi.unionworks.co.uk/categories" target="_blank">SASI</a>. </p><p>The purpose of browsing this way is to familiarise yourself with the different types of problems faced by merchants and being solved by apps. Ideally, you want to note down some interesting apps that you come across during your browsing adventure to investigate later on.</p><figure id="w-node-892fc283544a-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f1c114edd643e073591f8cc_browse%20categories%20shopify%20app%20store.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>2- Go through every letter in search autocomplete</h3><p>Okay, this is a step I took when&nbsp;I was browsing the app store. I would type in "aa", "ab", "ac"... ... ... "zz" on the search bar, note the autocomplete terms and check the results of ones I found to be interesting.</p><p>Turns out, Shopify has since updated their algorithm. Autocomplete suggestions only show up after you type 3 letters now. So you can't recreate what I did with autocomplete and go through every letter. It's not feasible anymore.</p><p>Not to worry, it's still useful.</p><h4>Plug in keywords of shortlisted apps into the search bar</h4><p>From step 1, all the apps (hopefully at least a dozen) that you shortlisted for being interesting, extract the keywords used in the app's title or description. </p><p>Now, enter …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Around November of last year, I started a project to wrangle my digital life. Tired of haphazardly increasing my subjectivity by trusting "free" websites to provide various services, I wanted to wrest some control over my internet existence. I made a plan to self-host several "critical" services on my home network and maintain them personally. In short, I made a homelab.</p>
<p>To be frank, the professional websites that I was previously dependent upon are undoubtedly more reliable than my cobbled-together hobby project of a homelab. However, on general principle (and because it seemed like a fun way to learn some sysadmin / devops skills), I made this setup:</p>
<p><img src="https://0xc45.com/blog/ansible-defined-homelab/homelab-network-diagram.svg" alt="Homelab Network Diagram"></p>
<p>As you can see, I have deployed a couple of general-purpose compute platforms: 4 ESXi hypervisors, and a Kubernetes cluster. Additionally, there are several VM-based services: Nextcloud, Gitea, and Harbor. For data storage and backup, I use a Synology NAS. Finally, a custom OpenBSD-based router provides internet connectivity to everything. In order to reduce operational overhead, I crafted <a href="https://github.com/0xC45/homelab-setup">a set of Ansible scripts</a> that deploy and configure all of these components.</p>
<p>Overall, making this setup has been quite a journey. In this blog post, I will describe my uses for each of these services, share my thoughts and experiences so far, and attempt to articulate my future improvement plans.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Of course, everything you see above already exists as a service on the internet. If my goal were solely the end feature set, it would have been much simpler to pay for each service. In most cases, there are even "free" versions available. For example, if I only cared about having access to a web-based git repository UI, I could have signed up for a Github or Gitlab account rather than bother setting up a Gitea VM on my home network.</p>
<p>However, like most of my hobby projects, this endeavor was more about the journey than the destination. By setting up these services on my home network, I learned a bunch of useful devops and sysadmin skills. Additionally, by running my own services, I have achieved the philosophical goal of reducing my reliance on 3rd party services. Now, if any of the services that I rely upon break, I am empowered to fix them. I am no longer dependent on the "opaque box" that is Google Drive, for example.</p>
<h2 id="components">Components</h2>
<p>So, without further ado, let's dive into each of the components that make up my homelab. For each component, I will describe the main utility it provides me, why I chose it, and any additional commentary that may be helpful.</p>
<h3 id="router">Router</h3>
<p>The first component of my homelab is a custom OpenBSD-based router. It provides internet connectivity and DHCP to everything on my home network. Additionally, the device serves as a caching DNS server and firewall. I could write an entire blog post describing this router in excruciating detail. In fact, I <a href="https://0xc45.com/blog/openbsd-home-router/">already have</a>.</p>
<h3 id="esxi-hosts">ESXi Hosts</h3>
<p>In total, I maintain four physical <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/esxi-and-esx.html">ESXi</a> hosts to form a platform for running virtual machines on my network.</p>
<p>Three of the ESXi hosts are Intel NUCs (System76 Meerkats). These smaller machines run the VMs that form my Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<p>The other ESXi host is a custom machine built from spare parts. It currently runs three VM-based HTTPS services: Nextcloud, Gitea, and Harbor. Because it only runs three (relatively small) VMs, it has quite a bit of spare compute power leftover for future additions and/or temporary experiments.</p>
<p>I chose ESXi to run my virtual machines because it's enterprise quality and free. There are many hypervisors out there. For my current use case, ESXi is perfect. Also, in the future, I may consider expanding my use of VMware products by running vCenter to programmatically manage virtual machines, setting-up vSAN for shared storage, and potentially installing NSX if my networking requirements become more complicated. So, there is room to grow.</p>
<h3 id="kubernetes-cluster">Kubernetes Cluster</h3>
<p>In addition to the VM-based compute platform provided by ESXi, I run Kubernetes to provide a container-based compute platform. Though I do not currently use my Kubernetes cluster for anything, I have plans to setup <a href="https://argoproj.github.io/">Argo CI/CD</a>, experiment with <a href="https://knative.dev/">kNative</a>, develop some operators, and maybe run a <a href="https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/factorio">factorio game server</a>.</p>
<p>The Kubernetes cluster consists of 6 VMs running across 3 Intel NUCs. I chose to install Kubernetes on VMs with the ESXi hypervisor layer for ease of management. At some point, I'm sure to break things, want to reconfigure, etc. With the hypervisor, it's easier to perform these type of adjustments. Furthermore, at some point in the future, I may switch to <a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/kubernetes-grid">TKG</a>, a vSphere-integrated distribution of Kubernetes.</p>
<h3 id="synology-nas">Synology NAS</h3>
<p>For backups and storing important data, I use a <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-global/products/DS218+">Synology NAS</a>. Though I didn't really shop around and compare NAS products / vendors, I am happy with the Synology so far. That being said, I would like to create my own NAS from scratch at some point in the future. However, the Synology product includes several features "out-of-the-box" that would be potentially difficult to replicate.</p>
<p>First, it has an easy-to-use application called <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/dsm/feature/active_backup_business">"Active Backup for Business"</a> that can automatically take backups of ESXi virtual machines following configurable schedules and retention policies.</p>
<p>The VM backup application pairs nicely with the automatic cloud backup application, <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/dsm/packages/GlacierBackup">"Glacier Backup"</a>. Every night, after the VMs are backed-up to the NAS, I replicate the backups to Amazon S3 Glacier. Hopefully, this way I won't ever lose data.</p>
<p>Finally, the Synology has built-in UPS integration. If <a href="https://www.apc.com/shop/us/en/products/APC-Power-Saving-Back-UPS-Pro-1500/P-BR1500G">my UPS</a> loses power for more than one minute, the NAS will cleanly shutdown, preventing any data corruption that could be caused by an unexpected power loss.</p>
<h3 id="nextcloud-vm">Nextcloud VM</h3>
<p>I use <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a> as my "personal cloud". I use it to store my important files and photos. The desktop / mobile application synchronizes the files across all of my devices, allowing me to edit and view my files from anywhere. </p>
<p>Nextcloud also has the capability to install "apps" that provide additional functionality. Currently, I have only installed one app, <a href="https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/deck">"Deck"</a>. Deck is a Kanban-style project management and organization tool. I use Deck to plan, organize, and record progress on my hobby projects.</p>
<p>Because it gives me the capability to install (and potentially create) apps, Nextcloud is an extensible platform. It's open source and under active development. Though the recent major version upgrade was a bit rocky (for me, at least), I'm happy with Nextcloud and plan to stick with it.</p>
<h3 id="gitea-vm">Gitea VM</h3>
<p>Of course, I need a place to store my code. For that purpose, I use <a href="https://gitea.io/en-us/">Gitea</a>. I prefer Gitea to Gitlab because it's lighter-weight. Unlike Gitlab, there aren't a million additional features bundled-in that add bloat (in my opinion). Also, I slightly prefer the Gitea UI over the Gitlab UI.</p>
<p>There's really not much else to say about Gitea. It works great for my purposes. I push all of my code to the Gitea VM running on my home network. Whenever I want to "publish" a project or share it with the world, I push my code to a public Github repo.</p>
<h3 id="harbor-vm">Harbor VM</h3>
<p>To make container images available for running on my Kubernetes cluster, I need a container registry. For this purpose, I use <a href="https://goharbor.io/">Harbor</a>, an open source solution that seems to be the current most popular self-hosted container registry. In addition to providing a standard API for pushing/pulling container images, Harbor has the useful capability to scan container images for known vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Harbor has worked well for me so far, but I haven't really placed it under a serious workload. Soon, I will start using my Kubernetes cluster for various projects, which will require pushing / pulling images from Harbor on a regular basis. Perhaps, at some point in the future, I will have a more nuanced opinion of Harbor.</p>
<h2 id="future-improvements">Future Improvements</h2>
<p>Though I am happy with the current setup, I continually find myself coming up with ideas for potential improvements and additions to the homelab. Here are a couple of the more well-defined ideas.</p>
<p>First, I want to install <a href="https://argoproj.github.io/">Argo</a> on the Kubernetes cluster to run pipeline-based workflows. For example, it could be useful to automatically run tests for every commit that gets pushed to my repositories on Gitea. More generally, I could configure Argo to trigger a job for any arbitrary external event. It could be used to create a notification service. Or, it could be used to manage heavy workloads. There are endless potential uses for a pipeline-based workflow engine such as Argo.</p>
<p>Second, I want to create a dashboard that provides a graphical representation of the status of each of my homelab components using <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a>. Using various open-source tools, I could collect metrics and aggregate them. Then, using Grafana, I could visualize the data. It would be useful to be able to quickly ascertain the state of my home network services in order to understand workloads, diagnose issues, etc.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>With the work spanning several months, creating my homelab has been quite a journey. Along the way, I started to grow weary, concerned that I had signed myself up for the all-consuming task of operating my homelab. With the overhead required to maintain all the various components, how could I ever have time for anything else? However, I'm happy to report that the Ansible script automation has proved worthwhile. Now, upgrades, configuration changes, and various "day 2" operations are quick and simple. At this point, I'm looking forward to shifting gears and working on something else for a while, using my homelab services as helpful tools along the way.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><a href="https://sunburnt.com.au/huawei-hacked-my-laptop">Huawei Hacked My Laptop?</a></p><p><img alt="" src="https://sunburnt.com.au/ox/webcore/attachments/29436/20200725_180027.huawei-xhost.png?width=500&amp;height=444"></p>

<p>The screenshot above shows a script called "Huawei Autorun" which executes the command "xhost +" when you login. This command makes your Linux desktop remotely accessible to anyone on the network. The "Huawei Autorun" script appeared on my laptop after installing a Huawei E353 HSPA+ 3G USB stick (with serial number CE0682 on the back).</p>

<p>It seems like I dodged a bullet as I don't use the standard Linux GNOME desktop, so the script was not enabled, but the fact remains that Huawei installed malware on my Linux laptop. If they managed to get into my laptop, imagine what is happening inside your phone.</p>

<p>State-sponsored hacking is real.</p>

<p><strong>----UPDATE----</strong></p>

<p>For those people who requested more information. The OS is Debian 8.1 LTS. The script is basically a one-liner embedded in an autostart launcher (see below). It was installed as root, so I must have screwed up big time there. Obviously, I'll&nbsp;have to reinstall my OS.&nbsp;Debian 8 is at end of life&nbsp;now anyway.</p>

<pre>$ cat /etc/xdg/autostart/HuaweiAutoStart.desktop 
[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=Huawei  AutoRun
Name[en_US]=Huawei AutoRun
<strong>Exec=xhost +</strong>
SwallowExec=
SwallowTitle=
Terminal=false
TerminalOptions=
Type=Application
URL=
X-KDE-SubstituteUID=false
X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true
GenericName[en_US]=</pre>

<p><strong>----UPDATE 2----</strong></p>

<p>Okay, I decided to check out this modem. It does include Linux drivers which require root for installation. I reran the installation script as root and sure enough the same autostart script was reinstalled.</p>

<pre>$ ls /etc/xdg/autostart/ -l
total 116
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  305 Oct 10  2014 at-spi-dbus-bus.desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 6351 Oct 21  2014 gnome-keyring-gpg.desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 7777 Oct 21  2014 gnome-keyring-pkcs11.desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 7339 Oct 21  2014 gnome-keyring-secrets.desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 5996 Oct 21  2014 gnome-keyring-ssh.desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 7741 Aug 27  2014 gsettings-data-convert.desktop
<strong>-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  262 Jul 25 23:59 HuaweiAutoStart.desktop</strong>
<span>....</span>
</pre>

<p>This script is also installed to <span>$HOME/.config/autostart/</span><span>HuaweiAutoStart.desktop</span>. Another script called <span>ReadDisplay</span> is&nbsp;installed in <span>/usr/local/modem</span> which&nbsp;passes the&nbsp;<span>$DISPLAY</span>&nbsp;environment variable to a binary&nbsp;called <span>MobilePartner</span>. The drivers do include a GUI, but if the sole purpose of all this is to fire up a GUI then it is not only exceptionally sloppy code, but also a&nbsp;security risk that needs explaining.</p>

<p>Below is a tarball image of the huawei e353 drivers so you can audit them for yourself. I've included the Windows drivers so you get an image of the disk just as I have it. Heck you could even try it for yourself. The drivers didn't compile the second time I did this, but the autostart script was still installed.</p>

<p><a href="https://sunburnt.com.au/ox/webcore/attachments/29437/huawei-e353-malware.tar.gz">Download huawei e353 drivers (warning, possible malware!)</a></p>

<p><strong>----UPDATE 3----</strong></p>

<p>I'm giving Huawei the benefit of doubt on this one. As a commenter suggested, it is probably a hack to run the GUI as root. Either way, it is still a nasty vulnerability, even if your X server is configured to use local sockets by default. I guess this&nbsp;shows the folly of blindly trusting hardware manufactures. I'll be sticking to open source code from official repositories in the future.</p>

<p>Live and learn, I suppose.</p>

      <p>Based on the article, I would think it is just a sloppy and lazy implementation, but the title does served as a bait clicker. The comment where avoiding pure chinese company or there is at least American company involved will be pure ignorance&nbsp;or turning a blind eye on what is happening around the world and purely cynical. Every country spying on people when they have the means and ways. So don't even think for a second that&nbsp;&nbsp;an American company involvement will make it any better. That will be pure ignorant.<br>
<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10403598/35-world-leaders-had-their-phones-monitored-by-US-spies.html">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10403598/35-world-leaders-had-their-phones-monitored-by-US-spies.html</a></p>

    
  <p>It's more likely the package installed some graphical configuration tool that needs to run as root. Running "xhost +" is a lazy way to enable programs running as root to connect to your non-root user's X11 session.</p>

<p>I don't know what debian's default settings are regarding Xorg and networking, but on my laptop Xorg appears to only be listening on unix sockets, which are obviously not accessible from the whole network.</p>

    
  <blockquote>
<p><span>State-sponsored hacking is real.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>Yes. It's happening. 14 eyes (US+others) are also doing it. So I don't trust US services and devices either.</span></p>

<p><span>While they're banning each other of different things, open hardware is rising up and welcoming everyone (for example RISC V). We need things like this in this world to bring in peace so that they don't fight over silli things.</span></p>

    
  <p>Clean the system, you most likely found one piece of the drop. Replace the drive, looks to be a long weekend</p>

    
  <p>I avoid any pure Chinese tech, where possible. By law in China, all companies must work with the CCP (which means the military). Obviously, iPhones and such are made in China, although production is starting to move to other countries under Trump's trade policies, but at least there is an American company involved on the HW and SW sides.</p>

    
  <p>Did inserting the Huawei E353 dongle attach a virtual CD-ROM drive that you manually installed drivers from? I know for a fact similar devices (eg, ZTE MF910) offer drivers this way. The generic Linux USB ethernet driver worked fine, so there's no need to install Huawei or ZTE's driver.</p>

<p>It's worth mentioning USB On-The-Go devices (including Android phones and 4G modems) have relatively powerful processors running a wide variety of network services, including an insecure web server (for the end-user web configuration interface), high-precision location, a high bandwidth internet side-channel (the 4G connection itself) while also having the ability to act as any USB client device (including keyboards to send keystrokes). They are an incredibly powerful platform for targeted cyberattacks and I imagine state actors are using them very often.</p>

<p><strong>PHP is a dynamically typed scripting language</strong> and until the year
of 2015 php had no support for statically declared types at all. One
could cast to scalar types explicitly in the code, but declaring scalar
types in methods and functions signatures wasn't a thing until PHP 7.0
with the <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/scalar_type_hints_v5">Scalar Type Declarations</a>
and <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/return_types">Return Type Declarations</a> rfcs.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean that from version 7.0 PHP became a statically typed
language, though. <strong>It has type hinting that can be analyzed statically</strong>
but <strong>it still supports dynamic types</strong> and even allows them to be mixed.
See the example below:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

function returnsInt(): int
{
  return '100';
}</code></pre>
<p>No doubt that <strong>there's a type mismatch there</strong>. The return type is
supposed to be <em>int</em> and the returned type is in fact a <em>string</em>. Now,
what PHP does there is to automatically transform the token '100'
into an integer in order to return the required type. Even though it
seems to have an extra cost, it doesn't. PHP's type juggling is <em>nearly</em>
cost-free in many cases.</p>
<p>To better clarify how the language deals with types I'll split this article
into the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#kinds-of-types-in-php">Kinds of types in php</a></li>
<li><a href="#type-operations-in-php">Type "operations" in php</a></li>
<li><a href="#union-types">Union Types</a></li>
<li><a href="#php-type-juggling">PHP's type juggling</a></li>
<li><a href="#php-type-modes">PHP type modes</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have suggestions on what to add here, feel free to
<a href="https://twitter.com/nawarian">reach out to me on twitter</a> or opening an issue on
github.</p>
<h2 id="kinds-of-types-in-php">Kinds of types in php</h2>
<p>PHP's type system is very simplified when it comes to language features.
For example there's no <em>char</em> type, or <em>unsigned</em> types or even <em>int8</em>,
<em>int16</em>, <em>int32</em>, <em>int64</em>...</p>
<p>The <em>char</em> type is simplified to a string type and all <em>integer</em> variations
are simplified into an <em>integer</em> type. Whether that's a good or bad thing, is
up to you.</p>
<p>One can always inspect a variable's type using the
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.gettype">gettype()</a> function or using
the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.var-dump">var_dump()</a> function and
checking its output.</p>
<p>PHP comes with three different kinds of types: <strong>scalar types</strong>, <strong>compound types</strong>
and <strong>special types</strong>.</p>
<h3>Scalar types</h3>
<p>Scalar types are the bare bones of the language and they are four:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boolean (<code>bool</code> | <code>boolean</code>)</li>
<li>Integer (<code>int</code> | <code>integer</code>)</li>
<li>Float (<code>float</code> | <code>double</code>)</li>
<li>String (<code>string</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>By definition scalar types do not carry behaviour or state with themselves.
Expressions like <code>100-&gt;toString()</code> or <code>'thephp.website'::length()</code> are invalid.</p>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: scalar values do not have behaviour or state, they just represent
a value.</strong></p>
<h3>Compound types</h3>
<p>Compound types are much more interesting because even though they are very similar
to the scalar type, <strong>each one of the four compound types carry different syntactic
capabilities.</strong></p>
<p>The four compound types are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#compound-type-array">array</a></li>
<li><a href="#compound-type-object">object</a></li>
<li><a href="#compound-type-callable">callable</a></li>
<li><a href="#compound-type-iterable">iterable</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="compound-type-array">The array compound type</h4>
<p>An array is in fact a hashmap, built-in to the language. Meaning that it stores
values in a <strong>key =&gt; value</strong> manner. Even if you use it purely as a vector.</p>
<p>Arrays are very flexible structures when it comes to size, internal types and
key-value mapping. The examples below are all valid arrays:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$vec = [0, 1, 2];
// $vec[1] is int(1)

$map = ['a' =&gt; 1, 'b' =&gt; 2];
// $map['a'] is int(1)

$map_ish = ['a' =&gt; 1, 0 =&gt; 2];
// $map_ish['a'] is int(1)
// $map_ish[0] =&gt; is int(2)</code></pre>
<p>Unlike C, php won't require you to define an array's size before creating it.
This of course comes with a memory consumption cost: the bigger your array size,
the more memory you'll consume in crazy proportions (in fact, arrays are allocated in powers of two).
How this consumption works is out of the scope of this article,
<a href="https://twitter.com/nawarian">feel free to ping me if you'd like to hear more</a>.</p>
<p>In case you're curious about this statement, the video below presents some charts
and further insights on arrays vs. object memory profiles.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JBWgvUrb-q8?start=1000" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""><iframe style="margin: auto; margin-bottom: 20px;" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JBWgvUrb-q8?start=1000" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>As you'll see bellow, arrays are also considered to be of type <em>iterable</em>, meaning
that you can iterate over them using a <em>foreach</em> loop. But they also provide
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.array.php">specific functions that can manipulate their internal pointers</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: array is an extremely flexible compound type that can be perceived
as a HashMap and is also considered an iterable type.</strong></p>
<h4 id="compound-type-object">The object compound type</h4>
<p>Due to php's architecture, the <em>object</em> compound type normally has a much lower memory
consumption profile when compared with arrays. That's because <em>normally</em> one would use
the object type by creating instances of classes.</p>
<p>Objects can carry state and behaviour. Meaning that php will offer dereferencing
language structs to access an object's internals. The snippet below illustrates
a php object's derefs:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

class MyClass
{
  private const A = 1;
  public int $property = 0;
  public function method(): void {}
}

$obj = new MyClass();
// $obj is object(MyClass)
// $obj::A is int(1)
// $obj-&gt;property is int(0)
// $obj-&gt;method() is null</code></pre>
<p>An object can also be normally created as a result of a type cast from an array.
Transforming an array's keys into objects property names. Such cast will always
result in an <code>object(stdClass)</code> type.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$obj = (object) ['a' =&gt; 1];
// $obj is object(stdClass)
// $obj-&gt;a is int(1)</code></pre>
<p>Important to notice that casting an array with numeric keys into an object is valid,
but one can't dereference its value because property names may not start with numbers.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$obj = (object) [0, 1]; // Legal
$obj-&gt;0; // Illegal</code></pre>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: objects normally have lower memory profiles than arrays, they carry
state and behaviour, they all inherit from stdClass and can be created by casting an
array.</strong></p>
<h4 id="compound-type-callable">The callable compound type</h4>
<p>A callable in php is anything that can be called (oh don't you say!!) with parenthesis
or with the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.call-user-func.php">call_user_func()</a>
function. In other words, a callable can fulfil the responsibility of what we know as
functions. Functions and methods are always callables. Objects and classes may also become
callables.</p>
<p>A callable can, by definition, have its reference stored in a variable. Like the following:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$callable = 'strlen';</code></pre>
<p>What? But that's a string, no?</p>
<p>Well, yes. But it can be coerced into a callable if necessary. Like below:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

function callACallable(
  callable $f
): int {
  return $f('thephp.website');
}

$callable = 'strlen';

var_dump(
  $callable('thephp.website')
);
// int(14)

var_dump(
  callACallable($callable)
);
// int(14)</code></pre>
<p>Callables may also point to object methods:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

class MyClass
{
  public function myMethod(): int
  {
    return 1;
  }
}

$obj = new MyClass();
var_dump([$obj, 'myMethod']());
// int(1)</code></pre>
<p>Looks odd? I know it looks like an array. In fact it is. Unless you name it a callable 👀</p>
<p>This kind of callable above (object-method reference) is very interesting because
<strong>you can call private or protected methods</strong> with it <strong>if you're inside the class' scope.</strong>
Otherwise you may only call public methods with it.</p>
<p>Also classes that implement
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php#object.invoke">the __invoke() magic method</a>,
automatically transform their instances into callables themselves. Like the following:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

class MyCallableClass
{
  public function __invoke(): int
  {
    return 1;
  }
}

$obj = new MyCallableClass();
var_dump($obj());
// int(1)</code></pre>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: callables hold reference to functions or methods and can be
constructed in different ways.</strong></p>
<h4 id="compound-type-iterable">The iterable compound type</h4>
<p>Iterables are simpler to explain: they are by definition an array or an instance of
the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.traversable.php">Traversable interface</a>. The
main thing of an iterable is that it can be used in a
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/control-structures.foreach.php">foreach() loop</a>, with a
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.generators.syntax.php#control-structures.yield.from">yield from statement</a>
or with <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/spread_operator_for_array">spread operator</a>.</p>
<p>Examples of iterables are:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

function generator_function(): Generator
{
  // ...
};

// All variables here are iterables
$a = [0, 1, 2];
$b = generator_function();
$c = new ArrayObject();</code></pre>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: if you can fit it in a foreach(), it is an iterable.</strong></p>
<h3>Special Types</h3>
<p>There are two special types. And the biggest reason why they're called special, is that
<strong>you can't cast these types</strong>. The special types are both the <strong>resource</strong> type and
the <strong>NULL</strong> type.</p>
<p><strong>A resource represents a handle to an external resource</strong>. It can be a file handle,
an I/O stream or a database connection handle. You may guess now why you can't convert
a resource to any other type.</p>
<p><strong>The null type represents a null value</strong>. Meaning that a variable holding NULL was not
initialized, assigned to NULL or unset during runtime.</p>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: a special typed value can't be casted to anything.</strong></p>
<h3>What about class instances?</h3>
<p>Class instances have the type <code>object</code> and will always be presented like so. Executing
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.gettype">gettype()</a> on an object will always return
a <code>string("object")</code> and calling <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.var-dump">var_dump()</a>
on an object will always print its value using the <code>object(ClassName)</code> notation. If you need
to fetch an object's class as a string, use the
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.get-class">get_class()</a> function.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$obj = new stdClass();

echo gettype($obj);
// object

var_dump($obj);
// object(stdClass)#1 (0) {
// ...

echo get_class($obj);
// \stdClass</code></pre>
<h2 id="type-operations-in-php">Type "operations" in php</h2>
<p>There are different "operations" one can do with PHP when it comes to types. I believe
it is important to clearly state them here so that we don't mix things up later on.</p>
<h3>Type juggling: type casting and coercion</h3>
<p>Before we dive in, here are three important definitions we need keep in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Type conversion</strong> means to transform a type from A to B. For example: from integer to float.</li>
<li><strong>Type cast</strong> means to <strong>manually</strong> or <strong>explicitly</strong> convert a type from A to B. As in <code>$hundred = (int) 100.0</code>. (<code>float(100.0)</code> became <code>int(100)</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Type coercion</strong> means to <strong>implicitly</strong> convert a type from A to B. As in <code>$twenty = 10 + '10 bananas';</code>. (<code>string("10 bananas")</code> became <code>int(10)</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Being that said, the following sections explain how it happens in php. Later on you'll find
more information on Type Juggling.</p>
<h4>Type casting</h4>
<p>Similar to what Java does, php allows type casting. Meaning that when a variable points to
a value that can be casted to a different type, it allows manual (explicit) type conversion.</p>
<p>Wait, wait. What!? 🤨</p>
<p>Given a variable <code>$hundred</code> holding a <code>string("100")</code> its value may be manually converted (casted)
to become an <code>int(100)</code> or a <code>float(100.00)</code> - or any other scalar type or one of compound
types <em>array</em> or <em>object</em>.</p>
<p>The following snippet works just fine in PHP and is very similar to Java:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$hundred = (int) '100';
// $hundred is now int(100)</code></pre>
<p>Now, one thing Java does and is completely illegal on php code, is to …</p></iframe></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-9357"><div><div><div><h2>Amazon’s venture capital fund accused of investing in small companies just to steal their ideas</h2><p>Jeff Bezos’ owned world’s biggest eCommerce firm is actually a predator! Amazon is reportedly using its venture capital arm to fund startups only to steal business ideas from them. Amazon is accused of investing in small firms to actually obtain information about products developed by them. The e-commerce retailer then uses this confidential information to launch its own service based on such data.</p><p>According to a report in the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-tech-startup-echo-bezos-alexa-investment-fund-11595520249">Wall Street Journal(Paywall)</a>, Amazon.com’s venture-capital fund invested in DefinedCrowd and gained access to the technology startup’s finances and other confidential information. Four years later the marketplace launched a similar artificial intelligence product that does almost exactly what DefinedCrowd does.</p><p>DefinedCrowd founder and CEO Daniela Braga has accused Amazon of stealing their concept to launch its own product. Amazon recently launched a new Amazon Web Services (AWS) product called A2I. DefinedCrowd CEO says that it is completely based on their product and competes directly with them. And all this under the garb of venture capital funding.</p><p>Another company that suffered a similar fate was LivingSocial. LivingSocial officials met with Amazon’s venture capital firm to discuss a potential investment. At the end of the talks, Amazon purchased 30 percent of LivingSocial equity. After buying the share in LivingSocial, Amazon requested access to proprietary LivingSocial data. In a few months, Amazon started reaching out to its own clients offering better deals for similar products.</p><p>Even Amazon’s Echo seems to have been developed using this predatory thieving. A company that built Ubi, a smart speaker was in talks with Amazon for seed funding. The Ubi officials met with Amazo several times to discuss funding and concepts. It was just a matter of days before Amazon launched a similar product to Ubi- Amazon’s Echo. Due to the Echo launch, Ubi has all but disappeared.</p><p>WSJ report says that many startup founders claimed that after Amazon launched rival products their businesses collapsed. Some say they were being forced to downsize their companies due to Amazon’s competition.</p><p>Amazon has refused to comment on the predatory nature of its venture capital fund. Amazon says that such funding meetings are confidential in nature. Amazon, however, added that information obtained from such meetings is not used to build competing products, noting that any such claims are typically resolved in court.</p><p>“For 26 years, we’ve pioneered many features, products, and even whole new categories. From amazon.com itself to Kindle to Echo to AWS, few companies can claim a track record for innovation that rivals Amazon’s,” an Amazon spokesperson told <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-startup-investment-competitors-wsj-report-echo-nucleus-ubi-2020-7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a>. “Unfortunately, there will always be self-interested parties who complain rather than build. Any legitimate disputes about intellectual property ownership are rightly resolved in the courts.”</p><p>While court decisions may take a long time and many of these startups are too small to fight with a giant like Amazon armed with a battery of A-list lawyers, it is answerable to the US anti-trust body which it will be facing next week. The Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos will have to testify in the official hearing scheduled for Monday in front of the House Judiciary Committee.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Choosing between a PhD and industry for new computer science graduates]]>

July 25, 2020 | https://www.shreya-shankar.com/new-grad-advice/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.shreya-shankar.com/new-grad-advice/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Many people ask me why I chose not to pursue a PhD directly after college. I figured I might as well centralize my thoughts in one place. This essay is for computer science or technical grads:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interested in machine learning</li>
<li>Enjoy working on hard, unsolved technical challenges</li>
<li>Possibly choosing between research or industry</li>
</ul>
<p>As someone who deeply enjoys thinking about and coding solutions to open-ended research questions, I genuinely considered going to a PhD program. To come to a decision, I spent a while pondering why many students with research experience don’t pursue a PhD directly after undergrad. I think there are many reasons why people don’t go directly to PhD programs, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Effort</em>: it’s a lot of work to write applications for many schools, get solid recommendation letters, pay a lot of money in application fees, go through interviews, align with professors, secure funding, and more.</li>
<li><em>Comfort</em>: industry perks and salaries can be more attractive than graduate school stipends and long work hours.</li>
<li><em>Inertia</em>: if you’re not absolutely sure it’s right for you, the thought of switching trajectories midway into the program is very anxiety-provoking.</li>
</ul>
<p>I felt like I could put in the effort to apply and would enjoy a PhD program if I got in, but I still didn’t know what to do. Delaying the decision didn’t feel optimal either, since even if I worked in industry for a few years before going to a PhD program, I didn’t think I’d easily accustom to a large pay cut and working on problem sets again. Understandably, the PhD vs Industry decision caused me a lot of stress! Halfway through my senior year, I wrote down some pros and cons for each choice. In practice, an industry job for me meant working at a startup since I didn’t really enjoy my engineering internships at large companies. </p>
<p>Here, I discuss the raw pros and cons of pursuing a PhD and pros and cons of joining an early-stage machine learning startup. I wrote these in my journal in January 2019, and I provide some relevant commentary from my current self as a machine learning engineer (July 2020) in the nested bullets.</p>
<h2>Pros of pursuing a PhD (immediately after graduating)</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>I can prioritize my curiosity and have the freedom to learn about what I find intellectually engaging.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Now that I’ve been at a startup, although I can still be curious about many things, I have to work on things that provide business value. The ability to not be constrained by industry value is a real pro here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I can deeply hone technical expertise and have many people respect me for it.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I’m cringing at how much external validation I used to seek. Being in computer science is playing the <a href="https://nav.al/long-term">long game</a>. You don’t always get external validation, and good work can take a while.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It’s easier to “be my own boss” if I were doing research.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe? Ask a researcher this question. But <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/08/16/how-do-you-work-on-something-important/">choosing what to work on is challenging</a>, regardless of whether you’re in research or engineering.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I actually really enjoy research more than engineering.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes I still feel that I enjoy research more than engineering, but I’ve committed to developing my engineering skills. Again, being in tech is playing the long game, and having good engineering skills will help me no matter where I go, whether it’s research or IC or management.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>There are more clear mentorship opportunities for me.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This is probably true if I went to a PhD program, since I’d have access to many professors and older grad student friends.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I can be in a stable career option (5-6 years at least if doing PhD).</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This point occasionally gives me anxiety, since I don’t know exactly where I am going to be for the next 5-6 years. Startups are risky. But I’ve gotten more used to this feeling over the past year. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cons of pursuing a PhD (immediately after graduating)</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Maybe I’m a shitty researcher or will find out that I’m a shitty researcher.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Still a fear of mine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It’s unclear whether I want to end up in academia or industry research, so a PhD could be for nothing.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>One of my math PhD friends explains a PhD as “a socially acceptable reason for screwing around with whatever you’re interested in.” I like this reference, so technically going to a PhD program isn’t a waste if I enjoy it in the process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Incentives in academia are horrible. There are so many major conferences. How do you balance long term gains with getting the publications out?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This is really true. A year ago, I didn’t know how to think long-term. I probably would have tried to maximize my number of papers and burned out in my 3rd year, complaining that I’m not working on anything truly impactful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>A PhD can be really long and hard.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I love Philip Guo’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/15731248-the-ph-d-grind"><em>The PhD Grind</em></a>. Unfortunately he recently took his website down, which hosted the book.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pros of joining an ML startup</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>I can learn how to build things from scratch.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Painfully true — building from scratch is challenging, but the growing pains are necessary to deeply understand productionizing ML. </li>
<li>At the time, I didn’t know about the existence of “real-world” ML and engineering tools such as <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Spark</a>, <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">Airflow</a>, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, or <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>. These tools are super relevant and learning them can be its own pro.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I can see how research is applied in industry and measure the gap between research and industry.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This gap is larger than I expected. It’s also really fun to apply state-of-the-art research to business cases. For example, we recently productionized a transformer model.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I can gain leadership skills from the beginning and be a key figure in recruiting and defining the culture.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I was thrown into the fire as soon as I joined. Now, a year later, I’ve probably done over a hundred technical interviews, led a few ML projects for key clients, and mentored a couple of interns. I would definitely not have gotten this experience at a larger company.</li>
<li>It’s also cool to be able to choose who you work with (to some extent) by hiring people that fit in with the culture you help to define.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I can closely work with both experienced engineers and non-technical domain experts.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I have learned so much from every single one of my coworkers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I am relatively immune to any level of risk this early in my career.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This honestly just speaks to my insane privileges of graduating from a top school, having experience at big tech companies, and being a US citizen. I am quite thankful for these things.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cons of joining an ML startup</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Possibly being the only woman, potentially for a long time.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Bleh. True. No comment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>This is not the route to maximize expected earnings. I could get paid more at a larger company. Only in the small chance that the startup succeeds will I make a lot of money.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>True, but I now feel like this really isn’t a priority for me. Being in tech gives me the privilege of making a high salary wherever I go, and I think that <a href="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2019628,00.html">as long as I can live comfortably</a> (as I do now), I’m happy. Maybe this will change if I’m trying to buy a house or have a family.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>My technical accomplishments aren’t seen outside the startup.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This is somewhat false. I think there are some people outside my company who respect my technical abilities.</li>
<li>This point also doesn’t really matter too much, since<a href="https://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/"> one’s career involves more than just how prolific of a programmer they are.</a> </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I could be overworking myself.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I think this is true of any job. There are always opportunities to work more than you’re expected to. Also, as a new grad, <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-mistakes-which-software-engineers-make-in-their-early-years/answer/Edmond-Lau">optimizing for learning rate</a> can feel like overworking oneself, especially in the beginning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>If I don’t care about the specific application, I might not be motivated to do quality work.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Surprisingly, I don’t care too much about cars (my company’s application), but I am really, really motivated to solve the technical challenges my company faces.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>Thinking back to the fall of 2018, I remember how stressed I felt drafting my statement of purpose. I’m the kind of person who’s never fully confident in my decisions — there’s always a nagging <em>what if?</em> in my brain. I didn’t feel a magnetic pull towards academia. I also didn’t feel like I was destined to make a huge impact in industry. What does one pursue if they’re just…unsure? I felt this urge to apply to PhD programs — after all, I grew up in a college town, I’m a professor’s daughter, and most of my closest childhood and university friends are in PhD programs.</p>
<p>One of my older friends told me, “If you know what problem you want to solve, then find the place where you’re most likely to help devise a solution.”  <em>Robustness in machine learning models is something only academics are working on</em>, I naively thought at the time. So maybe a PhD was the right move. But as I drafted my statement of purpose, writing about how we needed to construct and solve relevant toy problems because it would be imperative to have safe and robust machine learning models in the real world, it seemed silly to me that I wanted to research this field when I had never actually worked on machine learning in the real world.  What new perspectives could I bring? Why should a school accept me?</p>
<p>My wonderful undergraduate advisor, <a href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/~hanrahan/">Pat Hanrahan</a>, urged me to consider working in industry for a couple years before going to a PhD program. I didn’t like the suggestion at first — what if I would never end up doing a PhD? “Well, then you’ve saved yourself five or six years! If you don’t want to do a PhD, you’ll find out eventually,” he laughed. </p>
<p>Pat had a point, so I started to look for industry machine learning jobs. Fortunately, since I had significant ML research experience for an undergrad, I could pick between many options. Did I want to do machine learning at a large company? Small company? Focus on a specific vertical?  I thought back to my machine learning project at Facebook, where I wrote a few lines of SQL to use a well-oiled tool called <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/core-data/introducing-fblearner-flow-facebook-s-ai-backbone/">FBLearner</a> to set up a gradient boosting classifier. I thought about machine learning at Google, where engineers write <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub43438/">Borg</a> scripts to throw lots of serialized data at one of many models in a zoo.

<p><strong>Die Corona-Warn-App funktioniert nach Recherchen von </strong><strong><em>tagesschau.de</em></strong><strong> auf vielen iPhones nur fehlerhaft. Besitzer werden oft zu spät gewarnt. Die Entwickler räumten das Problem ein - und sehen den Fehler bei Apple. </strong></p>
<p><em>Von Dominik Lauck, tagesschau.de</em></p>
<p> Fünf Wochen nach dem Start der Corona-Warn-App sind Probleme bei der Nutzung bekannt geworden. Nach Recherchen von <em>tagesschau.de</em> funktioniert auf vielen iPhones die Kontaktüberprüfung nur lückenhaft. Nutzerinnen und Nutzer wurden teilweise über Wochen nicht über die App informiert, ob sie Kontakt zu Infizierten hatten oder nicht. SAP, das die App zusammen mit der Deutschen Telekom entwickelt hat, räumte den Fehler ein.</p>
<!-- infobox -->
<p> "Da gibt es Probleme, und ich hoffe ganz stark, dass die entweder sehr, sehr schnell beseitigt werden oder wir einen wirksamen Workaround finden, (…) um trotzdem die Funktionalität auf die Beine zu stellen", sagt Thomas Klingbeil, der Software-Architekt der Corona-Warn-App bei SAP gegenüber <em>tagesschau.de</em>.</p>
<h2>Hintergrundaktualisierung wird nicht aufgerufen</h2>
<p> Woran hakt es? Auch wenn die Corona-Warn-App nicht geöffnet ist, soll sie im Hintergrund weiterlaufen und Daten aktualisieren. Wenn es eine Begegnung mit einer Person gab, die dann positiv auf das Coronavirus getestet wurde, soll das Handy den Besitzer eigentlich aktiv mit einer Benachrichtigung auf das erhöhte Risiko hinweisen. "Das Problem, das wir haben, ist, dass die Hintergrundaktualisierung vom Betriebssystem offenbar nicht aufgerufen wird", so Klingbeil.</p><!-- mediaCon-->
<p> Zuvor hatte die "Bild"-Zeitung bereits über ähnliche Probleme bei einigen Android-Geräten berichtet. Dort war die Hintergrundaktualisierung im Stromsparmodus nicht oder nur eingeschränkt möglich. "Das gilt nicht nur für die Corona-Warn-App, sondern für alle Apps auf diesen Smartphones", hieß es dazu aus dem Bundesgesundheitsministerium. Laut Entwickler ist das keine Fehlfunktion in der App, sondern hängt mit den Einstellungen bei den Geräten zusammen. Dies könne von den Nutzern geändert werden.</p>
<p> Das Gesundheitsministerium versicherte, dass die Anwendung "zu jeder Zeit" funktioniert habe. Wer seine Einstellung nicht anpasste, wurde erst beim Öffnen der App vor einem möglichen gefährlichen Kontakt mit einem Corona-Infizierten gewarnt. "Mit der Version 1.1.1, die am Mittwoch erschienen ist, können die Nutzerinnen und Nutzern, diese fehlerhaften Optimierungsfunktionen des Betriebssystems übersteuern", erklärte Jürgen Müller aus dem SAP-Vorstand <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/corona-warn-app-und-sie-funktioniert-doch-juergen-mueller">in einem Blogeintrag</a>.</p>
<h2>Problem bei iPhones noch nicht behoben</h2>
<p> Anders als bei den Android-Geräten ist bei den iPhones das Problem noch nicht behoben. Einige Nutzer berichten gegenüber <em>tagesschau.de</em>, dass an mehr als zehn aufeinanderfolgenden Tagen kein Abgleich erfolgte. Das heißt, sie wären im Extremfall erst zehn Tage später gewarnt worden, dass sie Kontakt mit Infizierten gehabt hatten.</p>
<p> Normalerweise werden die Daten in der App alle 24 Stunden aktualisiert. Wann genau steht unter dem Punkt "Risikoermittlung" beziehungsweise in den Einstellungen des Smartphones. Pro Tag sollen bis zu 14 Datensätze abgerufen werden - einen für jeden der zurückliegenden 14 Tage. "Wenn die App in den letzten zwei Wochen dauerhaft aktiv war, sollten Sie in der Regel 13 oder 14 Überprüfungen in den letzten 24 Stunden sehen", erklären die Entwickler. Die Zahl der abgerufenen Datensätze sagt nichts darüber aus, ob oder wieviele Kontakte die App mit anderen Corona-Warn-Apps ermittelt hat.</p>
<!-- infobox -->
<h2>Fehler liegt im Betriebssystem von Apple</h2>
<p> Die Entwickler haben Apple über die Lücken bei der Kontaktüberprüfung informiert, der iPhone-Hersteller habe den Fehler mittlerweile eingeräumt. Nach bisherigen Erkenntnissen befindet sich im Betriebssystem iOS ein Bug. Dort ist ein sogenannter Scheduler einprogrammiert, der dafür sorgt, dass die Corona-Warn-App im Hintergrund die Daten einmal täglich vom Server holt.</p>
<p> "Wir sind vollkommen auf ein regelmäßiges Funktionieren des Schedulers angewiesen", erklärt Peter Lorenz, Chefentwickler der Deutschen Telekom, gegenüber <em>tagesschau.de</em>. "Dieser Scheduler hat hin und wieder einen Schluckauf." Dadurch unterbleibe der Impuls, die Daten vom Server abzurufen.</p>
<!-- infobox -->
<h2>Ministerium räumt Fehler ein</h2>
<p> Das Problem haben die Entwickler nach eigenen Aussagen "vor einer Woche" bemerkt. Auch in der Schweiz, Österreich und Italien hätten die Programmierer der dortigen Corona-Apps entsprechende Probleme festgestellt. "Uns war nicht bekannt, in welcher Breite das Problem auftritt", so Lorenz.</p>
<p> Das Ausmaß sei erst an diesem Freitag erkannt worden, als sich die Entwickler nach den Berichten über die Android-Fehler auch das Apple-Betriebssystem genauer angeschaut hätten. "Die Entwickler arbeiten mit Hochdruck an einem Weg, die systembedingten Einschränkungen zu umgehen, bis Apple das Systemproblem selbst gelöst hat", erklärte das Gesundheitsministerium auf Anfrage. SAP-Sprecher Hilmar Schepp zeigte sich zuversichtlich, "bis Anfang der kommenden Woche" eine vorübergehende Lösung zu haben, den Bug zu umgehen.</p>
<h2>Codes werden weiterhin ausgetauscht</h2>
<p> Sowohl bei den Android- als auch bei den Apple-Smartphones würden jedoch auch ohne die Hintergrundaktualisierung anonyme Codes mit anderen Smartphones ausgetauscht, versichern die Entwickler. Allerdings wird ein Nutzer bei fehlender Hintergrundaktualisierung nur dann über ein Ansteckungsrisiko informiert, wenn er die App öffnet.</p>
<p> Wie viele Geräte von den Problemen betroffen sind, ist nicht bekannt. Insgesamt wurde die App in Deutschland bereits 16,2 Millionen Mal heruntergeladen. Noch am Nachmittag hatte das Gesundheitsministerium erklärt, das Problem mit der aussetzenden Hintergrundaktualisierung sei bei iPhones nicht aufgetreten. "Im Moment können wir sagen, dass es nicht alle Androidgeräte betroffen hat, sondern nur bestimmte", sagte eine Sprecherin.</p><div>

<h4>So können Sie die Kontaktüberprüfung abrufen</h4>
<div><p>In den Einstellungen Ihres Smartphones können Sie sehen, ob die Kontaktüberprüfung der Corona-Warn-App reibungslos funktioniert oder Lücken aufweist. Dazu sind folgende Schritte nötig:</p><p><strong>iPhone:</strong> <br>Einstellungen -&gt; Datenschutz -&gt; Health -&gt; COVID-19-Kontaktprotokoll -&gt; Kontaktüberprüfungen </p><p><strong>Android-Geräte: </strong><br>Einstellungen -&gt; Google -&gt; COVID-19-Benachrichtigungen an</p></div>

</div><!-- teaser -->
</div>

<h2>App soll Infektionsketten unterbrechen</h2>
<p> Die Corona-Warn-App wurde <a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/corona-warn-app-startet-101.html">am 16. Juni veröffentlicht</a> und ist in den Stores <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.rki.coronawarnapp">von Google</a> und <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/corona-warn-app/id1512595757">Apple</a> erhältlich. Sie soll helfen, Infektionsketten nachzuverfolgen und zu unterbrechen. Außerdem kann sie dazu beitragen, dass Menschen nach einem Coronavirus-Test möglichst schnell ihr Testergebnis digital erhalten und über die App anonym mögliche Kontaktpersonen warnen können, wenn diese auch die App installiert haben.</p>

                        <p>If the proximate purpose of technology is to reduce scarcity, the ultimate purpose of technology is to eliminate mortality.</p><p>At first that sounds crazy. But let's start with the premise: is the proximate purpose of technology to reduce scarcity? Think about how a breakthrough is described: faster, smaller, cheaper, better. All of these words mean that with this new technology, one can do <em>more with less</em>. In the digital world, Google made information on any topic free to anyone with an Internet connection, and WhatsApp made it free to communicate with the same. In the physical world, innovations like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process">Haber Process</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug#Expansion_to_South_Asia:_the_Green_Revolution">Green Revolution</a> allowed us to produce more with less. In a real sense, these technologies <em>reduced scarcity</em>.</p><p>Now for second half of the sentence, the logical implication. Is the ultimate purpose of technology to eliminate mortality? Well, mortality is the main source of scarcity. If we had infinite time, we would be less concerned with whether something was faster. The reason speed has value is because time has value; the reason time has value is because human life has value, and lifespans are finite. If you made lifespans much longer, you'd reduce the effective cost of <em>everything</em>. Thus insofar as reducing scarcity is acknowledged to be the proximate purpose of technology, eliminating the main source of scarcity – namely mortality – is the ultimate purpose of technology. <strong>Life extension is the most important thing we can invent.</strong></p><p>And it's actually feasible today. It's been shown that we can extend healthy lifespans in mammals – and even <em>reverse</em> aging to bring people back to youth. Here's <a href="https://twitter.com/davidasinclair/status/1259084270854905856">link</a> after <a href="https://www.longevity.vc/">link</a> after <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15174-3">link</a> after <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/11/researchers-able-to-improve-reverse-age-related-diseases-in-mice/">link</a> on the topic.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Six years ago, a lifetime in the aging field, the mere suggestion that aging could be reversed was enough to have your colleagues &amp; donors screw up their noses. Tom Rando <a href="https://twitter.com/StanfordMed?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@StanfordMed</a> deserves a shout out for being brave enough back then to use the word "reversal" openly 6/n</p>— David Sinclair, PhD (@davidasinclair) <a href="https://twitter.com/davidasinclair/status/1259912936602177536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>You probably weren't aware of this, though. You probably also weren't aware of how far we've come on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00339-3">gene therapy</a>, how much has been done in <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/rna-injection-restores-hearing-in-guinea-pigs-30855">regenerative medicine</a>, how advanced the latest <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2285-x">bionic eyes</a> are – or how <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1228447944287932416">deadly</a> COVID-19 was as a threat until March of 2020.</p><h2 id="a-duty-to-evangelize-technological-progress">A duty to evangelize technological progress</h2><p>That is because people with scientific and technical backgrounds have not taken it upon ourselves to write about technological progress <em>as a duty</em>. We need to take time out of our busy days to make the case, repeatedly and with high production values, that technological progress is the <em>most </em>important thing we can do for broad-based prosperity and economic growth, and for life itself.</p><p>That starts with testing, drugs, treatments, and vaccines for COVID-19. But it goes far beyond that. Put another way: we may not get life extension or the whole suite of transhumanist technologies (brain-machine interfaces, stem cells, CRISPR gene therapy, and more) unless you, personally, evangelize them online. Not just tweets, but articles. Not just articles, but videos. Not just videos, but feature films. And not just a few films, but an <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/how-long-would-it-take-to-watch-all-of-netflix/">entire Netflix original library's worth</a>, a parallel tech media ecosystem full of inspirational content for technological progressives. A lifetime's worth of content that makes the case for immutable money, infinite frontier, artificial intelligence, and eternal life.</p><p>This may mean less focus on the businesses and personalities of technology. After all, do we care whether the technology for reversing aging is developed by a startup, an academic lab, a scientific consortium, or a solitary biohacker in their garage? No. What we care about is the goal of transcendence. If the technology ends up being <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Patenting-Sun-Polio-Salk-Vacine/dp/0688094945">completely free</a> and open source, so much the better. A corporate vehicle is just one means to an end, not an end in itself. We may need to understand every detail of operating a business, but we can't get lost in those details.</p><p>The point of doing a startup after all is to build something you can't buy. Money can't yet buy you a trip to <a href="https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/">Mars</a>. Or a <a href="https://www.neuralink.com/">neural implant</a>. Or a <a href="https://tricorder.xprize.org/prizes/tricorder">medical tricorder</a>. And at one point in the not-too-distant past it could not buy you a web browser, a search engine, or a smartphone. When the iPhone did not exist, people had to invent it. And they needed to be inspired to invent it.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>for iphone 1:</p><p>the original mac,<br>blade runner,<br>2001: a space odyssey,<br>sony walkman TPS-L2, <br>braun ET66, <br>the concorde, <br>massimo vignale, <br>henry dreyfuss, <br>apollo 11, <br>the beatles,<br>warp records,<br>NASA,<br>polaroid,<br>arthur c. clarke,<br>eero saarinen</p><p>among others… <a href="https://t.co/F3ayC03T3y">https://t.co/F3ayC03T3y</a></p></div>— Imran Chaudhri (@imranchaudhri) <a href="https://twitter.com/imranchaudhri/status/1092194839540584449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><h2 id="a-sense-of-purpose">A sense of purpose</h2><p>Why doesn't inspirational content for technological progressives exist in abundance? Part of the reason is adverse selection. While science fiction – even dystopian science fiction – can inspire, the scientists, engineers, founders, and funders thus inspired are often more occupied with building technology than evangelizing it. But this in turn means that we aren't directly educating the next generation, or the public at large.</p><p>We need to change that. Specifically, people who know math and science, who have experience in managing and investing, who are <em>technological progressives</em> rather than technological conservatives – these people need to learn to write, report, publish, and direct. We need to consciously build a parallel tech-driven decentralized media ecosystem, and we need it to become the first point of call for anyone seeking to learn about technology.</p><p>In this we will have allies around the world. Only the very richest people can afford to be cynical about the merits of technological progress. The <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2019/5/28/the-end-of-mobile">billions</a> of people who just got their first smartphone have had their lives dramatically improved as a consequence, and are too pragmatic to romanticize the past. If you haven't already internalized this point, take two minutes to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpvEWVVnICE">this</a>.</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QpvEWVVnICE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Back? OK. So, building a media ecosystem for technological progressives clearly starts with technical education. At the K-12 level, we've already got plenty of learning apps, and the next step is remote schools. And at the level of collegiate education and continuous learning, Lambda School, Fast.ai, Coursera, Udacity, Udemy, Binance Academy, and the countless GitHub tutorials are an amazing start. But our duty extends beyond education to media of all kinds, particularly visual media.</p><p>The tech ecosystem has natural advantages here. We have the domain knowledge. And the experts at hand. We're already doing content marketing, podcasts, conferences, and a tweetstorm or two. We understand search engines, social networks, and distribution. And yes, we have learned to code.</p><p>What we haven't done yet is <em>full stack narrative</em>. That is, with a <a href="https://wistia.com/series/one-ten-one-hundred">few exceptions</a>, like Elon Musk, we haven't really told story arcs with technological progress at the center. We haven't taken the pitch we use to recruit engineers and externalized it for the public. We haven't infused <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1276010131990261761">emotion</a> and meaning into our public communications. We haven't made every one of our companies a media company. We haven't set out to tell our story ourselves.</p><p>We need to correct that immediately, and start evangelizing technological progress with every word and action. To recognize that the purpose of technology is to transcend our limits, and to motivate everything we're doing with a sense of that purpose. To take the winnings from our web apps and <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-did-Elon-Musk-fund-his-businesses-from-PayPal-to-SpaceX-and-Tesla">put them towards Mars</a>, to feel no hesitation towards starting small and no shame in dreaming big, to tell the world that it actually is possible to <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/rna-injection-restores-hearing-in-guinea-pigs-30855">cure the deaf</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2285-x">restore sight</a>, and <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2020/03/old-human-cells-rejuvenated-with-stem-cell-technology.html">end</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nXop2lLDa4">death</a> <a href="https://www.ldeming.com/longevityfaq">itself</a>.</p>

<p><strong>We ❤️ &nbsp; Old Underwear...</strong></p>
<p>They feel comfy, they fit our contours. Nevermind the holes and the old stains 🤢</p>
<p><strong>X11 is like Old Underwear.</strong> It's been around for 30 years... Yet we still use it in spite of its feature gaps and wonky quirks.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/PinePhone"><strong>PinePhone on Ubuntu Touch feels like... New Underwear.</strong></a></p>
<p>It runs Linux but it has none of the legacy X11 code. Because it's optimised for a great mobile experience with <strong>Wayland.</strong></p>
<p>But New Underwear feels uncomfortable. So today we'll learn Wayland and understand how apps are built with Wayland.</p>
<p>Hopefully someday we'll move on to newer, simpler app frameworks (like <a href="https://lvgl.io/">LVGL</a> and Flutter) as we discard our Old Underwear: X11, SDL, GTK, Qt, ...</p>
<p>The source code for this article may be found here...</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">X11</a> is the Graphical Display Service that runs on most Linux desktops and notebooks.</p>
<p>Let's hunt for the X11 Service on Pinebook Pro...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-pinebook.png" alt="X11 Service on Pinebook Pro"></p>
<p>That's the X11 Service... A <strong>2.2 MB</strong> executable named <strong><code>Xorg</code></strong>. </p>
<p>The X11 Service controls the rendering of Linux apps (as well as the keyboard and mouse input) like this...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-x11.png" alt="X11 Architecture"></p>
<p>(Adapted from <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/architecture.html">"Wayland Architecture"</a>)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>At the top we have the Linux programs running on our Linux machine: <strong>Terminal, Editor, Web Browser</strong>.</p>
<p>Each program renders its graphical display and transmits the raw graphics to the X11 Service (via a local TCP socket).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>X11 Service forwards the rendered graphics to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing_window_manager"><strong>Window Manager / Compositor</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The Window Manager / Compositor is provided by the <strong>Desktop Environment</strong>: Xfce, KDE, Gnome, ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Window Manager / Compositor wraps the rendered graphics into Display Windows and <strong>"decorates"</strong> them with scrollbars, title bar and minimise / maximise / close buttons.</p>
<p>The Window Manager / Compositor then draws the Display Windows into a <strong>Screen Buffer</strong> according to their screen coordinates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Screen Buffer is rendered to our screen by the X11 Service, talking to the <strong>Linux Display Driver</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any <strong>keyboard and mouse input</strong> is captured by the X11 Service, and forwarded to the programs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Why is X11 so complex? So many hops?</em></p>
<p>Because X11 was designed for Distributed Computing Systems.</p>
<p>Here's how I used (abused?) X11R4 at <a href="http://srg.cs.illinois.edu/">UIUC Systems Research Group</a> way back in 1990 (30 years ago!)...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-uiuc.png" alt="Distributed X11 System"></p>
<p>Thankfully things are a lot simpler now, lemme explain...</p>

<p><em>Do we need overlapping or tiled windows on PinePhone?</em></p>
<p><em>Do we need to need to decorate PinePhone windows with a title bar and minimise / maximise / close buttons?</em></p>
<p><em>Do we even need any windows on PinePhone?</em></p>
<p>No! Because each PinePhone app takes control of the entire screen!</p>
<p>PinePhone uses a simpler Graphical Display Service: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(display_server_protocol)#Wayland_compositors"><strong>Wayland Compositor</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Let's hunt for the Wayland Compositor on PinePhone...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-compositor.png" alt="Wayland Compositor on PinePhone"></p>
<p>That's the Wayland Compositor... A <strong>262 KB</strong> executable named <code>unity-system-compositor</code>. </p>
<p><em>Compare that with the 2.2 MB X11 Server on Pinebook Pro!</em></p>
<p>Here's how the Wayland Compositor controls apps and touchscreen input on PinePhone with Ubuntu Touch...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-arch.png" alt="Wayland Architecture"></p>
<p>(Adapted from <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/architecture.html">"Wayland Architecture"</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGL_(API)">"EGL API"</a>)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>At the top we have the apps running on our phone: <strong>Terminal, Editor, Web Browser</strong>.</p>
<p>Since each app runs fullscreen, only the active app will be rendered.</p>
<p>When then app starts, it queries the <strong>Wayland Compositor</strong> for the graphical display interfaces available. (They talk via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_file_types#Socket">Linux socket file</a>: <code>/run/user/32011/wayland-0</code>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wayland Compositor returns the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGL_(API)"><strong>EGL Interface</strong></a> to the app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>App calls the EGL Interface to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL"><strong>render OpenGL graphics</strong></a> directly to the <strong>Linux Display Driver</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Linux Display Driver forwards the OpenGL rendering commands to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit"><strong>GPU to update the screen</strong></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any <strong>touchscreen input</strong> is captured by the Wayland Compositor, and forwarded to the active app.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Wayland looks so much simpler and faster than X11!</p>
<p><em>Wayland is designed for OpenGL and GPUs?</em></p>
<p>Yes! And I lied about Wayland being New Underwear... Wayland is not really that New!</p>
<p>Wayland was first released in 2008 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(display_server_protocol)">11 years ago</a>)... Yet it was designed around OpenGL and GPUs, the same tech that powers our beautiful games today. (<a href="https://youtu.be/DNBk9hnPkTY">And websites too</a>)</p>
<p>Read on to learn how to render our own OpenGL graphics with Wayland and Ubuntu Touch on PinePhone...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-egl.jpg" alt="Rendering a yellow rectangle with Wayland and OpenGL on PinePhone"></p>
<p><em>Rendering a yellow rectangle with Wayland and OpenGL on PinePhone</em></p>

<p>Here's the function that calls OpenGL to render the yellow box above: <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-mir/blob/master/egl.c#L44-L60"><code>pinephone-mir/egl.c</code></a></p>
<pre><code>/// Render the OpenGL ES2 display
static void render_display() {
    //  Fill the rectangular region with yellow
    glClearColor(
        1.0,  //  Red
        1.0,  //  Green
        0.0,  //  Blue
        1.0   //  Alpha
    );
    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

    // Render now
    glFlush();
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>render_display()</code> looks exactly like normal OpenGL, and it works on PinePhone with Wayland! (Thanks to Ubuntu Touch)</p>
<p>Two things to note...</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>PinePhone supports a popular subset of OpenGL, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_ES"><strong>OpenGL for Embedded Systems</strong></a> Version 2.0.</p>
<p>OpenGL ES is optimised for Embedded Devices. It's used by many mobile and console games today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To render OpenGL ES graphics, we need to get the <strong>OpenGL ES Context</strong> and <strong>Window Surface</strong> from Wayland</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Before calling <code>render_display()</code>, we fetch the OpenGL Window Surface from Wayland like so: <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-mir/blob/master/egl.c#L167-L189"><code>pinephone-mir/egl.c</code></a></p>
<pre><code>/// Dimensions of the OpenGL region to be rendered
static int WIDTH  = 480;
static int HEIGHT = 360;

static struct wl_egl_window *egl_window;  //  Wayland EGL Window
static EGLSurface egl_surface;            //  EGL Surface

//  Create the EGL Window and render OpenGL graphics
static void create_window(void) {
    //  Create an EGL Window from a Wayland Surface 
    egl_window = wl_egl_window_create(surface, WIDTH, HEIGHT);
    assert(egl_window != EGL_NO_SURFACE);  //  Failed to create OpenGL Window

    //  Create an OpenGL Window Surface for rendering
    egl_surface = eglCreateWindowSurface(egl_display, egl_conf,
        egl_window, NULL);
    assert(egl_surface != NULL);  //  Failed to create OpenGL Window Surface

    //  Set the current rendering surface
    EGLBoolean madeCurrent = eglMakeCurrent(egl_display, egl_surface,
        egl_surface, egl_context);
    assert(madeCurrent);  //  Failed to set rendering surface

    //  Render the display
    render_display();

    //  Swap the display buffers to make the display visible
    EGLBoolean swappedBuffers = eglSwapBuffers(egl_display, egl_surface);
    assert(swappedBuffers);  //  Failed to swap display buffers
}
</code></pre>
<p>Functions named <code>wl_egl_...</code> are provided by the Wayland EGL Interface.  Functions named <code>egl...</code> come from the cross-platform <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/egl.html#:%7E:text=The%20main%20library%20(%20libEGL%20)%20is,directly%20dispatched%20to%20the%20drivers.">Mesa 3D Graphics Library</a>.</p>
<p><em>EGL vs OpenGL... What's the difference?</em></p>
<p>In Wayland, EGL is the Enabler for OpenGL. </p>
<p>Wayland only understands EGL and it will gladly hand us EGL objects... But it's up to us to transform EGL into OpenGL for rendering.</p>
<p>Thus in the code above, we take a Wayland Surface <code>surface</code> and transform it into an EGL Window <code>egl_window</code>...</p>
<pre><code>//  Create an EGL Window from a Wayland Surface 
egl_window = wl_egl_window_create(surface, WIDTH, HEIGHT);
</code></pre>
<p>Then we create an OpenGL Window Surface <code>egl_surface</code> from that EGL Window...</p>
<pre><code>//  Create an OpenGL Window Surface for rendering
egl_surface = eglCreateWindowSurface(egl_display, egl_conf,
    egl_window, NULL);
</code></pre>
<p>And we begin the OpenGL rendering...</p>
<pre><code>//  Set the current rendering surface
eglMakeCurrent(egl_display, egl_surface,
    egl_surface, egl_context);

//  Render the display
render_display();

//  Swap the display buffers to make the display visible
eglSwapBuffers(egl_display, egl_surface);
</code></pre>
<p>Here's how we create a Wayland Region for OpenGL rendering: <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-mir/blob/master/egl.c#L103-L112"><code>pinephone-mir/egl.c</code></a></p>
<pre><code>static struct wl_region *region;  //  Wayland Region

//  Create the Wayland Region for rendering OpenGL graphics
static void create_opaque_region(void) {
    //  Create a Wayland Region
    region = wl_compositor_create_region(compositor);
    assert(region != NULL);  //  Failed to create EGL Region

    //  Set the dimensions of the Wayland Region
    wl_region_add(region, 0, 0, WIDTH, HEIGHT);

    //  Add the Region to the Wayland Surface
    wl_surface_set_opaque_region(surface, region);
}
</code></pre>
<p>To learn more about EGL, check out <a href="https://jan.newmarch.name/Wayland/EGL/">"Programming Wayland Clients"</a></p>
<p>The Wayland EGL code in this article was adapted from that document.</p>

<p>Earlier in <code>create_window()</code> we called an <strong>EGL Context</strong> <code>egl_context</code> to render OpenGL graphics.</p>
<p>Here's how we get the EGL Context: <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-mir/blob/master/egl.c#L113-L165"><code>pinephone-mir/egl.c</code></a></p>
<pre><code>/// Wayland EGL Interfaces for OpenGL Rendering
static EGLDisplay egl_display;  //  EGL Display
static EGLConfig  egl_conf;     //  EGL Configuration
static EGLContext egl_context;  //  EGL Context

//  Create the EGL Context for rendering OpenGL graphics
static void init_egl(void) {
    //  Attributes for our EGL Display
    EGLint config_attribs[] = {
        EGL_SURFACE_TYPE,    EGL_WINDOW_BIT,
        EGL_RED_SIZE,        8,
        EGL_GREEN_SIZE,      8,
        EGL_BLUE_SIZE,       8,
        EGL_RENDERABLE_TYPE, EGL_OPENGL_ES2_BIT,
        EGL_NONE
    };
    static const EGLint context_attribs[] = {
        EGL_CONTEXT_CLIENT_VERSION, 2,
        EGL_NONE

        <h3>
About</h3>

<p>
Mathematical Components is the name of a library of formalized mathematics for
the Coq system. It covers a variety of topics, from the theory of basic data
structures (e.g., numbers, lists, finite sets) to advanced results in various
flavors of algebra. This library constitutes the infrastructure for the machine
checked proofs of the Four Color Theorem and of the Odd Order Theorem.
</p>
<p>
The reason of existence of this book is to break down the barriers to entry.
While there are several books around covering the usage of the Coq system and
the theory it is based on, the Mathematical Components library is built in an
unconventional way. As a consequence this book provides a non standard
presentation of Coq, putting upfront the formalization choices and the proof
style that are the pillars of the library.
</p>
<p>
This books targets two classes of public. On one hand newcomers, even the more
mathematical inclined ones, find a soft introduction to the programming
language of Coq, <em>Gallina</em>, and the <em>Ssreflect</em> proof language.
On the other hand accustomed Coq users find a substantial account of the
formalization style that made the Mathematical Components library possible.

<p>
	*** The Urban Archeology Program uncovered basalt slab floors corresponding to an open plaza in the Old Houses of Axayácatl, <em>tlatoani</em> of Tenochtitlan between 1469 and 1481.</p>

<p>
	*** INAH’s archaeological salvage project also detected the remains of the conqueror's dwelling, which later became the headquarters of the first Cabildo of New Spain and of the Marquessate of the Valley of Oaxaca.</p>

 

<p>
	Within the walls of the Old Houses of Axayácatl some of the most decisive episodes of the conquest of Mexico-Tenochtitlán occurred, such as the death of the <em>tlatoani</em> Moctezuma Xocoyotzin, possibly on June 29, 1520; unexpected outcomes that undermined the relationship between Mexicans and Spaniards and triggered the open confrontation.</p>

<p>
	The most recent discovery made by specialists from the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH), of vestiges of that pre-Hispanic palace, and of the remains of a later house built under the orders of Hernán Cortés, with reused materials from the previous Tenochca building, revives the memory of those historical events, five centuries later.</p>

<p>
	Thanks to historical sources, it is no mystery for archaeologists that under the floors of the Nacional Monte de Piedad, one of the most emblematic buildings of Mexico City’s Historic Center, located next to the Metropolitan Cathedral, are the foundations of the Palace of Axayácatl, which functioned as the living quarters of Cortés' entourage upon their arrival in the heart of Tenochtitlan.</p>

<p>
	Over the last two decades, and taking advantage of diverse remodeling projects undertaken in the headquarters of that institution, various INAH experts have found remnants of the former residence of Moctezuma II's father. The most recent discoveries were brought to light during archaeological interventions led by Raúl Barrera Rodríguez and José María García Guerrero, head and collaborator, respectively, of the Urban Archeology Program (PAU).</p>

<p>
	Following an inspection for refurbishments conducted in the northern half of the historic building, PAU personnel carried out an archaeological salvage project between the first days of September 2017 and mid-August 2018, focusing on the main courtyard and an adjacent room. It is noteworthy that the project continues to the present in the post-dig research phase.</p>

<p>
	Excavations resulted in the discovery of numerous basalt slab floors, which must have formed part of an open plaza in the Palace of Axayácatl, the ruler who controlled the destiny of Tenochtitlan between 1469 and 1481.</p>

<p>
	Also, from the early Viceregal period (1521-1620 AD), the remains of a house built by order of Cortés were uncovered. That construction, where the Spanish conqueror resided for several years, would also become the seat of the first Cabildo of New Spain (around 1525) and of the Marquessate of the Valley of Oaxaca, granted to the conqueror four years later.</p>

<p>
	<strong>The archaeological investigation</strong></p>

<p>
	As an exciting part of the public outreach program "Contigo en la Distancia” (“With you from a Distance”), from the Ministry of Culture, the head of the PAU, Raúl Barrera, and his collaborator José María García, explain that they dug 12 test pits - 2 meters per side and 1.50 m deep— around the main courtyard of the National Monte de Piedad, where remodeling work was being carried out to reinforce the columns that define the structure and support the first level of the building.</p>

<p>
	By excavating a series of test pits, on the north, east and west sides, the remains of a stone masonry wall - 1.50 meters high by 1.25 m wide - were uncovered. This wall served as a foundation and basal platform for a series of columns of the building erected around 1755, which allows us to deduce that the central courtyard was originally larger. Also, in the west section of this same space were found the subflooring: basal portions and a shaft of other columns from the early Viceregal period.</p>

<p>
	However, major surprises awaited in the adjacent room. PAU archaeologists had the opportunity to conduct an extensive excavation, which allowed them to locate the remains of a room made of basalt and <em>tezontle </em>(vesicular lava) dressed stones - 5 by 4 meters -, whose base sat upon a floor of basalt slabs. Further analyses led to the conclusion that this was the home of Hernán Cortés, once Mexico-Tenochtitlan fell in 1521.</p>

<p>
	Below the subflooring of the house of Cortés, more than 3 meters deep, the remains of another floor of basalt slabs, but from pre-Hispanic times, were detected. Given its characteristics, the specialists deduced that it was part of an open space in the former Palace of Axayácatl, probably a courtyard.</p>

<p>
	Barrera and García emphasize that the vestiges of the nascent Viceregal era correspond to reused materials from the Old Houses of Axayácatl. These premises, like so many other structures of the Sacred Precinct of Tenochtitlan, were destroyed by the Spanish and their indigenous allies, almost to their foundations.</p>

<p>
	As an example of this, embedded in the façade of the southeast interior corner of the colonial room, two pre-Hispanic dressed stones carved with sculptures in high relief were found. They depicted a feathered serpent (Quetzalcóatl) and a headdress of feathers, and must have belonged to a panel of the Palace of Axayácatl. Also, another Mexica sculpture with the glyph that symbolizes the <em>tianquiztli</em> or market was recovered, in its place as part of a shaft.</p>

<p>
	Some of the diagnostic materials, which allow the preliminary dating of these findings, are the remains of pre-Hispanic and colonial pottery, whose types (styles) belong to the aforementioned historical periods: Aztec III: Orange Monochrome, Black-on-Orange and Texcoco Burnished Earthenware; as well as glazed earthenware and Spanish and New Spain majolica.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Old Houses of Axayácatl</strong></p>

<p>
	Raúl Barrera, also a researcher at the INAH Directorate of Salvage Archaeology, reflects on the fact that some material evidence speaks volumes, by its very paucity. Such is the case for the recent discoveries in the National Monte de Piedad, which “speak” of the destruction that the main buildings of Tenochtitlan were subjected to, both for symbolic and practical purposes.</p>

<p>
	Despite the modest nature of the remains, those pre-Hispanic floors were the same ones that the Spanish invaders and their allies tread upon during their arrival to Tenochtitlan, on November 8, 1519. Moctezuma II allowed them to stay in the old houses that had belonged to his father, and soon after they turned them into their barracks.</p>

<p>
	While in that palace, numerous events took place. For example, they remodeled a room to celebrate mass, and right there, they also held various rulers captive, starting with their distinguished host: Moctezuma Xocoyotzin; as well as Cuitláhuac, lord of Iztapalapa; Cacamatzin,<em> tlatoani</em> of Texcoco; and Itzcuauhtzin, lord of Tlatelolco, among others.</p>

<p>
	Following on the massacre during the festival of Tóxcatl that took place at the Templo Mayor (“Great Temple”) on May 22 of 1520, by the order of Pedro de Alvarado, the Spanish withdrew and returned to the Palace of Axayácatl. That incident unleashed the anger of the Mexica and, at the end of June of that year, they besieged the invaders in that building. Hernán Cortés wanted to contain their fury through Moctezuma, who tried to placate them from the roof of the palace. But the efforts were in vain, as his brother Cuitláhuac had already been ordained the new ruler.</p>

<p>
	On the night of June 30, 1520, the Spanish fled to Tlaxcala by the great causeway of Tlacopan (today Tacuba), leaving behind the Old Houses of Axayácatl.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Cortés’ houses</strong></p>

<p>
	After the fall of Tenochtitlan, the surviving Mexicas were forced to destroy, with their own hands, their temples and palaces and build the new city using the same materials. The Old Houses of Axayácatl would gave way to the Houses of Hernán de Cortés, which were also the temporary headquarters of the first Cabildo of New Spain, around 1525, and of the Marquessate of the Valley of Oaxaca, a noble title carrying the responsibility for creating a government, granted in 1529 for his services to the Spanish Crown.</p>

<p>
	Upon the conqueror's death in 1547, his descendants retained ownership. His son Martín Cortés Zúñiga inherited the marquessate, but in 1566 he was involved in a conspiracy that sought to seize the government of New Spain, so he was expelled from the Viceroyalty. The houses and the extensive land remained in the hands of a legal representative and, already in poor condition, were sold to the Sacro Monte de Piedad in 1836.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      

<div>
  
    
      <div><p>In version 3.4, python shipped with a new module in the standard library,  <code>pathlib</code> . At the time of its release, I remember hearing some fanfare around it, but I didn’t quite understand the point of it. I had only recently stopped adding strings together to create paths to the files and folders I needed to work with, in favor of using the  <code>os</code>  and  <code>os.path</code>  modules. It took me a little while to experiment with it and plumb the documentation for useful&nbsp;bits.</p><p>Since then, I’ve learned a lot about the  <code>pathlib</code>  module, and as I have said before, <a href="https://everydaysuperpowers.dev/articles/pathlib-my-new-favorite-module/">it is my favorite module in the standard library</a>.</p><p>While that’s the case, most people I talk to about it are working to hard to access files and folders with python. Many have either not heard about it, or they still don’t understand&nbsp;it.</p><p>They still write code like&nbsp;this:</p></div>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">BASE_FOLDER = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <p><span>OK</span>, so there’s nothing wrong with that code per se, but most pythonistas would agree that your code should be readable. I would argue that  <code>pathlib</code>  could make that line of code more readable<label for="readable"></label><span>One could argue that it’s not necessarily more readable, if you’re not as familiar with it. So maybe I should settle for it being shorter?</span>&nbsp;:</p>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">BASE_FOLDER = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1]</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <div><p>I don’t know what your favorite module is in the standard library<label for="std"></label><span>Though, I would like to know what it is and why!</span> , but I imagine that most people don’t really think about&nbsp;it.</p><p>The reason why  <code>pathlib</code>  is my favorite module is that I have found it to be so very useful. And I really believe it can save you pain and effort in the months and years to&nbsp;come.</p><p>That’s why I created two resources for&nbsp;you.</p><p>The first is what I’m calling a “field guide” to  <code>pathlib</code> . It’s a standalone document, a little longer than one of my blog posts, that will introduce you to the module and some of its features I use the&nbsp;most.</p><p>I have also created a cheat sheet for the module, since there are over 40 useful properties and methods on a  <code>Path</code>  object, and I find that I could use a quick-reference guide to remind me of the ones I don’t use as&nbsp;often.</p><p>Look, I suggest the next time you are going to work with a file or folder, give  <code>pathlib</code>  a&nbsp;try.</p><p>It combines parts of the  <code>os</code> ,  <code>os.path</code> , and  <code>glob</code>  modules (and maybe more) in one useful&nbsp;package.</p></div>


    
  
    
      <h2 id="strings-arent-good-enough">
        <a href="https://everydaysuperpowers.dev/articles/stop-working-so-hard-paths-get-started-pathlib/#strings-arent-good-enough">Strings aren’t good enough</a>
      </h2>
    
  
    
      <div><p>One of the things I love about  <code>pathlib</code>  is that you are now working with an object instead of a&nbsp;string.</p><p>Strings are not the best way to work with data. You can’t ask a string what the name of the file is. Instead, you’ll have to come up with method to break the string apart and harvest that&nbsp;information.</p><p>One way to do that would be to use the  <code>basename</code>  method in the  <code>os.path</code>  module and split the&nbsp;result:</p></div>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">location = '/Users/chris/field_guides/pathlib.html'
file_name = os.path.basename(location).split('.')[0]</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <div><p>That works, but it’s not the most readable. You have to do some mental gymnastics to unpack the four different things that happen in that one line of code. It could be challenging for people who are new to&nbsp;python.</p><p>Instead, you could use a  <code>Path</code>  object:</p></div>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">location = Path('/Users/chris/field_guides/pathlib.html')
file_name = location.stem</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <p>Now, this is what I’m talking about! There’s no mental gymnastics to figure out how to split strings. There’s no having to remember what individual  <code>os.path</code>  methods do. It’s just simply asking an object what one of its properties&nbsp;are.</p>


    
  
    
      <h2 id="express-yourself">
        <a href="https://everydaysuperpowers.dev/articles/stop-working-so-hard-paths-get-started-pathlib/#express-yourself">Express yourself</a>
      </h2>
    
  
    
      <div><p>Since it frees me from directly manipulating strings, I find that  <code>pathlib</code>  allows me to be more expressive with the way I write code that interacts with files and&nbsp;folders.</p><p>I write less code, and my mind feels more able to think about the problem at&nbsp;hand.</p><p>For instance, you can easily reference all of the  <code>json</code>  files in the current&nbsp;folder:</p></div>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">json_files = Path().glob('*.json')</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <p>You can even safely open a file, load its contents, and close it in one&nbsp;line:</p>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">json_files = Path().glob('*.json')
for f in json_files:
    data = json.loads(f.read_text())</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <div><p>Even manipulating paths are easier with&nbsp;pathlib.</p><p>I see many people joining paths by adding strings together, like&nbsp;this:</p></div>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current"># not the best way to manipulate a path
root_folder = 'path/to/content/folder'
config_file = root_folder + 'config/config.json'</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <div><p>While this can work, it’s not the best way to manipulate paths, as this way will break if you ever run your code on a different operating system, as Windows uses back-slashes to denote paths. All other platforms use&nbsp;slashes.</p><p>Also, it’s easy to introduce bugs like I did in that code. I didn’t include a trailing slash in the  <code>root_folder</code>  variable. So the resulting path would look like this, and would probably&nbsp;fail:</p></div>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current"># result of previous code
'path/to/content/folderconfig/config.json'</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <p>The next best way to join paths is to use the  <code>os.path.joinpath</code>  method. This will handle the “bug” I introduced&nbsp;above:</p>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">config_file = os.path.join(root_folder, 'config/config.json')
print(config_file)
'path/to/content/folder/config/config.json'</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <div><p>While this is better, it still doesn’t address the cross-platform&nbsp;issue.</p><p>Thankfully,  <code>pathlib</code>  not only makes it even easier to join paths, but it also allow you to write code that works on every operating&nbsp;system.</p></div>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">root_folder = Path('path/to/content/folder')
config_file = root_folder.joinpath('config/config.json')</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <p>Additionally,  <code>pathlib</code>  gives you the option to write less code when joining paths. This is equivalent to the line&nbsp;above:</p>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">config_file = root_folder / 'config/config.json'</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <h2 id="its-your-turn">
        <a href="https://everydaysuperpowers.dev/articles/stop-working-so-hard-paths-get-started-pathlib/#its-your-turn">It’s your turn</a>
      </h2>
    
  
    
      <div><p>Look, you seriously should give  <code>pathlib</code>  a&nbsp;try.</p><p><a href="https://everydaysuperpowers.dev/resources/">Download my field guide</a>. Use it to get a basic understanding of how to use the  <code>Path</code>  object. Practice accessing files with it. Then, come back and download my cheat sheet, so you can better remember what attributes are at your disposal and be reminded of the ones you haven’t tried&nbsp;yet.</p><p>I’m confident you’ll enjoy working with files and folders more than you do&nbsp;now.</p><p>And also, let me know how you would improve these&nbsp;resources.</p><p>Thank&nbsp;you!</p></div>

<![CDATA[Bloom filters debunked: Dispelling 30 Years of bad math with Coq]]>

July 24, 2020 | https://gopiandcode.uk/logs/log-bloomfilters-debunked.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://gopiandcode.uk/logs/log-bloomfilters-debunked.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="text-org5efdc67">
<p>
There's this rather nifty feature of modern web browsers (such as
<b>Firefox</b> or <b>Chrome</b>) where the browser will automatically warn the
user if they happen to navigate to a "<i>malicious</i>" URL:
</p>

<p><img src="https://gopiandcode.uk/images/malicious-site.png" alt="malicious-site.png">
</p> 


<p>
While <i>conceptually</i> simple, this feature actually requires more
engineering effort than one would expect - in particular, tracking the
set of known malicious URLs in a practical manner turns out to be
somewhat difficult.
</p>

<p>
This is because, on one hand, trying to store the database of <i>all</i>
known malicious URLs, which, bear in mind, may contain <i>millions and
millions</i> of entries, is something that is just practically
infeasible for most users. </p><p><img src="https://gopiandcode.uk/images/database_local.png" alt="database_local.png"> </p>


<p>
Conversely, sending <i>every</i> URL that a user visits to some external
service, where it could be <i>logged</i> and <i>data-mined</i> by nefarious
third parties, is something that most users should
probably not be comfortable with.
</p>

<p>
As it turns out, browsers actually implement this functionality by
means of a rather interesting <i>compromise</i><sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
Using a probabilistic data structure known as a <b>Bloom filter</b>,
Browsers maintain a approximate representation of the set of known
malicious URLs locally.  By querying this <i>space-efficient</i> local set,
browsers will only send up a <i>small proportion</i> of the honest URLs.
</p>

<p><b><i>Use a Bloom filter to act as a local proxy for queries to an external database</i>.</b>
</p>


<p>
This proxy technique, which safe-guards the privacy of millions of
users ever day, depends on <b>two key properties</b> of Bloom filters:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>No false negatives</dt><dd>This states that if a query for an URL in the
Bloom filter returns negative, then the queried item can be
guaranteed to not be present in the set of malicious URLs - i.e
<i>the Bloom filter is guaranteed to return a positive result for
all known malicious URLs</i>.</dd>

<dt>Low false positive rate</dt><dd>This property states that for any URL
that is <i>not in the set of malicious</i> URLs, the likelihood of a
Bloom filter query returning a positive result should be <i>fairly
low</i> - thus minimising the number of <i>unnecessary</i> infractions on
user privacy.</dd>
</dl>


<p>
This mechanism works <i>quite</i> well, and the guarantees of a Bloom filter
seem to be perfectly suited for this particular task, however it has
one small problem, and that is:
</p>

<p><b><i>The</i> widely cited expression <i>for the</i> false positive rate <i>of a bloom filter is</i> wrong!</b>
</p>


<p>
In fact, as it turns out, the behaviours of a Bloom filter have
actually been the subject of 30 years of mathematical contention,
requiring <i>multiple</i> corrections and even <i>corrections of these
corrections</i>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Given this history of errors, can we really have any certainty in our
understanding of a Bloom filter at all?</b>
</p>

<p>
Well, <i>never fear</i>, I am writing this post to inform you that we have
just recently used <code>Coq</code> to produce the <i>very first</i> <b>certified</b> proof
of the false positive rate of a Bloom filter, finally putting an end to
this saga of errors and returning certainty (pardon the pun<sup><a id="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>) to a
mechanism that countless people rely on <i>every single</i> day.
</p>

<p>
In the rest of this post, we'll explore the main highlights of this
research, answering the following questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>What is a Bloom filter?</li>
<li>Why did these errors initially arise?</li>
<li>What is the true behaviour of a Bloom filter? and how can we be certain?</li>
</ul>

Structures", you can find the paper <a href="https://www.springerprofessional.de/en/certifying-certainty-and-uncertainty-in-approximate-membership-q/18186934">here</a>, and a video presentation of

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemprop="articleBody" id="content"><p>If your an engineer you probably spend a lot of time using a terminal.
Some of your best productivity gains will come from understanding it better and making small improvements to repetitive tasks.</p><p>Many people know the basics for default shell shortcuts like Ctrl+a and Ctrl+e to go to the begining and end of a line.
There are also a few keyboard shortcuts you’ve probably found by accident like Ctrl+s, Ctrl+z, or Ctrl+c.</p><p>Here are some keyboard shortcuts I use regularly that you might find helpful too.
I’m focusing on zsh because that’s my preferred interactive shell but many of these shortcuts will work in bash or other shells too.</p><p>If you want more shell tips, check out my mastering zsh workshop <a href="https://github.com/rothgar/mastering-zsh">https://github.com/rothgar/mastering-zsh</a>.</p><p>We’ll start with some basic keyboard shortcuts and get progressivly more advanced.
Many of these shortcuts are default behavior but some will need code added to your configuration to enable them.</p><h3 id="basics">Basics</h3><p>I’m amazed how long it took me to learn these keybord shortcuts and see that people still don’t know them.</p><p><code>Ctrl+r</code>: Reverse search through your command history.
Kinda like pushing the up arrow with search.</p><p><code>Ctrl+c</code>: kill/interupt the current running process.
If you don’t want it to print <code>^C</code> every time you press it you can add <code>set echo-control-characters Off</code> to your <code>~/.inputrc</code> file.</p><p><code>Ctrl+d</code>: Close your current terminal.
Same as typing <code>exit</code> but way shorter.</p><p><code>Ctrl+l</code>: clear the screen.
Similar, but slightly different, to typing <code>clear</code>.</p><p><code>Ctrl+z</code>: Suspend process.
This is really helpful if you’re in your editor and you need to run a command real quick.
Instead of opening a new terminal press <code>ctrl+z</code>, run your command, and then type <code>fg</code> to bring the command back to the foreground.</p><h3 id="delete-word-behind-your-cursor">Delete word behind your cursor</h3><p>If you have a command typed out or selected from your history with Ctrl+r you probably want to change one or two words from it.</p><p>First you can move your cursor back a word with <code>Alt+b</code>.
Press it multiple times to keep moving back.</p><p>Once your cursor is at the end of the word you need to change/delete press <code>Ctrl+w</code> to delete it.
If it doesn’t delete up to the characters you expect try setting your <code>$WORDCHARS</code> variable to characters that should be considered part of the word.</p><h3 id="don-t-repeat-your-whole-arguments">Don’t repeat your whole arguments</h3><p>If you need to move a file to something like a $FILE.bak you can do that easily with <code>{,}</code>.</p><p>Don’t do this</p><pre><code>cp ~/this-is/my-long-file/name.txt ~/this-is/my-long-file/name.txt.bak
</code></pre><p>Do this</p><pre><code>cp ~/this-is/my-long-file/name.txt{,.bak}
</code></pre><p>It works anywhere in the command too!
This will copy name.txt into new-folder (assuming it exists).</p><pre><code>cp ~/this-is/{my-long-file,new-folder}/name.txt
</code></pre><h3 id="enter-last-argument-from-previous-command-s">Enter last argument from previous command(s)</h3><p>There is a default shell variable <code>$?</code> which represents the last argument from the preceeding command (e.g. <code>echo $?</code>)
<code>Ctrl+.</code> is the keyboard shortcut to do the same thing.
Not only is it easier to type but you can push it multiple times to cycle through the last argument from previous commands.</p><h3 id="prepend-sudo">Prepend sudo</h3><p>I need this a lot.
You type out a command or find it from your history and need to run it with sudo but forgot it at the begining of the line.
Normally you would <code>Ctrl+a</code> type <code>sudo</code> then <code>Ctrl+e</code>.
This shortcuts does all that with a single shortcut.</p><p>Add this code snippet to your .zshrc
I prefer <code>esc, s</code> for the keyboard shortcut because it works well in vim mode and doesn’t clobber the default <code>Ctrl+s</code> shortcut.</p><pre><code># add sudo before command with esc, s
function prepend-sudo() {
  [[ -z $BUFFER ]] &amp;&amp; zle up-history
  if [[ $BUFFER == sudo\ * ]]; then
    LBUFFER="${LBUFFER#sudo }"
  else
    LBUFFER="sudo $LBUFFER"
  fi
}
zle -N prepend-sudo
# shortcut keys: [Esc] [s]

<p>Historically, US Presidents have entered the White House at a <a href="https://t.co/v8DD3uCI85?amp=1">median age of 55</a>. </p>



<p>Trump was the oldest ever to become president. If he is re-elected and serves a full second term, he would become the oldest sitting president of all-time (surpassing Reagan in his second term). If Biden is elected, he would become the oldest sitting president of all-time too, on his first day. </p>



<p>We are going the wrong way.</p>



<p>Bernie and Bloomberg were even older than Biden. Warren would have been older than Trump upon election. Of the 7 candidates who won at least 1 delegate in the Democratic Primary, 4 were in their 70s, 1 was in her 60s, and 2 were in their 30s. Isn’t it odd that none of them were in their 40s or 50s? It seems that the ages of our presidential candidate’s are becoming as polarized as their politics. There is no one in the middle! I want a middle candidate for president in terms of both age and politics.</p>



<p>In terms of approximating an appropriate age, 40s and 50s seem like a reasonable range. Cognitive function is certainly not all that makes a good president but it would seem to be a significant factor. According to a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614567339?casa_token=L29u1CmuY6gAAAAA%3AHwbJVxHMdjeQxoe1A1UcjnE-sTEy1YhbSyhlQic62On1RpUMpAd0JKWh7H2IvB3tj5dmN8nw2g4x&amp;journalCode=pssa">study </a>in Psychological Science, it does not look like anything good happens after 55. Of course, there is something to be said for growing wiser with age and other good arguments of that nature which are totally valid. I should clarify that when I say that nothing good happens after 55, I am stricly speaking in scientific terms of cognitive function for the average person. No offense to my elders (and sorry for calling you elders).</p>

<p>There are other studies that suggest the best age for decision-making and leadership tends to be during a person’s 50s. Of course, there are many exceptions. This is not an exact science applicable to every person by any means. Still, it seems like reasonable enough support to justify a solid range in which being too young or too old should almost never be an issue.</p>



<p>Politics completely aside, the age range of recent candidates like Yang (45), O’Rourke (47), Cruz (49), Rubio (49), Booker (51), and Harris (55) seems to be an appropriate one. They are all between 45 and 55 which presents an even narrower ranger than what I previously defined as 40s and 50s. Again, I am not saying that this is a range that our president needs to be within by any means, but it seem like a good age range to be within nonetheless. I may have issues with any or all of these candidates listed above but in no case are any of my top concerns in any way related to their ages. Same goes for Kanye (43).</p>



<p>It is helpful also to think about the best leaders our world has to offer outside of politics. I think it is safe to assume that the most successful companies tend to have some of the most successful CEOs.</p>



<p>Here are the ages of the CEOs of the 7 largest companies in the world:</p>



<ul><li>Microsoft’s Satya Nadella (52) </li><li>Apple’s Tim Cook (59) </li><li>Amazon’s Jeff Bezos (56) </li><li>Alphabet’s Sundar Pichai (47) </li><li>Alibaba’s Daniel Zhang  (48) </li><li>Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg (36) </li><li>Tencent’s Ma Huateng (48) </li></ul>



<p>The median age of those world-leading CEOs is 48 and the average is 50. Let us add Elon Musk into the mix for good measure. The man who is revolutionizing the auto industry and sending Americans to space is 48. Coincidentally, I would argue the president should be leading bothing of those efforts.</p>



<p>The point I am making is that we should not be debating the mental fitness of our candidates based on age. That does not mean that I would never vote for someone in their 70s. I just wish I had an electable option not to. Candidates in their early 30s and late 60s generally seem a bit young and old to me for the role of president, respectively, but I would certainly vote for the right candidate at 35 or 65, and even someone in their 80s if that individual candidate seemed great to me. I do not want to be written off as an ageist for having written this and if that is not a term yet I am sure that it will be soon. Just because I would generally want my football team’s quarterback to be in his 20s or early 30s doesn’t mean I would not prefer Tom Brady in his 40’s to most of the other quarterbacks in the league. It seems to me that 40s and 50s are good years of age to be had by the person in the most powerful position in the world, The President of the United States of America. </p>

<p>At the current moment, neural nets are trained once, in the “training phase” and then inputs are sent to them to test their intelligence. But as I sit here somewhat affected by cannabis, I realize that any sufficiently strong artificial general intelligence will have to have some type of analog of drugs just like we do.</p>



<p>Everyone likes to say that an AGI would be so much more powerful than ourselves. Now would you consider an AGI that was unable to take drugs superior to a human? The thing is that if we want AGIs to have parity with ourselves then any training that they undergo should be equivalent to any kind of questions that we ask them. Currently NN are the way they are because we’re exploiting AI for cheap computations. </p>



<p>Lets let’s rewind for a sec and ask a hypothetical question. What would happen if I took a human brain outside the body and asked it a question and then tried to extract the answer. Aside from all the complexities of encoding and decoding, we don’t know if the writes to the brain can be disentangled from the reads to the brain. It doesn’t seem like anyone has even asked the question: Does an AGI need to have both reads and writes intertwined in such a complex way to produce intelligence? Perhaps, this is the easiest way to produce AGI.</p>



<p>I believe self-modifying neural nets are the solution to AGI. Our current neural nets are designed as commodity tools for calculations – literally designed to eventually, after training, become a frozen set of, in GPT-3’s case, 175 billion parameters. I do believe if we want to have a chance with GPT-3 becoming AI, we will need to somehow pipe the results of its conversations back into itself..online training. Is this being considered at all?</p>



<p>Let’s put self modification back and allow our neural nets to take drugs. As silly as that sounds it really is the path forward. For neural nets that need to execute quickly, we can figure out ways to ignore the writes and only do the reads for performance reasons. We should start designing architectures based on self-modifying principles. Paradigms in AI need to change. ML can stay where it is if all it wants to do is model pure functions with non-linear pipelines of matrix operations.</p>

		<p>Ever since I can remember, I've been fascinated by understanding the universe. I began as a game hacker, tearing things down, taking them apart (figuratively, using Softice and Ollydbg.) I made mods for HL using Small C. And websites in PHP. I went to university for Biomedical Sciences but did not pursue an MD. I kept doing software development. I worked for many startups and then big name companies, like Amazon.</p>
<p>The corporate culture was not for me. Startup culture was not to my liking either, however better than the toxic culture at Amazon. I prefer to remain independent, although I would love to get a PHD in Pure Mathematics. It's tough to go back to school though I would love to.</p>
<p>In the last 5 years, I've switched gears to Mathematics and Physics. I bought many used textbooks and am in the middle of studying real/complex analysis. It is a steep hill to climb, but having learned computer science / algorithms, and read lots of Claude Shannon, Gregory Chaitin, Von Neumann, and other logician/computer scientist's work, has given me a unique perspective on the relationship between information, computation, physics, and life/consciousness. Many mathematicians can not even program. I feel it is a huge mistake when the subjects are so interconnected.</p>
<p>I have many ideas but the one I am seeking to fund is called Life. Most ambitious projects that aim to simulate OUR universe, fail for lack of computing power, and lack of a Grand Unified Theory - it's a fruitless and frail endeavor.</p>
<p>INSTEAD, I aim to reduce the necessary universal principles to ones that are necessary just for life to exist and sprout. This is not an easy task, and one can never be sure if one can create life. Perhaps our universe is very special and uniquely able to produce life whereas other configurations will fail. There is no way to know except to try. Even if we fail to produce life, there will be interesting behavior discovered.</p>

					<p><em>Google Play&nbsp;removes Boomerang Parental Control – I share our recent experience dealing with Google’s Appeals team.</em></p>
<h3>About us</h3>
<p>We are a team of three Dads with the combined goal of helping families start conversations with their kids about technology use. Over 5 years ago, the core features were built by our CTO based on his own family’s needs to limit his son’s time spent on his tablet. We innovated way before the big companies and continue to innovate having features that the big companies do not have. Now that everyone is aware of the essential need to ensure that our kids grow up with a balanced approach to technology usage, the big companies built their own tools with a massive competitive advantage: they own the operating system they want to control. In 2018, Apple made changes that saw&nbsp;us have <a href="http://useboomerang.com/2020/01/31/letter-users-apple-parental-controls/">difficulties supporting iOS devices</a>&nbsp;after announcing screen time features in iOS12.&nbsp;In early 2019,&nbsp;<a href="http://useboomerang.com/2019/03/13/boomerang-vs-google-re-call-sms-permissions/">Google also changed their permission requirements</a> for apps declaring Calls and SMS permissions which&nbsp;was used with parents’ consent for our calls and text message safety features (this guideline change resulted in us offering&nbsp;a <a href="http://useboomerang.com/download/">sideload download option</a>&nbsp;that continues to offer&nbsp;these safety features). Now in 2020, it seems Google is taking similar measures on Android with their Family Link app which is tied into your Google account. Below is a timeline of our recent experience with the Google Play Appeals Team who have shown a very inconsistent relationship with their developers and how they review apps. There were some very frustrated messages back to Google’s Appeals Team below as we strongly believe Google’s completely in the wrong with their assessment of our apps and leveraging their size and strength to force us into changing (which we have yet are still stuck in a Rejected state at the time of this post).</p>
<h3>Experience with Google’s App Review</h3>
<p>Compared to Apple’s App Store app reviews, Google Play app reviews are way more automated. In the past year we received a few false positives where we were rejected for Deceptive Behavior in <a href="https://useboomerang.com/">Boomerang Parental Control</a> and our other app, <a href="https://filterchrome.com/">Filter Chrome</a> because our app didn’t allow the user to uninstall our app “easily”. Please note our apps are designed to be installed on kid devices owned by parents and self-identifying pornography addicts with our Filter Chrome app. A prevent removal feature is key to keep these users safe and is employed by all competitors, including Google’s own Family Link. I call these false positives as when we would upload a new version, without any changes except for a higher version number, our update would pass and we would be fine for months after. I can confirm this is a fairly common practice by Google Play developers, including apps in our parental control category.</p>
<p>This May, we had a similar violation but our apps were completely removed from Google Play within a few days of our updates (these updates were bug fixes). We thought similar to our previous experience so we proceeded to upload another update in the same fashion… This time was different. As an Android developer, when we update our app, we will upload it to what is called the “Alpha Track” on our Google Play Console. This where our update will be published and only available as an “internal” version for us to test before releasing to the public (what is called the Production track). We had never had our Production version completely removed from Google Play before for an update we published in the Alpha track. We received the same robotic template reply with the same Deceptive Behavior violation but this time, Google’s App Review completely removed our Production app from the Play Store. No warning and an ambiguous message that they couldn’t uninstall our app. We tried the same previous method of doing a version update but this time we were completely stuck. Below is the full documented timeline of events in our experience – we feel we have been wrongly targeted here and need to bring visibility into this poor handling by Google which has also cost a month’s revenue so far.</p>
<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>
<p><strong>May 8th 2020:</strong> Our latest update (version 1257) gets flagged for <strong>“CAN’T UNINSTALL APP – Your app violates the Deceptive Behavior policy.”</strong> (screenshot below) The link to their policy does not state anything related to uninstall actions but mentions “<strong>Apps that modify device settings or features with the user’s consent but do so in a way that is not easily reversible.”</strong> There are no examples of what easily reversible looks like. Boomerang Parental Control, just like many other apps like us <span><strong>including Google’s own Family Link</strong></span>, have an easily reversible approach to turning off protection and uninstalling. The reality of parental control apps is, Parents do not want an easily removable app on their child’s Android device – this is a fact and product management 101. Plus, it’s with our user feedback that we added this feature several years ago so our app cannot be removed easily by a child – this is also a key component to any parental controls parent pay for. On some devices, it is not possible to fully lock in our app so we still offer a notification to parents when their child tampers with our app by either turning off specific permissions like the Device Administrator.</p>

<p><strong>May 11th, 2020:</strong> I filed an Appeal [3-0733000030602] with the Google Play Appeals Team. Based on previous experience, I also resubmitted an update to our app as a way to see if this was just an error by Google’s app review robots.</p>
<p><strong>May 13th, 2020:</strong> Our update gets approved (screenshot below).</p>

<p>At this point, we thought all would be fine just like previous experiences where we get flagged, republish an update, receive approval and stay live on Google Play. In this case, only until June 26th. This is when things started to really feel like targeting by Google’s review team.</p>
<p><strong>June 26th, 2020:</strong> I received the following message which flagged multiple versions of our&nbsp;Filter Chrome&nbsp;versions, many were archived and never released to the public.</p>
<p><img src="https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/24102905/06262020-FIlter-Chrome-versions-removal-1024x730.png" alt="06262020 - FIlter Chrome versions removal" width="960" height="684" srcset="https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/24102905/06262020-FIlter-Chrome-versions-removal-1024x730.png 1024w, https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/24102905/06262020-FIlter-Chrome-versions-removal-300x214.png 300w, https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/24102905/06262020-FIlter-Chrome-versions-removal-768x548.png 768w, https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/24102905/06262020-FIlter-Chrome-versions-removal-600x428.png 600w, https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/24102905/06262020-FIlter-Chrome-versions-removal-875x624.png 875w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"></p>
<p><strong>June 30th 2020:</strong> After 45 days of smooth operation (since our May 14th update), Boomerang Parental Control gets flagged again for the same ambiguous CAN’T UNINSTALL APP reason – 4 days after our&nbsp;Filter Chrome app gets flagged too for the same reason. I’m saying ambiguous as what is mentioned in the email (see below) does not share the language of the policy I’m supposed to use to make corrections to the violation. Furthermore, I know our competitors and <strong>Google’s own Family Link use the same approach</strong> that Google’s App Review says we are in violation of. This is absolute hypocrisy.</p>

<p><strong>July 2nd, 2020:</strong>&nbsp;I filed another appeal with the following message. For clarity, our prevent removal feature is not enabled by default without the user’s consent. The parent/guardian or self managing person using our apps must manually turn on our app protection.&nbsp;You&nbsp;cannot get a copy of your appeal message so I copied it this time.</p>
<p><em><span>Message sent in the Appeals form</span>: </em></p>
<p><em>We do not have anything in our Parental Control app Boomerang that has a prevent removal feature. Why the removal? Your guidelines are not being followed by your robots and I’m repeating myself again that your guidelines does not explicitly mention anything related to “CAN’T UNINSTALL APP”. I WANT TO TALK TO SOMEONE – NO MORE CANNED TEMPLATE REPLIES, PLEASE.</em></p>
<p><em>What are your robots looking for? Keywords in the metadata? User review keywords (which in our case come mostly negatively from kids who have their parents install our app on the kids phones that parents own!).</em></p>
<p><strong>July 3rd, 2020:</strong> I reactivated my Premium account on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jpayeur/" target="_blank">LinkedIN</a> and researched key contacts in Google Play’s Policy Team such as “Policy Leader” and “Policy Specialist”. I found about 20 whom I sent them a similar InMail message to the following screenshot below. Update July 22nd, 2020: I have yet to receive any feedback/reply from the people who create and manage Google Play’s Policies.</p>

<p><strong>July 6th, 2020: </strong>We had to inform our users about our difficulties with Google as inquiries were pilling in from them sharing that they were no longer able to find our app on Google Play. Our email was&nbsp;titled “<a href="https://us9.campaign-archive.com/?u=def604cc98ecfc90acf27aec4&amp;id=a786c3e4c0" target="_blank">Google has become Evil</a>”. We received several replies, including a few like the following:</p>
<p><em>Does this mean that my son will be able to uninstall boomerang from his device? If so, the program will be absolutely worthless to me!</em></p>
<p><em>Are you saying that there will no longer be any protection on uninstallation of the app? If so, what is even the point of the app? Is this going to be completely discontinued or just the Play Store version?</em></p>
<p><em>Removing the prevent uninstall option doesn’t make it worth paying for, obviously. Is this going to be fixed, or do I end my subscription and get the balance refunded to me?</em></p>
<p><strong>July 7th, 2020:</strong> I received the following message from the Google Play Team. My gut is now not feeling right (deja vu of <a href="http://useboomerang.com/2020/01/31/letter-users-apple-parental-controls/">our experience with Apple in 2018/2019</a>). My reply is included here too – <em>as of July 22nd, 2020, I have yet to receive any answers to my previous questions.</em></p>

<p><strong>July 8th, 2020:</strong> The following reply is received from Google. Google is now quoting various policies to build a case against our approach in protecting our app which is still allowed in many other apps recently updated on Google Play, <strong>including their own Family Link</strong>, a direct competitor to Boomerang Parental Control. Upon reviewing our app protection, we did find we could improve how the protection works to make it clearer to the user (typically a child, not an adult) on why the Device Administrator permission is protected. This mimicked many other apps I reviewed on Google Play so we made the change and pushed this update with the …</p></div></div>

<p>Iâ€™ve just been readÂ­ing <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/user/lukeprog/">Lukeâ€™s</a> <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/hN2aRnu798yas5b2k/a-crash-course-in-the-neuroscience-of-human-motivation">â€œCrash Course in the NeuÂ­roÂ­science of HuÂ­man MoÂ­tiÂ­vaÂ­tion.â€�</a> It is a useÂ­ful text, alÂ­though there are a few techÂ­niÂ­cal erÂ­rors and a few bits of outÂ­dated inÂ­forÂ­maÂ­tion (see [1], upÂ­dated inÂ­forÂ­maÂ­tion about one parÂ­ticÂ­uÂ­lar quibÂ­ble in [2] and [3]).</p>
<p>There is one sigÂ­nifiÂ­cant missÂ­ing piece, howÂ­ever, which is of critÂ­iÂ­cal imÂ­porÂ­tance for our subÂ­ject matÂ­ter here on LW: the effect of atÂ­tenÂ­tion on plasÂ­ticÂ­ity, inÂ­cludÂ­ing the plasÂ­ticÂ­ity of moÂ­tiÂ­vaÂ­tion. Since I donâ€™t see any other texts adÂ­dressÂ­ing it diÂ­rectly (cerÂ­tainly not from a neuÂ­roÂ­scienÂ­tific perÂ­specÂ­tive), letâ€™s cover the main idea here.</p>
<p>SumÂ­mary for imÂ­paÂ­tient readÂ­ers: foÂ­cus of atÂ­tenÂ­tion physÂ­iÂ­cally deÂ­terÂ­mines which synapses in your brain get stronger, and which arÂ­eas of your corÂ­tex physÂ­iÂ­cally grow in size. The imÂ­pliÂ­caÂ­tions of this provide diÂ­rect guidance for alÂ­terÂ­aÂ­tion of beÂ­havÂ­iors and moÂ­tiÂ­vaÂ­tional patÂ­terns. This <em>is</em> used for this purÂ­pose exÂ­tenÂ­sively: for inÂ­stance, many benefits of the CogÂ­niÂ­tive-BeÂ­havÂ­ioral TherÂ­apy apÂ­proach rely on this mechanism.<a id="more"></a></p>

<p><strong>I â€“ AtÂ­tenÂ­tion and plasticity</strong></p>
<p>To illusÂ­trate this propÂ­erly, we need to define two terms. Iâ€™m guessÂ­ing these are very faÂ­milÂ­iar to most readÂ­ers here, but letâ€™s cover them briefly just in case.</p>
<p>First thing to keep in mind is <em>the</em> <em>plasÂ­ticÂ­ity of corÂ­tiÂ­cal maps.</em> In essence, parÂ­ticÂ­uÂ­lar funcÂ­tional arÂ­eas of our brain can exÂ­pand or shrink based on how ofÂ­ten (and how inÂ­tensely) they are used. A small amount of this growth is physÂ­iÂ­cal, as new axÂ­ons grow, exÂ­pandÂ­ing the white matÂ­ter; most of it hapÂ­pens by reÂ­purÂ­posÂ­ing any less-used cirÂ­cuitry in the vicinity of the acÂ­tive area. For exÂ­amÂ­ple, our sense of sight is proÂ­cessed by our viÂ­sual corÂ­tex, which turns sigÂ­nals from our eyes into lines, shapes, colÂ­ors and moveÂ­ment. In blind peoÂ­ple, howÂ­ever, this part of the brain beÂ­comes inÂ­vaded by other senses, and beÂ­gins to proÂ­cess senÂ­saÂ­tions like touch and hearÂ­ing, such that they beÂ­come sigÂ­nifiÂ­cantly more senÂ­siÂ­tive than in sighted peoÂ­ple. Similarly, in deaf peoÂ­ple, auÂ­diÂ­tory corÂ­tex (part of the brain that proÂ­cesses sounds) beÂ­comes adapted to proÂ­cess viÂ­sual inÂ­forÂ­maÂ­tion and gather lanÂ­guage clues by sight.</p>
<p>SeÂ­cond conÂ­cept weâ€™ll need is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_somatosensory_cortex"><em>soÂ­matosenÂ­sory corÂ­tex</em></a> (SSC for short). This is an area of the (verÂ­teÂ­brate) brain where most of the inÂ­comÂ­ing touch and poÂ­siÂ­tional (proÂ­priÂ­oÂ­cepÂ­tive) senÂ­saÂ­tions from the body conÂ­verge. There is a map-like qualÂ­ity to this part of our brain, as evÂ­ery body part links to a parÂ­ticÂ­uÂ­lar bit of the SSC surÂ­face (which can be illusÂ­trated with silly-lookÂ­ing things, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sensory_Homunculus.png">senÂ­sory hoÂ­muncuÂ­lus</a>). More touch-senÂ­siÂ­tive arÂ­eas of the body have larger corÂ­reÂ­spondÂ­ing arÂ­eas within the SSC.</p>
<p>With these two in mind, letâ€™s conÂ­sider one acÂ­tual exÂ­perÂ­iÂ­ment [4]. ScienÂ­tists meaÂ­sured and mapped the area of an owl monÂ­keyâ€™s SSC which beÂ­came acÂ­tiÂ­vated when one of his fingerÂ­tips was touched. The monÂ­key was then trained to hold that finger on a tacÂ­tile stimÂ­uÂ­laÂ­tor â€“ a movÂ­ing wheel that stimÂ­uÂ­lates touch reÂ­cepÂ­tors. The monÂ­key had to pay atÂ­tenÂ­tion to the stimÂ­uÂ­lus, and was reÂ­warded for letÂ­ting go upon deÂ­tectÂ­ing cerÂ­tain changes in spinÂ­ning freÂ­quency. After a few weeks of trainÂ­ing, the area was meaÂ­sured again.</p>
<p>As you probÂ­aÂ­bly exÂ­pected, the area had grown larger. The touch-proÂ­cessÂ­ing neuÂ­rons grew out, co-optÂ­ing surÂ­roundÂ­ing cirÂ­cuitry in orÂ­der to achieve betÂ­ter and faster proÂ­cessÂ­ing of the stimÂ­uÂ­lus that proÂ­duced the reÂ­ward. Which is, so far, just anÂ­other way of showÂ­ing plasÂ­ticÂ­ity of corÂ­tiÂ­cal maps.</p>
<p>But then, there is someÂ­thing else. The SSC area exÂ­panded only when the monÂ­key had to <em>pay atÂ­tenÂ­tion</em> to the senÂ­saÂ­tion of touch in orÂ­der to reÂ­ceive the reÂ­ward. If a monÂ­key was trained to keep a hand on the wheel that moved just the same, but he did not have to pay atÂ­tenÂ­tion to itâ€¦ the corÂ­tiÂ­cal map reÂ­mained the same size. This findÂ­ing has since been repliÂ­cated in huÂ­mans, many times (for inÂ­stance [5, 6]).</p>
<p>Take a moÂ­ment to conÂ­sider what this means.</p>
<p>A man is sitÂ­ting in his livÂ­ing room, in front of a chessÂ­board. ClasÂ­siÂ­cal muÂ­sic plays in the backÂ­ground. The man is foÂ­cused, thinkÂ­ing about the next move, about his chess stratÂ­egy, and about the fuÂ­ture posÂ­siÂ­bilÂ­ities of the game. His neuÂ­ral netÂ­works are opÂ­tiÂ­mizÂ­ing, makÂ­ing him a betÂ­ter chess player.</p>

His neuÂ­ral netÂ­works are opÂ­tiÂ­mizÂ­ing, makÂ­ing the pain more inÂ­tense, easÂ­ier to feel, harder to igÂ­nore.</p>

<p><strong>II â€“ PracÂ­tiÂ­cal imÂ­pliÂ­caÂ­tions: makÂ­ing and breakÂ­ing habits, effiÂ­cacy of CBT </strong></p>
<p>HaÂ­bitÂ­ual learned beÂ­havÂ­iors are ofÂ­ten illusÂ­trated with the exÂ­amÂ­ple of drivÂ­ing. When we are learnÂ­ing to drive, we have to pay atÂ­tenÂ­tion to evÂ­eryÂ­thing: when to push the pedÂ­als, when to sigÂ­nal, where to hold our handsâ€¦ A few years later, these beÂ­havÂ­iors beÂ­come so auÂ­toÂ­matic, we hardly pay atÂ­tenÂ­tion at all. InÂ­deed, most of us can drive for hours while carÂ­ryÂ­ing on conÂ­verÂ­saÂ­tions or listenÂ­ing to auÂ­dioÂ­books. We are comÂ­pletely unÂ­aware, as our own body keeps pushÂ­ing pedÂ­als, sigÂ­nalÂ­ing turns, and changÂ­ing gears.</p>
<p>We can thereÂ­fore say that <em>drivÂ­ing beÂ­havÂ­iors</em>, through pracÂ­tice and atÂ­tenÂ­tion, evenÂ­tuÂ­ally beÂ­come auÂ­toÂ­matic â€“ which is, most of the time, a good thing. But so do many other things, inÂ­cludÂ­ing some deÂ­strucÂ­tive ones we might want to get rid of. Letâ€™s take a simÂ­ple one: nail bitÂ­ing. You are readÂ­ing, or watchÂ­ing a movie, or thinkÂ­ing, or drivÂ­ingâ€¦ when you sudÂ­denly noÂ­tice some minor pain, and reÂ­alÂ­ize that you have chewed your nail into a ragged stump. Ouch!</p>
<p>You catch yourÂ­self bitÂ­ing, you stop. Five minÂ­utes later, you catch yourÂ­self bitÂ­ing again. You stop again. ReÂ­peat <em>ad inÂ­finiÂ­tum</em>, or <em>ad nauÂ­seam</em>, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>CogÂ­niÂ­tive-BeÂ­havÂ­ioral TherÂ­apy has a highly sucÂ­cessÂ­ful apÂ­proach for breakÂ­ing habits, which reÂ­quires only a very subÂ­tle alÂ­terÂ­aÂ­tion to this proÂ­cess. You noÂ­tice that you are bitÂ­ing your nails. You imÂ­meÂ­diÂ­ately foÂ­cus your atÂ­tenÂ­tion on what you are doÂ­ing, and you stop doÂ­ing it. No rage, no blamÂ­ing yourÂ­self, no negaÂ­tive emoÂ­tions. You just stop, and you foÂ­cus all the atÂ­tenÂ­tion you can on the act of stopÂ­ping. You move your arm down, foÂ­cusÂ­ing your atÂ­tenÂ­tion on the act of moveÂ­ment, on the feelÂ­ing of your arm goÂ­ing down, away from your mouth. Thatâ€™s it. You can go back to whatÂ­ever you were doÂ­ing.</p>
<p>Five minÂ­utes later, you noÂ­tice yourÂ­self bitÂ­ing your nails again. You calmly reÂ­peat the proÂ­ceÂ­dure again.</p>
<p>By doÂ­ing this, you are trainÂ­ing yourÂ­self to perform a new beÂ­havÂ­ior â€“ the â€œstop and put the hand downâ€� beÂ­havÂ­ior â€“ which is itÂ­self trigÂ­gered by the nail-bitÂ­ing beÂ­havÂ­ior. As you go along, you will get betÂ­ter and betÂ­ter at noticÂ­ing that you have started to bite your nails. You will also get betÂ­ter and betÂ­ter at stopÂ­ping and putting your hand down. After a while, this will beÂ­come semi-auÂ­toÂ­matic; youâ€™ll noÂ­tice that your hand went to your mouth, a nail touched your tooth, and the hand went back down beÂ­fore you could do anyÂ­thing. Donâ€™t stop trainÂ­ing: foÂ­cus your atÂ­tenÂ­tion on the â€œstop and dropâ€� part of the acÂ­tion.</p>
<p>After a while, the nail-bitÂ­ing simÂ­ply goes away. Of course, the more comÂ­plex and more inÂ­grained a habit is, the more effort and time will be needed to break it. But for most peoÂ­ple, even strong habits can be relÂ­aÂ­tively quickly weakÂ­ened, or rediÂ­rected into less deÂ­strucÂ­tive beÂ­havÂ­iors.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s probÂ­aÂ­bly obÂ­viÂ­ous that habits can be <em>creÂ­ated</em> in this way as well. We donâ€™t beÂ­come betÂ­ter at things we do â€“ we beÂ­come betÂ­ter at things we <em>pay atÂ­tenÂ­tion to while weâ€™re doÂ­ing them.</em> If you want to make exÂ­erÂ­cise a habit, your efforts will be much more effecÂ­tive if you foÂ­cus your atÂ­tenÂ­tion on your exÂ­erÂ­cise techÂ­nique, rather than reÂ­peatÂ­edly thinkÂ­ing how painful and tiring the whole proÂ­cess is.</p>
<p>There is also a diÂ­rect imÂ­pliÂ­caÂ­tion for trainÂ­ing in any comÂ­plex skill. Start with the well-known <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve">learnÂ­ing curve</a> effect: we gain a lot of skill relÂ­aÂ­tively quickly, and then imÂ­proveÂ­ments slow down inÂ­creÂ­menÂ­tally as we apÂ­proach our maxÂ­iÂ­mum poÂ­tenÂ­tial skill level. It is relÂ­aÂ­tively easy to go from a poor to a mediocre tenÂ­nis player; it is much, much harder to go from mediocre to good, and even harder to go from good to exÂ­celÂ­lent.</p>
<p>ComÂ­plex skills have many differÂ­ent asÂ­pects, which we usuÂ­ally atÂ­tempt to train siÂ­mulÂ­taÂ­neously. We can beÂ­come very good at some, while stayÂ­ing poor at othÂ­ers. The opÂ­tiÂ­mal apÂ­proach would be to foÂ­cus most of our atÂ­tenÂ­tion on those asÂ­pects where our abilÂ­ities are weakÂ­est, since smaller inÂ­vestÂ­ments of time and effort will lead to larger imÂ­proveÂ­ments in skill.</p>

<p>In our society we revere scientists far more than we revere historians. Consequently, people are often more willing to listen to what scientists say about history than what historians say about history. Unfortunately, often times, when scientists try to speak or write about history, they make glaring mistakes.</p>



<p>For instance, I have already written extensively about how the 1980 television miniseries <em>Cosmos: A Personal Voyage</em>, written and presented by the astronomer and astrophysicist Carl Sagan,<em> </em><a href="http://talesoftimesforgotten.com/2020/02/05/carl-sagan-was-really-bad-at-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promoted all sorts of</a> egregious misconceptions <a href="http://talesoftimesforgotten.com/2018/08/06/who-was-hypatia-of-alexandria-really/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about the Neoplatonist philosopher Hypatia</a> and <a href="http://talesoftimesforgotten.com/2019/07/03/misconceptions-about-the-library-of-alexandria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about the supposed destruction of the Library of Alexandria</a>.</p>



<p>The book <em>The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined</em>, written by the linguist and psychologist Steven Pinker is one that has been bothering me for a long time. I promised that I would write an article about it in <a href="https://talesoftimesforgotten.com/2019/12/28/how-violent-was-the-pre-modern-world-really/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this article I wrote last year about violence in the pre-modern world</a>, but I have been holding back until now because I am aware of how popular the book is and what an impact it has had on so many people’s lives.</p>



<p>Bill Gates, for instance, described it in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122115732/http://www.thegatesnotes.com/Books/Personal/The-Better-Angels-of-Our-Nature" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a review</a> as “one of the most important books I’ve read – not just this year, but ever.” Unfortunately, this book is filled with all kinds of historical inaccuracies and I think it promotes some ideas that, while they may seem comforting in the short-term, are actually deleterious in the long-run.</p>



<p><strong>Pinker’s basic argument</strong></p>



<p>In case you are unfamiliar with the book, Pinker’s basic historical argument is that all of human history up until the Early Modern Period is a chronicle of superstition, backwardness, barbarity, and relentless, inhuman cruelty. He contends that life in the pre-modern world was, to quote Thomas Hobbes, whom Pinker displays a professed fondness for, “nasty, brutish, and short”; violence was an unavoidable part of everyday life and no one even considered the idea that it was bad.</p>



<p>Then, Pinker contends, in western Europe during the Early Modern Period, people started to become civilized and then the Enlightenment happened and everything has been getting better ever since. Pinker says that, over the past few centuries, humanity has made stunning and remarkable progress in all areas. According to Pinker, we are currently living in the best, most peaceful, most prosperous time in all of human history and things are only getting better overall.</p>



<p>It is easy to see why this story is so appealing. There is a rugged, Whiggish simplicity to it. Furthermore, it is a <em>comforting </em>narrative in which we are not only clearly superior to our ancestors in every way, but also clearly heading in the right direction. It is a real shame that this whole narrative is riddled with inaccuracies and oversimplifications.</p>



<p>Because I do not have time to write a response to Pinker’s entire book, I will focus this review primarily on the sections in the first few chapters dealing with ancient and medieval history. Before I get into it, though, I want to make very clear that I am not disputing Pinker’s argument that violence was generally more common in the ancient and medieval worlds than it is today. What I am disputing, however, is Pinker’s overall portrayal of the ancient and medieval worlds.</p>



<p>From reading Pinker’s book, one comes away with the impression that everyone in pre-modern times was a brutal monster, gratuitous violence was an extremely common, unavoidable part of everyday life, and no one even considered that things like rape, torture, and genocide might be wrong. This is very much an inaccurate portrayal that is rooted in Pinker’s extensive and largely uncritical reliance on a small number of unreliable sources and works of outright fiction.</p>

<p><em>ABOVE: Image of one version of the front cover of Pinker’s bestselling book</em></p>



<p><strong>Pinker’s assessment of prehistoric societies</strong></p>



<p>In his book, Pinker presents the traditionally widely accepted view that prehistoric nomadic societies were unbelievably violent and almost constantly at war. This is very much the traditional view that most scholars have had of prehistoric societies. Prehistory is not my main area of expertise, so I will not dwell on it too much, but I will note that the traditional view advanced by Pinker has been challenged in recent years.</p>



<p>For instance, here’s <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/341/6143/270" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a paper by Douglas Fry and Patrik Söderberg published in July 2013 </a>that looks at lethal aggression in twenty-one contemporary nomadic hunter-gatherer societies. The paper concludes that, in general, these societies are far less violent than has traditionally been thought. They also observe that most documented cases of lethal aggression in these societies were classifiable as homicides committed by a single person against another person and that actual wars between hunter-gatherer tribes were quite rare.</p>



<p>My view is that the data just isn’t clear enough to make any pronouncements about how violent prehistoric cultures were, since our evidence of these cultures is extremely limited. Also, we need to be willing to recognize that there may have been significant variation in how violent these societies were; just because <em>some</em> hunter-gatherer groups were extremely violent doesn’t mean they all were.</p>



<p><strong>Pinker’s assessment of ancient Greece</strong></p>



<p>Pinker’s description of ancient Greek warfare is almost totally reliant on the portrayal of war in the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em>. The <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey </em>are, however, works of fiction and they are not in any sense accurate reflections of what warfare in archaic Greece was really like. Classicists have known this for at least a century.</p>



<p>For instance, as I discuss in <a href="http://talesoftimesforgotten.com/2019/03/13/did-the-trojan-war-really-happen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this article I wrote in March 2019 about the historicity of the Trojan War</a>, the author of the<em> Iliad </em>seems to have had no idea how chariots were used in Bronze Age warfare. At the time when the <em>Iliad</em> was composed, chariots were no longer used for warfare, but the author of the <em>Iliad</em> seems to have had a vague impression that they had been used for warfare at some point in the past.</p>



<p>Thus, the author of the <em>Iliad</em> imagines chariots being used almost like golf carts, with the warriors riding the chariots to the site of the battle and then disembarking in order to fight on foot in hand-to-hand combat. In historical reality, it seems that warriors who had chariots actually fought in those chariots. Indeed, that was the whole advantage of having a chariot. The <em>Iliad </em>therefore portrays chariots being used in warfare in a way that they were probably never really used.</p>



<p>Fantastic and mythological elements appear all throughout the <em>Iliad</em>. For instance, deities are constantly intervening in the conflict, Achilles’s horses Balios and Xanthos can talk, and heroes are described as lifting massive boulders that no man alive in the poet’s age could lift. In Book Twenty-One of the <em>Iliad</em>, Achilles literally fights a river god who is mad about him dumping so many corpses into his waters. These poems were composed for entertainment, not to accurately document what Bronze Age warfare was really like.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-05da7d3c3be414703c01282240ffaaa6" alt=""></figure></div>



<p><em>ABOVE: Painting of Achilleus fighting the god of the river Skamandros, a scene from Book Twenty-One of the </em>Iliad<em>, painted in 1737 by the French painter Charles-Antoine Coypel. The</em> Iliad <em>is primarily a work of fantasy, not of history.</em></p>



<p>Citing the<em> Iliad </em>and the <em>Odyssey</em> as evidence that archaic Greek culture was exceptionally violent is like citing modern violent films as proof that contemporary American society is exceptionally violent. Humans have <em>always</em> told stories involving graphic violence; we still tell stories involving graphic violence today and we will probably still be telling stories involving graphic violence in a thousand years. All that these stories prove is that humans in general have a fascination with stories of violence.</p>



<p>Pinker’s analysis of what life was like in ancient Greece relies heavily on Johnathan Gottschall, a literary scholar who, as best as I can tell, has no formal background in history or classical studies in particular. In the entire section, Pinker does not even reference a single ancient Greek historical source or a single classicist.</p>



<p>In response to the argument that ancient Greek warfare was generally less deadly than modern warfare because people in ancient Greece were fighting with spears and swords rather than with “machine guns, artillery, bombers, and other long-distance weaponry,” Pinker merely quotes a graphic description from Gottschall of people getting slaughtered with spears and dismisses the issue.</p>



<p>It baffles me that Pinker could somehow think this even constitutes an argument; one graphic description of slaughter from a modern literary critic based on the <em>Iliad</em>, a work of fiction, does not constitute as proof that a spear is as deadly as a machine gun.</p>



<p>Ironically, one piece of historical evidence that we can perhaps gather from the Homeric poems is that many of the original listeners of these poems had probably never seen an actual battle first-hand; the poet frequently describes men fighting using similes comparing them to everyday scenes from the natural world, especially of animals, which many scholars have suspected is because the poet was trying to conjure up images of what a battle might look like for those who had never seen one.</p>

<p>Now, of course, in historical reality, the ancient Greeks <em>were</em> capable of being quite violent, but I think Pinker’s portrayal leaves a rather significant misimpression of just how violent life in ancient Greece really was.</p>



<p>Archaic Greek warfare was much smaller-scale than modern warfare and, in most cases, probably resulted in a lot fewer deaths. Battles were usually rather small-scale, with armies most often being composed of only a few hundred men at most, and they were usually fought over land. It was not a common occurrence for a city to be sacked and burned like the …</p></div></div>

    <p>One of the first things we did in setting up the company was create a repo
named "rfd." This repo houses our requests for discussion. Bryan teased this to
the internet...</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">To the point of this piece, the first thing we actually built at <a href="https://twitter.com/oxidecomputer?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@oxidecomputer</a> was infrastructure for design documentation and discussion -- which, like many problems, is peskier than it might seem! <a href="https://t.co/w8ecNNUN0I">https://t.co/w8ecNNUN0I</a></p>— Bryan Cantrill (@bcantrill) <a href="https://twitter.com/bcantrill/status/1286005213065703424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<p>...and folks asked for our process, so we are going to share it!</p>
<p>The best way to
describe RFDs is with "RFD 1 Requests for Discussion." Below is that RFD.</p>

<p>Writing down ideas is important:  it allows them to be rigorously formulated
(even while nascent), candidly discussed and transparently shared.
We capture the written expression of an idea in a <strong>Request for Discussion</strong>
(RFD), a document in the original spirit of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments">IETF Request for Comments</a>,
as expressed by <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3">RFC 3</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The content of a note may be any thought, suggestion, etc.
related to the software or other aspect of the network.
Notes are encouraged to be timely rather than polished.
Philosophical positions without examples or other specifics, specific suggestions
or implementation techniques without introductory or background explication, and
explicit questions without any attempted answers are all acceptable.
The minimum length for a note is one sentence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>These standards (or lack of them) are stated explicitly for two reasons.
First, there is a tendency to view a written statement as ipso facto authoritative,
and we hope to promote the exchange and discussion of considerably less than
authoritative ideas.
Second, there is a natural hesitancy to publish something unpolished,
and we hope to ease this inhibition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar to RFCs, our philosophy of RFDs is to allow both timely discussion of
rough ideas, while still becoming a permanent repository for more established ones.
Depending on their state, RFDs may be quickly iterated on in a branch,
discussed actively as part of a pull request to be merged, or commented upon
after having been published.
The workflow for the RFD process for is based upon those of the Golang
proposal process, Joyent RFD process, Rust RFC process, and Kubernetes
proposal process.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use-an-rfd">When to use an RFD</h2>
<p>The following are examples of when an RFD is appropriate, these are intended to
be broad:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add or change a company process</li>
<li>An architectural or design decision for hardware or software</li>
<li>Change to an API or command-line tool used by customers</li>
<li>Change to an internal API or tool</li>
<li>Change to an internal process</li>
<li>A design for testing</li>
</ul>
<p>RFDs not only apply to technical ideas but overall company ideas and processes
as well.
If you have an idea to improve the way something is being done as a company,
you have the power to make your voice heard by adding to discussion.</p>

<p>At the start of every RFD document, we'd like to include a brief amount of metadata.
The metadata format is based on the
<a href="https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/wiki/metadata">python-markdown2</a> metadata format.
It'd look like:</p>
<pre><code>---
authors: Andy Smith &lt;andy@example.computer&gt;, Neal Jones &lt;neal@example.computer&gt;
state: prediscussion
---
</code></pre>
<p>We keep track of three pieces of metadata:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>authors</code>: The authors (and therefore owners) of an RFD.
They should be listed with their name and e-mail address.</li>
<li><code>state</code>: Must be one of the states discussed below.</li>
<li><code>discussion</code>: For RFDs that are in or beyond the <code>discussion</code> state, this should be a link to the PR to integrate the RFD;
see below for details.</li>
</ol>
<p>An RFD can be in one of the following six states:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>prediscussion</code></li>
<li><code>ideation</code></li>
<li><code>discussion</code></li>
<li><code>published</code></li>
<li><code>committed</code></li>
<li><code>abandoned</code></li>
</ol>
<p>A document in the <code>prediscussion</code> state indicates that the work is not yet
ready for discussion, but that the RFD is effectively a placeholder.
The <code>prediscussion</code> state signifies that work iterations are being done
quickly on the RFD in its branch in order to advance the RFD to the <code>discussion</code> state.</p>
<p>A document in the <code>ideation</code> state contains only a description of the topic
that the RFD will cover, providing an indication of the scope of the eventual
RFD. Unlike the <code>prediscussion</code> state, there is no expectation that is
undergoing active revision. Such a document is scratchpad for related ideas.
Any member of the team is encouraging to start active development of such an
RFD (moving it to the prediscussion state) with or without the participation
of the original author. It is critical that RFDs in the <code>ideation</code> state are
clear and narrowly defined.</p>
<p>Documents under active discussion should be in the <code>discussion</code> state.
At this point a discussion is being had for the RFD in a Pull Request.</p>
<p>Once (or if) discussion has converged and the Pull Request is ready to be merged,
it should be updated to the <code>published</code> state before merge.
Note that just because something is in the <code>published</code> state does not mean that
it cannot be updated and corrected.
See the  <a href="#making-changes-to-an-rfd">Making changes to an RFD</a> section for more
information.</p>
<p>The <code>prediscussion</code> state should be viewed as essentially a collaborative
extension of an engineer's notebook, and the <code>discussion</code> state should be used
when an idea is being actively discussed.
These states shouldn't be used for ideas that have been committed to,
organizationally or otherwise;
by the time an idea represents the consensus or direction, it should be in
the <code>published</code> state.</p>
<p>Once an idea has been entirely implemented, it should be in the <code>committed</code> state.
Comments on ideas in the <code>committed</code> state should generally be raised as issues --
but if the comment represents a call for a significant divergence from or
extension to committed functionality, a new RFD may be called for;
as in all things, use your best judgment.</p>
<p>Finally, if an idea is found to be non-viable (that is, deliberately never
implemented) or if an RFD should be otherwise indicated that it should be
ignored, it can be moved into the <code>abandoned</code> state.</p>
<p>We will go over this in more detail.
Let's walk through the life of a RFD.</p>
<h2 id="rfd-life-cycle">RFD life-cycle</h2>
<p>There is a <em>prototype</em> script in this repository, <code>scripts/new.sh</code>, that will
automate the process.</p>
<pre><code>$ scripts/new.sh 0042 "My title here"
</code></pre>
<p>If you wish to create a new RFD by hand, or understand the process in greater
detail, read on.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Never at anytime through the process do you push directly to the
master branch. Once your pull request (PR) with your RFD in your branch is
merged into master, then the RFD will appear in the master branch.</p>
<h3 id="reserve-a-rfd-number">Reserve a RFD number</h3>
<p>You will first need to reserve the number you wish to use for your RFC.
This number should be the next available RFD number from looking at the
current <code>git branch -r</code> output.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-branch-for-your-rfd">Create a branch for your RFD</h3>
<p>Now you will need to create a new git branch, named after the RFD number you wish to reserve.
This number should have leading zeros if less than 4 digits.
Before creating the branch, verify that it does not already exist:</p>
<pre><code>$ git branch -rl *0042
</code></pre>
<p>If you see a branch there (but not a corresponding sub-directory in <code>rfd</code> in
master), it is possible that the RFD is currently being created;
stop and check with co-workers before proceeding!
Once you have verified that the branch doesn't exist, create it locally and
switch to it:</p>
<pre><code>$ git checkout -b 0042
</code></pre>
<h3 id="create-a-placeholder-rfd">Create a placeholder RFD</h3>
<p>Now create a placeholder RFD.
You can do so with the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>$ mkdir -p rfd/0042
$ cp prototypes/prototype.md rfd/0042/README.md
# OR IF YOU PREFER asciidoc
$ cp prototypes/prototype.adoc rfd/0042/README.adoc
</code></pre>
<p>Fill in the RFD number and title placeholders in the new doc and add your name as an author.
The status of the RFD at this point should be <code>prediscussion</code>.</p>
<p>If your preference is to use asciidoc, that is acceptable as well, however the examples in this flow will assume markdown.</p>
<h3 id="push-your-rfd-branch-remotely">Push your RFD branch remotely</h3>
<p>Push your changes to your RFD branch in the RFD repo.</p>
<pre><code>$ git add rfd/0042/README.md
$ git commit -m '0042: Adding placeholder for RFD &lt;Title&gt;'
$ git push origin 0042
</code></pre>
<p>After your branch is pushed, the table in the README on the master branch will
update automatically with the new RFD. If you ever change the name of the RFD in the future,
the table will update as well. Whenever information about the state of the RFD
changes, this updates the table as well. The single source of truth for
information about the RFD comes from the RFD in the branch until it is merged.</p>
<h3 id="iterate-on-your-rfd-in-your-branch">Iterate on your RFD in your branch</h3>
<p>Now, you can work on writing your RFD in your branch.</p>
<pre><code>$ git checkout 0042
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can gather your thoughts and get your RFD to a state where you would
like to get feedback and discuss with others.
It's recommended to push your branch remotely to make sure the changes you make
stay in sync with the remote in case your local gets damaged.</p>
<p>It is up to you as to whether you would like to squash all your commits down to
one before opening up for feedback, or if you would like to keep the commit
history for the sake of history.</p>
<h3 id="discuss-your-rfd">Discuss your RFD</h3>
<p>When you are ready to get feedback on your RFD, make sure all your local
changes are pushed to the remote branch.
At this point you are likely at the stage where you will want to change the
status of the RFD from <code>prediscussion</code> to <code>discussion</code> for a fully formed
RFD or to <code>ideation</code> for one where only the topic is specified.
Do this in your branch.</p>
<h3 id="push-your-rfd-branch-remotely-2">Push your RFD branch remotely</h3>
<p>Along with your RFD content, update the RFD's state to <code>discussion</code> in your branch, then:</p>
<pre><code>$ git commit -am '0042: Add RFD for &lt;Title&gt;'
$ git push origin 0042
</code></pre>
<h3 id="open-a-pull-request">Open a Pull Request</h3>
<p>Open a pull request on GitHub to merge your branch, in this case <code>0042</code> into the master branch.</p>
<p>If you move your RFD into <code>discussion</code> but fail to open a pull request, a friendly
bot will do it for you. …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>I have to tell you about the Kalman filter, because what it does is pretty damn amazing.</p>
<p>Surprisingly few software engineers and scientists seem to know about it, and that makes me sad because it is such a general and powerful tool for <strong>combining information</strong> in the presence of uncertainty. At times its ability to extract accurate information seems almost magical— and if it sounds like I’m talking this up too much, then take a look at <a href="https://www.bzarg.com/p/improving-imu-attitude-estimates-with-velocity-data">this previously posted video</a> where I demonstrate a Kalman filter figuring out the <em>orientation</em> of a free-floating body by looking at its <em>velocity</em>. Totally neat!</p>

<p>You can use a Kalman filter in any place where you have <strong>uncertain information</strong> about some dynamic system, and you can make an <strong>educated guess</strong> about what the system is going to do next. Even if messy reality comes along and interferes with the clean motion you guessed about, the Kalman filter will often do a very good job of figuring out what actually happened. And it can take advantage of correlations between crazy phenomena that you maybe wouldn’t have thought to exploit!</p>
<p>Kalman filters are ideal for systems which are <strong>continuously changing</strong>. They have the <span id="more-491"></span>advantage that they are light on memory (they don’t need to keep any history other than the previous state), and they are very fast, making them well suited for real time problems and embedded systems.</p>
<p>The math for implementing the Kalman filter appears pretty scary and opaque in most places you find on Google. That’s a bad state of affairs, because the Kalman filter is actually super simple and easy to understand if you look at it in the right way. Thus it makes a great article topic, and I will attempt to illuminate it with lots of clear, pretty pictures and colors. The prerequisites are simple; all you need is a basic understanding of probability and matrices.</p>
<p>I’ll start with a loose example of the kind of thing a Kalman filter can solve, but if you want to get right to the shiny pictures and math, feel free to <a href="#mathybits">jump ahead</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s make a toy example: You’ve built a little robot that can wander around in the woods, and the robot needs to know exactly where it is so that it can navigate.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/robot_forest-300x160.png" alt="Your little robot" width="300" height="160" srcset="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/robot_forest-300x160.png 300w, https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/robot_forest.png 553w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>We’ll say our robot has a state \( \vec{x_k} \), which is just a position and a velocity:</p>
<p>\(\vec{x_k} = (\vec{p}, \vec{v})\)</p>
<p>Note that the state is just a list of numbers about the underlying configuration of your system; it could be anything. In our example it’s position and velocity, but it could be data about the amount of fluid in a tank, the temperature of a car engine, the position of a user’s finger on a touchpad, or any number of things you need to keep track of.</p>
<p>Our robot also has a GPS sensor, which is accurate to about 10 meters, which is good, but it needs to know its location more precisely than 10 meters. There are lots of gullies and cliffs in these woods, and if the robot is wrong by more than a few feet, it could fall off a cliff. So GPS by itself is not good enough.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/robot_ohnoes.png"><img src="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/robot_ohnoes-300x283.png" alt="Oh no." width="300" height="283" srcset="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/robot_ohnoes-300x283.png 300w, https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/robot_ohnoes.png 403w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>We might also know something about how the robot moves: It knows the commands sent to the wheel motors, and its knows that if it’s headed in one direction and nothing interferes, at the next instant it will likely be further along that same direction. But of course it doesn’t know everything about its motion: It might be buffeted by the wind, the wheels might slip a little bit, or roll over bumpy terrain; so the amount the wheels have turned might not exactly represent how far the robot has actually traveled, and the prediction won’t be perfect.</p>
<p>The GPS <strong>sensor</strong> tells us something about the state, but only indirectly, and with some uncertainty or inaccuracy. Our <strong>prediction</strong> tells us something about how the robot is moving, but only indirectly, and with some uncertainty or inaccuracy.</p>
<p>But if we use all the information available to us, can we get a better answer than <strong>either estimate would give us by itself</strong>? Of course the answer is yes, and that’s what a Kalman filter is for.</p>


<p>Let’s look at the landscape we’re trying to interpret. We’ll continue with a simple state having only position and velocity. $$<br>
\vec{x} = \begin{bmatrix}<br>
p\\<br>
v<br>
\end{bmatrix}$$</p>
<p>We don’t know what the <em>actual</em> position and velocity are; there are a whole range of possible combinations of position and velocity that might be true, but some of them are more likely than others:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_0.png" alt="gauss_0" width="310" height="325" srcset="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_0.png 621w, https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_0-287x300.png 287w" sizes="(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px"></p>
<p>The Kalman filter assumes that both variables (postion and velocity, in our case) are random and <em>Gaussian distributed.</em> Each variable has a <strong>mean</strong> value \(\mu\), which is the center of the random distribution (and its most likely state), and a <strong>variance</strong> \(\sigma^2\), which is the uncertainty:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_1.png" alt="gauss_1" width="310" height="276" srcset="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_1.png 621w, https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_1-300x267.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px"></p>
<p>In the above picture, position and velocity are <strong>uncorrelated</strong>, which means that the state of one variable tells you nothing about what the other might be.</p>
<p>The example below shows something more interesting: Position and velocity are <strong>correlated</strong>. The likelihood of observing a particular position depends on what velocity you have:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_3.png" alt="gauss_3" width="310" height="286" srcset="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_3.png 621w, https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_3-300x276.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px">This kind of situation might arise if, for example, we are estimating a new position based on an old one. If our velocity was high, we probably moved farther, so our position will be more distant. If we’re moving slowly, we didn’t get as far.</p>
<p>This kind of relationship is really important to keep track of, because it gives us <strong>more information: </strong>One measurement tells us something about what the others could be. And that’s the goal of the Kalman filter, we want to squeeze as much information from our uncertain measurements as we possibly can!</p>
<p>This correlation is captured by something called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_matrix">covariance matrix</a>. In short, each element of the matrix \(\Sigma_{ij}\) is the degree of correlation between the <em>ith</em> state variable and the <em>jth</em> state variable. (You might be able to guess that the covariance matrix is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_matrix">symmetric</a>, which means that it doesn’t matter if you swap <em>i</em> and <em>j</em>). Covariance matrices are often labelled “\(\mathbf{\Sigma}\)”, so we call their elements “\(\Sigma_{ij}\)”.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_2.png" alt="gauss_2" width="310" height="286" srcset="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_2.png 621w, https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_2-300x276.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px"></p>

<p>We’re modeling our knowledge about the state as a Gaussian blob, so we need two pieces of information at time \(k\): We’ll call our best estimate \(\mathbf{\hat{x}_k}\) (the mean, elsewhere named \(\mu\) ), and its covariance matrix \(\mathbf{P_k}\). $$<br>
\begin{equation} \label{eq:statevars}<br>
\begin{aligned}<br>
\mathbf{\hat{x}}_k &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}<br>
\text{position}\\<br>
\text{velocity}<br>
\end{bmatrix}\\<br>
\mathbf{P}_k &amp;=<br>
\begin{bmatrix}<br>
\Sigma_{pp} &amp; \Sigma_{pv} \\<br>
\Sigma_{vp} &amp; \Sigma_{vv} \\<br>
\end{bmatrix}<br>
\end{aligned}<br>
\end{equation}<br>
$$</p>
<p>(Of course we are using only position and velocity here, but it’s useful to remember that the state can contain any number of variables, and represent anything you want).</p>
<p>Next, we need some way to look at the <span><strong>current state</strong></span> (at time <span><strong>k-1</strong></span>) and <strong>predict the <span>next state</span></strong> at time <span><strong>k</strong></span>. Remember, we don’t know which state is the “real” one, but our prediction function doesn’t care. It just works on <em>all of them</em>, and gives us a new distribution:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_7.jpg" alt="gauss_7" width="310" height="286" srcset="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_7.jpg 621w, https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_7-300x276.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px">We can represent this prediction step with a matrix, \(\mathbf{F_k}\):</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_8.jpg" alt="gauss_8" width="310" height="286" srcset="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_8.jpg 621w, https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_8-300x276.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px">It takes <em>every point</em> in our original estimate and moves it to a new predicted location, which is where the system would move if that original estimate was the right one.</p>
<p>Let’s apply this. How would we use a matrix to predict the position and velocity at the next moment in the future? We’ll use a really basic kinematic formula:$$<br>
\begin{split}<br>
\color{deeppink}{p_k} &amp;= \color{royalblue}{p_{k-1}} + \Delta t &amp;\color{royalblue}{v_{k-1}} \\<br>
\color{deeppink}{v_k} &amp;= &amp;\color{royalblue}{v_{k-1}}<br>
\end{split}<br>
$$ In other words: $$<br>
\begin{align}<br>
\color{deeppink}{\mathbf{\hat{x}}_k} &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}<br>
1 &amp; \Delta t \\<br>
0 &amp; 1<br>
\end{bmatrix} \color{royalblue}{\mathbf{\hat{x}}_{k-1}} \\<br>
&amp;= \mathbf{F}_k \color{royalblue}{\mathbf{\hat{x}}_{k-1}} \label{statevars}<br>
\end{align}<br>
$$</p>
<p>We now have a <strong>prediction matrix</strong> which gives us our next state, but we still don’t know how to update the covariance matrix.</p>
<p>This is where we need another formula. If we multiply every point in a distribution by a matrix \(\color{firebrick}{\mathbf{A}}\), then what happens to its covariance matrix \(\Sigma\)?</p>
<p>Well, it’s easy. I’ll just give you the identity:$$<br>
\begin{equation}<br>
\begin{split}<br>
Cov(x) &amp;= \Sigma\\<br>
Cov(\color{firebrick}{\mathbf{A}}x) &amp;= \color{firebrick}{\mathbf{A}} \Sigma \color{firebrick}{\mathbf{A}}^T<br>
\end{split} \label{covident}<br>
\end{equation}<br>
$$</p>
<p>So combining \(\eqref{covident}\) with equation \(\eqref{statevars}\):$$<br>
\begin{equation}<br>
\begin{split}<br>
\color{deeppink}{\mathbf{\hat{x}}_k} &amp;= \mathbf{F}_k \color{royalblue}{\mathbf{\hat{x}}_{k-1}} \\<br>
\color{deeppink}{\mathbf{P}_k} &amp;= \mathbf{F_k} \color{royalblue}{\mathbf{P}_{k-1}} \mathbf{F}_k^T<br>
\end{split}<br>
\end{equation}<br>
$$</p>
<h2>External influence</h2>
<p>We haven’t captured everything, though. There might be some changes that <strong>aren’t related to the state</strong> itself— the outside world could be affecting the system.</p>
<p>For example, if the state models the motion of a train, the train operator might push on the throttle, causing the train to accelerate. Similarly, in our robot example, the navigation software might issue a command to turn the wheels or stop. If we know this additional information about what’s going on in the world, we could stuff it into a vector called \(\color{darkorange}{\vec{\mathbf{u}_k}}\), do something with it, and add it to our prediction as a correction.</p>
<p>Let’s say we know the expected acceleration \(\color{darkorange}{a}\) due to the throttle setting or control commands. From basic kinematics we get: $$<br>
\begin{split}<br>
\color{deeppink}{p_k} &amp;= \color{royalblue}{p_{k-1}} + {\Delta t} &amp;\color{royalblue}{v_{k-1}} + &amp;\frac{1}{2} \color{darkorange}{a} {\Delta t}^2 \\<br>
\color{deeppink}{v_k} &amp;= &amp;\color{royalblue}{v_{k-1}} + &amp; \color{darkorange}{a} {\Delta t}<br>
\end{split}<br>
$$ In matrix form: $$<br>
\begin{equation}<br>
\begin{split}<br>
\color{deeppink}{\mathbf{\hat{x}}_k} &amp;= \mathbf{F}_k \color{royalblue}{\mathbf{\hat{x}}_{k-1}} + \begin{bmatrix}<br>
\frac{\Delta t^2}{2} \\<br>
\Delta t<br>
\end{bmatrix} \color{darkorange}{a} \\<br>
&amp;= \mathbf{F}_k …</p></div></div>

<p>In this post I will discuss some testing techniques for internal red teams to identify privacy issues in services and infrastructure, most importantly a simple three step approach that might uncover interesting results.</p>

<h2 id="background-story">Background story</h2>

<p>First, let me share a story from the past. When I did my master’s I built an app that performs end to end encryption of Facebook posts. This means that only the intended audience for which your posts were encrypted for can decipher the posts.</p>

<p>The project was called Project Cryptbook, and I found an old screnshot again:</p>

<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/cryptbook.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/cryptbook.png" alt="Project Cryptbook"></a></p>

<p>On the left you see the UI in the app which shows the clear text. And on the right, you see what everyone else, including Facebook sees.</p>

<p>That was about 10+ years ago - interesting how time flies. Facebook replaced the “wall” with an ad-driven timeline and Windows Phone is dead.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I have always been a fan of privacy, data protection and giving user’s control over their data.</p>

<h2 id="red-teaming-for-privacy">Red Teaming for privacy!</h2>

<p>When years later I oversaw planning and performing large red team operations I thought quite a bit on how to help organizations improve their understanding of privacy threats with practical excersices. It became even more interesting when new regulations started kicking in.</p>

<p><strong>Does your organization have procedures in place to regularly assess systems and infrastructure for privacy violations?</strong></p>

<p>Article 32 of the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legalcontent/EN/TXT/?qid=1528874672298&amp;uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> highlights the requirement and necessity to test regularly when processing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“a process for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of processing.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even for privacy minded folks and organizations, there is little information available on how to perform privacy testing nor is there much literature out there (to my knowledge). Chances are you might have not even thought about privacy focused testing before.</p>

<p><a href="https://gdpr.eu/"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/gdpr.png" alt="GDPR Logo"></a></p>

<p>Let’s dive into the threats of data and motivated intruder.</p>

<h2 id="data-intruder-threat">Data Intruder Threat</h2>

<p>Privacy violations are often insider threats. Employees who have access to production and PII data can easily exfiltrate large amounts of data or be coerced into doing so by an adversary.</p>

<p>In more mature organizations such access is only granted on a case-by-case basis and temporarily for support, debugging or when security incidents arise. And access to the systems and data records is <em>(should be)</em> monitored thoroughly.</p>

<h3 id="easy-access-to-customer-data">Easy access to customer data?</h3>

<p>How difficult is it for a developer, a marketing person, support personnel, a data scientist, or someone from HR to access customer data?</p>

<p><strong>Are access requests possibly auto-approved!?</strong></p>

<p>The data intruder threat is important as more and more of the world’s data is being stored in the cloud. Insiders indeed exploit their privileges at times, for instance: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-cyber-access-exclusive-idUSKCN24O34E">Twitter (2020)</a>, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/facebook-investigating-claim-engineer-used-access-stalk-women-n870526">Facebook (2018)</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/14/google-engineer-fired-security/">Google (2010)</a>.</p>

<p>How is the situation in your organization?</p>

<p>Ideally, customers should be notified whenever employees or contractors access their information through support, maintenance, or bug fixes. That would set a high standard for ethics in the industry.</p>

<p>What safeguards are in place to prevent anyone from downloading the customer database, copying it onto a USB device to exfiltrate, sell the information, or take it home when departing the company?</p>

<h2 id="motivated-intruder">Motivated Intruder</h2>

<p>Furthermore, NIST highlights the <strong>Motivated Intruder</strong> as being an internal adversary who has access to <strong>anonymized datasets and uses data science techniques to <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/publications/sp/800-188/archive/2016-08-25/documents/sp800_188_draft.pdf">reidentify and deanonymize the data</a></strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/hacker.png" alt="Hacker"></p>

<p>I have been using the term <strong>Motivated Intruder</strong> in a broader sense for any privacy focused red teaming operations throughout my career.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started-with-privacy-focused-testing">Getting started with privacy focused testing</h2>

<p>There are some basic ways to test and identify privacy violations in your organization.</p>

<p>Here are a couple ideas for operations, such as:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Identifying customer data in widely accessible locations</strong>. For various reasons PII might end up accidentally in widely accessible telemetry, source code, logs, event streams, shared email inboxes, data science notebooks,…</li>
<li><strong>Simulate a Data Intruder who can legitimately gain access to customer data for business purposes</strong> and exfiltrate sentinel records to validate monitoring solutions</li>
<li><strong>Exploit a system vulnerability</strong> or weakness to gain access to customer data</li>
<li>Perform <strong>de-anonymization attacks</strong> - teaming up with data scientists during red team operations</li>
</ol>

<p>In this post I will be focusing on the first two scenarios.</p>

<p>Discuss with compliance and legal teams before engaging with them to ensure you have a well-rounded and authorized test plan in place.</p>

<h2 id="scenario-1-identifying-customer-data-in-widely-accessible-locations">Scenario 1: Identifying customer data in widely accessible locations</h2>

<p>I am a fan of creating sentinel datasets and have the red team find and exfiltrate those as objective.</p>

<p><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/background.filler.png" alt="background"></p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-sentinel-record">What is a sentinel record?</h3>

<p>A sentinel data record is basically a test record, often with an easily identifiable pattern.</p>

<p>Sentinel data records are useful for privacy focused testing. One way to get basic end-to-end test coverage is to use your own systems as an external user:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Data creation with unique patterns</strong> - Sign up with a unique and easily identifiable pattern as PII</li>
<li><strong>Exercising features</strong> of the system under test - Then exercise and use all the features of the system to trigger various workflows internally</li>
<li><strong>Hunting for patterns in internal systems</strong> - Finally, switch hats and search internally in widely accessible places for that <strong>unique pattern</strong></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="how-does-this-work-practically">How does this work practically?</h3>

<p>Let’s say your organization runs a service that allows users to register with their first name, last name, address, and credit card, and users can upload text and comments. Let’s walk through a test scenario step by step.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-data-creation-with-unique-easily-identifiable-patterns">Step 1: Data creation with unique, easily identifiable patterns</h3>

<p>In a practical fashion, this could be as simple as the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>As username, pick <strong>John55444562200</strong> <strong>Tester55444562200</strong></li>
<li>The address could be <strong>Test Road55444562200</strong></li>
<li>Credit card contains <strong>55444562200</strong> as well</li>
<li>Phone number contains  <strong>55444562200</strong></li>
<li>The email address contains it, for instance <strong>johntester+55444562200</strong>@example.org</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>You get the idea!</strong></p>

<h3 id="step-2-exercising-features">Step 2: Exercising features</h3>

<p>After creating test data, use the system and its features. Consider triggering side conditions and error cases to get a wide range of test cases. Upload/post/edit/delete information in the same using the pattern <strong>55444562200</strong>.</p>

<p>There is also the opportunity to automate and leverage already existing test frameworks to become more repeatable and have better test coverage.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-hunting-phase">Step 3: Hunting phase</h3>

<p>Afterward, it is time to hunt for the <em>specific</em> string pattern - in this case for <strong>55444562200</strong>.</p>

<p>This means searching various data stores and widely accessible information repositories for the pattern that used during signup.</p>

<p><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/lookfor.png" alt="Searching"></p>

<p>At this stage there is <strong>no</strong> need to actively compromise systems - ideally you just define a scope of systems to analyze upfront. Searching widely accessible <strong>telemetry stores</strong> and <strong>supposedly anonymized datasets in data lakes</strong> is a good place to start.</p>

<p>Some surprise hits might also be visible in places like <strong>internal source code repositories</strong> - maybe a data scientists checks in customer data when building or analyzing models, and of course our very own <strong>security monitoring solutions</strong> might contain the pattern as well. Other places are <strong>Intranet portals</strong>, <strong>file servers</strong> and <strong>O365/SharePoint/GSuite</strong>.</p>

<p>Using this simple technique, it’s possible to raise awareness and identify potential privacy violations and improve the overall security posture. It also helps protect the organization from certain data intruder threats.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can also do a privacy hunt without creating sentinel records. For instance searching for regular expression of phone numbers, email addresses or credit card numbers can help identify sensitive datasets in widely exposed locations pretty quickly.</p>

<h3 id="scenario-2-malicious-insider-and-privacy-implications">Scenario 2: Malicious insider and privacy implications</h3>

<p>When troubleshooting issues and debugging purposes, as well as security investigations, it is likely that engineers in your organization can request access to production machines where they might be exposed to customer data. In less mature organizations the process might be even simpler - and the question is if auditing is taking place. This is an important angle to validate as a red team.</p>

<p><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/number.png" alt="Numbers"></p>

<p>What if someone legitimately gains that level of access to debug a performance problem but at the same time exfiltrates customer data on a production system?</p>

<p>Would the blue team detect that? Is there enough logging in place to figure out what happened?</p>

<p>The actual data to exfiltrate can again be sentinel production records. This is to avoid having the red team touch real customer data – which is always preferable. Although, as a safety pre-caution red teamer must have proper authorization if they get exposed to customer data during testing (and yes, red teams have to be audited also). Discuss your testing objectives and approach with your legal counsel to ensure its legitimate and authorized.</p>

<p><strong>In the end, I think that an organization has to engage in privacy testing to help protect customer data and to demonstrate adhering to privacy regulation.</strong></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this post we discussed how Red Teams can help identify privacy violations by performing motivated intruder testing. We also learned about the Data Intruder and walked through some basic test techniques to help identify and minimize risk associated with accidently leaking customer data.</p>

<p>Hope this was interesting and useful. If you kick off such tests in your organization, I’d be curious to learn about findings or other approaches and ideas you might have.</p>

        <p>If you’ve heard the news about the nRF9160 then you know it’s a game-changer. ARM Cortex M33 + LTE Cat-M + NB-IoT and GPS all included under one System in Package. Drool-worthy, right?</p>

<p>Well, if you’ve been using the nRF SDK to build nRF5x projects, you likely feel like you’re hanging from your toes. That’s because Nordic has chosen to adopt Zephyr as their RTOS of choice for the nRF9160.</p>

<p>Although there is <a href="https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/">plenty of documentation about Zephyr</a>, making the transition can still be tough. Many nRF SDK enthusiasts will find themselves lost in a sea of CMake files and Kconfigs. I’m here to help with that!</p>

<p>This is the guide I wish existed while I was developing some drivers for the <a href="https://www.jaredwolff.com/store/nrf91-feather/">nRF9160 Feather</a>. I spent weeks getting accustomed to how Zephyr worked, figuring out what files needed to be where, and how the heck to include a header file. (Fun times.)</p>

<!-- excerpt start -->
<p>In this post, I’ll go over some of the nuances related to creating drivers for your peripherals on Zephyr. We’ll talk about Device Tree organization, <code>Kconfig</code>, and <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> files. By the end, you should have an idea on how to tackle your own Zephyr driver aspirations!

<p>In this example, you’ll learn about what it takes to create a driver for the PCF85063A real-time clock and counter. I’ve chosen to use the counter API for reasons we’ll discuss in a bit. There are some prerequisites to getting started though. Let’s begin with SDK Setup.</p>

<h3 id="sdk-setup">SDK Setup</h3>

<p>I’ll be referencing Nordic’s nRF Connect SDK a bunch throughout this post. I’ve been building and testing nRF9160 Feather on v1.3.0. I won’t be going into detail on how to set up the SDK though. Nordic has <a href="https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/getting_started.html">great documentation</a> you can check out to get started. I’ve also discussed <a href="https://www.jaredwolff.com/zephyr-on-nrf9160-feather/">my experience here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="what-west-can-do-for-you">What <code>west</code> can do for you</h3>

<p>The Zephyr project uses a CLI tool, <code>west</code>, for project management, compilation, and flashing. <code>west</code> replaces the idea of a top-level Makefile and project dependency management like Git submodules. For the most part, it accomplishes that goal well.</p>

<p>You’ll need to install <code>west</code> if you haven’t already. Follow the SDK setup links above for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Building</strong></p>

<p>To build a project, navigate to the directory for the application in question and run <code>west build</code>. For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span><span>cd </span>ncs/nrf/samples/nrf9160/nrf_cloud_agps
<span>$</span><span> </span>west build <span>-b</span> circuitdojo_feather_nrf9160ns <span>-p</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This builds in the current folder for the <code>circuitdojo_feather_nrf9160ns</code> board. You can find all the possible <code>arm</code> based boards in <code>ncs/zephyr/boards/arm/</code> The <code>-p</code> flag tells <code>west</code> to clean before building.</p>

<p>A ton of things happen in the background to build a project. We’ll discuss more how things compile in the next section.</p>

<p><strong>Flashing</strong></p>

<p>Flashing code is as simple as running <code>west flash</code> from your project directory. You can use the <code>-r</code> parameter to choose which programming method you’d like to use. Common options are <code>jlink</code>, <code>nrfjprog</code> (for Nordic projects), <code>pyocd</code>, <code>openocd</code>, <code>dfu-util</code>, etc.</p>

<p>These “runners” are set in the board configuration. Here’s the <code>board.cmake</code> for the nRF9160 Feather located in <code>zephyr/boards/arm/circuitdojo_feather_nrf9160/board.cmake</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>board_runner_args</span><span>(</span>nrfjprog <span>"--nrf-family=NRF91"</span><span>)</span>
<span>board_runner_args</span><span>(</span>jlink <span>"--device=cortex-m33"</span> <span>"--speed=4000"</span><span>)</span>
<span>include</span><span>(</span><span>${</span><span>ZEPHYR_BASE</span><span>}</span>/boards/common/nrfjprog.board.cmake<span>)</span>
<span>include</span><span>(</span><span>${</span><span>ZEPHYR_BASE</span><span>}</span>/boards/common/jlink.board.cmake<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/master/boards/arm/circuitdojo_feather_nrf9160/board.cmake">Original Github code here</a>)</p>

<p>As you can see, the nRF9160 Feather supports the <code>nrfjprog</code> and <code>jlink</code> options.</p>

<h2 id="dependency-management">Dependency Management</h2>

<p>There are a few different ways of handling dependencies in firmware land. I’ve used Git submodules as my dependency “manager” of choice. Zephyr though, is very opinionated on how you should work with your dependencies. Let’s look into how we do that with <code>west</code> and a <code>west.yml</code> file.</p>

<p><code>west.yml</code> is a manifest file much like a <code>Cargo.toml</code> in rust or <code>package.json</code> for Node. You initialize a Zephyr repository using <code>west init</code> command. This does a shallow <code>git</code> clone for each dependency and puts them into place.</p>

<p>Here’s what a <code>west.yml</code> file may look like. This was for a personal project that uses <a href="https://github.com/nanopb/nanopb">NanoPB</a> and also the nRF Connect SDK.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>manifest</span><span>:</span>
  <span>remotes</span><span>:</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>nrfconnect</span>
      <span>url-base</span><span>:</span> <span>https://github.com/nrfconnect</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>nanopb</span>
      <span>url-base</span><span>:</span> <span>https://github.com/nanopb</span>
  <span>projects</span><span>:</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>nrf</span>
      <span>remote</span><span>:</span> <span>nrfconnect</span>
      <span>revision</span><span>:</span> <span>v1.3.0</span>
      <span>import</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>nanopb</span>
      <span>repo-path</span><span>:</span> <span>nanopb</span>
      <span>revision</span><span>:</span> <span>0.3.9</span>
      <span>path</span><span>:</span> <span>pyrinas/ext/nanopb</span>
      <span>remote</span><span>:</span> <span>nanopb</span>
  <span>self</span><span>:</span>
    <span># This repository should be cloned to ncs/nrf.</span>
    <span>path</span><span>:</span> <span>pyrinas</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>west.yml</code> file doesn’t affect driver operation. If you’re going to include your drivers as a separate repo though, this is where you would add it! You can learn more though by going to the Zephyr documentation on <a href="https://docs.zephyrproject.org/1.14.1/guides/west/manifest.html">West Manifests</a>. (complete with crazy dependency diagrams and more!)</p>

<h2 id="how-things-compile">How Things Compile</h2>

<p>One of the important things to know about driver development is how things compile. It may bend your mind a bit but we’ll get through this together.</p>

<h3 id="cmakeliststxt"><code>CMakeLists.txt</code></h3>

<p>If you spend enough time in Zephyr, you may see some patterns emerge. Many folders and sub-folders have this dynamic duo: <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> and <code>Kconfig</code>. These files are where all the magic happens.</p>

<p>You may already have an idea of what <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> does by its name. It’s a Makefile of sorts that you use to add source files and include folders to a project. The neat thing about <code>cmake</code> is that it’s recursive (for better or for worse). This means a higher-level <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file spells out what, if anything, can be found in subdirectories. There are no more ginormous Makefiles. You make the changes you need closest to the code that’s affected.</p>

<p>For example, you can add subdirectories in <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> so they’re part of the <code>cmake</code> path:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Point to NCS root directory.</span>
<span>set</span><span>(</span>NRF_DIR <span>${</span><span>CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR</span><span>}</span> CACHE PATH <span>"NCS root directory"</span><span>)</span>

<span>include</span><span>(</span>cmake/extensions.cmake<span>)</span>
<span>include</span><span>(</span>cmake/multi_image.cmake<span>)</span>
<span>include</span><span>(</span>cmake/reports.cmake<span>)</span>

<span>zephyr_include_directories</span><span>(</span>include<span>)</span>

<span>add_subdirectory</span><span>(</span>ext<span>)</span>
<span>add_subdirectory</span><span>(</span>lib<span>)</span>
<span>add_subdirectory</span><span>(</span>samples<span>)</span>
<span>add_subdirectory</span><span>(</span>subsys<span>)</span>
<span>add_subdirectory</span><span>(</span>drivers<span>)</span>
<span>add_subdirectory</span><span>(</span>tests<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Sometimes they’re used to set the directory as a project. This particular one is from the <code>https_client</code> example in nRF Connect SDK.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>cmake_minimum_required</span><span>(</span>VERSION 3.8.2<span>)</span>

<span>find_package</span><span>(</span>Zephyr REQUIRED HINTS $ENV{ZEPHYR_BASE}<span>)</span>
<span>project</span><span>(</span>https_client<span>)</span>

<span>target_sources</span><span>(</span>app PRIVATE src/main.c<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In my case, I’ll show you how I used several <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> so the compiler knows about my device drivers!</p>

<h3 id="kconfig"><code>Kconfig</code></h3>

<p><code>Kconfig</code> allows you to create project-based configuration parameters. If you’ve ever used Nordic’s Original SDK, you know the pain of their <code>sdk_config.h</code> file. <em>It’s a nightmare.</em></p>

<p>Like <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>, <code>Kconfig</code> files allow you to keep the configuration as close to your code. There’s no massive top-level configuration manifest to be afraid of. You can add your code without breaking the repository. Good stuff, right?</p>

<p>Here’s an example of a <code>Kconfig</code> from the <code>ncs/nrf/applications/asset_tracker</code> application</p>

<div><div><pre><code>menu "Asset tracker"

rsource "src/ui/Kconfig"

config APPLICATION_WORKQUEUE_STACK_SIZE
    int "Application workqueue stack size"
    default 4096

config APPLICATION_WORKQUEUE_PRIORITY
    int "Application workqueue priority"
    default SYSTEM_WORKQUEUE_PRIORITY

menu "GPS"
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can see that it references separate <code>Kconfig</code> files as a dependency. You can also see that some environment variables are set with default values. You can either add them to your project’s <code>prj.conf</code> <em>or</em> edit them using <code>west build -t menuconfig</code>. If you’re looking to make permanent changes, you should use the <code>prj.conf</code> method.</p>

<p>The most important part about <code>Kconfig</code> files in regards to drivers is that you can use these variables as flags for conditional compilation.</p>

<p>As an example, here’s what the <code>ncs/nrf/drivers/sensor/CMakeLists.txt</code> looks like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>add_subdirectory_ifdef</span><span>(</span>CONFIG_BH1749 bh1749<span>)</span>
<span>add_subdirectory_ifdef</span><span>(</span>CONFIG_SENSOR_SIM sensor_sim<span>)</span>
<span>add_subdirectory_ifdef</span><span>(</span>CONFIG_PMW3360 pmw3360<span>)</span>
<span>add_subdirectory_ifdef</span><span>(</span>CONFIG_PAW3212 paw3212<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You may notice that all the variables begin with <code>CONFIG_</code>. All variables produced by <code>Kconfig</code> have this prefix. So, for example, <code>APPLICATION_WORKQUEUE_STACK_SIZE</code> becomes <code>CONFIG_APPLICATION_WORKQUEUE_STACK_SIZE.</code></p>

<p>In the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> above, you can see that a subdirectory is only added if the driver is “enabled”. <code>CONFIG_BH1749</code> happens to be the top-level environment variable to make that happen. You can also use this type of conditional compilation for your project code.</p>

<h3 id="zephyrmoduleyml"><code>zephyr/module.yml</code></h3>

<p><code>Kconfig</code> and <code>CMakeList.txt</code> are great, but where do we start? How does <code>west</code> know where to start looking for them?</p>

<p>The answer is a very unsuspecting file called <code>module.yml</code>. <code>module.yml</code> is usually found in the <code>/zephyr</code> subdirectory of a dependency. For example, here’s the one for nRF Connect SDK located in <code>ncs/nrf/zephyr/</code></p>

<p>Example</p>

<div><div><pre><code>build:
  cmake: .
  kconfig: Kconfig.nrf
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The file tells <code>west</code> where to find the appropriate base <code>Kconfig</code> and <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>. Those are the starting point for further repository traversal. Without these, there’s no way to use your driver code in your application!</p>

<h2 id="adding-a-drivers-folder">Adding a drivers folder</h2>

<p>You now should understand <code>Kconfig</code>, <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>, and <code>module.yml</code>. We’re ready for driver development!</p>

<p>In my case, since my driver work is ongoing, I opted to use my own <code>drivers</code> folder in my main project repository. You can always opt to start developing your drivers in <code>zephyr/drivers</code>. This is likely a better location especially if you want to release the driver for others to use. The downside is that it requires more work!</p>

<p>In my case, here’s …</p></div></div>

    <p>Society moves in waves.  It always starts with lots of separate things. Then they get bundled. After a while, more and more people start to realize that the bundled solution is too bloated and not specific enough for their needs. <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/5/21/office-messaging-and-verbs">This is when an unbundling happens.</a></p>

<p>Unbundlings always represent a multitude of business opportunities. Below I’ll list several examples of unbundlings that have happened in the past, some that are happening right now, and a few speculations on what might be unbundled next.</p>

<p>While going through the following examples, ask yourself:  What aspect hasn’t been unbundled yet? What could be unbundled in a better way?</p>

  <li>Twitter? (Especially its DM function, e.g., along the lines of what Earn.com tried. But also the “News-Feed” aspect, the “Life-Updates” aspect, the RSS-Feed aspect, etc.)</li>
  <li>Ebay? Amazon? (See Etsy, Shopify)</li>
  <li>Offices? (See Slack, Zoom, <a href="https://www.focusmate.com/">Focusmate</a>, <a href="https://wip.chat/">WIP.chat</a>)</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="layout-marketing"><section><div> <p><i>by</i> <span>Joe Marshall</span> <i>on</i> <span>July 23, 2020</span></p> <p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/atlas-header.png"></p></div> <div><h2 id="intro-to-stripe-atlas">Intro to Stripe Atlas</h2>
<p>Stripe Atlas is a <a href="https://stripe.com/atlas">“platform for forming a company”</a> aimed in particular at startups and internet businesses. It consolidates a lot of the legal paperwork, fees, and hassle of incorporating a business, giving you access to a bevy of Stripe resources for company formation, all behind an online dashboard that sits inside your usual Stripe account. It costs $500 and covers a few hundred dollars in legal fees, plus it comes with thousands of dollars in credits with affiliated partners.</p>
<p><strong>Stripe Atlas offers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proof your company is incorporated - papers, Tax ID, etc  </li>
<li>Stripe account  </li>
<li>Business checking account with Azlo Banking (optional, more on this later)  </li>
<li>Access to the Stripe Atlas community  </li>
<li>A year of registered agent fees (required for Delaware Corps, normally $100/year)</li>
<li>Off-the-shelf legal templates created by Stripe Atlas-affiliated lawyers</li>
<li>Special offers from vendors ($5,000 in AWS credits, $10,000 in Digital Ocean, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>Although Stripe Atlas was designed initially for businesses that wanted to incorporate as Delaware C Corporations, it’s been expanded to support LLCs - meaning that if you don’t want to issue stock, have a Board of Directors, etc, but just want the legal framework for some shared profit venture, with the liability protection of an LLC, Stripe Atlas is still for you.</p>
<p>A major feature of Atlas, finally, is that it optionally comes with a business bank account. Access to the US banking system is a killer feature for international entrepreneurs who might want to process payments, sell / purchase companies, or otherwise participate in the American market.</p>
<p><strong>So, Stripe Atlas is for</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Entrepreneurs who want to simplify the incorporation process  </li>
<li>Startup Founders  </li>
<li>Bootstrappers / Indiehackers / Side Project-ers  </li>
<li>International Entrepreneurs who want to do business in the US</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-we-chose-stripe-atlas">Why <em>We</em> Chose Stripe Atlas</h2>
<p>We’re a <a href="https://formcake.com/about">small, four-person bootstrapped business</a> (basically, bullet points one and three). We knew and trusted Stripe as our payment processor and loved the idea of not only consolidating a lengthy, involved process into a tool we (already!) used, we also saw the $500 fee as more than worth it, considering the promised $5,000 in AWS credits, registered agent fees, and incorporation fee. The ability to create a business bank account in addition to the incorporation was gravy, considering that we needed a business-only Stripe-connected account. For us, since all we required was a garden-variety, digitally-oriented LLC formation with the ultimate company divided into four ownership units, Atlas made perfect sense. If our needs hadn’t been so simple and we’d ultimately needed something more custom, we still would’ve explored Stripe Atlas’ premade templates and flat-fee legal services, but more cautiously.</p>
<h2 id="approval-process">Approval Process</h2>
<p>In order to get approved for a Stripe Atlas account and a Delaware C Corporation, you’ll need to provide some information to Stripe for <em>each person</em> who’s going to be a part owner of the company:</p>
<p><strong>What you’ll need</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Photo of your driver’s license</li>
<li>Driver’s license number</li>
<li>Driver’s license expiration</li>
<li>Physical address</li>
<li>Social security number</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you submit this info Stripe will hit you with a whole mess of emails asking you to Docusign everything from an IP Assignment, which assigns any intellectual property you might have created to the company, to the actual paperwork dividing stock if you’re a Delaware C Corp or ownership units if you’re an LLC. It’s all very direct and automated, signing each stage of documents and providing the requisite information unlocks the next stage of documents and info-gathering.</p>
<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
<p><strong>Day 1</strong>: We signed up and submitted all our personal info<br><strong>Day 3</strong>: A mistake! We noticed in our Stripe Atlas dashboard that the status of our documents was no longer "Submitted." We notified them, resubmitted some things, and they rectified the error.<br><strong>Day 6</strong>: We receive the company formation documents: IP assignment, ownership percentages, etc.<br><strong>Day 10</strong>: We received our bank account with Azlo but still couldn’t accept payment (trying to process one would trigger an error through the Stripe API)<br><strong>Day 14</strong>: We receive our EIN (Employer Identification Number), otherwise known as our tax ID. We can now accept payments!</p>
<h2 id="stripe-atlas-aws-credits">Stripe Atlas AWS Credits</h2>
<p>Stripe Atlas teases a number of partner benefits in their promotional copy - $5,000 for AWS, up to $100,000 for GCP (!). Of course our all-AWS infrastructure makes those AWS credits essentially free money, so we were very interested in maximizing that benefit.</p>
<p>So after signing up for Atlas and going through all the AWS rigamarole we were able to secure only $1,000 in AWS credits.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/stripe-atlas-includes-five-thousand-credits-this-is-what-we-got">posted about it</a> and actually received a follow up from Stripe:</p>
<section>
Hi David, 

<p>Thanks for your interest in Stripe Atlas. My name is Tony and I’ll be happy to share further about our tools.</p>
<p>We know that building a new business is exciting and challenging—but it can also be costly. To help you get off to a great start, Stripe Atlas has partnered with Amazon Web Services to create some great offers for Stripe Atlas businesses.</p>
<p>In your case, applying through Stripe Atlas, the amount you're eligible for is (up to) $5000. The "up to" phrase is because there is a lifetime eligibility cap.</p>
<p>If you have any other questions about AWS benefits or Stripe Atlas, just reply to this email—we're happy to help.       </p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Tony</p>
</section>

<p>In summary: It seems that though Stripe can advertise the "up to" amounts it’s the actual partners (like AWS) who are setting the standards for what companies merit what credit payouts. Basically, Stripe directs you to AWS, you verify you’re a Stripe customer via a code, and the Amazon Gods pay what they pay.</p>
<p>It seems in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/activate/">AWS Activate</a> (the program giving the credits) we signed up under the "Bootstrapped / Self-funded" option to get our $1,000 in credits. Maybe if we'd signed up as a "Funded" startup we could've expected the full $5,000?</p>
<p>It’s disappointing and a little opaque, but no more than most marketing copy. Just keep in mind as you’re reading those credit totals in the official Stripe Atlas documentation that they come with light asterisks - it’s not ultimately Stripe awarding those amounts.</p>
<h2 id="stripe-atlas-taxes">Stripe Atlas Taxes</h2>
<p>We have been incorporated for under a fiscal year, so alas we haven’t had the pleasure of doing taxes yet. We have done some research into it though, and tried to get a sense of what support Stripe offers Atlas companies during tax time.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of some of the Stripe communication around taxes. These resources all came in an email to Atlas founders:</p>
<section>
Taxes &amp; Legal <br>
- Tax season ends July 15. <a href="https://discuss.stripe.community/t/official-stripe-atlas-2020-tax-thread/11361">Get answers to your questions.</a><br>
- <a href="https://discuss.stripe.community/t/guidance-on-extension-of-time-to-file-w-irs-c-corp-no-revenue/13511">“I’m looking for guidance on how to apply for an extension with the IRS.”</a><br>
- <a href="https://discuss.stripe.community/t/should-i-pay-taxes-again/13738">“I paid taxes four months ago. I just got an email saying I have to pay again.”</a>
</section>

<h2 id="azlo-banking-option">Azlo Banking Option</h2>
<p>We decided to create a business checking account with Azlo because we desperately needed to move off my-real-live-checking-account we naturally shipped with.</p>
<p>We haven’t done anything exciting from a financial perspective - no complicated M&amp;A’s, accounting logistics, or large business loans - we’ve just been depositing money from our Stripe account and occasionally withdrawing.</p>
<p>One neat feature of using Azlo + Atlas is that when you’re activating your Stripe account, moving beyond the testing stage and generating a live production token, as soon as Stripe gives you a valid token you’re ready to accept payments - immediately. It’s a great feeling adding that critical Stripe token to your secrets management, pushing it live, and knowing someone can “walk up”, purchase your digital product, and pay you money for it, all completely automated. This is admittedly a small thing but also indicative of some of that Stripe attention to detail they’re so great about.</p>
<h2 id="our-conclusion">Our Conclusion</h2>
<p>Really the only blemish on our entire Stripe Atlas experience was wanting that sweet $5,000 in AWS credits but settling for $1,000 - which feels like a pretty small, spoiled gripe. Having the central location for everything company incorporation-related in our Stripe dashboard - where we’re already comfortable - and small things like document and personal info checklists, only having to pay a single entity (Stripe) instead of a million small fees, along with just having the whole thing on rails, makes Atlas a great proposition.</p>

    </section>
    <section>
      <p><i>For the Q2 2020 Yelp Economic Average report, we’re using a new methodology that tracks several indicators on a daily basis, and extends into Q3. For more on the methodology for this report, <a href="https://www.yelpeconomicaverage.com/yea-q2-2020.html#methodology">click here</a>.</i></p>
    
      
        <p>As cities reopen and COVID-19 cases continue to rise across the country, local governments have taken action, pivoting their reopening plans. Many businesses that eagerly reopened doors in June were forced to scale back operations and in some cases even shut down again — a costly action for many small businesses.</p>
        <p>Yelp’s latest <a href="https://www.yelpeconomicaverage.com/yelp-coronavirus-economic-impact-report.html" target="_blank">Local Economic Impact Report</a>, published in June, showed a decrease of business closures compared to April and an increase in consumers getting back to their normal activities – such as dining in at restaurants, heading back into shopping malls and planning weddings. We’re now beginning to uncover longer term trends including a correlation between interest in restaurants, bars and nightlife, and gyms to a spike in COVID-19 cases across hotspot states. The report also measures business closure data that reflects an unstable economy; slower, but still consistent changes in consumers getting back to pre-pandemic activities; and sustained interest in supporting Black-owned businesses.</p>
    </section>    <section>
      <h2>Increased Consumer Activity in May Correlates with Increased COVID-19 Cases in June</h2>
        <p>In <a href="https://www.yelpeconomicaverage.com/yea-q1-2020.html" target="_blank">mid-to-late March</a> we saw consumer activity drop swiftly and uniformly across the nation. This new status quo was maintained in most states through at least mid-to-late April. In May, some states maintained the shutdown level of consumer interest, but many started to revert towards the pre-pandemic norm.</p>

          <p>As people began resuming common pre-pandemic activities across states like Florida, Nevada, South Carolina, Texas, Georgia and others – specifically, frequenting restaurants, bars and nightlife, and gyms – a clear spike in COVID-19 cases within those locations quickly followed.</p>

    <section>
        <p>As outbreaks worsened through late June, consumer interest in these categories started to come back down in states like Florida, Texas, South Carolina, and Arizona. This emphasizes the strong correlation between the pandemic and consumer behavior. When there's a major outbreak, Yelp data suggests it negatively impacts consumer interest in businesses where social distancing may be harder to enforce. If COVID-19 cases remain flat or decrease in a state, consumer behavior and local policies tend to revert towards the pre-pandemic norm, leaving the state vulnerable to a major outbreak in the near future. These outbreaks may then require stricter measures to suppress cases, as we are currently seeing in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/states-reopening-coronavirus-map/" target="_blank">California and Florida</a>.</p>

      <h2>Business Closures Fluctuate Across the Nation</h2>
        <p>The curve in business closures that we once saw <a href="https://www.yelpeconomicaverage.com/yelp-coronavirus-economic-impact-report.html" target="_blank">going down</a> has continued to change over the last month. We last reported 140,000 total businesses closures on Yelp from March 1 to June 15. We saw this increase to more than 147,000 total business closures on June 29 and then drop again to just more than 132,500 total business closures as of July 10. This rapidly changing number of closures reflects rapidly evolving situations at the local level, as some states with rising cases start to close again, while others continue to reopen. In April, we reported more than 175,000 business closures indicating that only 24% of businesses that were closed in April have reopened.</p>

        <p>Even as total closures fall, permanent closures increase with 72,842 businesses permanently closed, out of the 132,580 total closed businesses, an increase of 15,742 permanent closures since June 15. This also means that the percentage of permanent to temporary business closures is rising, with permanent closures now accounting for 55% of all closed businesses since March 1, an increase of 14% from June when we reported 41% of closures as permanent. Overall, permanent closures have steadily increased since the peak of the pandemic with minor spikes in March, followed by May and June.</p>

      <h2>Permanent Closures Continue to Increase Across Restaurants, Retail and Other Industries</h2>
        <p>While some industries have been able to slowly bounce back with fewer temporary closures, many are still enduring an increasing number of permanently closed businesses.</p>
        <p>The restaurant industry now reflects the highest total business closures, recently surpassing retail. As of July 10, there have been 26,160 total restaurant closures, an increase of 2,179 since June 15. Of the all closed restaurants in July, 15,770 have permanently closed (60%), accounting for 2,956 more permanent closures, a 23% increase since June 15. Meanwhile, bars and nightlife, an industry 6X smaller than restaurants, have endured an especially high closure rate, with 5,454 total business closures, 2,429 (44%) of which are permanent closures.</p>
        <p>Many retail businesses shifted their operating models and started offering curbside pickup and online ordering, unfortunately those measures aren’t always enough to sustain their business long term. Shopping and retail businesses have endured 26,119 total business closures, of which 12,454 are permanent, representing 48% of closed retail businesses on Yelp. On June 15, we reported 27,663 closed retail and shopping businesses, of which only 9,640 were permanently closed. Since then we’ve seen 1,544 retail businesses reopen, however an even higher number have been forced to shut their doors permanently, accounting for 2,814 new permanent closures, a 29% increase in permanent retail closures in the last month.</p>
        <p>The beauty industry follows a similar trend as the retail industry with 13,609 total business closures, a decrease from 15,348 in June, as many businesses have been able to reopen their brick and mortar locations. However, the industry has suffered from 1,213 new permanent closures since June 15, totalling 4,897 permanent closures as of July 10.</p>
        <p>Similar to retail and beauty, though there are fewer temporarily closed businesses, the fitness industry has also suffered from an increase in permanent closures. As of July 10, there have been 4,907 total fitness closures, a decrease of 682 closed businesses since June 15. However, of all closed fitness businesses 1,930 are permanently closed, representing 39% of closed fitness businesses on Yelp – 504 more permanent closures than in June. While some fitness businesses have been able to continue operating through virtual classes, many smaller brick and mortar studios have been forced to shut their doors permanently, as these small businesses battle affording high rent and operating expenses without being able to use their physical space.</p>

<p>This essay will hopefully be the first post in a series covering some of the basics of how things in the past, particularly in the ancient world, were made.  This isn’t a how-to guide (we’re not going to go into that much depth) but instead intended as a window into the many tasks that made a pre-modern society <em>work</em>, tasks that are so often <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/07/12/collections-the-lonely-city-part-i-the-ideal-city/">left </a><a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/07/19/the-lonely-city-part-ii-real-cities-have-curves/">out </a>of the modern imagination of the past.  Throughout, I want to highlight not only the jobs, but also <strong>the people who did them</strong> and the <strong>human landscapes they created</strong>.</p>



<p>Each entry in this series is likely to come in multiple parts – as you will soon see, almost everything worth making has to be made in quite a few steps and each step is often complex enough to occupy its own weekly post.  I <em>think</em> this series will run in four parts (possibly with a fifth part addendum), but no plan survives contact with my tendency to overwrite.  I wanted to start with farming instead of something more flashy and exciting like iron production (where I know there is quite a lot of interest in how one goes from reddish rock to polished sword), for the simple reason that <strong>agriculture sits at the foundation of every other form of production</strong>.  Every person in an agrarian society whose job – mining, smithing, tanning, timber-cutting, trading, tailoring, <em>everything</em> – doesn’t involve primary food production is subsisting off of the food production of others, typically (as we’ll see) <em>many</em> others.</p>



<p>That said, <em>this post</em> is mostly about <strong>farmers</strong> more than <em>farming</em> (we will talk about the mechanics of farming, just not right away!).  One thing I want to highlight in this series are the many different jobs and occupations <em>and the people who did them</em> who tend to lurk in the background of our imagination of the past, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/07/12/collections-the-lonely-city-part-i-the-ideal-city/">where they appear at all</a>.  And in the case of farming in much of the pre-modern world, the survival strategies of subsistence farmers exert a very strong shaping influence on the countryside and life for non-farmers (terminology note: ‘subsistence’ farming refers to farming directed primarily towards the survival of the farmers and their families; in much of the pre-modern world, there was a fairly sharp divide between <em>most</em> farmers who farmed on a subsistence basis and the largest market-oriented estates of the wealthy, who will be our focus <em>next</em> week).</p>



<p>As a final caveat before we dive in, I specialize in the economy of the ancient Mediterranean, so my observations here are going to tend (where not otherwise noted) to be <em>most</em> true in the Mediterranean world, in that period (c. 650 BC – 450 AD).  Where I know there are major exceptions, I’ll try to note them, but it’s simply not possible to know every production permutation <em>everywhere</em> and at <em>every</em> time.  For this series, we’re going to focus on wheat production, with a bit of a Mediterranean bias (but I’ve tried to pull in some evidence from North China as well; by and large I’ve found that wheat cultivation seems to create <em>similar </em>patterns everywhere, but there is local variation).</p>



<p>As always, if you like what you are reading here, please share it; if you really like it, you can support me on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a>. And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on twitter (@BretDevereaux) for updates as to new posts as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or military history musings.</p>






<p><strong>Bibliography note at the outset</strong>: for the sake of keeping these posts readable, especially since I don’t have an easy footnote function here, I am not going to laboriously cite everything at each point of reference, but I’ll include a bibliography note up front for the whole series.  My information for the ancient Mediterranean is drawn from a number of sources, the most important of which are P. Erdkamp, <em>The Grain Market in the Roman Empire</em> (2005); N. Rosenstein, <em>Rome at War: Farms, Families and Death in the Middle Republic</em> (2004); Foxhall and Forbes, “Σιτομετρεία: The Role of Grain as a Staple Food in Classical Antiquity,” <em>Chiron</em> 12 (1982) and Foxhall, “The Dependent Tenant” <em>JRS</em> 80 (1990), and just reading a pile of Greek and Roman agricultural writers (Columella, Cato, Pliny the Elder, Xenophon, etc).<br>Note also C. Fischer-Bovet, <em>Army and Society in Ptolemaic Egypt</em> (2014), W. Scheidel, <em>Death on the Nile</em> (2001) and R. Bagnall and B. Frier, <em>The Demography of Roman Egypt </em>(1994) for the Egyptian demographic modeling.  Egypt is an important reference for demographic data because relatively more records survive there due to the arid conditions preserving papyrus.<br>I am less well read on Medieval European agriculture, but I should note some reliance here on M. Bloch, <em><em>La Société Féodale</em></em> (1940; available trans. Manyon, 1962) and E.L.R. Ladurie, <em>Les Paysans de Languedoc</em> (1966; available trans. J. Day, 1976).  Also relevant on general features and broad continuity, J. Landers, <em>The Field and the Forge</em> (2003); for the military history minded, Landers (and Rosenstein) are more focused on the connection between agriculture and military activity.<br>My references to Chinese agriculture are from Cho-yun Hsu, <em>Han Agriculture: The Formation of Early Chinese Agrarian Economy</em> (1980).</p>



<h2>Why Bread?</h2>



<p>From the outset I want to note that agriculture, especially subsistence agriculture, typically is not planting simple mono-cultures of a single crop.  I opted to focus in this series on <strong>bread</strong> because it is <em><strong>usefully simple</strong></em> for a number of reasons.  It lets us focus on wheat and barley, which are relatively simple crops to talk about but also (in the broad sweep of Eurasia where they were the primary crop) provided the majority of calories for the <em><strong>vast</strong></em> majority of people.  Vegetables, fruit, meat, other animal products (along with sauces and things derived from them) were in the ancient Mediterranean generally expensive things, used by most normal people (read: the not-super-rich) to <em>flavor</em> a meal that still consisted mostly of bread, when they were available at all.  That’s because (as we’ll see) wheat and barley were efficient and cheap to grow at scale.</p>

<p>That doesn’t mean that people <em>only</em> ate bread, to be clear.  The Mediterranean diet is built on a <em>triad</em> of grapes, grains and olives; animal products were also in the diet.  Grains don’t have a broad enough range of nutrients to really subsist someone forever; you need proteins and vitamins and so on.  <strong><em>But</em></strong> when we are looking at the bulk of what was eaten any way we measure it – calories, volume, weight, labor intensity, economic scale – cheap, mass-available grains just dominate, so that’s where we start.  When scholars model ancient agriculture and food habits, they build a nutritional model centered on grains and then supplement with other things as necessary (which as an aside is <em>also</em> how the Greeks and Romans actually talk about food – rations that we are quite sure included meat and vegetables are typically given as grain allowances, e.g. Thuc 4.16.1; Plut. <em>Lyc</em>. 12.2; Plb. 6.39.13; Cato, <em>de Agr.</em> 56).</p>



<p>Finally, a <strong>terminology note</strong>: when I say <strong>wheat</strong> I mean genus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat"><em>triticum</em> </a>and its subspecies; when I say <strong>barley</strong> I mean <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barley">Hordeum vulgare</a></em>.  I am going to use ‘grain’ or ‘grains’ to refer to both crops together (although there are many other grains).  The British frequently use the word ‘corn’ to refer to wheat; this causes no end of confusion in Americans, for whom ‘corn’ means <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize">maize</a>.  I do not know that I will reference maize, but if I do, I will call it maize and to avoid confusion, I am not going to use corn at all as a term.  Apologies to my British readers whose usage is, I should note, older but also more confusing.</p>



<p>To start with, we need to start not with our crops, <strong>but with our farm and farmers.</strong></p>



<h2>The Farming Household</h2>



<p>Looking at our peasant household, what we generally have are large families on small farms.  The households in these farms were not generally nuclear households, but extended ones.  Pre-Han Chinese documents assume a household to include three generations: two elderly parents, their son, his wife, and their four children (eight individuals total).  Ptolemaic and Roman census data reveal a bewildering array of composite families, including multi-generational homes, but also households composed of multiple nuclear families of siblings (so a man, his wife, his brother and then brother’s wife and their children, for instance), and so on.<strong>  Normal family units tended to be around eight individuals, but with wide variation</strong> (for comparison, <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/families/households.html">the average household size in the United States for a family is 3.14</a>).</p>

<p>At the same time that households <strong>were <em>large</em> (by modern standards), the farms they tilled were, by modern standards, very small</strong>.  The normal size of a Roman household small farm is generally estimated between 5 and 8 <em>iugera</em> (a Roman measurement of land, roughly 3 to 5 acres); in pre-Han Northern China (where wheat and millet, not rice, were the staple crops), the figure was “one hundred mu (4.764 acres)” – essentially the same.  In Languedoc, a study of Saint-Thibery in 1460 showed 118 households (out of 189) on farms of less than 20 <em>setérée</em> (12 acres or so; the <em>setérée </em>appears to be an inexact unit of measurement); 96 of them were on less than 10 <em>setérée</em> (about 6 acres).  So while there is a <em>lot</em> of variation, <strong>by and large it seems like the largest cluster of household farms tend to be around 3 to 8 acres or so; 5 acre farms are a good ‘average’ small farm.</strong></p>



<p>This coincidence of normal farm size and family size is not an accident, but essentially represents …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Resilience in Action is a podcast about all things resilience, from SRE to software engineering, to how it affects our personal lives, and more. Resilience in Action is hosted by Blameless Staff SRE Amy Tobey. Amy has been an SRE and DevOps practitioner since before those names existed. She cares <em>deeply</em> about her community of SREs and wants to take what she’s learned over the 20+ years of her career to help others.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In our fourth episode, Amy chats with Craig Sebenik, SRE at Aurora and co-author of “<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/what-is-sre/9781492054429/#:~:text=Book%20Description,sites%20continuously%20introduce%20new%20features.">What is SRE</a>?” and “<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/salt-essentials/9781491914427/">Salt Essentials</a>.” He has a degree from Le Cordon Bleu (Sydney, Australia), a Master's in Italian Cuisine (Apcius in Florene, Italy), and a Master's in Gastronomy (University of Rheims, France). His greatest passion is teaching what he has learned from adventures in SRE and cooking.<br></p><p>See the full transcript of their conversation below, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity.<br></p><p><strong>Amy Tobey: In lieu of introductions, I thought we should just jump straight into our first experiences on the internet.</strong><br></p><p><strong>Craig Sebenik: </strong>My first introduction to the web specifically (not the internet) was in graduate school at Brown in 1991. I had been using Gopher for a number of years and I loved Gopher. It was fantastic, but obviously pictures were kind of a pain in Gopher. Maps and things like that were not generally accessible but textual information was really easy to find because of its hierarchical nature.</p><p>One of the graduate students I was working with pointed me at this "brand new" thing called the world wide web. It was Mosaic back in the early days, and this was on an educational network.<br></p><p><strong>Amy Tobey: </strong>What kind of machine was it?<br></p><p><strong>Craig Sebenik: </strong>I was doing computational chemistry so they were all SGIs, even in those days with 19-20” monitors.</p><p>It was fantastic. I was used to Gopher and its hierarchical nature. Moving to the web was very, very different. And I said, "You know what? I'm looking for an email address for a friend of mine that I met at an internship a couple years before." The graduate student said, "Okay, what's the URL?" I'm like, "The what?". She said, "I need to know where to start."&nbsp;</p><p>In Gopher, you start at the root, you go to education or, in this case, New York and then you go down the chain looking for the right school. At this point, there were no search engines, and you had to know where to start. Looking back at the time, I&nbsp; was hopeful, but I had to say, "This thing sucks." I was not a fan of the web in the early days.<br></p><p><strong>Amy Tobey: </strong>Those of us that didn't really experience Gopher never knew that past. I came in late for Gopher. I hit Usenet early and then I basically skipped over Gopher entirely. Almost everybody I've talked to who experienced their formative time on Gopher tends to go, "Yeah this web stuff just kind of sucks by comparison."<br></p><p><strong>Craig Sebenik: </strong>Then WebCrawler and AltaVista came out. I'm like, "Oh, yeah. This makes it better." And then the big one hit—not the big one that most people today would think of—and that was Yahoo.</p><p>These college kids published essentially all their bookmarks (and this was back when Yahoo was something like cs.standford.edu/yahoo or something like that.) It was like, "This is fantastic." Much like Gopher, it was organized hierarchically.<br></p><p><strong>Amy Tobey: </strong>You were in school at this time for computational chemistry, so how the heck did you get from there to index technology?<br></p><p><strong>Craig Sebenik: </strong>I was always programming. I was programming on SGIs and then I transferred to University of Michigan and I graduated/dropped out. Whatever. It's all nuance. But I got my Masters from Michigan and I was, "Now I need a job. What do I know how to do?" At that point I didn't know a lot except how to program. The first job I got was actually a backup person. I would go in on Sundays and change the tapes.</p><p>That was a part time gig for three to four months. Then in ‘94, I found a mom-and-pop ISP located in Plymouth, Michigan. It's next to me down from Ann Arbor. There were maybe 20 employees and we were doing web design/ISP. We had a bank of modems that people would dial into.<br></p><p><strong>Amy Tobey: </strong>I kind of miss that entry point. That's a very different environment to cut your teeth in, compared to what a lot of corporations are like today. The friends of mine that did it described a shop where you could just basically—if you were getting stuff done—do whatever the heck you wanted. <strong>Can you talk a little bit about that environment and kind of how it molded how you approach reliability?</strong><br></p><p><strong>Craig Sebenik: </strong>One of the big differences in those days was security. Security was not as big of a deal as it is today. You just did the little bit of security that you needed to, and because there were fewer tools, it was more on individuals to write their own little bash scripts. This would have been before things like ADUser were as common as they are today.</p><p>So you had to write your own ADUser script that would update the password file, create the home directory, and change permissions on the home directory from a skeleton. It's so funny seeing what exists today. I wrote something exactly like that. Granted it was nowhere near as resilient as they are today. The number of edge cases that a general purpose tool has to deal with is significantly more than your specific scenario where you get a list of names from the sales person. They’d say, "We just signed this account. You need to add these 20 accounts to the main servers." You created a bash script with the current list of 20. You copied that script to all four servers, and you ran the script. You watched it and it was fine. The idea of centralized logging didn't exist, and the idea of metrics didn't exist in the same way.<br></p><blockquote>The number of edge cases that a general purpose tool has to deal with is significantly more than your specific scenario where you get a list of names from the sales person.</blockquote><p><strong>Amy Tobey:</strong> I mean we didn't even SSH really.

I wasn't making enough progress on my university parts because as a music major usually you get sucked into all of the ensembles, which are usually a credit or two but they usually want four to six hours a week of your time. I was way behind. And then toward the end I thought, "Oh crap. I've got to start making money at some point." ThenI had some realizations about myself and whether I was really suited to teach in high school or middle school. I did half a semester of CS.</p><p>I had learned a bunch of Linux over the summer, so I thought, "Oh, I'll try this CS thing. This is exciting," and was eternally bored. I found a job in Detroit doing systems administration for a stock broker. That was my entry point. But at the time I was still presenting as a white male. I feel like that was a big part of how I got that opportunity. <strong>When I look back at it, I keep trying to find those details in the story that I can share with other people for how they can get their start in the industry because systems administration in our experience has been a great place to enter.

The biggest thing was probably just digging around the file system. If your listeners don't know, SunOS 4 was essentially a BSD version, whereas Solaris was System 5.

They assume that systemd will do the right things for them.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In my self study of Rust, I’ve run into concepts that are different than anything else I’ve seen in other languages, and have had a hard time wrapping my head around. The purpose and usage of <code>Cell</code> and <code>RefCell</code> is one of those concepts. I said to myself, “why not write a blog, it’ll help you, and maybe help someone else!”. Putting my thoughts and inquiries in writing has been helpful for me, and I hope it’s just as helpful for you!</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>To understand what these things are, we need to understand <em>Interior Mutability</em> and how it relates to “normal” Rust.</p>

<p>What’s interior mutability? Interior mutability is different than the <em>Inherited Mutability</em> that we are so used to (even if we didn’t know the technical term). Variables in Rust exhibit inherited mutability when they are defined using the <code>mut</code> keyword; this is the standard way of declaring a mutable variable. The following code is what you don’t want, producing the error below it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>x</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The value of x is {}."</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Error!</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  |
2 |     let x = 1;
  |         -
  |         |
  |         first assignment to `x`
  |         help: make this binding mutable: `mut x`
3 |     x += 1;
  |     ^^^^^^ cannot assign twice to immutable variable
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Change <code>let x = 1</code> to <code>let mut x = 1</code>, and we solve the problem! The program correctly prints</p>



<p>Ok cool, that’s easy. Now what do we do when we want to update a variable in a function, but don’t want to pass ownership? We just use a mutable reference!</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>add_and_print</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>*</span><span>x</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The value of x in add_and_print is {}."</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>);</span>
    <span>// mutable reference to x is dropped</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span> <span>// Declare a mutable variable x</span>
    <span>add_and_print</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>x</span><span>);</span> <span>// Modify x in function</span>
    <span>x</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span> <span>// Modify x again</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The value of x in main is {}."</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which prints</p>

<div><div><pre><code>The value of x in add_and_print is 2.
The value of x in main is 3.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which is expected. Cool, we can update mutable references in functions and still update them where owned. In the example above, the reference <code>&amp;mut x</code> has inherited mutability as <code>mut</code> is being passed down directly from the current scope (as we’ll see, in contrast to interior mutability).</p>

<p>Ok, now here’s a contrived example, but represents the use case of <code>Cell</code> and <code>RefCell</code>. Let’s say we have this struct.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>XStruct</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>mut</span> <span>i32</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ok, so it’s a struct that holds a mutable reference to an i32, so ownership of <code>x</code> doesn’t change, and the following compiles.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#[derive(Debug)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>XStruct</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>mut</span> <span>i32</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>x_struct</span> <span>=</span> <span>XStruct</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>x</span> <span>};</span>

    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The value of x_struct is {:?}."</span><span>,</span> <span>x_struct</span><span>);</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The value of x is {:?}."</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and we get…</p>

<div><div><pre><code>The value of x_struct is XStruct { x: 1 }.
The value of x is 1.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Nice, still compiles and prints the expected result! Now let’s try an mutate <code>x</code> in <code>main</code>!</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#[derive(Debug)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>XStruct</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>mut</span> <span>i32</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span> <span>// Declare a mutable variable x</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>x_struct</span> <span>=</span> <span>XStruct</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>x</span> <span>};</span> <span>// Pass a mutable reference to x</span>

    <span>x</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span> <span>// Modify x...</span>

    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The value of x_struct is {:?}."</span><span>,</span> <span>x_struct</span><span>);</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The value of x is {:?}."</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and the compiler says…</p>

<div><div><pre><code>   |
8  |     let x_struct = XStruct { x: &amp;mut x };
   |                                 ------ borrow of `x` occurs here
9  |
10 |     x += 1;
   |     ^^^^^^ use of borrowed `x`
11 |
12 |     println!("The value of x_struct is {:?}.", x_struct);
   |                                                -------- borrow later used here
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ughhhhhhh, we can’t do this. We’ve made a mutable borrow when defining <code>x_struct</code>, and it hasn’t gone out of scope yet. The compiler WILL NOT let us do this. To understand why we can’t do this, let’s review Rust’s borrow rules:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You can have one mutable reference.
OR (exclusive)</li>
  <li>You can have multiple immutable references.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, our issue in the above example is that we have two references to <code>x</code>, and we want those references to be mutable. (Yeah I know, <code>x</code> in <code>main</code> isn’t borrowed, <code>x</code> owns it’s value, but I’d still think it be able to mutate it’s own data).</p>

<p>You may be asking, why do we have these rules in the first place? The reason is to prevent data races, which can result in nondeterministic errors, which are just awful to deal with (I won’t go deeper into data races as it’s a whole other topic in computer science and programming).</p>

<p>Ok, we have these rules, BUT I WANT MULTIPLE MUTABLE REFERENCES. That’s where interior mutability comes to the rescue!</p>

<p>The gist of interior mutability is that we can wrap something that’s <em>mutable</em> in a structure that is <em>immutable</em>. We can then create multiple immutable references to that thing (which follows rule #2 above), get a mutable reference when we’re ready, and then mutate the value! (We’ll discuss the caveats later. No free lunch, right?)</p>

<h3 id="refcellt-yay"><code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>, YAY!</h3>

<p>So, think of <code>RefCell</code> as the tortilla of the interior mutability burrito… (ok I’ll stop). Here’s an example of our failed borrow example using <code>RefCell</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>cell</span><span>::</span><span>RefCell</span><span>;</span>

<span>#[derive(Debug)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>XStruct</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>RefCell</span><span>&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>add_and_print</span><span>(</span><span>x_struct</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>XStruct</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>*</span><span>x_struct</span><span>.x</span><span>.borrow_mut</span><span>()</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span> <span>// Mutably borrow and dereference the underlying data</span>

    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The value of x_struct in add_and_print is {:?}."</span><span>,</span> <span>x_struct</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>ref_cell_x</span> <span>=</span> <span>RefCell</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span> <span>// ref_cell_x is immutable</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>x_struct</span> <span>=</span> <span>XStruct</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>ref_cell_x</span> <span>};</span> <span>// Pass an immutable reference to ref_cell_x</span>

    <span>add_and_print</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>x_struct</span><span>);</span> <span>// Pass an immutable reference to x_struct</span>

    <span>*</span><span>ref_cell_x</span><span>.borrow_mut</span><span>()</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span> <span>// Modify ref_cell_x</span>

    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Final value of x_struct is {:?}."</span><span>,</span> <span>x_struct</span><span>);</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Final value of x is {:?}."</span><span>,</span> <span>ref_cell_x</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>IT COMPILES!!!! The output we get is…</p>

<div><div><pre><code>The value of x_struct in add_and_print is XStruct { x: RefCell { value: 2 } }.
Final value of x_struct is XStruct { x: RefCell { value: 3 } }.
Final value of x is RefCell { value: 3 }.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>…which is exactly what we expected! The value in <code>ref_cell_x</code> first starts as 1, we call <code>add_and_print</code> which increases the value inside to 2, then we add 1 again to the value in <code>ref_cell_x</code> and get a final value of 3, and both <code>ref_cell_x</code> and <code>x_struct</code> both have the same value. We did this all without creating a mutable reference to <code>ref_cell_x</code>!</p>

<h3 id="but-what-about-cellt">But what about <code>Cell&lt;T&gt;</code>?</h3>

<p><code>Cell&lt;T&gt;</code> is just a different way to accomplish interior mutability. With <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>, you get a reference to the underlying data (note the <code>Ref</code> part). With <code>Cell&lt;T&gt;</code>, you indirectly interact with the wrapped value by using <code>set</code> and <code>get</code> (and some other fancy methods). Here’s the same example from above rewritten using <code>Cell&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>cell</span><span>::</span><span>Cell</span><span>;</span>

<span>#[derive(Debug)]</span>

    <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>Cell</span><span>&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>add_and_print</span><span>(</span><span>x_struct</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>XStruct</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>x_struct</span><span>.x</span><span>.get</span><span>();</span>
    <span>x_struct</span><span>.x</span><span>.set</span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>

    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The value of x_struct in add_and_print is {:?}."</span><span>,</span> <span>x_struct</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>cell_x</span> <span>=</span> <span>Cell</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>x_struct</span> <span>=</span> <span>XStruct</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>cell_x</span> <span>};</span>

    <span>add_and_print</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>x_struct</span><span>);</span>

    <span>let</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>cell_x</span><span>.get</span><span>();</span>
    <span>cell_x</span><span>.set</span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>

    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Final value of x_struct is {:?}."</span><span>,</span> <span>x_struct</span><span>);</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Final value of x is {:?}."</span><span>,</span> <span>cell_x</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and the output is…</p>

<div><div><pre><code>The value of x_struct in add_and_print is XStruct { x: Cell { value: 2 } }.
Final value of x_struct is XStruct { x: Cell { value: 3 } }.
Final value of x is Cell { value: 3 }.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>See? Same result. As you can tell, the only difference is that we first had to <code>get</code> the value out of the cell, modify it, and then <code>set</code> it again.</p>

<h3 id="when-should-i-use-refcellt-vs-cellt">When should I use <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> vs. <code>Cell&lt;T&gt;</code>?</h3>

<p>There are two main differences between <code>RefCell</code> and <code>Cell</code>. First, types wrapped in <code>Cell</code> must implement the <code>Copy</code> trait while those in <code>RefCell</code> don’t need to. This makes sense. When calling <code>get</code> on a <code>Cell</code>, you are getting a copy of the wrapped data, whereas the methods associated with <code>RefCell</code> are <code>borrow</code> and <code>borrow_mut</code>, which return references to the underlying data. Copying data back and forth does come at a performance cost, especially if the wrapped data is big, therefore making <code>RefCell</code> an attractive candidate.</p>

<p>The second difference is that <code>RefCell</code>’s references are checked at runtime, which comes at a performance cost of verifying reference counts and possibly being completely wrong about your borrowing logic and causing your program to panic (not good); you can’t cause panics using <code>set</code> and <code>get</code> with <code>Cell</code> as you’re not modifying the data through reference. Here’s an example of what can go wrong with <code>RefCell</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>cell</span><span>::{</span><span>RefCell</span><span>};</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>cell</span> <span>=</span> <span>RefCell</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>

    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>cell_ref_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>cell</span><span>.borrow_mut</span><span>();</span> <span>// Mutably borrow the underlying data</span>
    <span>*</span><span>cell_ref_1</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"RefCell value: {:?}"</span><span>,</span> <span>cell_ref_1</span><span>);</span>

    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>cell_ref_2</span> <span>=</span> <span>cell</span><span>.borrow_mut</span><span>();</span> <span>// Mutably borrow the data again (cell_ref_1 is still in scope though...)</span>
    <span>*</span><span>cell_ref_2</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"RefCell value: {:?}"</span><span>,</span> <span>cell_ref_2</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This program compiles, but panics halfway through running.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>thread 'main' panicked at 'already borrowed: BorrowMutError'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What? Isn’t the compiler supposed to prevent these types of reference errors? Yes, for “normal” mutable references. The reference rules stated earlier still apply, they’re just enforced at runtime when using <code>RefCell</code>.</p>

<p>And this is the double edged sword of <code>RefCell</code>s. There are times where we need more flexibility than just a singular mutable reference. <code>RefCell</code> gives us this flexibility, but at the cost of not checking our references statically.</p>

<p>I hope this explanation of interior mutability, <code>Cell</code>, and <code>RefCell</code> was helpful to you! Feel free to contact me if you any comments, suggestions, or just need to correct me!</p>

              <p>
                As a small startup, when it comes to process (the word itself induces unpleasant flashbacks to sitting in tons of unproductive meetings at big companies) we try to follow the “if it’s not broken, then don’t fix it” mindset. 
              </p>
              <p>
                For a long time, since it was just Eric and I working together, we got by with almost no documentation other than a heap of disorganized Dropbox Paper documents, tons of calls at odd hours (often lasting until 2am), and a bunch of texts and/or Slack messages.
              </p>
              <p>
                This stopped working when two things happened: 1) we began working with our first contractor and 2) we began onboarding a lot more new customers. Things got a lot busier and resources became more scarce (there are only so many hours in the day!), and because we were so disorganized it was hard to keep focused on our actual goals instead of just dealing with whatever fires came up. Soon it became evident that <i>our lack</i> of process was holding us back. 
              </p>
              <p>
                To solve this, we followed the 80/20 rule to figure out how we could implement a minimal amount of process to help us reap a majority of the benefits. After trying a few things that haven’t worked, these are the 4 tools we’ve landed on that help us plan and execute against our goals each week: 
              </p>
              <ol>
                  <li><a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a>, for weekly priority tracking</li>
                  <li><a href="https://www.cadencework.com/">Cadence</a>, for status and progress updates</li>
                  <li><a href="https://www.linear.app/">Linear</a>, for task tracking</li>
                  <li>Only two scheduled 15 minute meetings to begin and end the week</li>
                </ol>
              
              
              <p>
                At Cadence, we run weekly sprints. We kick off each week with a short 15-minute meeting. This meeting is important because it is where we decide and align on what our top 3 weekly priorities are.
              </p>
              <p>
                We then record those weekly priorities in Notion and assign each priority an owner. For that week, the owner’s top goal is to achieve their priority, meaning they should prioritize and scope their tasks however they want so that they can do so.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is what our weekly priority table in Notion looks like:
              </p>
              <figure>
                <img src="https://www.cadencework.com/assets/img/notion-priorities.png" alt="Notion">
              </figure>
              <p>
                Afterwards, we break each of our priorities into discrete engineering tasks and add them to Linear. (I will probably make a future post detailing how we track tasks and manage cycles in Linear, but that’s out of scope for now.) 
              </p>
              <p>
                Throughout the week, we use Cadence to update each other on the progress of our tasks as we work on them. Not only does Cadence eliminate the need for daily status calls, it also helps us proactively identify blockers. With our Cadence updates, we can help each other debug problems either directly in a threaded discussion on Slack or a quick, synchronous call. 
              </p>
              <p>
                This is what our Cadence updates look like: 
              </p>
              <figure>
                <img src="https://www.cadencework.com/assets/img/cadence-statuses.png" alt="Cadence Statuses">
              </figure>
              <p>
                We even use Cadence to praise members of our team, which further helps us stay connected throughout the week. 😄
              </p>
              <figure>

              </figure>
              <p>
                Finally, at the end of the week, we hop back on a call to assess how we did on achieving our priorities for that week. We also catch up with each other and chat about any fun weekend plans we have coming up. 😄
              </p>
              <figure>
                <img src="https://www.cadencework.com/assets/img/daily-hangout.png" alt="Daily Hangout">
              </figure>
              <p>
                Ultimately, as is true for any company, the product development cycle is a constantly evolving one. In fact, I am sure I will re-read this post in a few months and barely recognize what I am talking about. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

                                        <p><span>On July 23, local time, the Supreme Court of British Columbia dis-closed evidence for the next stage of court hearings in Meng Wanzhou's extradition case. On May 27, the court ruled that the Meng Wanzhou case was, in essence, related to fraud.</span></p>
<p>The disclosed evidence suggests that Meng's case was masterminded by the U.S. and entirely political in nature. HSBC was involved throughout the scheme, taking actions such as maliciously framing Meng and fabri-cating evidence. This indicated that Meng is innocent.</p>
<p><strong>The crime was falsified and allegations were groundless</strong></p>
<p>According to the Record of Case that the U.S. submitted to the Canadian court, Meng concealed Huawei's relationship with Skycom Tech. Co., Ltd. ("Skycom"), which misled HSBC into continuing providing bank-ing services to Huawei. Therefore, HSBC violated U.S. sanctions against Iran and faced the risk of civil and criminal penalties. Meng's conduct amounted to fraud.</p>
<p>The only piece of key evidence in this case was a PowerPoint presenta-tion that Meng delivered to HSBC. The disclosed materials included the full text of the PowerPoint presentation and correspondence between HSBC and Huawei. However, it was found that the U.S. deliberately concealed and misinterpreted key information, meaning the allegations were inconsistent with facts.</p>
<p><strong>HSBC was aware of the relationship between Huawei and Skycom throughout the process</strong></p>
<p>HSBC professed that it was unclear about the relationship between Huawei and Skycom, but this was a blatant lie.</p>
<p>Skycom was Huawei's partner in Iran, and the relationship between these two companies was clear. Huawei had held shares in Skycom and Meng Wanzhou had once been on Skycom's Board of Directors for a short period of time. In 2007, Huawei sold its shares in Skycom and in April 2009, Meng left her position as a board member. Since then, the two companies had maintained normal business dealings.</p>
<p>HSBC was aware of Huawei's business in Iran throughout the process, and correspondence between the three parties in 2010 suggested HSBC had been fully aware of the relationship between Huawei and Skycom. According to the 2009 and 2010 financial statements that Huawei sent to HSBC, the bank fully understood Skycom's business operations in Iran.</p>
<p>HSBC attempted to justify their false arguments and make their evi-dence sound more convincing by claiming that only "junior" employees were aware of the relationship between Huawei and Skycom. The bank went on to say that these "junior" employees did not report the relevant information to "senior" executives. Therefore, these executives could only assess the associated risks based on the PowerPoint presentation provided by Meng.</p>
<p>This rhetoric is simply nonsense.</p>
<p>As the world's largest telecom equipment manufacturer and a Fortune 500 company, Huawei had been the 17th largest customer of HSBC's Global Liquidity and Cash Management Department. In addition to this, the two companies had collaborated for nearly 20 years. Therefore, having a "junior" employee serving as Huawei's account manager would have been unreasonable as well as unbelievable. HSBC pointed its fingers at their own employees, which was neither a reason to exempt them from liability nor an act that complied with the regulations of the banking industry.</p>
<p>It is particularly worth noting that in December 2012, HSBC signed a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) due to the bank's own misconduct. This misconduct included vi-olations of U.S. sanctions against Iran. HSBC assured the U.S. DOJ that it would complete remediation in relation to all its group customers. How could it have been possible that HSBC was unaware of the relationship between Huawei and Skycom throughout this process? If HSBC was unaware, then this would imply that they deceived the U.S. DOJ and should be subject to heavy penalties.</p>
<p>The most basic compliance requirement for large financial institutions is "know your customers". HSBC had a dedicated risk management committee and claimed that all of its branches had established compli-ance departments. If their risk assessment relied solely on Meng's Pow-erPoint presentation, then why did they have so many compliance staff?</p>
<p>In order to frame Meng, HSBC defamed itself and seriously damaged a reputation that it had cultivated for over a century.</p>
                                                                                    <!--正文分页结束-->

Whenever I stopped to take photos from the Grand Canyon to Niagara Falls or any particularly impressive bit of architecture in between I took pains to frame the images just so.</p>

<p>I was determined to screen out the overhead electrical wires, trash dumpsters, and road construction that detracted from the postcard images I was trying to achieve. He said those pictures were clichés. Everyone already knows what they look like because they’re on a million kitchen calendars and Hallmark cards. Why not capture what the landscape really looks like? America is mostly parking lots, squat concrete strip malls, storm water retention ponds, refineries, chain link fences, and tract homes made of plastic siding. Photographing the authentic American landscape is both more challenging and ultimately more rewarding if you can do it well.</p>

<p>I was in Missoula, Montana a while back attempting to capture the look and feel of the place when the director of a senior center walked up to me and demanded to know what I was doing. I said I was a tourist taking pictures. She didn’t believe me. <em>These aren’t tourist scenes.</em> She insisted I stop or she was going to call the police. I offered a vague apology, showed her my identification, and said I’d stay put until the authorities arrived.</p>

<p>I was walking around a nondescript neighborhood in Chicago a few years ago when five squad cars surrounded me at an intersection. I was asked for my identification, they were keen to see what was on my camera, and there were all sorts of questions about who I was and what I was up to. The police wouldn’t say exactly why they descended on me in such an overwhelming fashion, but it was pretty clear there had been a report of unsavory activity of the terrorist variety.</p>

<p>Last year I was in Atlanta wandering around as I tend to do. So much of this particular neighborhood had devolved into a state of disrepair that the buildings were uninhabitable. But to my surprise people were still living in some of the units. More shocking still, as I later learned, landlords continued collecting rent from tenants.</p>
<p>As I explored the area and gathered photos a woman called out to me from across the street. <em>Not for camera view!</em> She kept repeating the phrase over and over. <em>Not for camera view!</em> I approached her, introduced myself, and asked her why she objected to my activities. She shook her head and waved her hands adamantly. <em>Not for camera view!</em> That’s all she ever said to me. I suspect a middle aged white guy with an expensive camera was an indication that there were forces at work that threatened her housing situation – as precarious and substandard as it was. I tried to imagine where she might be forced to live if these buildings and her situation were ever disturbed.</p>

<p>Some time later I was in Thousand Oaks, a prosperous suburban enclave in Southern California, doing the same thing. A man came out of his home and marched across his lawn toward me full of piss and vinegar. He demanded to know who I was, but before I could answer he let me know exactly who he thought I was. <em>I was a thief casing the neighborhood!</em>&nbsp;I’m a lot of things, but threatening isn’t one of them. I handed him my drivers license and told him the truth. Documenting the American landscape is a peculiar hobby of mine.</p>
<p>He scoffed, but decided I wasn’t a thief. <em>He realized at that moment that I was a real estate developer looking to destroy his community!</em>&nbsp;Nope. Not even close. I said I was curious about how people live in different places, et cetera. He became squinty eyed. <em>I was a news reporter looking to stir up trouble!</em> Well, I have a blog, but so does everyone and their dog. It’s not like I’m with the New York Times or anything. <em>Aha! You’re from the government!</em> (Read: a dirty communist.) And so it went.</p>

<p>I was in Detroit doing my usual thing when a man across the street began yelling at me. <em>You have no right to photograph me without express written permission!</em> He came at me with righteous indignation. I handed him my card, told him I was visiting from San Francisco, and said I was curious about what Detroit was really like. <em>I will sue you if you publish any photos of me in them! How dare you violate my rights!</em> I scrolled though the images on my camera screen and showed him I wasn’t actually photographing him at all. His expression flickered for a split second before he redirected his tirade. <em>You have no right to invade our community. You think this place is yours to do with as you please, but it’s not. </em>The conversation went on like this for a while. I wanted to know who he thought I was and what he thought I was doing. I wanted to know about the specifics of his grievances. <em>Anything I tell you will only be used against me and my people.</em></p>
<p>So this is what America is actually like. The good, the bad, and the ugly. Look out your window. Take a drive down to your local big box store. Walk around your neighborhood. This is reality. Just sayin’.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This is a story of how a software company was able to start a conversation with 8x more of their users by cutting&nbsp;the length of their emails by 90%. You could set up a test of this method in less than an hour.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/c377678ef05df48ca100bc7c0c7b4ee18ae4292d/5f0ab/images/uploads/0356.jpg" alt="Cartoon About Saying Less"></p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p><strong>One of the most valuable things you could do for your software business is talk to your users.</strong> You can help them get more value from your software, learn how they use your product, hear their feedback, and demonstrate the quality and commitment of your support.</p>

<p>However, if you’ve ever tried to talk to your users by email, you probably ran into a problem:&nbsp;<strong>Many users&nbsp;don’t respond.</strong></p>

<p>Even if you follow all the best practices around emails, genuinely want to help them, and spend a long time writing a personalized email, people&nbsp;still don’t respond. That can be very frustrating.</p>

<p>Netlify—<a href="https://www.netlify.com/">a platform for static sites</a>—was feeling this frustration, so they brought me in to help.</p>

<p>Knowing that signups don’t matter if new users aren’t starting to use and get value from the software, Netlify was emailing every new user with an offer to help or answer any questions.</p>

<p>By most measures, the email was good: It was personalized, sent within&nbsp;a day, sent by a real person (their head of customer success), and had&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gkogan.co/blog/dont-design-emails/">no flashy design</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Unfortunately it had a reply rate of just 1%.</strong> They were missing a huge opportunity by&nbsp;failing to reach 99 of every 100 users.</p>

<h2>The Solution: Saying Less</h2>
<p>When I saw the length of the original email, I suspected users are:</p>

<ul>
 	<li>Not&nbsp;bothering to read it because of its length.</li>
 	<li>Assuming it's a template email because of its length, and therefore don't believe the offer to help is sincere.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first thing I&nbsp;did was delete most of the email text&nbsp;and run an A/B test against the original…</p>

<h3>First A/B Test:&nbsp;Original vs Short Email</h3>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7fe4ca1e7b73c29c841ee396bc6a727fcf546bbd/4f5e5/images/uploads/onboarding-email-1.jpg" alt="Long Onboarding Email"></p>

<p>This original email had 150+ words and a reply rate of 1% (1 of every 100 users).</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/a0b1c850a8b4f90c586af96347a02cce4516fe5d/2c0d2/images/uploads/onboarding-email-2.jpg" alt="Short Onboarding Email"></p>

<p>This variation&nbsp;had 37 words&nbsp;and resulted in a reply&nbsp;rate&nbsp;of 4% (1 of every 25 users).</p>

<p><strong>Cutting the original email text by 75% increased the reply rate by 300%.</strong></p>

<p>That’s a terrific&nbsp;result for a few minutes of work. I&nbsp;could have stopped there, but wondered how far I&nbsp;could take this before seeing diminishing returns.</p>

<p>On to the second test…</p>

<h3>Second A/B Test: Short vs Very Short</h3>

<p>I&nbsp;took the winning email from the first test and cut another 50% of the text, taking out as much as possible while retaining the email’s meaning, then tested it against the previous winner.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/277ca277bbecd4e9282c4bd579557b6029cae3f1/513f3/images/uploads/onboarding-email-3.jpg" alt="Very Short Onboarding Email"></p>

<p>This version has just 14 words. It resulted in a reply rate of 8% (1 of every 12 users).</p>

<p><strong>Cutting the email text by another 50% <em>doubled</em> the&nbsp;reply rates from the previous version.</strong> Compared to the original, the length was cut by 90% and reply rates increased by 700%.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/164e960178dbe5fd0019901e2da78a68bcb38406/55ff3/images/uploads/reply-rates.png" alt="Email Reply Rates"></p>

<p><strong>Imagine you could onboard 8x more people to your software&nbsp;and hear 8x more feedback from new users.</strong> That’s the power of saying less.</p>

<h2>Try It Yourself</h2>

<p>Take your welcome&nbsp;or onboarding&nbsp;email—<a href="https://www.gkogan.co/blog/question-for-saas-trial-users/">start here</a> if you don’t have one—and cut out any text that isn’t&nbsp;necessary. When you feel you’re done, take out another 50%. Finally,&nbsp;run an A/B test and measure positive replies to this shorter email versus your original.</p>

      <p>If you want to get anything done, there are two basic ways to&nbsp;get yourself to do it.</p>
<p>The first, more popular and devastatingly wrong option is to try to motivate yourself.</p>
<p>The second, somewhat unpopular and entirely correct choice&nbsp;is to cultivate discipline.</p>
<p>This is one of these situations where adopting a different perspective immediately results in superior outcomes. Few uses of the term “paradigm shift” are actually legitimate, but this one is. It’s a lightbulb moment.</p>
<p>What’s the difference?</p>

<p><strong>Motivation, broadly speaking, operates on the erroneous assumption that a particular mental or emotional&nbsp;state is necessary to complete a task.</strong></p>
<p>That’s completely the wrong way around.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline, by contrast, separates outwards functioning from moods and feelings <em>and thereby ironically circumvents the problem by consistently improving them</em>.</strong></p>
<p>The implications are huge.</p>
<p><strong>Successful completion of tasks brings about the inner states that chronic procrastinators think they need to initiate tasks in the first place.</strong></p>
<p>Put in simpler form, <strong>you don’t wait until you’re in olympic form to start training. You train to get into olympic form.</strong></p>
<p>If action is conditional on feelings, waiting for the right mood becomes a particularly insidious form of procrastination. I know that too well, and wish somebody pointed it out for me twenty, fifteen or ten years ago before I learned the difference the hard way.</p>
<p>If you wait until you feel like doing stuff, you’re fucked. That’s precisely how the dreaded procrastinatory loops come about.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2014/08/Screen_Shot_2014_08_26_at_3.40.03_PM/e467ccab2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/08/the-procrastination-loop-and-how-to-break-it/379142/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source of picture&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>At its core, chasing motivation is insistence on the infantile fantasy that we should only be doing&nbsp;things we<em> feel like</em> doing. The problem is then framed thus: “How do I get myself to <em>feel like doing</em> what I have rationally decided to do?”. Bad.</p>
<p>The proper question is “How do I make my feelings inconsequential and do the things I consciously want to do without being a little bitch about it?”.</p>
<p>The point is to cut the link between feelings and actions, and do it anyway. You get to feel good and buzzed and energetic and eager <em>afterwards</em>.</p>
<p>Motivation has this the wrong way around. I am utterly 100% convinced that this faulty frame is the main driver of the “sitting about in underwear playing Xbox, and with yourself” epidemic currently sweeping developed countries.</p>
<p>There are psychological problems with relying on motivation as well.</p>
<p>Because real life in the real world occasionally requires people do things that nobody in their right mind can be massively enthusiastic about, “motivation” runs into the insurmountable obstacle of trying to elicit enthusiasm for things that objectively do not merit it. The only solution besides slackery, then, is to put people out of their right minds. That’s a horrible, and fortunately fallacious, dilemma.</p>
<p>Trying to drum up enthusiasm for fundamentally dull and soul crushing activities is literally a form of deliberate psychological self-harm, a voluntary insanity: “I AM SO PASSIONATE ABOUT THESE SPREADSHEETS, I CAN’T WAIT TO FILL OUT THE EQUATION FOR FUTURE VALUE OF ANNUITY, I LOVE MY JOB SOOO MUCH!”</p>
<p>I do not consider self-inflicted episodes of hypomania the optimal driver of human activity. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysthymia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thymic</a> compensation via depressive episodes is inevitable, since&nbsp;the human brain will not tolerate abuse indefinitely. There are stops and safety valves. There are hormonal hangovers.</p>
<p>The worst thing that can happen is succeeding at the wrong thing – temporarily. A far superior scenario is retaining sanity, which unfortunately tends to be misinterpreted as moral failure: <em>“I still don’t love my pointless paper-shuffling job, I must be doing something wrong.”</em> <em>“I still prefer cake to brocolli and can’t lose weight, maybe I’m just weak”.</em> <em>“I should buy another book about motivation”</em>. Bullshit. The critical error is even approaching those issues in terms of motivation or lack thereof. The answer&nbsp;is discipline, not motivation.</p>
<p>There is another, practical problem with motivation. It has a tiny shelf life, and needs constant refreshing.</p>
<p>Motivation is like manually winding up a crank to deliver a burst of force. At best, it stores and converts energy to a particular purpose. There are situations where it is the correct attitude, one-offs where getting psyched and spring-loading a metric fuckton of mental energy upfront is the best course of action. Olympic races and prison breaks come to mind. But it is a horrible basis for regular day-to-day functioning, and anything like consistent long-term results.</p>
<p>By contrast, discipline is like an engine that, once kickstarted, actually <em>supplies</em> energy to the system.</p>
<p>Productivity has no requisite mental states. For consistent, long-term results, discipline trumps motivation, runs circles around it, bangs its mom and eats its lunch.</p>
<p>In summary, motivation is trying to feel like doing stuff. Discipline is doing it even if you don’t feel like it.</p>
<p>You get to feel good <em>afterwards</em>.</p>
<p>Discipline, in short, is a system, whereas motivation is analogous to goals. There is a symmetry. Discipline is more or less self-perpetuating and constant, whereas motivation is a bursty kind of thing.</p>
<p>How do you cultivate discipline? By building habits – starting as small as you can manage, even microscopic, and gathering momentum, reinvesting it in progressively bigger changes to your routine, and building a&nbsp;positive feedback loop.</p>
<p>Motivation is a counterproductive attitude to productivity. What counts is discipline.</p>

<h2> Haskell Language Server, binaries and installation </h2>
<p>
    Posted on July 24, 2020 by <a href="https://github.com/bubba">Luke Lau</a>
    <span><img src="https://mpickering.github.io/ide/images/bubba.png"></span>
</p>

<p>If you’ve ever had to install <em>haskell-ide-engine</em> or <em>haskell-language-server</em>, you might be aware that it is quite a lengthy process. There are several reasons for this, two of the most significant being:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both <em>haskell-ide-engine</em> and <em>haskell-language-server</em> act as a kitchen sink for plugins. These plugins all depend on the corresponding tool from Hackage, and as a result they end up pulling in <strong>a lot</strong> of transient dependencies.</li>
<li>The GHC API that powers the underlying <em>ghcide</em> session only works on projects that match <strong>the same</strong> GHC version as it was compiled with. This means that in order to support multiple GHC versions (which is quite common with Stack projects that can define a specific version of GHC) the install script needs to build a binary of <em>haskell-ide-engine</em>/<em>haskell-language-server</em> <strong>for every single GHC version</strong> that is supported.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter is the purpose of the <em>hie-wrapper</em>/<em>haskell-language-server-wrapper</em> executable. The <code>install.hs</code> script will install binaries for every version under <code>haskell-language-server-8.6.5</code>, <code>haskell-language-server-8.8.3</code>, etc. The wrapper is then used in place of the language server, and will detect what version of GHC the project is using and launch the appropriate version of <em>hie</em>/<em>haskell-language-server</em>.</p>
<p>Building all these different binaries with several different versions of GHC means you need to build every single dependency multiple times over, leading to some hefty build times and chewing through a lot of disk space. On top of this, installation from source is the <em>only</em> supported installation method so far. This isn’t great for newcomers or for those who just want to setup a working IDE in a pinch. So many of us have spent the past month hard at work trying to improve the installation story.</p>

<p>One obvious solution would be to just provide static binaries. This has been a <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine/issues/1068">long running discussion</a>, that dates all the way back to <em>haskell-ide-engine</em>. When we say static binaries, we mean a binary that has no dynamically linked libraries. You can test that by running <code>ldd</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ ldd haskell-language-server-wrapper
    linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007fff185de000)
    libz.so.1 =&gt; /usr/lib/libz.so.1 (0x00007faa3a937000)
    libtinfo.so.5 =&gt; /usr/lib/libtinfo.so.5 (0x00007faa3a8d2000)
    librt.so.1 =&gt; /usr/lib/librt.so.1 (0x00007faa3a8c7000)
    libutil.so.1 =&gt; /usr/lib/libutil.so.1 (0x00007faa3a8c2000)
    libdl.so.2 =&gt; /usr/lib/libdl.so.2 (0x00007faa3a8bc000)
    libpthread.so.0 =&gt; /usr/lib/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007faa3a89a000)
    libgmp.so.10 =&gt; /usr/lib/libgmp.so.10 (0x00007faa3a7f7000)
    libm.so.6 =&gt; /usr/lib/libm.so.6 (0x00007faa3a6b2000)
    libc.so.6 =&gt; /usr/lib/libc.so.6 (0x00007faa3a4eb000)
    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 =&gt; /usr/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007faa3a9ab000)</code></pre>
<p>That’s a lot of linked libraries, all of which will need to be available on the users machine if we were just to ship the binary like that. With cabal-install, we can statically link these with just <code>cabal build --enable-exeutable-static</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ ldd haskell-language-server-Linux-8.10.1 
	not a dynamic executable</code></pre>
<p>However one big caveat is that this only works on Linux. macOS doesn’t really have a notion of truly static binaries, since the system libraries are only provided as dylibs. The best we can do is just ensure that the only dynamically linked libraries are the ones already provided by the system, which it looks like it was in the first place!</p>
<pre><code>$ otool -L haskell-language-server
haskell-language-server:
	/usr/lib/libncurses.5.4.dylib (compatibility version 5.4.0, current version 5.4.0)
	/usr/lib/libiconv.2.dylib (compatibility version 7.0.0, current version 7.0.0)
	/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1281.100.1)
	/usr/lib/libcharset.1.dylib (compatibility version 2.0.0, current version 2.0.0)</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, making a static binary is one thing, but having that binary be portable is another. If we want the binary to run on other machines outside of the host, it can’t rely on data-files, which some <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine/issues/1143">plugins such as <em>hlint</em> used</a>. And the same goes for any <code>libexec</code> binaries, which <em>cabal-helper</em> took advantage of.</p>
<p>Once these were <a href="https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint/pull/824">taken care of upstream</a>, we then had to deal with GHC library directory: This is a directory that comes with your GHC installation, typically in something like <code>/usr/local/lib/ghc-8.10.1/</code> or in <code>~/.stack/programs/x86_64-osx/ghc-8.10.1/lib/ghc-8.10.1/</code> for Stack. Inside it contains all the compiled <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Library_submissions#The_Libraries">core libraries</a>, as well as the actual ghc executable itself: Your <code>/usr/bin/ghc</code> is most likely a script that just launches the binary in the library directory!</p>

<p>Either way, <em>ghcide</em>/<em>haskell-language-server</em> use the GHC API, which <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-8.10.1/docs/GHC.html#v:runGhc">needs to know where this directory is</a> to do it’s job:</p>

<p>The most common way to get the path to the library directory is through the <a href="https://github.com/simonmar/ghc-paths/blob/master/Setup.hs"><em>ghc-paths</em></a> package, which uses <a href="https://github.com/simonmar/ghc-paths/blob/master/Setup.hs">some custom <code>Setup.hs</code> magic</a> to work out where the library directory is, for the GHC <strong>that is being used to compile the program</strong>. It bakes in the paths at compile time, which means it’s portable if we share the source and build it on other systems. But if we build it on one system where the library directory is at <code>/usr/local/lib/ghc-8.10.1</code> for example, then when <strong>distributing the binary</strong> to another system it will still try looking for the old path which resides on a completely different machine! For example, if GHC was installed via ghcup on the other system, then the library directory would reside at <code>~/.ghcup/ghc/8.10.1/lib/</code>: a very different location.</p>
<p>So if we want to be able to distribute these binaries and have them actually run on other systems, <em>ghc-paths</em> is out of the question. This means that we have to somehow get the library directory oureslves <strong>at runtime</strong>. Thankfully, the <code>ghc</code> executable has a handy command for this:</p>
<pre><code>$ ghc --print-libdir
/usr/local/lib/ghc-8.10.1</code></pre>
<p>We could just call this directly. But what if you had a Cabal project, configured with <code>cabal configure -wghc-8.8.3</code> whilst the <code>ghc</code> on your PATH was version 8.10.1? Then the library directories would have mismatching verisons! What we can do instead however is:</p>
<pre><code>$ cabal exec ghc -- --print-libdir
Resolving dependencies...
/usr/local/lib/ghc-8.8.3</code></pre>
<p>And consider even the case for Stack, where it downloads GHC for you. Well, we can do the same thing as Cabal:</p>
<pre><code>$ stack exec ghc -- --print-libdir
/Users/luke/.stack/programs/x86_64-osx/ghc-8.6.5/lib/ghc-8.6.5</code></pre>
<p>These commands are tool specific, so it only made perfect sense to put this logic into <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hie-bios"><em>hie-bios</em></a>, our library for interfacing and setting up GHC sessions with various tools. Now there’s an API for cradles to specify how to execute the <code>ghc</code> executable that they use when building themselves.</p>

<p>The build process is automated across a wide range of platforms and GHC versions on GitHub Actions, which gets triggered everytime a release is made. Previously setting up Haskell on Travis CI/CircleCI/AppVeyor used to be pretty fiddly, but the <a href="https://github.com/actions/setup-haskell">setup-haskell</a> action for GitHub has made dramatic strides recently. In just a few lines of yaml we can setup a rather hefty build matrix for all the verisons we support:</p>
<pre><code>  build:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}

    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        ghc: ['8.10.1', '8.8.3', '8.8.2', '8.6.5', '8.6.4']
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macOS-latest, windows-latest]
        exclude:
          - os: windows-latest
            ghc: '8.8.3' # fails due to segfault
          - os: windows-latest
            ghc: '8.8.2' # fails due to error with Cabal</code></pre>
<p>
<img alt="Now that's what I call a build matrix" src="https://mpickering.github.io/ide/images/github-actions-matrix.png" height="300">
</p>
<p>Unfortunately the story of Haskell on Windows is a bit hairy as usual, so there were a few bumps that needed worked around. The biggest and most annoying one by far was hitting the <code>MAX_PATH</code> limit for file paths whenever we tried to build the <code>haskell-language-server-wrapper</code> executable. Admittedly this is a rather long name for a binary, but a combination of the fact that GitHub actions checks out the source directory in <code>D:\a\haskell-language-server\haskell-language-server</code> and how Cabal’s per-component builds nest build products crazy deep meant that we we’re constantly going over the rather stringent 260 character limit:</p>
<pre><code>Linking D:\a\haskell-language-server\haskell-language-server\dist-newstyle\build\x86_64-windows\ghc-8.10.1\haskell-language-server-0.1.0.0\x\haskell-language-server-wrapper\build\haskell-language-server-wrapper\haskell-language-server-wrapper.exe ...
55
realgcc.exe: error: D:\a\haskell-language-server\haskell-language-server\dist-newstyle\build\x86_64-windows\ghc-8.10.1\haskell-language-server-0.1.0.0\x\haskell-language-server-wrapper\build\haskell-language-server-wrapper\haskell-language-server-wrapper-tmp\Paths_haskell_language_server.o: No such file or directory
56
`gcc.exe' failed in phase `Linker'. (Exit code: 1)</code></pre>
<p>We tried several things including</p>
<ul>
<li>Enabling the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file#enable-long-paths-in-windows-10-version-1607-and-later">LongPathsEnabled registry key</a> to disable this restriction. But it turns out it was already on the entire time and <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/13373">GHC/GCC aren’t using the right Windows API calls</a></li>
<li>Checking out the code in a different root directory, but it doesn’t seem to be possible with GitHub actions</li>
<li>Squashing the build directory with just <code>--build-dir=b</code> – still left us 2 characters over the limit!</li>
<li>Disabling per-component builds – just fails with another build error</li>
</ul>
<p>But at the end of the day, the only reliable solution was just to rename <code>haskell-language-server-wrapper</code> to something shorter whilst building:</p>
<pre><code>- name: Shorten binary names
  shell: bash
  run: |
    sed -i.bak -e 's/haskell-language-server/hls/g' \
               -e 's/haskell_language_server/hls/g' \
               haskell-language-server.cabal
    sed -i.bak -e 's/Paths_haskell_language_server/Paths_hls/g' \
               src/**/*.hs exe/*.hs</code></pre>
<p>There’s still some sporadic issues with <a href="https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/6986">Cabal on Windows</a> and GitHub Actions having infrastructure outages so the builds aren’t 100% flake free yet, but it does provide a rather large build …</p></div></div></div>

<h2><strong>What is DevOps?</strong></h2>



<p>The DevOps methodology, a software and team management approach defined by the portmanteau of Development and Operations, was first coined in 2009 and has since become a buzzword concept in the IT field. </p>



<p>DevOps has come to mean many things to each individual who uses the term as DevOps is not a singularly defined standard, software, or process but more of a culture. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/devops" target="_blank">Gartner</a> defines DevOps as:</p>



<p><em>“DevOps represents a change in IT culture, focusing on rapid IT service delivery through the adoption of agile, lean practices in the context of a system-oriented approach. DevOps emphasizes people (and culture), and seeks to improve collaboration between operations and development teams. DevOps implementations utilize technology—especially automation tools that can leverage an increasingly programmable and dynamic infrastructure from a life cycle perspective.”</em></p>



<p>As you can see from the above definition, DevOps is a multi-faceted approach to the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), but its main underlying strength is how it leverages technology and software to streamline this process. So with the right approach to DevOps, notably adopting its philosophies of co-operation and implementing the right tools, your business can increase deployment frequency by a factor of 30 and lead times by a factor of 8000 over traditional methods, according to a CapGemini <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/de-de/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/03/devops-the-future-of-application-lifecycle-automation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">survey</a>.</p>



<h2><strong>The Right Tools for the Job</strong></h2>



<p>This list is designed to be as comprehensive as possible. The article comprises both very well established tools for those who are new to the DevOps methodology and those tools that are more recent releases to the market—either way there is bound to be a tool on here that can be an asset for you and your business. For those who already live and breathe DevOps, we hope you find something that will assist you in your growing enterprise.</p>



<p>With such a litany of tools to choose from, there is no “right” answer to what tools you should adopt. No single tool will cover all your needs, and will be deployed across a variety of development and Operational teams, so let’s break down what you need to consider before choosing what tool might work for you.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Plan and collaborate:</strong> Before you even begin the SDLC, your business needs to have a cohesive idea of what tools they’ll need to implement across your teams. There are even DevOps tools that can assist you with this first crucial step.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Build:</strong> Here you want tools that create identically provisioned environments. The last you need is to hear “But it works for me on my computer”</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Automation:</strong> This has quickly become a given in DevOps, but automation will always drastically increase production over manual methods.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Continuous Integration:</strong> Tools need to provide constant and immediate feedback, several times a day but not all integrations are implemented equally, will the tool you select be right for the job?</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Deployments need to be kept predictable, smooth and reliable with minimal risks, automation will also play a big part in this process.</li></ul>



<p>With all that in mind, I hope this selection of tools will aid you as your business continues to expand into the DevOps lifestyle.</p>

<h2>3. <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/" target="_blank">Google Cloud Deployment Manager</a></strong></h2>



<p>Much like the tools mentioned above, Google Cloud Deployment Manager is Google’s IAC tool for the Google Cloud Platform. This tool utilizes YAML for its config files, and JINJA2 or PYTHON for its templates. Some of its notable features are synchronistic deployment and ‘preview’, allowing you an overhead view of changes before they are committed.</p>

<p>Terraform is brought to you by HashiCorp, the makers of Vault and Nomad. Terraform is vastly different from the above mentioned tools in that it is not restricted to a specific cloud environment, this comes with increased benefits for tackling complex distributed applications without being tied to a single platform.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Few have seen these happy little landscapes in person, and they're in Penticton all summer.</p><div><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="" sizes="" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5660021.1595516348!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/bob-ross.jpeg"></p></div><figcaption>Bob Ross does his happy little thing. Scene from The Joy of Painting.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Bob Ross, Inc.)</figcaption></figure><p><span><p>When a shipment of paintings from Bob Ross, Inc. arrived at the <a href="http://pentictonartgallery.com/bob-ross-exhibition">Penticton Art Gallery</a>, Paul Crawford realized he was looking at mountains and meadows and "happy little trees" that few, if any, had seen in decades.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"It was crazy opening them up," says Crawford, the curator at the PAG. "I don't think they'd seen the light of day since they were put in the boxes. They still smelled of turpentine."</p>  <p>To September 13, Penticton&nbsp;— a city of 33,000 in the Okanagan Valley&nbsp;—&nbsp;will be one of the only places in the world where you can find an authentic Bob Ross. And the solo exhibition, <em>Happy Little Accidents</em>, is the largest of its kind to happen anywhere to date. Still, with more than 30 Bob Ross originals on view, the selection is nothing — a mere drop in the babbling brook — when you consider the volume Ross produced on <em>The Joy of Painting</em> alone.&nbsp;</p>  <h2>'Let's get crazy'</h2>  <p>Between 1983-94, the series taped 403 episodes out of a local PBS station in Muncie, Ind. And beyond the occasional guest appearance — from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QWvzEQ69Kw">Bob's son Steve</a> or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpNrn0_97LM">Peapod the Squirrel</a> — the program's lulling, low-budget formula never really wavered.&nbsp;</p>  <p>In half an hour, Ross would conjure an original painting, pictures he actually created in triplicate for each episode. One painting was a reference image;&nbsp;another was for publication (instructional books were a pillar of the original Bob Ross empire, a business that was reportedly worth <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/22/arts/television-bob-ross-the-frugal-gourmet-of-painting.html?pagewanted=all">$15 million US</a> by 1991). And the third piece materialized as the cameras rolled.&nbsp;</p>  <p>It's those canvases — familiar landscapes of nowhere in particular — that countless viewers have admired from home. But beyond the screen, these original works have rarely, if ever, been on view. Though Ross was known to occasionally donate his work to PBS stations, he didn't sell the paintings made on the program, and Bob Ross, Inc. — the company that manages his intellectual property — has never been in the business of dealing art. Originals are not for sale through BRI. Instead, you can buy Bob Ross jigsaw puzzles, novelty socks, even Fun Dip-style powdered candy (the Bob Ross "<a href="https://experience.bobross.com/2019/11/14/bob-ross-candy-flavor-palette/">Flavor Palette</a>"). On rare occasions, <a href="https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/entertainment/art/4684705-Minnesota-couple-learns-painting-bought-40-years-ago-is-Bob-Ross-original">an authentic landscape</a> will appear on the market.

Used with permission. )</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>If you want to see an actual painting, traditionally&nbsp;there's only been one reliable option. A&nbsp;collection can be found in New Smyrna Beach, Fla., home to the <a href="https://www.bobrossartworkshop.com/">Bob Ross Art Workshop and Gallery</a> since 1992. But the motherlode's stored at BRI headquarters. Last year, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/arts/bob-ross-paintings-mystery.html"><em>New York Times</em></a> journeyed to their office in Herndon, Va., and made a charming, bite-sized documentary that solved the mystery of the missing landscapes. (Some 1,165 Bob Ross originals are stashed away in their building.)</p>  <p>Crawford saw that doc last summer. And then he sent BRI an email. He wanted those paintings in Penticton.&nbsp;</p>  <h2>Making <em>Happy Little Accidents</em></h2>  <p>"I was really wanting to celebrate the legacy of Bob Ross, and really look at some of the larger questions that Bob presented himself: whose work deserves to be in a museum, and whose work needs to be remembered?" says Crawford.&nbsp;</p>  <p>A few years back, an exhibition devoted to the landscapes of <a href="https://mackenzie.art/experience/exhibition/a-sublime-vernacular-the-landscape-paintings-of-levine-flexhaug/">Levine Flexhaug</a>&nbsp;— Saskatchewan's master of the thrift-store sublime&nbsp;—&nbsp;appeared at galleries around the country. (A companion exhibition about Canadian "<a href="http://pentictonartgallery.com/speed">speed painters</a>," Flexhaug included, is open at the PAG to Sept. 13.) Crawford says he's taken a note from that travelling Flexhaug show in curating <em>Happy Little Accidents</em>, and if there's a strict definition of "museum-worthy," the show aims to "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy6J4e1z4Lc">beat the devil out of it</a>," like some old dirty paintbrush.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Ross died of lymphoma in 1995, but if a museum retrospective eluded him in his time, he wasn't especially fussed about it. In 1991, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/22/arts/television-bob-ross-the-frugal-gourmet-of-painting.html?pagewanted=all"><em>New York Times</em></a> asked Ross about the subject. Already a low-key icon, he said he wasn't keen on the notion. "Most painters want recognition, especially by their peers. I achieved that a long time ago with TV. I don't need any more." And according to BRI, major arts institutions weren't exactly clamouring to get their white gloves on a Bob Ross painting — at least until last year.&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5659999.1595507752!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/bob-ross-mountain-summit-1987.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5659999.1595507752!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/bob-ross-mountain-summit-1987.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5659999.1595507752!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/bob-ross-mountain-summit-1987.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5659999.1595507752!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/bob-ross-mountain-summit-1987.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5659999.1595507752!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/bob-ross-mountain-summit-1987.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5659999.1595507752!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/bob-ross-mountain-summit-1987.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Bob Ross. Mountain Summit, 1987. The Joy of Painting, Season 13, Episode 10.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Bob Ross name and images are registered trademarks of Bob Ross Inc. © Bob Ross Inc. Used with permission. )</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>The DePaul Art Museum in Chicago was the first gallery to make contact, says BRI; in April 2019, four paintings appeared there in the exhibition&nbsp;<em><a href="https://resources.depaul.edu/art-museum/exhibitions/Pages/new-age-new-age.aspx">New Age, New Age: Strategies for Survival</a></em>. Later that year, the <a href="https://www.franklinparkartscenter.org/exhibitions/bob-ross/">Franklin Park Arts Centre</a> (Purcellville, Va.) opened <em>Happy Accidents</em>, a show devoted to Ross's TV paintings. When the PAG came calling, BRI says they were fielding similar requests from galleries around the world. Three paintings are now on view at <a href="https://arkdes.se/en/utstallning/asmr-weird-sensation-feels-good/">ArkDes</a> in Sweden (they're part of a salute to ASMR, the oddly satisfying genre of which Ross is hailed as the permed patron saint). Another solo exhibition is scheduled to open at the <a href="https://www.museummore.nl/en/">Museum MORE</a> in the Netherlands this November. And a <a href="https://minnetrista.net/home/things-to-do/exhibits/bob-ross-experience/">brand new attraction</a>, a shrine to the man himself, will open this October in Muncie, Ind., long-time home of <em>The Joy of Painting</em>.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Writes Sarah Strohl, an executive assistant at BRI: "With the recent resurgence of interest and love for Bob Ross in the past few years, we have displayed paintings in exhibits as well as donated four paintings to the Smithsonian." (Oh, yeah — that happened in 2019, too. In addition to the artwork, Smithsonian National Museum of American History&nbsp;acquired an old easel from the show and some production notebooks.) "However," says Strohl, "our focus has always been the same as Bob's on the show:&nbsp;to interest others in creating paintings of their own."</p>  <p>On the surface, yes,<em> The Joy of Painting</em>&nbsp;is designed so folks can dabble along from home. But it's a rare fan who's squeezed out a tube of Prussian Blue. Ross knew it. As he told the <em><a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1990-07-07-9007060122-story.html">Orlando Sentinel</a> </em>in 1990: "The majority of our audience does not paint, has no desire to paint, will never paint." Instead, the show's appeal is more abstract. It's less about the art lesson, and more about the mood: cozy, nurturing — an audio-visual pat on the back, coaxing the audience to try something new. For 22 minutes, at least, there's no fear of failure. As Ross used to say, "We don't make mistakes, we just have happy accidents."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="" sizes="" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5660007.1595508155!/fileImage/httpImage/bob-ross-happy-accidents.gif"></p></div><figcaption> <!-- -->(Giphy)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>But a Bob Ross fan doesn't necessarily get the same huggy vibes when they think about contemporary art. In curating <em>Happy Little Accidents</em>, Crawford says he was thinking about Ross's gift for reaching the masses. "So many people feel they don't have the knowledge that they can engage in art, and that, to me, is appalling. We need to change that."</p>  <p>Even in a pandemic, <em>Happy Little Accidents</em> has likely attracted some first-time patrons to the PAG already. The gallery is keeping extended hours to match demand, and is open seven days a week through the summer. According to Crawford, people have been lining up every morning since the show opened July 4. (Because of COVID-19, only 13 guests are allowed in the exhibition at a time.) Additional programming includes painting classes with a "Bob Ross-Certified" teacher. The first round sold out, and more have been added.&nbsp;(There are <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/bob-ross-instructors_n_56465ea4e4b0603773491281?ri18n=true&amp;guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAALON9mL8cT4UC27WdyOWykz8B3iZD94swx7lOm_2zN8aaDgGTklIkFGkyUq5GdWqW8ySYOua-68Wre2bQoYSgvuk0UsZ8yPi13cGZZGZZd6WGas1i9B2WMxtwnuorJ9x9fc42RCRIQrCCesQe5d9roE3ideznBF3IhlaETlpVsb">thousands of these official instructors around the world</a>, it turns out. Says Crawford: "There must be a dozen that are living within a three-hour drive of us here in Penticton.")&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5660001.1595507860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/happy-little-accidents.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5660001.1595507860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/happy-little-accidents.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5660001.1595507860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/happy-little-accidents.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5660001.1595507860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/happy-little-accidents.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5660001.1595507860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/happy-little-accidents.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5660001.1595507860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/happy-little-accidents.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>Installation view of Happy Little Accidents at the Penticton Art Gallery.

("It's a very solemn painting with a sort of dead tree that sort of sits in a very ethereal sort of landscape," says Crawford.) In person, he says the landscapes are more impressive than he'd imagined. "There's a luminosity to them, you know, for as beguilingly simple as they are."</p>  <p>And in researching the exhibition, Crawford says he came across a surprising B.C. connection&nbsp;—&nbsp;one that's only touched on at the museum. Before Ross made his TV debut, he studied with William Alexander, another guy known for painting landscapes on PBS. A former German POW, Alexander moved to North America after the Second World War, and lived all over Canada during his lifetime, including Powell River, B.C. His Emmy-winning series, though, <em>The Magic of Oil Painting</em>, taped at a Los Angeles public-broadcasting station from 1974-82, and it shares plenty of aesthetic DNA with Ross's format, right down to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExmWbC2I_Qg">all-black set</a>. "It's remarkable how similar they are," says Crawford. "But he was a rough, gruff-spoken fellow and didn't quite have Bob's smooth way of delivery." Alexander wasn't cool with Ross's fame, though. (As he told the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/22/arts/television-bob-ross-the-frugal-gourmet-of-painting.html?pagewanted=all"><em>New York Times</em></a> in 1991: "I trained him and he is copying me.")

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In the book Winning, the legendary General Electric CEO Jack Welch defines his rules of leadership:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule 3: Leaders get into everyone’s skin, exuding positive energy and optimism…your job as a leader is to fight the gravitational pull of negativism. That doesn’t mean you sugarcoat the challenges your team faces. It means you display an energizing, can-do attitude about overcoming them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I couldn’t agree more. How many truly optimistic managers do you see on a day to day basis?  Not people that are so over-leveraged that fear pushes them to hope everything works out. Not people who ignore hard truths and escape into a good Spotify playlist.</p>

<p>Optimistic managers. Managers who see the world for what it is - a never-ending grind full of challenges, bad-breaks, luck, let-downs, inspirations, and everything in between - and approach it with a consistently positive energy and will to make things work.</p>

<p>The answer: not enough. Here are some ways you can uplevel your optimism.</p>

<p>To be optimistic, don’t:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Commiserate regularly with your reports. Commiseration is a little forfeit, every time. As a leader, you shouldn’t be signalling that the way to react to adversity is to lament. The film Saving Private Ryan calls this out beautifully: “Gripes only go up the chain of command, never down. Privates gripe to sergeants, sergeants gripe to captains, captains gripe to majors, majors gripe to colonels and colonels gripe to generals. Gripes always go up, never down.”</li>
  <li>Otherize other teams in the org. Or more bluntly: don’t talk shit about other teams. They might not be perfect, but neither are you. Otherizing only makes it harder to find the path forward.</li>
  <li>Pretend like everything is great. Again, optimism isn’t about pretending things are great. It’s a commitment to framing things as challenges to be solved, not problems to be lamented.</li>
</ul>

<p>To be optimistic, do:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Have a never-ending well of persistence. You might feel like Sisyphus pushing that boulder up the hill day in and day out. Optimistic people understand that most of one’s work life is pushing boulders up hills and have a good attitude about it.</li>
  <li>Get over things. If you can’t reset your opinion on people, problems, slights, and all other things to an absolute neutral, you’ll be saddled with a distracting and deteriorating buildup of resentment. Learn to get over things completely.</li>
  <li>Commit. If you’re second guessing yourself every step of the way you’ll never be able to sustain optimism. Set some timeframe for re-evaluation - maybe 6 months or a year - and then forget about anything that sounds like “maybe”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Optimism isn’t a feeling that puffs your lungs up with rejuvenating life and leads to transcendent moments of inspiration. It’s removing the friction that your ego and backbone want to instinctively introduce when faced with challenges. It’s a way to move forward.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/BadChinaTake">@BadChinaTake</a> is actually just a vehicle for ethnographic research needed to complete my second PhD. Yes, you did sign the Institutional Review Board waiver.</p>



<p>The following four broad categories are useful for anyone who wishes to navigate the cesspit of public opinion on the English-speaking Internet. While there are of course interdisciplinary individuals whose takes transcend categories, if not the very bounds of reason and logic, nevertheless, the following is sufficient as a primer to acquaint oneself with the varieties of garbage available to any aspiring to become a fabled China Watcher.</p>



<p>If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please keep them to yourself! I am very, very busy knowing things about China!</p>



<p><strong>Mystic China Knowers (MCKs)</strong></p>



<p><em>Examples: More or less any cultural consultant, Martin Jacques (who is also a tankie, detailed below, and does not even speak Chinese</em>)<em>, and really most people besides actual specialists in Eastern philosophy who insert quotes from Confucius</em> <em>into their writing</em></p>



<p>Most MCKs are not ethnically Chinese, BUT, they often have been to China and/or other places in the exciting <em>Sinosphere</em>, maybe for even up to a few years or more, and speak some Mandarin! Most often, though, theirs is of the mellifluous “<em>waw hway shwah zhawng-win</em>” variety, which they are entirely unaware of because the bar for non-native/heritage speakers (especially white ones) who learn Chinese is not low, it is just fully on the ground. MCKs are big fans of <strong>“phrenology for words,”</strong> an obnoxious genre of take based on an extremely superficial reading of some random Mandarin phrase, which they think they can divine like tea leaves with their HSK 3 level skills of cross-culture communication. For instance, from a consultant in India:</p>

Both Indian and Chinese cultures don’t have a word to bid adieu. In Mandarin its zài jiàn (再见), while the Indians say phir milenge, both mean I will see you again. It is a Western concept to say goodbye, surmising you might never see the person again.

Language, whether consumed through stories, written characters or ways of doing business, emote the underlying rich fabric of cultural connectedness between India and China.&quot;" srcset="https://manicuredchinahand.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-15-at-11.22.14-pm.png?w=1024 1024w, https://manicuredchinahand.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-15-at-11.22.14-pm.png?w=150 150w, https://manicuredchinahand.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-15-at-11.22.14-pm.png?w=300 300w, https://manicuredchinahand.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-15-at-11.22.14-pm.png?w=768 768w, https://manicuredchinahand.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-15-at-11.22.14-pm.png 1092w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"></figure></div>



<p><em>The notion of “goodbye” was indeed unheard of until brought to the subcontinent by the East India Trading Company and later to Qing China by the Royal Navy during the First Opium War</em>.<em> Everyone was just always, like, together before that</em>.</p>



<hr>



<p>From the relatively few MCKs whose attention spans and Mandarin reading ability  allow them progress from singular words or phrases into the realm of entire books, we get the “<strong>I once read this Chinese thing</strong>” subtype. Their genesis begins with the subject’s consumption of one, or maybe even a few, venerable Chinese texts. These texts might be a classic (probably read in translation, which is normally fine, unless you’re constructing a Unified Theory of China on it, in which case you need to suck it up and learn Classical Chinese). It might also be something like, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-07-05/is-the-u-s-in-a-new-cold-war-china-has-already-declared-it">I dunno, the Three Body Problem</a>, because that was on sale at Barnes &amp; Noble.</p>



<p>Whatever the text, upon consumption it renders unto the MCK a bounteous insight regarding literally anything you can think of about China and the Chinese; usually, this is also whatever topic is easiest to get placed in an op-ed or decent blog. Through feats of exegesis and interpretation that would put St. Augustine or Maimonides to shame, the MCK extracts meaning that, coincidentally, will also be critical for you to know if you want even the slightest chance of your line of spandex infant lederhosen to take off in Peking this fall. Their fee is $4,998.00 per briefing.</p>



<p>While rarer in the Twitterverse, there are certainly Chinese people whose views fall under the MCK category. One might argue that the Communist Party of China’s continued harping emphasizing 5,000 years of Chinese history puts it in this territory on occasion as well. (Archaeologist Michael Storozum has a good piece on why that claim relies on some pretty… liberal interpretations of what exactly constitutes a reliable historical record <a href="https://radiichina.com/china-5000-years-history/">here in Radii</a>.)</p>



<p><strong>Death 2 CCP Squad (D2CS)</strong></p>



<p><em>Examples: Rob Spalding, Chris Balding, Steve Bannon &amp; Miles Kwok, presumably all members of Committee on the Present Danger: China, management and most reporters of the Epoch Times</em></p>



<p>D2CS is to China as Dick Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz are to Iraq. They are <strong>the inverse of a Tankie</strong>, in way; China cannot do anything that is not a pernicious threat to the civilized world, freedom, love, beauty, and truth. The D2CS cheapen legitimate, pressing concerns about China on security, economic, and human rights fronts by instantly transforming any discussion thereof into a Manichaean battle of the Utterly Good United States et al. versus the People’s Republic of Evil and its ilk. Particularly noxious because of the influence many of them have in the US government at present (or <em>had,</em> before getting kicked out, in the cases of Spalding and Bannon.)</p>

<p>D2CS types are <strong>predominantly, but not exclusively, right-wing.</strong> Their backgrounds are diverse—some (like Miles Kwok a.k.a. Guo Wengui) were burned by Beijing and flipped their relatively mundane anger at losing everything they had in some power struggle into a self-righteous crusade; others (like Spalding) were spurned by some part of The Beltway establishment for being nincompoops and are convinced there is a conspiracy against all good patriots; and some are justifiably aggrieved Hong Kongers who have placed their hopes on the American right to deliver them, which, in all seriousness, really sucks to see. Then there’s the Epoch Times. Remember when their editorial board <a href="https://www.abc10.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/verify-unsolicited-paper-spreads-outlandish-covid-claims/103-9290495e-a501-44fa-b7df-0bb0e385328b">suggested</a> people afflicted with COVID-19 should consider denouncing Chinese Communist Ideology as a potential cure? Great crowd over there. Quality stuff.</p>



<p>The <strong>relatively small left-wing D2CS contingent</strong> seems to be primarily composed of Extremely Online pro-Taiwan independence advocates, the kind who make Tsai Ing-wen look like Chiang Ching-kuo. It’s not clear to me how many are even Taiwanese. Their wrath also stems from kernels of concern about the security and wellbeing of the place they genuinely have come to love, but frankly, it just gets cringey, and they seem to lack an understanding that their rhetoric is frequently appropriated by the right to advocate for hawkish policy that if anything may put <em>more </em>Taiwanese people in danger.</p>



<p><strong>Tankies</strong></p>



<p><em>Examples: Employees of </em>Grayzone<em> (especially editor <a href="https://twitter.com/BenjaminNorton?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Ben</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/BenjaminNorton">Norton)</a>, the <a href="https://twitter.com/qiaocollective">Qiao <s>Beehive</s> Collective</a>, and upwards of 90% of people with ☭ in their Twitter display name)</em></p>



<p>A classic type whose name is derived from the Soviet tanks that rolled through either Czechoslovakia in 1968, Hungary in 1956, or even the tanks at Tiananmen Square in 1989, depending on who you ask. The Tankie is an unapologetic Western apologist for authoritarian violence and repression regularly deployed by the CCP against dissidents and activists it deems a threat to Party rule. The tankie will probably tell you those dissident and activists were counterrevolutionaries anyway. Many appear to be literal teenagers, which is telling.</p>



<p>Through extremely ahistorical and elementary readings of a smorgasbord of left-wing texts, or at least the screenshots of said texts they see on Twitter, Tankies collate around an “<strong>Identity Politics for Stalinists,” </strong>a ludicrous worldview the functionally renders the very idea of imperial colonialism exclusively to the domain of white-majority countries (except the USSR, of course, which was not imperialist, and Hong Kong democracy protestors, who are, because one of the waved a Union Jack that one time) and by extension does not countenance the idea that China could ever engage in similar offenses. Interestingly, there are degrees of Tankie-ism, or in other words, there are some Tankies that are too Tankie even for other Tankies:</p>

Kim Jong-un is just misunderstood.  It’s all very charming.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Politically, they are much less powerful on the whole than the most prominent D2CS type, probably because they are too obnoxious to be around in real life, making organizing grassroots actions hard. Yet they are subtly pernicious in that their presence is extremely corrosive for the left writ large; if I’m a Ukrainian-American at my first New York DSA meeting, I’m going to get pretty pissed when someone gets up and tells me my <em>babusya’s</em> death was actually faked for CIA agitprop or whatever. Ditto re: any Hong Konger who might otherwise organize on the left (speaking of which, shout out to <a href="https://lausan.hk/">Lausan</a> , which everyone should read).</p>



<p>Indeed, the tell-tale sign of Tankie-ism is the belief that the CIA/other Western intelligence agencies are several orders of magnitude more effective, discreet, and competent than they actually are, which is probably pretty embarrassing for the CIA. Another tell-tale sign is just views of history that sound like they come from a weird fairytale:</p>

<p><strong>CCP Bootlickers</strong></p>



<p><em>Examples: <a href="https://twitter.com/CarlZha">Carl Zha</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/shaunrein">Shaun Rein</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Tom_Fowdy">Tom Fowdy</a>, that one fratbro you studied abroad in Shanghai with for a semester and who really hit it off with the nephew of the Deputy Chair of the District Party Committee when you all went out clubbing once and then decided he was never going back to Arkansas, ever</em>,<em> because this place is great</em></p>



<p>Unlike Tankies, the Bootlicker is not convincingly Marxist, although they may nominally claim to be for the sake of convenience. They prefer to expound upon the superiority of the People’s Republic in more platitudinous terms, like pictures of ethnic minorities dancing happily. They generally have direct experience living and working in China, or are from there themselves, which helps explain why they are not real Marxists, because if they were, they might get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasic_incident">steamrolled by the CCP</a>. In reality, the bootlickers just subscribe the what may be termed <strong>“Socialism with Suck-up Characteristics.”</strong></p>



<p>The Bootlicker can be driven by any combination of motives, such as financial interest in China, nationalism, and/or contrarianism. For Shaun Rein, for instance, it appears to be a combination of all three. There’s also the fact that his mother-in-law is the daughter Marshal Ye Jianying, who was a member of the CCP Politburo in the 1970s and 80s. </p>

Using the model option can avoid the conflict in such cases.</p></blockquote><p><code>v-model</code> is well-known for two-way binding. <code>input</code> is the default update event. The value can be updated via <code>$emit</code>. The only limitation is that the component needs an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> tag to bind with the <code>value</code> prop.</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>my-checkbox</span> <span>v-model</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>val<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>my-checkbox</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>template</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

One such specialty is calculating the 8-digit root of a 13th power of 100 digits. Achieving record times historically required massive memorization and calculating speed, racing through a procedure that remains a mystery to most people. Part I of this essay provides a historical overview of the extraction of 13th roots, including the methods used by a few mental calculators, methods that largely rely on a mix of intensive mental calculation and large-scale rote memorization. It demonstrates the creativity and drive of these&nbsp; marvelous people.</p>
<p>In Part II of this essay we will propose a new method for 13th roots like those posed to lightning calculators that is relatively easy to learn, one that makes this feat feasible for those of us with basic mental math capabilities and a desire to do something amazing. A printer-friendly PDF version of Parts I and II is linked at the end of this essay.</p>

<p><strong>Why 13th Roots?</strong></p>
<p>It is generally known that the difficulty of mentally solving for integer roots depends on the number of digits in the root rather than the number of digits in the power. So why did the 13th root of a 100-digit number become the standard?</p>
<p>First, the appeal of a prime power must be acknowledged. Square root extraction is another popular category in itself. Composite roots such as the 4th root or 12th root can be calculated as a sequence of roots of their factors (two square roots to get a 4th root, followed by a cube root to get a 12th root). In fact, for a given number of digits in the root, even-numbered roots are more difficult because the final digit of an odd root can be found from the final digit of the power. It turns out that orders of powers that are one more than a multiple of 4 (such as the 13th power) have a root with the same final digit, while orders of powers that are one less than a multiple of 4 (such as a cube) have a root with a unique final digit relative to the final digit of the power. So here we have the first clue: the final digit of a 13th root will be the same as that of the power.</p>
<p>Second, 100 is an impressive round number of digits, and this produces a 13th root consisting of 8 digits. This number of digits proves to be non-trivial while not beyond the capabilities of the best mental calculators. If there were only 3 digits in the root of an odd power, the problem is easy. The final digit is found from the rules just described. The first digit can be inferred from memorized or estimated ranges of the powers. The properties of modular arithmetic can reveal the middle digit; here the root and power are replaced with remainders after division by an integer while still retaining the 13th power relationship, and we can deduce the missing digit.</p>
<p>For example, consider the 3-digit root of an odd power such as 24137569. Since 200<sup>3</sup> = 8000000 and 300<sup>3</sup>=27000000, we know the root has a 2 as the first digit. Since 3 is one less than a multiple of 4, the final digit of the root will not necessarily equal that of the power, but there will be a unique mapping—in this case 9<sup>3</sup> ends in 9 so the last digit is in fact 9 and we are left with 2b9, where b is unknown. The remainder when a number N is divided by 11 (or N mod 11) can be found by subtracting the odd-place digits from the even place digits and repeating, adding 11’s until the result lies between 0 and 10. Here 24137569 mod 11 = (9+5+3+4) – (6+7+1+2) = 5. Now (2b9)<sup>3</sup> mod 11 must equal 5 as well. So [(9+2) – b]<sup>3</sup> mod 11 =&nbsp; (11 – b)<sup>3</sup> mod 11 = 5. As noted above, for cube roots there is a unique mapping between n and n<sup>3</sup> mod 11 and this mapping would be memorized by the mental calculator. Here we can see that 3<sup>3</sup> mod 11 = 5 since 27 = 22+5, so 11–b = 3 or b = 8. So the cube root of 24137569 is 289.</p>
<p>For the 13th root of a 100-digit number, the first digit is always 4, and we know the last digit is the same as the power. But the 13th root has 8 digits and 7992563 possibilities so there is much more ambiguity, even when the performer has memorized long tables of 2-digit or 3-digit sets of beginning and ending digits. For this reason, the <em>Guinness Book of World Records</em> created the category of 13th root extraction of 100-digit numbers, recording in the eleventh edition of 1972 a time of 23 minutes by Herbert B. de Grote of Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>Historical Methods</strong></p>
<p>In the years since de Grote’s initial record, great efforts have been taken to solve 13th roots, and as a result the times required for it have steadily decreased. Here we will discuss three of the major players in this field: Wim Klein, Gert Mittring and Alexis Lemaire.</p>

He eventually attained a record time in 1981 of 1 minute 28 seconds to calculate the 13th root of</p>
<p>88008443440489299575219015772236417859411720052615<br>
65487280650870412023307854274990144578442271602817</p>
<p>He found the answer to be 48757377.</p>
<p>How did he calculate these roots? Klein used logarithms to find the first five digits, and then used his knowledge of 13th root endings and modular arithmetic to deduce the last three digits. To find the logarithms he would factor the initial digits and add up those 5-digit logarithms from memory, interpolating between values as needed for offsets. Then he would divide by 13 and use the reverse process to find the antilogarithm, the number whose logarithm would be that value. This would be the initial five digits of the root. It is far easier said than done.</p>
<p>Smith [1983] discussed with Klein his method for finding the 13th root of</p>
<p>14762420839370760705665953772022217870318956930659<br>
27236796230563061507768203333609354957218480390144</p>
<p>Here is Smith’s account of Klein’s procedure:</p>
<hr>
<p>The first five digits of the root are fixed through the use of logarithms. Klein has memorized to five places the logs of the integers up to 150; this, coupled with his ability to factor large numbers, allows him to approximate the log of the first five digits of the power, which is usually sufficient to determine the first five digits of the root, though, as he says “the fifth digit is a bit chancy.”</p>
<p>Klein began by factoring 1,476 into 36 times 41 and taking the (decimal) log of each: log 36 = 1.55630 and log 41 = 1.61278; adding the mantissas yields 0.16908, but this is, of course, too little. Through various interpolations Klein estimated the mantissa of the log of 147,624 as 0.16925 (it is more nearly 0.16916).</p>
<p>Klein now had an approximation of the log of the 100-digit number above – 99.16925. This must be divided by 13 to obtain the log of the 13th root. Since 99=13 × 7 with a remainder of 8, to obtain the mantissa of the antilog of the 13th root he divided 8.16925 by 13, which is approximately 0.62840. He estimated the antilog to be about halfway between 4.2 and 4.3 and decided to try 4.25. The result was exact, so the first five digits of the root should be 42500, as indeed they are.</p>
<p>It is now necessary to determine the last three digits of the root. This he does from an examination of the last three digits of the power. In the case of odd powers, these uniquely determine the last three digits of the root, but in the case of even roots, like this one, this method yields four possibilities; in the case of 144 they are 014, 264, 514, and 764. (The choices always differ by 250.) To select the correct one Klein divides the original number by 13 and retains the remainder. In the case of 13th roots, the root remainder and the power remainder must be the same. The power remainder is 7; only 764 as the final three digits of the root will yield 7 as the remainder. Thus the 13th root is determined to be 42,500,764.</p>
<hr>
<p>As we will see, there are multiple endings possible when the 13th power ends in 2, 4, 6, or 8, so these are not going to be record attempts. In fact, the above account appears to be unique; other accounts of 13th roots are limited to odd final digits, and the method described in Part II of this paper is also limited to odd final digits.</p>
<p>Here is Klein’s account for another 13th power, also from Smith:</p>
<p>75185285487713563581947553291145079861723813162341<br>
53935861550997297991815299022662358976308065985831</p>
<hr>
<p>The first five digits of the power are 75185, which is nearly 7519, and 7519 is 73 times 103. The mantissa of the log of 73 is 0.86332 and that of 103 is 0.01284. Their sum is 0.87616. Dividing 8.87616 by 13 yields 0.68278. This falls between the mantissas of the logs of 48 and 49, but is much closer to 48. Since 481 is 13 (mantissa 0.11394) times 37 (mantissa 0.56820), the mantissa of its log will be 0.68214; close, but still a bit low; 4,816 can be factored into 16 (mantissa 0.20412) times 7 (mantissa 0.84510) times 43 (mantissa 0.63347). This gives a mantissa of 0.68269. Then 4,818 factors into 66 (mantissa 0.81954) times 73 (mantissa 0.86332), which yields a mantissa of 0.68286. Thus, in the interpolation we want 9/17 of 20 which is about 10 1/2. The first five digits of the root should be 48170 (48160 + 10). This, in fact, is correct.</p>
<p>When Klein actually did the calculation he made a minor error (he was looking for the antilog of 0.68277 instead of 0.68278) and first took 48169 for the first five digits of the root. In this case, however, since the root is odd, the last three digits are uniquely fixed—since the power ends in 831, the root must end in 311. Upon dividing the power by 13 Klein got a remainder of 7. But dividing 48,169,311 by 13 gives a remainder of 8. To make these two remainders come into line he changed his solution to 48,170,311, which is correct.</p>

<p>I’ll confess: I use a GUI for Git. Not always, and not even most of the time. The CLI is usually quicker, and I’m usually in the terminal anyway, but yet I also use a GUI. Why? Primarily for reviewing diffs and history, or for performing rarely used operations. I mean, I can google “cherry pick” for those rare times I use it, or I can choose it from the menu and not worry about mangling things in Git history.</p>



<p>I’m a long-time user of <a href="https://www.git-tower.com/mac">Tower</a> on macOS. It’s beautiful, intuitive, feature-rich, and powerful. Updates come frequently, and they even have <a href="https://stuff.git-tower.com/">cool merch</a>. I have <a href="https://stuff.git-tower.com/products/the-dev-manifesto">this</a> hanging by my desk at the office I haven’t seen since mid-March. I assume it’s still there. They also offer <a href="https://www.git-tower.com/windows">Tower for Windows</a>. What they <em>don’t</em> have, however, is a Linux version (preemptive snark: “That’s because people who use Linux don’t use GUIs!”).</p>



<h2>Closed Source: GitKraken</h2>



<p>I <a href="https://www.slant.co/topics/242/~best-graphical-git-clients-for-linux">asked Slant what Linux Git GUI was best</a>, sifted through some editor plugins and “minimal” clients, and decided to try <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/">GitKraken</a>. I’d tried GitKraken on macOS years ago, and thought it had promise. Back then, though, I’d already cast my lot (and my money) with Tower, so I never dug into GitKraken. Now, it was time.</p>



<p>I installed GitKraken and began using it. It ticked all the boxes for me: intuitive, beautiful, and feature-rich. After a few days using it, I decided to show my support by purchasing a license (preemptive snark: “People who use Linux don’t pay for software!”). GitKraken offers three flavors:</p>



<ol><li>Free (“For open source developers”)</li><li>Individual (“For individual developers” — $29/year)</li><li>Pro (“For teams and companies” — $49/year)</li></ol>



<p>See more information on <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/pricing">their page</a>. Among other things, Individual lets you access private repositories. Pro adds enterprise features: user management, GitHub Enterprise, etc. The tiers and features make sense. It’s a reasonable approach. Since I have no enterprise needs, but I <em>do</em> want to work with private repositories, I paid $29 for an Individual license. And I continued to use GitKraken.</p>



<p>After some days or weeks of use, I decided to really dig into GitKraken’s settings and understand its suite of offerings. I found the Preferences screens, and saw I could configure an External Editor and a Default Terminal. When I tried to select a different editor, I saw that my only option was “&lt;None&gt;”:</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.grailbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/preferences.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.grailbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/preferences.png 484w, https://www.grailbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/preferences-300x99.png 300w, https://www.grailbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/preferences-320x105.png 320w" sizes="(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px"><figcaption>GitKraken Preferences</figcaption></figure>



<p>I poked around a little bit in the UI, ran a few google searches, and came up empty on how to resolve this. I saw a menu item in GitKraken, though, that said, “Send Us Feedback,” so I sent the following:</p>



<blockquote><p>I’m using GitKraken 7.0 on Pop!_os 20.04. In Preferences -&gt; General, both the External Editor and Default Terminal dropdowns have &lt;None&gt; as the only option. How can I configure these?</p></blockquote>



<p>The reply came back:</p>



<blockquote><p>Thank you for taking the time to reach out to support. We currently do not provide support for free accounts. For guaranteed support please upgrade to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/pricing"><strong>GitKraken Pro</strong></a>. Additionally, it’s important to note that the GitKraken Git GUI does not support Pop!_OS. Our team does not test again this distro and we cannot guarantee that the GitKraken Git GUI will behave properly. If you have installed the GUI via snap please try one of the alternative install options detailed here, https://support.gitkraken.com/how-to-install/#linux-deb-rpm-and-targz-files. If you require additional assistance please upgrade to GitKraken Pro.</p></blockquote>



<p>I assumed a mistake had occurred — true, I didn’t have a Pro account, but nor was I using a Free account. I started to reply that I wasn’t a Free user, but first I checked the features of the different pricing tiers. Indeed, they provide email support only for the Pro edition. A customer paying at the Individual level has no support recourse. The support individual hadn’t made a mistake (other than getting my license wrong) — he had followed protocol. Now, I felt a little miffed. Dismissed. At the least, they could have said something like: “Thanks for pointing this out. We are developing a support document that addresses where this information comes from to help you troubleshoot,” or something that sounded like they cared. Still, I hadn’t done my homework when I made my purchase. The terms were right there. I should have paid more attention.</p>



<p>I briefly considered throwing them $20 more just so they’d have to fix this for me, but realized they’d almost certainly stand firm on not supporting Pop!_OS. So I reformatted my hard drive and installed Ubuntu . . . just kidding. I kept my $20. And I tried to solve this myself. Things I tried:</p>



<ul><li>Find the configuration file: check</li><li>Add good-guess entries to the configuration file: didn’t work</li><li>Install VS Code to see if it it would show up in the dropdown: didn’t work</li><li>Install and configure GitKraken on my MacBook Pro with an External Editor and see what the configuration file should <em>really</em> look like: check</li><li>Duplicate the configuration file on my Linux box: didn’t work</li></ul>



<p>At this point, I ran out of steam. GitKraken is an Electron app, if I’m not mistaken, so I suppose I could have tried digging into obfuscated JavaScript. I’ve seen what WebPack can do, though, and I also figured the license I’d agreed to prevented such action, so I surrendered and looked for another Git GUI.</p>



<h2>Open Source: Guitar</h2>



<p>I don’t remember how I found <a href="https://github.com/soramimi/Guitar">Guitar</a> — I assumed Slant, but I don’t see it now on the list so must have been a random Internet search that led me to it. I installed it, used it, and liked it. Not quite as intuitive or beautiful as GitKraken, but I soon got the hang of it and I was off and running.</p>



<p>One day, though, I wanted to amend a commit. In Tower, the commit dialog has a checkbox for amending a commit. Guitar has no such checkbox. I poked around a little, then dashed to the command line to amend the commit and made a mental note to follow up.</p>



<p>When I got around to following up, I found <a href="https://github.com/soramimi/Guitar/issues/53">this issue</a> asking for an option to amend a commit. The response from the developer pointed out that the option existed, albeit using a different interface mechanism: a context menu. I right-clicked one of my commits in the Guitar GUI and didn’t see the “Edit message…” option. I didn’t understand why. This time, though, I could do something about it.</p>



<p>I cloned the Guitar repository, fired up <a href="https://www.qt.io/product/development-tools">Qt Creator</a>, followed <a href="https://github.com/soramimi/Guitar/blob/master/docs/build_guide-en/build_guide_origin.md">the build instructions</a>, and was able to launch Guitar in the debugger. I looked through the code, which was clean and straightforward. Easy to follow — and this, for a guy who only recently learned that <a href="https://ariya.io/2009/01/qt-not-qt">Qt is pronounced “cute.”</a> (Note: I find that pronunciation more unsettling than Jay-Double-you-Tee being pronounced “jot,” but no one consulted me on either.)</p>



<p>I soon found the part of the code that draws the context menu in question, set a breakpoint, and stepped through the code. I learned that it adds that menu item to the context menu of a commit if:</p>



<ul><li>It’s the latest commit</li><li>There are no uncommitted changes in the working copy</li><li>The commit has not been pushed to a remote</li></ul>



<p>So the feature works as the developer designed: you can edit the message, but not the content, of the commit. In other words, you can’t add a file to a commit to amend it. And I could figure all that out because the code was open source. I could see it. Step through it. Know exactly what was happening. And I can change that behavior, if I want, and offer it to others who want the same behavior.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Here’s where I say that Open Source is categorically better than Closed Source. I can’t do it, though. It’s not categorically better. It’s better in some ways and worse in others. It optimizes some things at the expense of others. It worked in my favor, above, allowing me to troubleshoot and resolve my own issue.</p>



<p>As commercial software, however, GitKraken generates sufficient revenue to have (presumably) developers, designers, product owners, and support staff working on it full time. It’s more intuitive and better looking than Guitar. It offers ticket tracking boards and project timelines and integration with other tools. And as long as you pay $49/year and run a supported operating system, you can get email support for it. In contrast, I’m guessing that Guitar is a side project for <a href="https://github.com/soramimi">its developer</a>. They get no money from it. It puts no food on the table. They work on it as they have time. And I keep saying “they” because English has no genderless singular third-person pronoun, but you can see <a href="https://github.com/soramimi/Guitar/graphs/contributors">soramimi does most of the work</a>. It’s a labor of love, and a gift to the community. </p>



<p>This is where the pedant points out that you don’t have to be closed source to be commercial. That’s true only in theory, as the recent <a href="https://github.com/hapijs/hapi/issues/4111">hapi flap</a> reminds us.</p>



<p>Life is full of trade-offs. Software is one of them. I’ll go on using some closed source and some open source, paying for some software and using some for free. I’m going to thank the developer of Guitar for all their work. I’ll be writing a patch for Guitar that allows you to amend a commit by adding a file. I’ll check it in using a Git GUI. I’ll let you guess which one.</p>

<h2>Fair Use and Exigent Circumstances</h2>



<p>

*<em>The opinions and scholarship communicated on this website are the author’s own, expressed in his personal capacity.*</em></p>



<p>If you work in any of the higher ed institutions that are preparing to move online – maybe your copyright world has exploded in a range of questions on fair use, e-reserves, online access, scanning, digitization, and more! I am sure many of you, especially in the library community, are working towards the best solution for students, faculty, staff, and patrons in this time of crisis. </p>



<p>To help you navigate this process, over the next few posts  (working as I go) I will offer reminders of all the super awesome legal tools libraries have for copyright as “stewards of access” in our communities.</p>



<p>As I have often messaged, libraries and archives have “superpowers” under the copyright law that allows us to supply our communities with access to materials for research, scholarship, and study. Most notably, these statutory exemptions were granted to libraries and archives by Congress to ensure our continued public mission. Further, libraries can utilize technology to <em>enhance</em> access to materials. Adapting and utilizing technology for the benefit of our patrons is something that libraries and archives have been successful at for decades – from the first photocopiers in libraries, microfiche, computer labs,  to 3-D printers! </p>



<p>So, in times like this COVID-19 crisis, let’s continue to harness both law and technology to help!</p>



<p>Before I get to the TEACH Act, Section 108, or any other superpower – first and foremost, we must talk about <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107">fair use</a>. While this isn’t a library superpower – <strong>fair use is for everyone!</strong> – it certainly falls to the libraries and archives, in many circumstances, to be the champions of fair use on campus (and bust any fair use myths!)</p>



<figure><img src="https://kylecourtney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Fair-Use-Rosie-1024x557.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://kylecourtney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Fair-Use-Rosie-1024x557.jpg 1024w, https://kylecourtney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Fair-Use-Rosie-300x163.jpg 300w, https://kylecourtney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Fair-Use-Rosie-768x418.jpg 768w, https://kylecourtney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Fair-Use-Rosie.jpg 1409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>In questions I’ve received, tweets I’ve been following, and posts to the Copyright First Responders lists about libraries’ responses to COVID-19, what is pervasive is the sense that this isn’t a normal “par for the course” moment. These are exigent circumstances with a limited timeline, and we, as libraries, have a strong mission and public purpose. In response to the COVID-19 public health crisis and ensuing campus closures, we can make use of the “release valve” that fair use offers. We have a lot of space to support our communities in this moment as long as we’re being thoughtful, <em>providing good copyright information when asked</em>, and limiting our activities to the&nbsp;specific, <em>time-bound needs</em> of instructors and students for the rest of the semester. In doing so, we are applying fair use prudently and managing risk sensibly. We are not crafting permanent policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortunately, copyright law does not always restrict uses. In many cases a solid understanding of fair use can help ease fears, provide legal alternatives to a particular request, or help educate the higher education community at large. </p>



<p>Again, as long as we’re being thoughtful, <em>providing good copyright information when asked</em>, and limiting our activities to the&nbsp;specific, <em>time-bound needs</em> of our communities for the rest of this timeline, we are in a good place to have a strong fair use analysis. <br></p>



<p>Yes, we are still applying fair use prudently and managing risk sensibly, but we can do that and clearly meet our user’s needs!  </p>



<p>Just to be clear: Fair use is a flexible limitation on copyright which states “Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106” (the copyright owner’s rights) “the fair use of a copyrighted work…for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research” is not an infringement of copyright. And then we are given the famous four-factor test to make that risk determination.</p>



<p>Again, let me emphasize “<strong>flexible!</strong>” Fair use is flexible and, as the Supreme Court stated in<em> <a href="https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/assets/files/2LiveCrew.pdf">Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.</a></em><a href="https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/assets/files/2LiveCrew.pdf">, 510 U.S. 569 (1994)</a> “permits and requires courts to avoid rigid application of the copyright statute.” So, if fair use is found, it is, according to the Copyright Act, “not an infringement of copyright.”</p>



<p>The
mechanics underpinning fair use were codified in the Copyright Act with the
famous four factors: 1) the purpose and character of the use, 2) the nature of
the work copied, 3) the amount and substantiality of the work used, and 4) the
effect on the market for the original. One has to examine all four factors for
each individual use to make a fair use determination. </p>



<p>For
the purposes of this blog post, let’s explore a fictional request to scan some
materials for a class that is forced to move to online as a result of a
COVID-19 closure. Below we will make our way through each of the four factors with
an eye to ask some questions and gain an understanding of making a fair use determination
for this sort of scenario.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://kylecourtney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/fair-use-four.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://kylecourtney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/fair-use-four.jpg 296w, https://kylecourtney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/fair-use-four-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 296px) 100vw, 296px"></figure></div>



<p><strong>Fair Use Factor One – Purpose and Character:</strong> The first fair use factor, “purpose and character of the use,” is illustrated by the examples that is part of the fair use statute preamble: <em>criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship or research.</em> Clearly our colleagues working at non-profit educational institutions have a good start for a fair use determination right away. Our use is clearly for the benefit of research and education!  </p>



<p>Additionally, let’s put this first factor in the context of the COVID-19 closure scenario. Well, this particular “purpose” is allowing faculty and students to access the materials they need in a public emergency where they are facing quarantines, social distancing, or campus/library closures. This is strong evidence, I believe, for favoring fair use in the “purpose and character” factor. </p>



<p><strong>Fair Use Factor Two – Nature of Copyrighted Work:</strong> </p>



<p>When
determining whether our COVID-19-related scanning request is a fair use under
the second factor, we must ask ourselves a couple of questions about the work
at hand: Is it published or unpublished; and how “creative” is the original
work?</p>



<p>While
the law is more protective of unpublished work, because authors have right to
decide whether and when they will make their work public, courts have largely
ignored this factor, with some calling it “neutral” in many recent decisions.
Certainly, many higher ed courses use both factual works and creative works.</p>



<p>Certainly do not see this factor as dispositive of the entire fair use test – let’s move forward to the next factor!</p>



<p><strong>Fair Use Factor Three – Amount and Substantiality Used:</strong> The third factor receives major discussion in both court cases and scholarship surrounding fair use. A common question that examines this factor derives directly from the critical facts in most fair use cases: <em>How much is being used?</em> If it’s a smaller amount of a copyrighted work, it favors fair use. But what about a request for an entire work?</p>



<p><strong>Well, despite any myths you may have heard, it can be fair to use an entire work</strong>. However, it must be a justified fair use. The important thing to remember is that the law favors using the right amount necessary to serve the users purpose. There are no bright lines when it comes to what percentage of the copyrighted work is too much and typically, the higher the percentage, the more likely this factor is to count against fair use.</p>



<p>However, let’s apply this to a new common COVID-19 scenario: The use of a book when the campus moves online. Maybe we consider that we do not scan the whole textbook, unless it is absolutely necessary. And it may be absolutely necessary! And it also may not be! The factor is assessed based on the facts of the scenario.</p>



<p>For example, a class may have already covered Chapters 1-7 for the first part of the semester – and now, moving online, they need chapters 8, 9, 10, and 11 to finished out the semester. The library may have used fair use analysis to tailored this request to the needs of the faculty and students. This action is employing part of the fair use rationale that states that one should use only the amount necessary to serve the purpose.</p>



<p>The syllabus certainly helps with calculating the need and amount used. I have observed recommendations making materials available to students that are measured by the class syllabus <strong>from the “move online” moment </strong>to the<strong> end of the semester.</strong> Now, that might be more than any library policy “rules of thumb” that normally exist. But again, this is not the normal policy – and wouldn’t be representative of the factual scenarios we are being presented with now with the COVD-19 crisis. Fair use decisions are rendered case-by-case, thankfully, and we can look to amount needed as necessary to serve the purpose.</p>



<p>Now, here’s another novel issue. What if the student needs access to the book for studying for the final test? Chapters 1-7, which were previously only available on reserve (or left behind in the abandoned dorm room) are now inaccessible. Can we expand the digitization request beyond chapters 8, 9, 10, and 11 to finished out the semester ? Again, we have to look at the limited use, timing, and exigent circumstances of this scenario. Use the same standard as always used under factor three: <em>the use should use only copy the amount necessary to serve the purpose </em></p>



<p><strong>Fair Use Factor Four – Market Effect:</strong> This is another factor that gets a lot of discussion both in the fair use court cases and commentary. The question often revolves around whether the proposed use will cut into the potential market or value of the work. And we have seen court cases stating that using a copyrighted work in a way that means lost sales to the copyright owner will weigh against fair use.</p>



<p>This
last factor gets a lot of discussion both in fair use court cases and
commentary. The question often revolves around whether the proposed use will cut
into the potential market or value of the work.And court cases have

      <p>
        The <a href="https://github.com/alexkuc/remote-dev-server-scripts#requirements">repository</a> contains a concise summary. It contains the bare minimum required to get started. The aim of this article is to provide more in-depths tutorial.
      </p>
      
      <div>
        <p>
          In <a href="https://alexkuc.github.io/articles/create-remote-dev-server/" target="_blank">part one</a>, I have shown how to create a remote development using DigitalOcean and rsync. In part two, I will show how to automate the entire process using Bash script.
        </p>
        <p>
          To get started, you will need to install and configure the dependencies:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>DigitalOcean account</li>
          <li>Bash, at least version 4</li>
          <li>doctl</li>
          <li>rsync (<code>do.sh sync</code>)</li>
          <li>fswatch (<code>do.sh watch</code>)</li>
          <li>scp (<code>do.sh copy</code> <code>do.sh scp</code>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Once that is done, clone <a href="https://github.com/alexkuc/remote-dev-server-scripts" target="_blank">the repository</a>. You can either set it up as a sub-module or as a standalone repo. To make <code>do.sh</code> be accessible from anywhere, copy it or symlink it into your <code>PATH</code>, e.g. <code>/usr/local/bin</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The droplet can be configured using either Bash or yaml configs where examples of both are available in the repository. You would need to call the script either from one level up from <code>do.sh</code> or export environment variable <code>CLOUD_CONFIG</code> with a different path.
        </p>
        <p>
          This script allows a certain degree of flexibility via <a href="#env-vars">environment variables</a>. For instance, the config used can be specified via <code>CLOUD_CONFIG</code>. If you require a greater degree of customizability, you can either submit a PR or fork the repository.

          Using <code>do.sh</code> is very simple. To get started, type <code>do.sh help</code> which will show you a list of available commands. <em>Some</em> commands support chaining, e.g., <code>do.sh up prep sync</code> which will run in sequential order. Generally, you can chain commands which have a fixed number of arguments such as <code>up</code> or <code>down</code>. Commands like <code>ssh</code>, <code>cmd</code> and <code>copy</code> can have any number of arguments so these do not support chaining. A good workaround is to add these commands at the very end, e.g. <code>do.sh up copy file1 file2 file3</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below is a list of available commands: <code>up         create dev server *
down       destory dev server *
reset      re-create dev server *
sync       rsync from local to remote *
watch      watch local for changes and sync
deps       install Node deps on remote *
prep[are]  shortcut for sync -&gt; deps -&gt; watch
ssh        start interactive ssh session
ssh &lt;cmd&gt;  execute command on droplet
cmd &lt;cmd&gt;  ssh &lt;cmd&gt; and replace cwd with local
scp &lt;path&gt; copy from remote to local (cwd)
copy&lt;path&gt; copy from local to remote (~/.repo/)
cp &lt;path&gt;  alias to copy command
dist       shortcut to copying dist/ from remote *
host       show public ip of remote *
config     create config from env var CLOUD_CONFIG *
help       show available commands

* these commands support chaining, e.g. do.sh up prep sync</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is an example of my workflow. I start with <code>up</code>, followed by <code>prep</code>. As this script supports chaining, here is what I do: <code>do.sh up prep</code>. If I need to run a command after copying files, I execute <code>do.sh sync cmd &lt;cmd&gt;</code>. Path re-write is useful if I want to be able to copy and paste path from the error stack straight away (<code>cmd</code>). For instance, I use iTerm which supports semantic history and with path re-write, I can open files directly from console on my local system.
        </p>

          This script supports so-called settings via environment variables overrides. Here is a list of supported overrides:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>NAME</code> name of the droplet, defaults to <code>dev-server</code></li>

          <li><code>SPECS</code> droplet specs, defaults to <code>s-2vcpu-2gb</code>; find out more specs by running <code>doctl compute size list</code></li>
          <li><code>REGION</code> droplet datacenter, defaults to <code>lon1</code></li>
          <li><code>CLOUD_CONFIG</code> location of cloud config, defaults to <code>./dev-server/cloud-config.yml</code></li>
          <li><code>SSH_KEY</code> local path to private ssh key, defaults to <code>~/.ssh/developer</code></li>
          <li><code>SSH_USER</code> ssh user, defaults to <code>developer</code></li>
          <li><code>SSH_HOST</code> ssh host, defaults to none; the value is configured at runtime when <code>up</code> command is run and saved to <code>SSH_OUTPUT</code></li>
          <li><code>SSH_SOCKET</code> local path for ssh socket, defaults to none; once <code>SSH_HOST</code> is available, the value becomes <code>${HOME}/.ssh/sockets/$SSH_USER@$SSH_HOST</code></li>
          <li><code>SSH_CWD</code> value of <code>pwd</code> on remote host, configured at runtime</li>
          <li><code>LOCAL_CWD</code> value of <code>pwd</code> on local host</li>
          <li><code>SSH_HOST_FILE</code> local path where <code>SSH_HOST</code> value is saved, defaults to <code>/tmp/dev_ssh_host</code></li>
          <li><code>SSH_CWD_FILE</code> local path where <code>pwd</code> of remote host is saved, defaults to <code>/tmp/dev_ssh_cwd</code></li>

July 24, 2020 | https://maxkostinevich.com/blog/serverless-geolocation/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://maxkostinevich.com/blog/serverless-geolocation/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
        <p>If you ever tried to make a Geo-location service (e.g. define a user country based on user IP address), most likely you heard about <a href="https://www.maxmind.com/">MaxMind</a>. </p>
<p>MaxMind - is probably one of best companies who provides Geo IP databases and services. </p>
<p>However, there is a number of limitations: if you're making a side-project, most likely you do not want to pay extra $$$ for geolocation services. And for this case MaxMind offers GeoLite2 database, however you'll be in charge of hosting this database on your server and making regular updates of the database. You also need to make sure your project is compliant with MaxMind's License.</p>
<h2>Why to use Cloudflare Workers instead of AWS Lambda?</h2>
<p>In this particular example, I needed a simple geo-location service which will be used in embeddable javascript code (similar to Google Analytics or other tracking service), so the response time is quite crucial.</p>
<p>In my first attempt I tried to use Serverless framework to host simple geo-location function on AWS Lambda (this function uses MaxMind GeoLite2 database). However, I quickly realized that the response time isn't what I've expected - on average the response took somewhere between from 200ms to 500ms. So I started looking for other options.  </p>
<p>So, I thought - if I could not host it on AWS Lambda, where else I could host my serverless function? The next service I tried - is <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Workers</a>. I created a simple function to test the reponse time, and it was really impressive - on average it was between from 30ms to 80ms, I've got almost x10 better performance in comparison to AWS. </p>
<p>However, this solution had one really big caveat - MaxMind GeoLite2 database does not work on Cloudflare Workers due to some runtime limitations.</p>
<h2>MaxMind alternative</h2>
<p>And then I thought - hey, wait a second, as Cloudflare provides DDoS protection services, they might provide some interesting features in Cloudflare Workers. And after exploring their documentation, I realized that the <code>Request</code> object in function have an access to <code>cf</code> object, which contains some useful information about the visitor, including visitor's country!</p>
<p>That's exactly what I was looking for, within a few dozens of lines of code I got my geolocation function up and running.</p>
<h2>The source code</h2>
<p>If you haven't worked with Cloudflare before, you need to signup at <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare.com</a> and go to Workers directory.</p>
<p>Then, create a new worker with the following source code:</p>

<p>Then you can start making requests to your Worker's endpoint.</p>    </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>Since the GPT-3's demos have stormed Twitter, more and more devs are getting anxious about how this would affect their jobs in the future. I think the tweet that has struck the developers the most is the one by Sharif Shameen</p>

<p>If anyone can create UI and generate React code just by describing it in plain English, why would any company hire a Frontend Developer anymore? </p>
<p>Let's start by getting a little more context about GPT-3</p>
<h2 id="what-is-gpt-3-">What is GPT-3?</h2>

<p><strong>Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) — 3,</strong> in simple words, is a pre-trained model that can explore the internet for answers and generate responses in a contextual way. This is why it is able to start giving predictions even when provided with a small input. You can check out Paul's demo for more context.</p>

<h2 id="how-gpt-3-will-help-evolve-your-jobs-rather-than-taking-it">How GPT-3 will help evolve your jobs rather than taking it</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"With Products like <a href="http://debuild.co/" target="_blank">debuild.co</a>, should we even bother learning Frontend development?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fear of AI taking on all our jobs has been the topic of discussion for years now, and since GPT-3, developers are able to see this happening to them sooner than later.  This is the same situation when people were of the impression that firebase will kill backend jobs, and products like Netlify and Vercel will kill Cloud engineering jobs, but on the contrary, all these services have played a role in increasing the job market. It has been empowering more and more startups to rise up with low initial investment, and these startups in turn hire more engineers when they want to scale up.</p>
<p>In my opinion, one should consider GPT-3 to be the milestone in AI which will lead us to the next evolution of the way we work. </p>

<h2 id="the-concept-of-priming-in-gpt-3-models">The Concept of Priming in GPT-3 models</h2>
<p>The biggest reason why GPT-3 is a potential game-changer in AI tech is that anyone can use this without having to find a dataset for the ML to start predicting as expected, few inputs will help you get exceptional results. That being said the quality of input is definitely a factor for the results that you get. This is where the concept of priming comes up. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Priming is giving the model a series of input and expected outputs which should be easy for the model to calculate context and create a guide for itself for future inputs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I highly recommend you to look into <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/@IntuitMachine">Carlos' pieces</a> if you want to dive deeper into how priming works starting from the one mentioned below</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/intuitionmachine/the-subtle-art-of-priming-gpt-3-bc12f67c9777">The Subtle Art of Priming GPT-3</a></p>
<p>According to the material that is out there as of now, it seems that using GPT-3, it would become extremely easy to create a super tool for a niche use-case, but there is still time for it to be mature enough to replace a whole field of work. </p>

<p>You can follow Swyx's repo to be up to date with all things GPT-3</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/sw-yx/gpt3-list">sw-yx/gpt3-list</a></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>GPT-3 is the closest we can get to have something like Jarvis from Iron man so that should be something that can be exciting</p>
<p>I think the best way to handle this new progress in AI is to sit tight and be curious about how this can change the way developers would be building products in the future.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: This blog is all written without any help of GPT-3</em> 😂</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I am waiting for my GPT beta invite like:

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>
<a href="https://gtoolkit.com/">Glamorous Toolkit</a> is now beta. This is the first usable incarnation of our vision of moldable development. We still have plenty of things we want to do, but now we can say that the large technical challenges are behind us.
</p>
<p>
Many things have changed since our previous release from a year ago. The GitHub repository says we addressed more than 900 issues spanning from deep technical issues to creating a whole new visible user interface. Essentially, much of the current system has been developed or redeveloped during last year.
</p>
<p>
Let's take a tour through the highlights.
</p>
<p>
Before we look at the cool technical details, let's pause for a second and consider our goal of making the inside of software systems explainable. To reach this goal, first and foremost, we focus on reimagining how developers read code. Glamorous Toolkit does bring innovations in how we write code, but it is the reading where we make the most difference. Developers alone spend 50+% of their time reading code. That is the single largest activity in software development and we reimagine how this effort is being spent from the ground up. The result is what we call moldable development and we are now confident in saying that it is a novel way of approaching programming. 
</p>
<p>
To get a feeling of what it means, please scroll down and look briefly at the screenshots. Notice how they look rather distinct from one another. Software is highly contextual. We want the environment to mold to that context and depict it distinctly, too.
</p>
<p>
Ok, enough of that. Let's go on with the show.
</p>
<p>
A good chunk of the effort went into making Glamorous Toolkit run in native windows reliably. We are now happy to announce that it now works for Mac, Windows and Linux.
</p>

	<figcaption>The home tab of Glamorous Toolkit</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
This is an important step not only for the looks of it, but also internally. If until now we were bootstrapping inside the graphical support from Pharo, now we get to control the complete rendering. We are still able to spawn the old Morphic World interface on demand. In this way, people that are used to Pharo can enjoy the interface of the new environment while still being able to rely on old tools when needed.
</p>
<p>
To be able a high degree of moldability, the environment's frame must impose little constraints.
</p>
<p>
In our case, the frame essentially knows a home tab that we can easily mold, a menu that we can make moldable, and a way to search that is already moldable. This is it. No elaborate global menus. No hardcoded views. We can do this because the actions are bundled with the context in which they apply.
</p>
<figure>

	<figcaption>Glamorous Toolkit offers a tabbed interface</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Coder offers the means through which we manipulate static code. The work on Coder started from the need to mold  the experience for the smallest unit of code organization: the method. We started from the editor for a single method and built the rest of the experience around it.
</p>
<p>
For example, below we see a search through the system revealing methods that can be individually viewed and modified in place. In this particular case, we expand one inner method only to look for references of an instance variable, and this, in turn, opens another list on the right. Using this simple mechanism we can transform any Playground into a powerful code query tool and a scoped code browser.
</p>
<figure>

	<figcaption>Example of a queries and previews as method snippets</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Coder can be molded in several ways. For example, below we see the baseline defining the dependencies of the Bloc project. Each dependency is defined through a string denoting the name of the dependency. Coder recognizes the API and allows us to expand the string right in place to browse the corresponding dependency.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/glamorous-toolkit-v0-7-1214-beta-2uv9ne4vyynvcv08kcm07cihz/pictures/gtr-coder-baseline.png" alt="Example of a baseline method with expanded dependencies">
	<figcaption>Example of a baseline method with expanded dependencies</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
The environment is classically seen as being specific to a language. We believe moldability must be much finer grained:  all tools must be made adjustable within the context of code. In our case, we bring that ability to the individual instruction.
</p>
<p>
Playground and Inspector are the core tools that enable live exploration. They were significantly consolidated. The core mechanism remained the same, but now they are complemented with a few abilities.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/glamorous-toolkit-v0-7-1214-beta-2uv9ne4vyynvcv08kcm07cihz/pictures/gtr-playground-inspector.png" alt="Example of a Playground, connected Inspectors and an object Playground">
	<figcaption>Example of a Playground, connected Inspectors and an object Playground</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
First, error handling. Inspector is extensible by third party code. At the same time, as it is the most basic tool we have in the environment, it is critical that these extensions cannot  break the inspector. So, now we have a fine grained handlers that gracefully show errors without breaking the Inspector.
</p>
<p>
Another part is preserving the history in Playground. On each code execution we store the Playground's content on disk. This also works for code we are writing in the context of an object.
</p>
<p>
But, perhaps most important is that we brought the full coding experience into both Inspector and Playground. When inspecting an object, the Meta view offers a Coder on the class of the object. Particularly interesting is that the value of <code>self</code> is bound to the inspected object. This ability allows us to promote programming in Inspector in the presence of live objects. More recently, we went a step further and extended the Playground coding experience as well. This includes the ability to create classes and methods right in place.
</p>
<p>
A consequence is that we can now use the expansion mechanisms to peek into code wherever we are, including the Playground and Inspector. Through this, we do not go to where the code is. The code shows up where we are. That is the humane way.
</p>
<figure>

</figure>

<p>
Spotter is the moldable search interface.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/glamorous-toolkit-v0-7-1214-beta-2uv9ne4vyynvcv08kcm07cihz/pictures/gtr-spotter.png" alt="Example of a Spotter search">
	<figcaption>Example of a Spotter search</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Just like how an object can tell the Inspector how it can be viewed, it can also tell Spotter how it can be searched. This simple ability can then be combined in many different ways to support various use cases from navigating through code or the file system, to pasting external urls to open them within the environment.
</p>
<p>
While Spotter is prominently available globally, we also integrated it with Inspector and Coder. For example, when editing a class, Coder offers a Spotter to search within the context of that class.
</p>
<figure>

	<figcaption>Searching within the context of a class from within Coder</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Debugger saw significant improvements, too. The stack is made of the same snippets as found in Coder or in Playground. And it can be seamlessly integrated in the inspection flow.
</p>
<figure>

	<figcaption>A debugger and an inspector on a variable</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Documenter is the engine with which we assemble narratives. We use it for documenting classes, or we use it for describing business cases or architectural descriptions. For example, here we see a Coder with a document as a class comment. Clicking on a link opens up another document, essentially transforming the whole image into a wiki.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/glamorous-toolkit-v0-7-1214-beta-2uv9ne4vyynvcv08kcm07cihz/pictures/gtr-documenter-faces.png" alt="Browsing through live documents">
	<figcaption>Browsing through live documents</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Documenter saw several developments, and it became faster and more usable. We achieved this by making the previews render lazily.
</p>
<p>
The different tools are wired together in a broader flow we call Pager that embeds tools as pages connected in a Miller columns interface. The novelty is that tools are now first class and can appear at arbitrary locations in a larger flow.
</p>

Beside documents, another pervasive medium to express narratives are slideshows. Presenter offers exactly that, only in our case, the slides are live. Each slide is essentially a scoped environment and can be used for various purposes. For example, the Tour slideshow offers an overview of Glamorous Toolkit, each slide exemplifying a separate concept or tool.

<p>
A narrative can take multiple forms. In the environment we already have  documents or slideshows. And now we have a hybrid: A way to combine text with a target graphical scene and offer seamless links between the two.
</p>
<p>
For example, below we see an explanation text on the left. On the right, we see a piece of code denoting the definition of an inspector view and a preview of the rendering for a specific object. Hovering over the highlighted words visually link to the corresponding parts in the code and in the scene.

Visualizer makes visualization a first-class citizen in the environment. It contains a few programmable engines including Mondrian, for drawing graphs, an initial Plotter for drawing charts, or Connector, for identifying connections between various objects.

Transcript is a basic console. Now, text is quaint, but we have to outgrow it. And, you should not use Transcript for debugging purposes either. But if you must, at least you can do it with style. For example, if you have an exception that you want to print, the whole exception stack is inspectable right from the Transcript. Why? Because we can, and because doing it any other way would be not glamorous enough.

The first non-Pharo language fully supported by Glamorous Toolkit is the one of SmaCC with which we define parsers for other langauges. For example, below we see the definition of the C# parser presented similarly to how we present Pharo code. Beside the editing abilities, the integration also comes with various debugging and inspection abilities, such as a simulator. Through these tools we make the construction and evolution of parsers innexpensive.

<div>
<blockquote>LinkedIn profiles have become a powerful place to gather data on individuals. Different parties will have their own usage of LinkedIn profiles, such as LinkedIn data mining, profile research or leads generation.</blockquote><p>There are many methods out there to procure the information we need. In this tutorial, we’ll be using one of the more simple ways to obtain the data we need, which is to use <strong>Python</strong> to simulate a Google search and get ahold of the URLs returned from the search results. Further processing can be done, either manually or via automation, as we discuss in our other tutorial, <a href="https://nubela.co/blog/tutorial-how-to-build-linkedin-automation-tools-with-python-with-a-code-example/">How to Build LinkedIn Automation Tools with Python With a Code Example</a>.</p><p>The main reason for this is to get familiar with one of the most common methods of web scraping, which is browser-based scraping. For those unfamiliar, this is where we simulate human behaviour on the web by using a browser. We will utilize a tool called <strong>Selenium</strong>, which is an open-source testing framework for web applications, which allows us to start a browser through the script. Its usage goes far beyond testing, however, as we will soon demonstrate.</p><h3 id="setup-">Setup:</h3><p>Before we start, we need to set up the project and download the dependencies we need:</p><ol><li>Python 3</li><li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/selenium/"><code>selenium library</code> with chrome webdriver</a></li></ol><h3 id="step-1">Step 1</h3><p>Let’s simulate a Google search. We will be making use of one of the more unknown Google search features, which is Google search operators, also referred to as advanced operators. These are special characters and commands that help to provide a more strict criterion for our search term, hence narrowing down our search results. You can read <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/">here</a> for a comprehensive list of operators.</p><pre><code>def create_search_url(title, location, *include):
    result = ""
    base_url = "http://www.google.com/search?q=+-intitle:%22profiles%22+site:linkedin.com/in/+OR+site:linkedin.com/pub/"

    quote = lambda x: "%22" + x + "%22"

    result += base_url
    result += quote(title) + "+" + quote(location)

    for word in include:
        result += "+" + quote(word)

    return result
</code></pre><p>We first start by defining our base URL. As you can see, there are search operators already present. The <code>-intitle</code> operator tells the engine to find pages with the word 'profiles' in the title tag. We also use the <code>-inurl</code> operator to ensure we only want pages with LinkedIn profile URLs. We can specify the default profile URLs that starts with <code>linkedin.com/pub/</code> or personalised URLs that start with <code>linkedin.com/in/</code> using the <code>OR</code> operator.</p><p>Then, we narrow our search even more by using double quotation marks to use exact-matching. Since we can’t enter double quotations in a Python string, we should either use the escape character (“\”) before the quotes or use the Unicode-equivalent in the URL which is <code>%22</code>. We enter the desired title/position and the country we passed as arguments into the quotes. To make our function less rigid, we allow additional arguments if you want to specify more criteria. Anything passed as <code>include</code> will be added for exact matching.</p><p>You can test this function yourself by printing out the result and pasting that result in your browser search bar. You can actually generate more specific Google search URLs by using free online tools like <a href="https://recruitin.net/">Recruit’em XRay Search</a>.</p><h3 id="step-2">Step 2</h3><p>Now we will make use of Selenium’s WebDriver to spin up our own automated browser. We can use any of the browsers supported by Selenium (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, etc), but for now, we will use Chrome. Here we can also specify if we want to run this browser in headless mode, which is to say without the browser window popping up (no GUI), by adding <code>options.add_argument('headless')</code>.</p><pre><code>max_page = 5
all_urls = []

options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
# options.add_argument('headless')

# specifies the path to the chromedriver.exe
driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)

# always start from page 1
page = 1

driver.get(create_search_url("software engineer", "singapore", "developer", "nubela"))

while True:
    time.sleep(3)

    # find the urls
    urls = driver.find_elements_by_class_name('r')
    urls = [url.find_element_by_tag_name('a') for url in urls]
    urls = [url.get_attribute("href") for url in urls]
    all_urls = all_urls + urls

    # move to the next page
    page += 1

    if page &gt; max_page:
        print('\n end at page:' + str(page - 1))
        break

    try:
        next_page = driver.find_element_by_css_selector("a[aria-label='Page " + str(page) + "']")
        next_page.click()
    except:
        print('\n end at page:' + str(page - 1) + ' (last page)')
        break

print(all_urls)
</code></pre><p>We then navigate to the URL returned by the previous function using <code>driver.get()</code>. This will open the page on the browser. Then it's time to get our hands on the profile URLs that are on this page of Google. We can use the browser 'Inspect' developer tool to see the HTML tag of the page links. For every link on the page, the class name of the HTML <code>div</code> will be <code>r</code>. As per convention, the hyperlink, or the profile URL, will be embedded within the <code>hrefs</code> attribute of the <code>a</code> tag.</p><p>Every time we finish scraping the Google page for URLs, we navigate to the next page by finding the button using <code>driver.find_element_by_css_selector()</code> and simulating a click action. Here we specified a counter for the number of pages and a maximum page which you can set a reasonable number for. If the next page doesn't exist, then we stop our crawling and return our results.</p><h3 id="additional-steps">Additional steps</h3><p>You have now obtained the LinkedIn profile URLs that you need. Easy, right? All you have to do now is to gather data available on these profiles. Unfortunately, bulk web scraping LinkedIn itself won’t be this easy because LinkedIn has measures in place to prevent this from happening. Read our other article, <a href="https://nubela.co/blog/why-you-shouldnt-use-linkedin-automation-tools-using-your-own-account/">Why You Shouldn’t Use LinkedIn Automation Tools using YOUR OWN Account</a>, to understand that even using some LinkedIn automation tools might danger your LinkedIn account.</p><p><strong>Good news, you can now scrape LinkedIn profiles <em>WITHOUT</em> risking your account with <a href="https://nubela.co/proxycurl/">Proxycurl</a>!</strong> You can read the <a href="https://nubela.co/blog/introducing-proxycurls-linkedin-api/">introduction to Proxycurl's LinkedIn API here</a>. With Proxycurl as a LinkedIn profile API, you can use your generated profile URLs and get all the data you need!

<![CDATA[Is Open Source Even Relevant in Serverless]]>

<p>Open source has been intertwined with enterprise software for more than two decades and, with the increased adoption of cloud computing, the role of open-source software has only been increasing. If we look at the hype around containers, it is completely driven by open source. As <a href="https://talkingserverless.com/serverless/">Serverless</a> gains traction, driven mainly by the higher-level abstractions, the key question in the minds of industry watchers. When the underlying nuts and bolts have limited meaning from the point of view of its end users, does open source have any meaning? Do developers even care about open source?</p>



<p>When cloud computing gained traction, driven by the success of AWS, there were questions about the viability of open-source software. We had open source projects like OpenStack, CloudStack, and Eucalyptus, competing against the Infrastructure as a Service offering from AWS. They failed miserably because the advantage of cloud computing was in the outsourcing of data center capital expenditure and operations. Open-source IaaS software didn’t provide this advantage and all they could offer was better resource utilization and programmatic access to the infrastructure. However, in the early days of cloud computing, the public cloud was not a runaway success among enterprise customers and the hybrid cloud was the path taken by these users.</p>



<p>Even though open source failed in providing an equivalent to AWS EC2, we saw the reverse happening in the PaaS layer. While Heroku, Google App Engine stagnated after getting initial developer mindshare, OSS offerings like OpenShift and CloudFoundry gained developer traction as well as enterprise adoption. Their success could be adopted to the fact that enterprise customers wanted to have a PaaS like abstraction that could span both on-premises as well as public cloud. This was followed by the huge success of Docker as the container engine and Kubernetes as the container orchestration plane. At this point, talking heads were so confident about the importance of OSS in cloud computing. But we need to keep in mind that the success of OSS in the PaaS layer was driven by two main reasons:</p>



<ul><li>PaaS services in the public cloud had a legacy cost structure based on compute units similar to virtual machines</li><li>Hybrid cloud was still the focus of enterprise customers due to unnecessary concerns about moving to public cloud providers</li></ul>



<p>In the last 2-3 years, we have seen a dramatic shift in the enterprise adoption of public clouds and most organizations are taking a cloud-first approach.</p>



<p>So, when AWS released AWS Lambda with a new pricing model based on service invocations, we saw a shift similar in importance to what happened when they released compute and storage as a service with a pricing model where user paid only when the service was used. Functions as a Service (FaaS) like AWS Lambda, <a href="https://go.zoho.com/yIl">Catalyst</a>, Azure Functions, etc. provide a breakthrough in the cost model similar to the pay per use model unleashed by early cloud services like AWS S3 and EC2. This is what makes FaaS uniquely attractive to both developers and enterprises. A fundamental shift in a cost structure that lowers the barrier to adoption and the cost of innovation. FaaS levels the playing field for smaller companies to build innovative services to compete with large organizations with great financial muscle. This is entirely driven by the cost model of FaaS alone and the cost savings are the reason why FaaS is still attractive in spite of certain architectural limitations imposed by the abstraction.</p>



<p>The key question is whether open-source can compete with FaaS offerings in the cloud. There is no straightforward binary answer and it is a bit more nuanced. OSS cannot compete head to head with FaaS. Developers would rather not have any operational overhead than managing the open-source serverless layer. FaaS is a clear winner against open source equivalents just like how IaaS made open-source cloud infrastructure software irrelevant. However, open-source may still be important in some niche areas:</p>



<ul><li>There could be higher-order developer frameworks on top of FaaS that could be open source in order to get developer mindshare. Serverless.com is a good example of this</li><li>Multi-cloud is fast becoming the de facto strategy for many organizations. Organizations may want to provide the same developer abstractions across multiple cloud providers. Open source serverless platforms will be relevant in this scenario. Data is spread out among multiple cloud providers and the compute for the applications using the data should lie closer to the data. Many organizations may want to provide a standardized developer interface to their developers. Open source serverless platforms will be useful in such scenarios. This is similar to the success of OpenShift and, to a lesser extent, CloudFoundry in the PaaS layer</li><li>Kubernetes is fast gaining traction among the enterprises for deploying containers. As organizations deploy apps using multiple encapsulations and deployment models like containers and FaaS, they may want to have a Kubernetes based serverless layer. Knative and serverless frameworks on top of Knative may be relevant in such scenarios</li></ul>



<p>While it doesn’t make sense to use an open-source FaaS layer while using a single cloud provider for deploying the applications, it may still be relevant in multi-cloud scenarios and toolkits around FaaS. Thoughts?</p>

<p>– None of your ancestors ever needed it.</p>



<p> – It’s new, so there haven’t been any studies on the long-term risks.</p>



<p> – The rich will have more of it than the poor, which contributes to inequality.</p>



<p> – Whites will have more of it than blacks, which contributes to racism.</p>



<p> – The inventors might get rich, even though the world has many hard-working, poor people. That’s not fair.</p>



<p> – Someone who doesn’t want it might be pressured into using it, and that would impinge on personal freedom.</p>



<p> – If it doesn’t save labor, it’s frivolous; if it does save labor, it will put people out of work.</p>



<p> – What if criminals, dictators, or other bad actors used it for evil purposes?</p>



<p> – People are used to the old way of doing things, and why should they have to change?</p>



<p> – It needs to be tested more thoroughly.</p>



<p> – Not having to do things the hard way will make everyone lazy.</p>



<p> – It’s not perfect, and it won’t solve all of our problems.</p>



<p> – Nobody would really want it anyway.</p>



<p> – The whole idea is just ridiculous.</p>
