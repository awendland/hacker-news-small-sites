<div><p>It seems like so long ago we were all sitting around watching our friends scroll through this new app called Instagram on their iPhone 4’s. Iâ€™m sure your conversations went something like this:<br><em>â€œItâ€™s like Facebook but just for picturesâ€¦â€�<br>â€œThat wonâ€™t last long, thatâ€™s boring.â€�<br></em>Well, this year Instagram turns 10! The app quickly caught the eye of the marketing world and has only expanded from there. With the introduction of<a href="https://www.digitalmediateam.co.uk/boost-posts-social-media-dmt-blog/"> boost posts</a>, ads and in-depth analytics it’s never been easier to know your audience and cater what they want. </p><p>Weâ€™re breaking down what Instagram does best: getting those likes. Let’s start giving you the rundown on the top ten most-loved Instagram photos of all time.</p></div>



<hr>







<h2>Ten:</h2>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>This isnâ€™t the only appearance Kylie Jenner will make on our Instagram list. Currently with 168 million followers, this isn’t surprising.  The make up mogul knows her angles and VSCO filters – and I suppose the professional photographers help too. </p>



<hr>







<h2>Nine:</h2>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/B0ZBRxUDX9y/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="12"></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>After the rough year Selena had she came back thriving. She was living her best life on a boat in Italy and her followers rushed to support it in the form of 14 million likes. </p>



<hr>







<h2>Eight:</h2>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/BtxEL1EgbYa/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="12"></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Sheâ€™s back again and better than ever. The photos show a very happy Selena on the beach hanging around with her friends and celebrating her friend getting married. </p>



<hr>







<h2>Seven:</h2>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/B1V5m7WFfUy/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="12"></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>There is not a single person alive who dislikes Dwayne â€˜The Rockâ€™ Johnson and the amount of likes he got on this post proves that. He tied the knot to his now-wife Lauren in his homeland of Hawaii. </p>



<hr>







<h2>Six:</h2>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/B72NUtWA0gS/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="12"></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The world was left heartbroken by the death of Kobe Bryant. In an emotional post, LeBron James pours his heart out as he talks about his friend and team mate.  </p>



<hr>







<h2>Five:</h2>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bwjpxgph9DE/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="12"></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>A newcomer has stormed the list! This post seemed to appear on everyone’s stories almost simultaneously. Not only is this a perfect example of what you can do with good marketing and a smart social media team, but proof that people do care about the planet and are trying to make change! The campaign is still active so go ahead and like it and plant one more tree. </p>



<hr>







<h2>Four:</h2>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3o8vWDhlOh/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="12"></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Jennifer Anniston posted this picture with her *ahem* friendsâ€¦ and the internet went wild. Aniston broke the Guinness World Record for being the fastest person to reach one million likes on a picture. It took her just five hours and 16 minutes to set the entire Instagram world into a <em>Friends</em> frenzy. </p>



<hr>







<h2>Three:</h2>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/Be3rTNplCHf/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="12"></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>To someone who isnâ€™t up to date on the situation, it may look like any other regular baby photo. But Kylie kept us waiting to announce this one, 341 days to be exact. After hiding her pregnancy from the public, this was her way of finally letting the world know that Stormi was here. </p>



<hr>







<h2>Two:</h2>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bi-hISIghYe/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="12"></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>This was the first and the last post on the late rappers Instagram page. Eerily, before his death, a snippet of his upcoming video was released where he attended his own funeral. </p>



<hr>







<h2>One:</h2>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/BsOGulcndj-/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="12"></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Started from the bottom now weâ€™re here. The number one most liked photo of all time. An egg.<br></p>



<p>This picture of an egg cracked Kylie Jennerâ€™s Instagram record by a long shot, with over 50 million likes at the time of writing. The account was speculated to be lots of things but finally it was revealed that it would be explained during the Super Bowl.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>It was an effort to make people speak out about their mental health in collaboration with the streaming service, Hulu. The cheeky egg even got a response from Kylie herself. <br></p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/BsmPezCnZ4I/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="12"></blockquote>

      <span>May 28, 2014</span>
    </p>
    
<p>This week, spreadsheets hit the news again, when data for a book written by economist Pikkety turned out to contain&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/05/23/financial_times_on_piketty_his_data_is_wrong.html">spreadsheet errors</a>. On this, Daniele Lemire wrote a blog post warning people&nbsp;<a href="http://lemire.me/blog/archives/2014/05/23/you-shouldnt-use-a-spreadsheet-for-important-work-i-mean-it/">not to use spreadsheets for serious work</a>. This is useless advice, let me explain why.</p>
<p><strong>1) Only a fool blames their&nbsp;tool</strong></p>
<p>Heathcare.gov is built in Java. Did people go around the interwebs shouting&nbsp;we all should stop using Java? Of course not! Because it is easy to see that the problems stemmed from other areas: process, time pressure, lack of testing and other (human) factors probably. See how silly it is to blame a tool? The same goes for spreadsheets. Yes, they are not so easy to test,&nbsp;but they have many benefits, like ‘liveness’ (immediate feedback), having data, metadata and calculations in one view, ease of deployment. In that sense, they have&nbsp;benefits over other programming environments.</p>
<p><strong>2) No, we do not know better!&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I have been working on spreadsheets as a researcher for about 5 years now, and during that time I spoke with a lot of spreadsheet users. Of course, I asked them why they would run a bank/insurance company/airline on spreadsheets. You know what many of them say?</p>
<p><em>“We asked IT to build this, they said it would take 6 months and half a million euros. And most likely it will be more expensive and not what we want.”</em></p>
<p>The reality is that it is just not feasible to build software for all business processes. We don’t have the manpower, and frankly, in many cases also not the domain skill needed. So what we need to do isn’t ridicule spreadsheet users.&nbsp;They have been disappointed by us many times. I already mentioned healthcare.gov and there are so many other IT screw-ups that it is almost&nbsp;arrogant to claim superiority over the spreadsheet users.</p>
<p><strong>3) Like democracy, spreadsheets are the worst, except for all others</strong></p>
<p>Then, in addition to our riducule, we try to push tools to them, “real” programming languages, that nor fit their needs nor their skills. They will never learn Java or C#. Python maybe, that seems to be easy to use for end-users, but certainly not for all of them. End-users are not programmers, they don’t want to be and they should not need to be.</p>
<p>Instead of shaming spreadsheet users, let’s focus on inventing better spreadsheet-killers tools (Tableau is my personal favorite at the moment). Or, and this is my line of research, help spreadsheet users to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.felienne.com/archives/2957">test</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://figshare.com/articles/Detecting_and_refactoring_code_smells_in_spreadsheet_formulas/980655">measure</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.felienne.com/archives/2964">refactor</a>. No one, really, no one, is helped with your judgement without thinking about alternatives.</p>

Chat bots are nothing new but unless they meet a high-enough quality bar, they tend to be a step backwards rather than forward. We believe huge language models such as <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/">OpenAI’s GPT-3</a> will form a foundation for a truly conversational human-computer interface. It is, however, a foundation rather than a solution in and of itself.</p><p>In this new paradigm, the big challenge becomes to ensure the chat bot strictly sticks to the topic it was designed for and provides accurate information - without depriving it of its creativity.</p><p>I will discuss this briefly in the context of what we refer to as <strong>knowledge-base chat bots</strong>. They are built to answer general questions and hold a conversation about a product, service or a topic delineated by a predetermined unstructured knowledge base.</p><p><img src="https://blog.quickchat.ai/images/zeroth_faster.gif" alt="Start a conversation - image" title="Start a conversation"></p><p>Our chat bot implementation approved by the OpenAI team (try it out live at <a href="https://itemsy.com/">itemsy.com</a>) is an expert on Itemsy - a software product for managing the content you read online. It relies on GPT-3 for its conversational capabilities.</p><p>Thanks to our <a href="https://quickchat.ai/">Quickchat</a> engine (on top of GPT-3), it makes full and accurate use of the Itemsy knowledge base it was provided with, focuses on the topic at hand and cannot be maneuvered away from it:</p><p><img src="https://blog.quickchat.ai/images/first_faster.gif" alt="Avoid off-topic conversations - image" title="Avoid off-topic conversations"></p><p>Ultimately, it’s all about <em>conversation</em>. It requires context, needs to be unscripted, adaptive and creative. You’re still talking to a machine but this time language feels more like natural language. 🙃</p><p><img src="https://blog.quickchat.ai/images/second_faster.gif" alt="Creative conversation guided by the user - image" title="Creative conversation guided by the user"></p><p>We’re ready to work with you and launch conversational chat bots for a wide range of use cases.

The problem is that the ease of accessing and interacting with a dataset is reversed correlated with the dataset’s size and complexity. Finding edge cases and interesting interactions within a large scale dataset is like finding a needle in a haystack. Therefore, making a great dataset such as nuScenes accessible through SiaSearch, makes the dataset even more powerful, as it becomes fully accessible and the process of selecting the relevant driving sequences is now trivial.</p><p><strong>The Importance of Research</strong></p><p>The research community plays a critical role in the autonomous vehicle (AV) development ecosystem. Some of the most important advancements in AV development became a reality thanks to curious researchers from labs around the globe. Both SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), as well as object detection, can be mentioned as ideal examples for significant progress that was done in research environments. They laid the groundwork for fundamental problems any AV engineer deals with during their daily jobs in the industry.</p><p>Today, the development of AV is very data-driven. Without driving datasets it would be impossible to train and validate perception, prediction, or motion planning models. However, equipping a test vehicle with a typical sensor setup (cameras, lidars, radars, GPS, imu) can cost up to a few hundred thousands of dollars. Therefore, large-scale publicly available datasets (free of charge for non-commercial activities) have played a significant part and will continue to do so, with regards to pushing forward the development of AV.</p><p>Lots of articles were written on the importance of public datasets and the motivation of the different OEMs, Tier 1 suppliers, and full-stack startups to release them to the research community.<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/05/29/how-open-source-data-can-drive-automotive-innovation/#117f9d5dfd40">[1]</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://news.mit.edu/2020/mit-toyota-release-visual-open-data-accelerate-autonomous-driving-research-0618">[2]</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/21/waymo-releases-a-self-driving-open-data-set-for-free-use-by-the-research-community/">[3]</a>&nbsp;These publications all share similar motivations such as encouraging researchers to develop new insights, discuss novel perspectives as well as to discover solutions to existing and shared problems. Therefore, it is clear that the industry sees the research community as an integral part of the autonomous vehicles ecosystem and as a facilitator for future and advanced developments.</p><p><strong>How SiaSearch is Used to Curate Training Datasets</strong></p><p>For example, as an ML engineer working on motion planning, you know you have a problem with your model when it comes to complex driving scenarios such as unprotected left turns with oncoming traffic and pedestrians next to the ego vehicle. You want to curate a training dataset to improve your model — how would you find the relevant data?!<br>Currently, this process is time-consuming and requires a manual review of large amounts of data to select scenes that fit the requirements.</p><p>With SiaSearch this process can be heavily accelerated. The ML engineer can curate a training dataset in just a few minutes! (even seconds, but we don’t like to brag). Intuitively querying the entire data lake and finding exactly what he needs before exporting the data to her development environment.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1601557776763_108903"><div><p>Explore nuScenes through SiaSearch —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.siasearch.io/open-data"><strong><em>register here</em></strong></a></p><p>If you want to learn more about SiaSearch and how it could help you to better interact with your raw sensor data, please feel free to visit our website at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.siasearch.io/">www.siasearch.io</a>, reach out to us via&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi@siasearch.io">hi@siasearch.io</a>&nbsp;and make sure to follow us on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/siasearch">LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/searchsia">Twitter</a>.</p><p>nuScenes is available for commercial use under our commercial license agreement.

  <p><label>Posted on <strong>28 September 2020</strong></label></p>
<p>Shadertoy is a wonderful tool which lets users create and share a type of program called a fragment shader online. The true magic of shadertoy is its community of very talented graphics programmers who build incredible works of art despite having access to only a sliver of the traditional graphics pipeline.  </p>
<p>Some of these shaders are very computationally intensive and even in a small window, they crawl along well below their intended 60 frames per second on my old laptop. Inspired by a technique in the VR community called Foveated Rendering, I decided to try to optimize these shaders by only rendering a fully detailed image within a small focal region. As you move away from the focal point the image quality decreases.   </p>
<p>This rendering scheme is motivated by biology. It turns out your eye notices more detail in the center of your vision than in the periphery. Some VR graphics programmers realized they could take advantage of this phenomenon to increase the effective resolution of images by increasing image quality towards the center of your vision. An in depth discussion of foveated rendering can be found in the “previous work section” of this <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/deepfovea-using-deep-learning-for-foveated-reconstruction-in-ar-vr">paper</a>.  </p>
<p>I did not have the time, equipment or the background necessary to implement a full foveated rendering system but it was fun to fool around with the concept.  </p>
<p>Before diving into the technical details let’s look at a simple shadertoy fragment shader.   </p>
<p><code>
void mainImage(out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord)<br>
{
</code></p><p><code>
    // Normalized pixel coordinates (from 0 to 1)<br>
    vec2 uv = fragCoord/iResolution.xy;
<div><pre><span></span><span>//</span> <span>Output</span> <span>the</span> <span>pixel</span> <span>coordinates</span> <span>as</span> <span>a</span> <span>color</span> <span>to</span> <span>screen</span>
<span>//</span> <span>fragColor</span> <span>is</span> <span>a</span> <span>4</span> <span>vector</span> <span>of</span> <span>the</span> <span>form</span>
<span>//</span> <span>(</span><span>red</span><span>,</span> <span>green</span><span>,</span> <span>blue</span><span>,</span> <span>transparency</span><span>)</span>
<span>fragColor</span> <span>=</span> <span>vec4</span><span>(</span><span>uv</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>
</pre></div>


</code></p><p><code>
}<br>
</code></p>
<p>This program runs once for each pixel on the screen. Each time it runs, we receive the input variable <code>fragCoord</code>. <code>fragCoord</code> is a 2d vector which contains the x and y coordinates of the pixel being drawn. We normalize those coordinates by dividing by <code>iResolution</code>, another 2d vector, which contains the width and height of the image. Finally we output a color to the screen, whose red and green channels are proportional to the x and y position of the pixel being drawn. The output of this shader looks like this:<br>
</p><p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/focused-render/simple-shader-out.png" width="50%"> 
</p>
<p>Side note, why do these shader programs require their own language? Shaders are special because they run on the graphics card instead of the cpu. They are highly parallel. A helpful mental model might be imagining that each pixel is colored simultaneously. Therefore a lot of things that we take for granted in normal program languages such as liberally accessing memory and branching become much more difficult.  </p>
<p>In shadertoy shaders the bottleneck is always in the pixel rendering step. So to speed them up we want to only render a subset of the all the pixels on the screen. It seems like selectively rendering pixels should be as simple as adding a branch to the per pixel shader code that looks like:  </p>
<p><code>
void mainImage(out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord) <br>
{<br>
</code></p><p><code>
    if (fragCoord is in the subset of pixels to render) {
      <p>
      ... do computationally intensive work 
      </p> 
    } else {
      <p>
      // return a black pixel<br>
      return vec4(0, 0, 0, 1); 
      </p> 
    } 
</code></p><p><code> 
}
</code></p>
<p>Unfortunately we cannot just use an if statement inside of the shader to save us from rendering all the pixels. Unlike normal programming languages, fragment shaders always execute both parts of each branch due to gpu limitations. So while our above code will still have to spend the sample amount of time evaluating compuationally intensive work.  </p>
<p>Luckily, it turns out that graphics drivers can selectively mark which pixels not to shade by writing their location to a special buffer called the stencil buffer. We can use this stencil buffer to only shade the subset of pixels we are interested in.</p>
<p>Once I could efficiently render a subset of the pixels, I needed to come up with a pre-generated sampling pattern. Most foveated rendering techniques seem to use a grid, but I decided to try a non uniform approach. Searching for some kind of optimal sampling pattern seemed like an interesting problem and if I was going to devote more time to this I'd explore options like <a href="https://blog.demofox.org/2018/01/30/what-the-heck-is-blue-noise/">blue noise</a>. However in the interest of time, I just decided fill in a small circle in the center and then use samples drawn from one low variance and one high variance gaussians centered at the middle of the screen to place the rest of the pixels. The final sampling pattern ended up looking like this:
</p><p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/focused-render/final-sample-pattern.png" width="50%"> 
</p>
<p>Next, I needed a way to fill in all the missing pixels in the final image. The approach I took was pretty simple. I started by mapping each pixel in the final screen to its nearest neighbor. Since my sampling pattern was predetermined, I could create this map beforehand and pass it into the shader as a texture. Here's what this mapping looks like:<br>
</p><p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/focused-render/nearest-mapping.png" width="50%"> 
</p>
<p>And here’s a gif of the mapping applied to a <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/3lsSzf">shadertoy</a> created by the extremely talented <a href="https://www.iquilezles.org/">Inigo Quilez</a>:<br>
</p><p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/focused-render/1-neighbor.gif"> 
</p>
<p>The above screen is 420x236 pixels and only 1/10th of those pixels are actually rendered. The focal point is directly in the center of the screen. Here's what the full resolution version looks like:</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/focused-render/original.gif"> 
</p>

<p>And here's what it looks like with only our sampling pixels:
</p><p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/focused-render/sample-pixels.gif"> 
</p>
<p>One little improvement I tried was to make 4 different maps. The kth map mapped each pixel in the final image to its kth nearest sampled neighbor. I weighted each of neighbors by the inverse of their distance to the pixel in question. I actually even tried using some gradient descent based optimization to fine tune the weights but ended up seeing little improvement. It also seemed that increasing the number of maps beyond 4 did not improve things much either. Here's what the example from above looks like with weighted interpolation between the four closest neighbors of each pixel (we are still rendering only 1/10th of the total pixels):
</p><p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/focused-render/4-neighbors.gif"> 
</p>
<p>Finally, here's the shader with 1/5th of the total pixels rendered (as opposed to 1/10th shown above):
</p><p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/focused-render/1of5pixels.gif"> 
</p>
<p>Okay that's all cool but does this technique actually increase performance? I did not do a rigerous benchmark, but <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/3l23Rh">this shader</a> goes from around 20-25 fps on my plugged in laptop to 60 fps when reduced to 1/5th of the total pixels. <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Ms2SD1">Another shader</a> went from around 15 fps to 60 fps.  </p>
<p>One last side note is that this method can be used with any 3d scene and is not exclusive to shader toys. I just chose to use them because they are always bottlenecked by the pixel rendering step and they are really pretty!</p>
<p>Further questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we achive better temporal stability? (the <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/deepfovea-using-deep-learning-for-foveated-reconstruction-in-ar-vr">paper</a> I mentioned earlier talks about this)</li>
<li>Can we dynamically change the sampling pattern to give us better results? For example what if we sampled along edges or areas where large amounts of motion is occuring? Of course to do this we would need to compute our nearest neighbor mappings on the fly (there are actually <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XtlGDS">some</a> <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ldl3W8">shadertoys</a> which already demonstrate capability).</li>
<li>How could this scheme improve if we had access to the internals of the 3d scene? For example, could we adjust our sampling pattern based on depth information?  </li>
<li>How does this actually look in VR?  </li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Scroll scroll scroll. Going through forms and having to open a dropdown to select your country, or even worse, gender can be time consuming. I’ve been wondering how time consuming exactly and whether some select types are better. So I thought; let’s run an experiment!</p>



<p>I quickly hacked together <a href="https://github.com/bvanderdrift/select-experiment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some code</a> and let over 500 unique users fill in a form asking for their age and country. The app asks users to select their country from 3 to 55 options (Distributed according to the Fibonacci sequence, because I like Fibonacci 🤓 ). The app shows either of the following four types of select interactions:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="701" height="596" src="https://its.beer/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Group-1-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://its.beer/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Group-1-1.png 701w, https://its.beer/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Group-1-1-300x255.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 701px) 100vw, 701px"></figure></div>



<p>The results were as follows (click on the image to open the actual chart):</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://select-experiment.vercel.app/results/line" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" width="898" height="457" src="https://its.beer/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-from-2020-09-27-13-49-05.png" alt="" srcset="https://its.beer/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-from-2020-09-27-13-49-05.png 898w, https://its.beer/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-from-2020-09-27-13-49-05-300x153.png 300w, https://its.beer/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-from-2020-09-27-13-49-05-768x391.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 898px) 100vw, 898px"></a></figure></div>



<h2>Why does the drop-down spike at 21 options?</h2>



<p>Since all the respondents were from the States (I had to guarantee one option somehow) and the “U” is low in the alphabet, my <strong>assumption</strong> is that somewhere above 13 options is when the option started to fall off the screen.</p>



<h2>Why is autocomplete so high?</h2>



<p>That’s also what baffled me, I expected this to be the fastest way to do a select when there are many options. There are two <strong>hypotheses:</strong></p>



<ol><li>Most people started looking for “<strong>The</strong> United States” which would fail because the country is marked as “United States”. </li><li>The interaction of the autocomplete is difficult. After user-testing the experiment with friends some said they didn’t know whether they had to click the option, press enter or do another interaction.</li></ol>



<p>In a scatterplot you can clearly identify that a good amount of people who had to use the autocomplete interaction struggled to select their answer.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://select-experiment.vercel.app/results/scatter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" width="901" height="453" src="https://its.beer/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://its.beer/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image.png 901w, https://its.beer/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-300x151.png 300w, https://its.beer/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-768x386.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 901px) 100vw, 901px"></a></figure></div>



<p>The “Autocomplete” outliers were at least three times as frequent as the others.</p>



<ul><li>Autocomplete: 10 outliers (shown in chart)</li><li>Dropdown: 3 outliers (not shown)</li><li>Textual card: 3 outliers (not shown)</li><li>Visual Card: 2 outliers (not shown)</li></ul>



<p>Since the autocomplete outliers were overrepresented, I <strong>assumed</strong> that the autocomplete were caused by something else than maleficent intent and decided not to remove the autocomplete outliers in the data-cleaning process (explained further down).</p>



<p>💡 Idea: re-run the experiment with “The” in front and a nudge to let users know they have to click the option. But, since I used Mechanical Turk to source the responses and this is just a fun experiment, it wasn’t worth the 💰!</p>



<h2>What are some biases?</h2>



<p>A quick experiment doesn’t come without biases. First off, the ages of 20-49 are over-represented;</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://select-experiment.vercel.app/results/age-distribution" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" width="886" height="449" src="https://its.beer/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-from-2020-09-27-13-49-38.png" alt="" srcset="https://its.beer/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-from-2020-09-27-13-49-38.png 886w, https://its.beer/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-from-2020-09-27-13-49-38-300x152.png 300w, https://its.beer/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-from-2020-09-27-13-49-38-768x389.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 886px) 100vw, 886px"></a></figure></div>



<p>💭 Thought: the data of this experiment is representative for you if your demographic matches these responses. If your user’s age distribution is very different you might want to consider re-running the experiment yourself for your demographic! Feel free to use the code <a href="https://github.com/bvanderdrift/select-experiment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>!</p>



<p>Also, over 80% of respondents is from the US 🇺🇸, with the rest being Dutch 🇳🇱 (I trialed it first with friends!).</p>

<p>💭 Thought: since users had to select their country, the positioning of “United States” and “Netherlands” in a list might have introduced a bias in the data.</p>



<h2>Data Cleaning</h2>



<p>Of course there were also some jokers 🤡! I removed any response where:</p>



<ul><li>The age was negative. There were no positive age-outliers.</li><li>The country was neither US or Dutch (in MTurk only US participants could answer, thus I feel safe removing other countries).</li><li>Anyone whose time-to-completion was very extreme (e.g., some people took 1.5 minutes to select their country, wow!). As explained earlier I did leave the autocomplete outliers in.</li></ul>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>With an average of 18 data-points for each combination there is too little data to make strong recommendations, but I’m going to try anyway:</p>



<ul><li>8 or less options? Avoid drop-downs &amp; auto-completes, just use a single-interaction method; the textual or visual cards!</li><li>Have over 55 options? Go for the auto-complete and save your users a bunch of headache 😊. Make sure to clearly communicate the required select interaction though, such as ‘Enter’ or a click!</li></ul>

Let’s talk about a vulnerability that’s exposing 2018-2020 Macs while most are declining to act nor report about the matter.
Oh, and did I mention it’s unpatchable?</strong></p><p><strong>Buckle up buckaroo, we’re in for a wild ride.</strong></p><p>Skip to <a href="#security-issues">#security-issues</a> for the technical mumbo-jumbo.</p><h2 id="preface">Preface</h2><h3 id="attribution">Attribution</h3><p>The following post is an industry analysis of the code and research performed by <a href="https://twitter.com/axi0mx/">twitter.com/axi0mx</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/h0m3us3r/">twitter.com/h0m3us3r</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/aunali1/">twitter.com/aunali1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mcmrarm/">twitter.com/mcmrarm</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/su_rickmark/">twitter.com/su_rickmark</a> who poured endless hours of work into this, allowing companies and users to understand their risks concerning this issue.</p><h3 id="intel-vs-silicon">Intel vs Silicon</h3><p>This blog post only applies to macOS systems with an Intel processor and the embedded T2 security chip.
Apple silicon systems will run completely on a set of Apple-designed ARM processors and mighth have a different topology, e.g. based on the A12.
Since the A12 chip seems to have fixed this issue (to be confirmed), it’s highly likely the new Apple Silicon machines will not be vulnerable.
And while the new upcoming Intel Macs at the end of year will probably receive a new hardware revision of the T2 chip (e.g. based on the A12), we are still stuck with this vulnerability on Macs between 2018 and 2020.</p><h3 id="so-about-this-t2-thing">So about this T2 thing</h3><p>In case you are using a recent macOS device, you are probably using <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208862">the embedded T2 security chip</a> which runs <em>bridgeOS</em> and is actually based on watchOS. This is a custom ARM processor designed by Apple based on the A10 CPU found in the iPhone 7.
The T2 chip contains a <em>Secure Enclave Processor</em> (SEP), much like the A-series processor in your iPhone will contain a SEP.</p><p>While newer Macs and/or Apple Silicon (including the dev kit) will use a more recent A-series processor such as the one found in the recent iPhone (A12), current Macs still use the A10.</p><p>It performs a predefined set of tasks for macOS such as audio processing, handling I/O, functioning as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module">Hardware Security Module</a> for e.g. Apple KeyChain or 2FA, hardware accelerating media playback, whitelisting kernel extensions, cryptographic operations and <strong>ensuring the operating system you are booting is not tampered with</strong>.
The T2 chip runs its own firmware called <em>bridgeOS</em>, which can be updated when you install a new macOS version. (ever notice the screen flickering? that’s the display driver being interrupted and possibly updated.)</p><p><em>Edit</em>: I first mentioned the iPad Pro to be impacted by the T2 vulnerability, but while it could suffer from the same vulnerability, it does not contain a T2 chip.</p><h3 id="the-macos-boot-sequence">The macOS boot sequence</h3><p>So let’s focus on the boot image verification on macOS. What exactly happens when you press that power button?
<a href="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/bootprocess.png">There’s also a visual representation for any <em>conaisseurs</em></a>.
For the enthusiasts, I personally find <a href="https://michaellynn.github.io/2018/07/27/booting-secure/">Booting Secure by mikeymikey</a> a more in-depth description.</p><ol><li><p>The T2 chip is fully booted and stays on, even if your Mac device is shutdown.</p></li><li><p>The press of the power button or the opening of the lid triggers the System Management Controller (SMC) to boot.</p></li><li><p>The SMC performs a Power-On-Self-Test (POST) to detect any EFI or hardware issues such as bad RAM and possibly redirect to Recovery.</p></li><li><p>After those basic sanity checks, the T2 chip is triggered and I/O connectors are setup. (USB, NVMe, PCIe, …) It will use NVMe and PCIe to talk to NAND storage.</p></li><li><p>The applicable boot disk is selected and a disk encryption password is asked if enabled to mount <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_File_System">APFS</a> volumes possibly via FileVault2 disk encryption.</p></li><li><p><code>/System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi</code> is located on your System APFS volume and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208330">depending on your secure boot settings</a> is validated.</p></li><li><p><em>boot.efi</em> is ran which loads the Darwin kernel <em>(throwback to BSD)</em> (or Boot Camp if booting Microsoft Windows) &amp; IODevice drivers. If a kernel cache is found in <code>/System/Library/PrelinkedKernels/prelinkedkernel</code>, it will use that.</p></li><li><p>Any User Approved Kernel Extensions are initialized &amp; added to the kernel space -if- they are approved by the T2 chip.
<em>This will go away with System Extensions</em>.</p></li></ol><h3 id="macos-security-features">macOS security features</h3><p>So Apple has a couple of tricks up its sleeve to limit the attack surface of any potential security vulnerabilities. A small summary of related measures since macOS Big Sur on Intel processors:</p><ul><li><p><em>System Integrity Protection</em> (SIP): a read-only <code>/System</code> partition so the base install of macOS (including the kernel) cannot be tampered with.</p></li><li><p><em>System Extensions</em>: a move to away from Kernel Extensions, getting external code out of the Kernel framework-wise.</p></li><li><p><em>Secure Boot</em>: verifies the signature validity of the operating system on disk.</p></li><li><p><em>Filesystem seals</em>: every byte of data is compared to a hash in the filesystem metadata tree, recursively verifying integrity.</p></li></ul><h3 id="apple-marketing">Apple marketing</h3><p>As you probably all already know, Apple pushes forward privacy &amp; security as important weapons in todays world of technology.
They tout their devices as highly secure and vouch to handle your personal data using a privacy-centric approach.
While there have been mistakes made in the past (who can blame them?), Apple has been generally quick to fix any security issues that were disclosed to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201220">their responsible disclosure program</a> or in public.</p><h2 id="security-issues">Security issues</h2><h3 id="jailbreaking">Jailbreaking</h3><h3 id="the-core-problem">The core problem</h3><p>The mini operating system on the T2 (<em>SepOS</em>) suffers from a security vulnerable also found in the iPhone 7 since it contains a processor based on the iOS A10. Exploitation of this type of processor for the sake of installing homebrew software is very actively discussed in the <a href="https://reddit.com/r/jailbreak/">/r/jailbreak</a> subreddit.</p><p>So using the <a href="https://checkm8.info/">checkm8 exploit</a> originally made for iPhones, the checkra1n exploit was developed to build a semi-tethered exploit for the T2 security chip, exploiting a flaw. This could be used to e.g. circumvent activation lock, allowing stolen iPhones or macOS devices to be reset and sold on the black market.</p><p>Normally the T2 chip will exit with a fatal error if it is in DFU mode and it detects a decryption call, but thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/windknown/presentations/blob/master/Attack_Secure_Boot_of_SEP.pdf">blackbird vulnerability</a> by team Pangu, we can completely circumvent that check in the SEP and do whatever we please.</p><p>Since sepOS/BootROM is <em>Read-Only Memory</em> for security reasons, interestingly, Apple cannot patch this core vulnerability without a new hardware revision.
This thankfully also means that this is not a persistent vulnerability, so it will require a hardware insert or other attached component such as a malicious USB-C cable.</p><h3 id="debugging">Debugging</h3><p>Every Apple iDevice (which includes the T2 and the Watch, via a port under the band) ships with a firmware recovery USB interface called Device Firmware Update (DFU), which is triggered when the device is not be able to boot or by pressing a particular set of buttons when turned on. It is always available because it is code run from SecureROM. This is the mode in which checkm8 runs.</p><p>Apple also leaves the ability to access various debug functionality which is disabled on production devices unless a special boot payload is used which runs in DFU. Since Apple is the only one who can sign code for DFU, they can demote any device they like, including the most recent A14 processors.
But since the checkm8 vulnerability runs so early in the boot process, we too can demote the T2 into DFU mode.
Without checkm8, we would not be able to run unsigned code in DFU and thus not be able enable debug interfaces. Once the debug interface is enabled Apple uses specialized cables with simian names (see Chimp, Kanzi, Gorilla).</p><h3 id="impact">Impact</h3><p>Once you have access on the T2, you have full <code>root</code> access and kernel execution privileges since the kernel is rewritten before execution.
Good news is that if you are using FileVault2 as disk encryption, they do not have access to your data on disk <em>immediately</em>.
They can however inject a keylogger in the T2 firmware since it manages keyboard access, storing your password for retrieval or transmitting it in the case of a malicious hardware attachment.</p><p>The functionality of locking an Apple device remotely (e.g. via MDM or FindMy) can be bypassed (<em>Activation Lock</em>).</p><p>A firmware password does not mitigate this issue since it requires keyboard access, and thus needs the T2 chip to run first.</p><p>Any kernel extension could be whitelisted since the T2 chip decides which one to load during boot.</p><p>If the attack is able to alter your hardware (or sneak in a malicious USB-C cable), it would be possible to achieve a semi-tethered exploit.</p><p>While this may not sound as frightening, be aware that this is a perfectly possible attack scenario for state actors.
I have sources that say more news is on the way in the upcoming weeks. I quote: <em>be afraid, be very afraid</em>.</p><h2 id="exploitation">Exploitation</h2><pre><code># install devtools

Since I did not receive a response for weeks, I did the same to numerous news websites that cover Apple, but no response there as well.
In hope of raising more awareness (and an official response from Apple), I am hereby disclosing almost all of the details.
You could argue I’m not following responsible disclosure, but since this issue has been known since 2019, I think …</p></div></div></div>

    <p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/chaos1.jpg" alt="Chaos, an important theme in hermetism" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>We live in a world that is gradually and incessantly attracted by
over-rationality and order. In this article we’ll burst the enchanted
bubble and embrace corruption and chaos — We’re going to discuss the
topic of image glitch art.</p>

<h2 id="w̸h̸a̷t̴̶s̴-̶a̴-̷g̷l̸i̷t̴c̵h̵">w̸h̸a̷t̴’̶s̴ ̶a̴ ̷g̷l̸i̷t̴c̵h̵</h2>

<p>Welcome to the land of creative destruction: image glitch art. Our story
starts with a simple idea: glitching a wallpaper to create a slideshow
of corrupted pictures.<br>
The unfortunate victim of our crime: The world (Right click <strong>&gt;</strong> View
image, while keeping the <strong>Control</strong> key pressed, to admire it in more
details while its still in its pristine form):</p>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/glitch_art/world_map.jpg" alt="World Map, nominal case" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>Before we begin, let’s attempt to define what we’re trying to do: What
is glitch art?<br>
Like any art movement, words can barely express the essence behind the
meaning, they are but fleeting and nebulous. Regardless, I’ll be an
infidel and valiantly express what I think glitch art is.</p>

<p>A glitch is a perturbation, a minor malfunction, a spurious signal. In
computers, glitches are predominantly accidental events that are
undesirable and could possibly corrupt data.<br>
Glitch art started as people developed a liking for such unusual events
and the effects glitches had on the media they were perturbing. Some started
to collect these glitches that happened naturally in the wild, and others
started to intentionally appropriate the effects by manually performing them.<br>
In the art scene, some started using image processing to “fake” true
glitching effects.</p>

<p>Glitches happen all the time and everywhere, information is never as
durable and reliable as we might like it to be, and living in a physical
world makes it even less so. You’ve probably encountered or heard of the
effect of putting a magnet next to anything electronic that hasn’t been
rugged to withstand such scenario.<br>
That’s why many techniques have been put in place to avoid glitches,
at all layers, from the hardware storage, to the software reading
and interpreting it. Be it error correcting codes (ECC) or error detection
algorithms, they are all enemies of glitch art and the chaos we like.</p>

<p>However, this niche aesthetic is more than a fun pass-time for computer
aficionado, there is a bigger picture. Similar to painters with
brushes on a canvas, we are offered a material, an object to work with
— a material made of bits and formatted in a specific way.<br>
Like any object, our medium has a form and meaning, it can move, it has
a size, it can be transferred, and interpreted — information theory
is the field interested in this.<br>
Like any object, our medium can be subject and react to deformations,
forces, and stressors. How it flows is what the field of rheology
is interested in (not to be confused with computational rheology, the
field of fluid simulation.) The medium fluidity can be studied to answer
questions such as: is it elastic, solid, viscous, or oily, how does it
respond, within the bound of information theory, to different types of
applied forces.</p>

<p>Here are some words you may encounter and that you definitely want
to know:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Misregistration: Whenever a physical medium misread data because of
damages caused by scratches, dirt, smudges, gamma rays, or any other
treasures the universe throws at us.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Datamoshing, Photomosh, Imagemosh: Abusing the format of a medium,
normally compression artefacts, to create glitches. For example, video
compression often use i-frames for fixed images and p-frame for the
movement/transition of pixels on that image. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datamoshing/">Removing i-frames is a
common glitching method</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Databending: An idea taken from circuit bending, bending the circuit
board of a toy to generate weird sounds. Databending is about bending
the medium into another unrelated one, reinterpreting it as something
it is not meant to be.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Let me add that glitch art is vast and fascinating, this article is but a
glimpse into this space. If you’re captivated as much as I am, please take
a look at <a href="http://gli.tc/h/0nline/">gli.tc</a> and <a href="https://beyondresolution.info/">Rosa Menkman’s Beyond
Resolution</a>. Images can be pleasantly
destroyed in a great number of ways to create masterpieces.</p>

<h2 id="i̷m̷a̷g̴e̴-̸g̸l̴i̴t̴c̵h̸-̴a̶r̵t̵">I̷m̷a̷g̴e̴ ̸G̸l̴i̴t̴c̵h̸ ̴A̶r̵t̵</h2>

<p>Before starting let’s give some advices:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Back up your precious files before corrupting them.</li>
  <li>Any glitching techniques can be combined and/or applied multiple times.</li>
  <li>Sometimes too little has no effect, and sometimes too much can destroy
the file.</li>
  <li>It’s all about trials and errors, especially errors that result in
glitches.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="̷h̷o̵w̶-̵t̸o̴-̶i̷n̶d̸u̷c̶e̵-̶a̸-̶g̸l̵i̷t̶c̸h̴">̷H̷o̵w̶ ̵T̸o̴ ̶I̷n̶d̸u̷c̶e̵ ̶A̸ ̶G̸l̵i̷t̶c̸h̴</h3>

<p>Now it’s time to think about how we can apply our mischievous little
stimuli, its size, the level or layer at which it’ll be applied, and
the methodological recipe we’ll concoct to poison our images.</p>

<p>Glitch artist Benjamin Berg classifies glitches into 3 categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Incorrect Editing: Editing a file using a software that
wasn’t made to edit such file. Like editing an image file as if it
was a text file.</li>
  <li>Reinterpretation aka Databending: Convert or read a file as if it was
another type of medium. Like listening to an image file as if it was
an audio file (aka sonification).</li>
  <li>Forced errors, Datamoshing, and Misregistration: A software or hardware
bug to force specific errors in the file. This can be about the
corruption of specific bytes in the file to induce glitches, or
something happening accidentally like a device turning off when saving
a file.</li>
</ul>

<p>So let’s get to work!</p>

<h3 id="m̷a̵s̵h̸i̶n̶g̷-̴t̶h̷e̷-̷d̶a̸t̵a̸-̸r̷a̸n̶d̶o̸m̴l̵y̷">M̷a̵s̵h̸i̶n̶g̷ ̴T̶h̷e̷ ̷D̶a̸t̵a̸ ̸R̷a̸n̶d̶o̸m̴l̵y̷</h3>

<p>The easiest, but roughest, way to glitch a file is to put on our monkey
suit and overwrite or add random bytes in our image. As you would have
guessed, this isn’t very efficient but half the time it does the trick
and forces errors.</p>

<p>This technique is better suited for stronger materials like images in
raw format — without metadata and headers. We’ll understand why in a bit.<br>
To convert the file to raw format, open it in GIMP, select <strong>Export As</strong>,
select the file by extension, and choose the raw type. For now, it doesn’t
matter if you pick pixel-ordered or planar, but we’ll come back to this
choice later because it’s an important one.</p>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/glitch_art/gimp_saveas_raw.jpg" alt="GIMP process to save image as raw" loading="lazy"></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">file world_map.data
<span># world_map.data: Targa image data - Map (771-3) 771 x 259 x 1 - 1-bit alpha "\003\003\003\003\003\003\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001"</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You should also note the width and height of the image as it now doesn’t
contain this information anymore, and we’ll need those to reopen it in
GIMP. In our case it is <code>2000x1479</code>.</p>

<p>We now proceed to hand over the file to our least favorite
staff and let them have an anger tantrum at it. So what does
it look like, let’s take a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6NMiuU0ys">the result our monkey
did</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/glitch_art/world_map_random_bytes.jpg" alt="World Map, monkey have been randomly mashing the
world" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>Not bad at all for something random, but we can do better.</p>

<h3 id="c̸o̶m̸p̷r̶e̷s̸s̵i̸o̶n̴-̶d̵e̵f̶o̶r̴m̷a̶t̷i̵o̸n̷">C̸o̶m̸p̷r̶e̷s̸s̵i̸o̶n̴ ̶D̵e̵f̶o̶r̴m̷a̶t̷i̵o̸n̷</h3>

<p>Some medium are more malleable when squished properly and squished
in different ways. The image sheds a lot of information and only the
essence stays. That’s a form of databending.<br>
For example, increasing the compression of JPEG images can open the path
for glitches to happen more frequently. This is a key asset, especially
when trying to create errors related to the compression parameters within
the format of the file.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">convert <span>-quality</span> 2 world_map.jpg world_map_compressed.jpg</code></pre></figure>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/glitch_art/world_map_compressed.jpg" alt="World Map, compressed to extract its
essence" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>Keep this in your toolbox to use along with other techniques.</p>

<h3 id="g̵e̴t̵t̶i̸n̵g̷-̴i̸n̵t̷i̵m̷a̴t̸e̴-̸w̶i̵t̸h̶-̴t̵h̸e̸-̴f̷o̴r̶m̸a̴t̷">G̵e̴t̵t̶i̸n̵g̷ ̴I̸n̵t̷i̵m̷a̴t̸e̴ ̸W̶i̵t̸h̶ ̴T̵h̸e̸ ̴F̷o̴r̶m̸a̴t̷</h3>

<p>We want to corrupt in the most efficient way possible, to create
attractive chaos from the smallest change possible. To do that we have to
get intimate with the medium, to understand its deepest secrets, tickle
the image in the right places. This is what we previously referred to
as imagemoshing.</p>

<p>There’s a panoply of image formats, and they all are special in their
own ways. However, there’s still some commonality:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Header, Footer, and Metadata: If the format contains these extra
information, be it extraneous or essential, what they represent, and
how they affect the rest of the image.</li>
  <li>Compression: The format can either be compressed or not. When it is
compressed, there can be extra bits of information to help other software
uncompress the image data.</li>
  <li>How the data is laid out: Usually, the image color information is
decomposed into its components such as HSL, RGB, or others. These
components then need to be represented in the image data, either in
an interleaved or planar manner. Planar refers to writing components
independently in the data (<em>ex:</em> all R, then all G, then all B),
while interleaved refers to having them joined non-contiguously in an
alternate sequence (<em>ex:</em> RGB, then RGB, then RGB..).</li>
</ul>

<p>Manipulating these to our advantage can lead to wonderful glitches. For
example, in our previous raw image example — an image bare of header,
footer, and without compression — the pixels were interleaved which
gave rise to the effect we’ve seen, namely shifts and changes in some
colors. Having them in planar form would’ve led to different glitches
in separate color channels.</p>

<h3 id="r̵e̷i̷n̴t̶e̷r̶p̸r̴e̸t̸a̷t̶i̷o̵n̴-̵a̸s̵-̵r̸i̷c̵h̸-̸t̷e̵x̵t̴-̴a̴k̷a̸-̷w̶o̴r̵d̴p̴a̸d̵-̷e̵f̸f̴e̶c̶t̶">R̵e̷i̷n̴t̶e̷r̶p̸r̴e̸t̸a̷t̶i̷o̵n̴ ̵A̸s̵ ̵R̸i̷c̵h̸ ̸T̷e̵x̵t̴ ̴A̴K̷A̸ ̷W̶o̴r̵d̴P̴a̸d̵ ̷E̵f̸f̴e̶c̶t̶</h3>

<p>Let’s give this a try with the well-known WordPad effect, which is about
databending an image into rich text: opening the image in WordPad and
saving it.<br>
Keep in mind that this only works with raw images as it’s highly
destructive and otherwise could break fragile key info in the header
and footer. So let’s reuse our interleaved raw image of earlier but also
get a planar one.</p>

<p>This is our results for interleaved:</p>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/glitch_art/world_map_wordpad.interleaved.corrupt.jpg" alt="World Map, WordPad effect interleaved" loading="lazy"></p>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/glitch_art/world_map_wordpad.planar.corrupt.jpg" alt="World Map, WordPad effect planar" loading="lazy"></p>

I could get a job, work on my businesses, sit around, watch Netflix, or work for free at tech startups.&nbsp;</p><p>I chose the latter.</p><p>Why would I work for free in a startup? It wasn’t for free; I had to pay for the train tickets and food. I didn’t care. I knew that being out there meeting founders and investors would be the best way to learn.&nbsp;</p><p>I wanted to be involved in the startup world by creating, developing, and investing in them. I believe that’s the way how we can change the world and have a positive impact.&nbsp;</p><p>But how in the world would I find those startups?</p><p>I sent 500+ emails, called companies, asked family friends, and did everything I could, but I got annoyed. So I was like, “Screw it, I’m just going to go and ask them.”</p><p>I went to this startup incubator called Techstars at 1871 and asked if they were hiring. And that I was willing to work for free or “volunteer.”</p><p>At first, the founders looked at me like, “Kid, how old even are you?” Most founders looked the other way, but two guys were like, “Damn, let’s find something for this kid to do.”</p><p>And that’s how one of my best summers started.</p><p>The founders may have thought a fifteen-year-old won’t be able to do much, but I literally told them, “I’m willing to do anything, I just want to learn and spend as much time as possible at the incubator.” It felt like I was learning by osmosis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I would go with the founders to meetings with investors and mentors and take notes, find venture capitalists interested in investing, work on hardware, and anything they told me to do.&nbsp;</p><p>I worked with three startups that developed an AI fitness assistant, solar drones, and a real estate crowdfunding site.&nbsp;</p><p>That summer showed me the world of startups. I met people like the governor, billionaires, and overall people who were heavily involved in the startup world.&nbsp;</p><p>I also experienced the startup world, which I’m sure will pay off in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>But most importantly, I met Paul, the founder who gave me the opportunity.&nbsp;</p><p>I always kept him posted on my progress in my projects and would ask how his company was doing. And Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Happy New Year messages as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, it turns out that Paul studied in the same college and did the same major. I’ve talked to him multiple times in the last few weeks and it reminded me of the <strong>importance of having people who were once where you are.</strong></p><p>Some people called people like Paul “mentors,” but that word is misleading because 1) it’s overused and over-hyped 2) it’s transactional and self-centered.&nbsp;</p><p>How do I call people like Paul? I call them, <strong>“My Future Selves.”</strong></p><p>They often can give that little push you need. And you get to cheat because you get to talk to your future self. What’s even better is that you can always do things differently and learn from their mistakes.&nbsp;</p><p>Studying engineering isn’t the easiest thing in the world and when you bomb a test, you can feel like “You don’t have what it takes.” My first chemistry exam? Hmmm. One to forget. I like to do as best as I can and not doing as expected frustrates me, especially when I need to get a good GPA to transfer to the engineering school.&nbsp;</p><p>I felt like I was the only one, but as I talked to “My Future Self” or Paul, I realized I wasn’t the only one and he too didn’t do great on his first chemistry exam. But he improved and could transfer to the engineering school.&nbsp;</p><p>He advised me on how to approach studying and how to approach the test and my grades have improved.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes, you can also lose sight of the big picture of what you want. Future selves remind you to keep focused not by scolding you but by asking you simple questions like, “What are your future plans after college?” or “Do you like what you’re studying?”</p><p>In my case, Paul knows I’m into startups and <a href="https://www.juandavidcampolargo.com/blog/ambition" target="_blank">eating the world</a>, so he helps me with choosing a path that aligns with my interests and with my goals.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking back, that was not a normal thing for a teen to do. Yes, you can say it, “I was weird.”&nbsp;</p><p>Well, not really. I knew <strong>who</strong> I was and <strong>where</strong> I wanted to go. That’s how going up to startup founders asking for a job could become your summer.&nbsp;</p><h2>How To Find Your Future Self</h2><p>If I hadn’t talked to Paul a few times since college started, I’d honestly be down and not very excited about the possibilities. <strong>Future selves can you show a path that gets you excited to work harder and more ambitiously.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>If you’re interested in finding a possible future self. I’ve learned a few lessons that can be helpful.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Avoid being artificial. </em></strong>We’ve all heard the talk, “Get a mentor and blah blah blah.” Sure, but that can’t the only reason. You should be genuine. And please please, don’t be asking people to be your mentor.&nbsp;</p><p>How can you be more genuine?</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Make yourself useful to them</p></li><li><p>Get a job or internship at that person’s company or lab</p></li><li><p>Ask unique and interesting questions</p></li><li><p>Just DM or email them</p></li></ul><p><strong><em>Understand their motivations. </em></strong>Keep this question in mind, “Why would someone want to mentor you?”</p><p>It usually happens when a high-potential person approaches them, and they can help him/her reach that potential.&nbsp; And if they can see their advice pays off 10x in you. If your future self tells you to walk 5 steps, they want to see you walk 50 steps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Don’t find mentors. </em></strong>This one will be the hardest to understand, but the most powerful. I don’t ask people, “Do you want to be my mentor?”</p><p>Most people will say “No.” Instead, the way you find mentors or future selves is by:</p><p>1) Finding people who are where you want to be.&nbsp;</p><p>2) Asking great questions and becoming genuinely interested in their work, and finally,&nbsp;</p><p>3) Keeping in contact with them and asking questions and/or advice when you need it. Or if you find something useful for them, this is when you help them.</p><p>I’m grateful to Paul and many of my other future selves because they allow me to learn from their mistakes, pick a unique path for me, and give you the little push and fresh perspective when you most need it.&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you, Paul, and thank you to all my future selves!</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Oswald Spengler was one of the most profound pessimists of modern times but at a glance, his legacy appears to have collected decades of dust since his early death in 1936.&nbsp;Considered unessential by historians and troublesome by philosophers, he nonetheless exerted an extraordinary influence over many powerful figures throughout the twentieth century. Wittgenstein said he was one of his chief inspirations; the Jungian theorist Joseph Campbell claimed Spengler’s work was his biggest influence; the philosopher Martin Heidegger was profoundly affected by Spengler’s thinking; and former Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, wrote favourably about him in his doctoral thesis ‘The Meaning of History’. Kissinger gifted a one-volume edition of Spengler’s The Decline of the West to President Nixon when he served in his administration to ‘emphasise the manifestation of events’. But who was this man whose thought has shaped modern philosophy and the perception of some of our top policy gurus, and what did he believe?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Oswald Spengler was born in the Duchy of Brunswick in 1880 to Protestant parents. His father’s family were traditionally mining engineers and metallurgical inspectors while his mother, Pauline, from whom Spengler received his irascible temperament, hailed from an artistically inclined lineage of ballet dancers and bohemians. Unlike his ancestors, his father worked as a senior postal secretary and severely chastised any hint of intellectualism in his children, a repulsion that must have conditioned the young Spengler to distrust celebrated thinkers later in his life. It was this inherited mixture of two divergent tendencies – engineering and science with bohemianism and the arts – that afforded Spengler a unique intellectual vantage and prepared him to proffer his special perspective to his readers in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After excelling in Greek, Latin, Mathematics and the Sciences at school, he attended the universities of Munich, Berlin and Halle. In 1903, two years after his father’s death, he initially failed to obtain his PhD but managed to pass a year later via an oral equivalent of the examination. He then qualified as a schoolmaster and led a relatively uneventful life teaching in Saarbrucken, Dusseldorf and Hamburg. When his mother died in 1910, he returned to Munich where he lived on his modest inheritance as a private scholar. It is said he owned no books and suffered from great loneliness rather like a latter-day Nietzsche. But, like Nietzsche, these years proved to be formative. It was around this time that he conceived of writing a book that would challenge common preconceptions of history and its meaning. He began work on&nbsp;<em>The Decline of the West&nbsp;</em>in 1911 and completed a first draft in 1914, but due to the war, he had to wait until 1918 for it to be published. Burdened with a weak heart, he was exempted from military service yet this didn’t mean he had an easy time. With much of his inheritance invested abroad, he was forced to persist in a state of serious poverty until the publication of his work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it came out, its success made him an instant celebrity and he finally gained the respect and reputation his talents deserved. His explanation of the war as a ‘historical change of phase’ which was ‘preordained for Germany hundreds of years ago’ consoled Germans who were being blamed in the European press for gratuitously starting the greatest military catastrophe of their time. In the early days of the Weimar Republic, he called himself a Socialist, but not a socialist of any obvious orthodoxy. He rejected Marx, whom he saw as the chief critic of the English capitalism he  defined as ‘Get rich, so you don’t have to work anymore’. He believed that the true source of German socialism was not Marx so much as Frederick William I. To succinctly explicate his brand of Prussian Socialism he used the phrase ‘Do your duty, work’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His Prussian subgenre of Socialism naturally appealed to National Socialists and he became an inspirational figure to some early believers of Nazism. His criticism of the Weimar Republic, of Marxism, pacifism and democracy intellectually aided the Nazis in their ideological advancement to the top of German politics, but once they were in power Spengler famously refused to ‘Heil Hitler’ and was thereafter shunned. He occupied his concluding years by collecting thousands of books and exotic primitive weapons, by reading the comedies of Moliere and Shakespeare and listening to the haunting quartets of his hero, Beethoven. He died three weeks before his fifty-sixth birthday of a sudden heart attack on 8<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;May, exactly nine years before the bloody fall of the Third Reich.</p>



<p>Like Kant, who rarely left his place of birth and was famously not convivial, Spengler lived an externally anodyne existence while his mental interior shone incandescently with original ideas. He worked in an age of Prussian militarism and German nationalism, of extraordinary revelations and dire events, when the tumultuous tide of uncontrollable circumstances invoked an apocalyptic atmosphere. His thinking therefore can be seen as an illuminating response to the blindness of his time. His magnum opus,&nbsp;<em>The Decline of the West</em>, was a rejection of Eurocentric versions of history and a repudiation of traditional structures of scholarship. He deemed the historical phases of ‘classical, medieval and modern’ as inaccurate, random and unhelpful, as a cracked encasement of human activity. He did not want to appraise the past chronologically and solely link cause to effect. He wanted to examine what was common and unique to cultures across the world, what the nature of mass existence is, and how humans see themselves through history, if at all. He called this new approach a ‘Copernican overturning’. For the study of history, it is as seminal a moment as the Newton’s shift in Physics or Descartes’s dramatic declaration of ‘Cogito ergo sum’ in Western Philosophy. This drastic development he hoped would forever transform humanity’s elemental understanding of history. However, his obscurity seems to have precluded his influence on the public and his theories remain widely unread outside the insular circles of academia.&nbsp;Perhaps the pessimism he espoused makes him appear intellectually unprofitable and therefore unattractive to the merely curious reader.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In&nbsp;<em>The Decline of the West</em>, Spengler’s ‘Copernican overturning’ led him to see past eras as loose biographies of isolated cultures. He applied the seasonal system of spring, summer, autumn and winter to the evolution and undoing of every prosperous society. They rise, flourish, wither and vanish like distinct wild flowers on a windswept heath. Spring naturally represents an awakening when the force of cultural expression is so strong that it sets a precedent for centuries thereafter. Summer signifies a stage of pleasing artistic production and clever imitations when creation becomes a personal activity. Autumn is when the soul of a culture depicts its happiness and attempts to return to nature, and winter means the solidifying of culture into a civilisation, when great art is mostly extinguished and the creative energy that drove a culture on is almost entirely spent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although there have been innumerable births of culture, Spengler argued only eight ‘high cultures’ have existed: the Babylonian, Egyptian, Indian, Sino-Japanese, Mesoamerican, Classical (Greek-Roman), Magian (or Arabian) and our own, the Faustian. Classical man was more concerned by the near and the present, whereas we children of the Faustian age are forever looking into infinity, searching for the ultimate end of our speculative powers. Sadly, he claims that the Faustian age is the most tragic because although we enjoy unprecedented technological discoveries and rapidly strive and create, we know deep down that our goals will always elude us and that our efforts will eventually be proven futile.&nbsp; To add to the dark tone he used to describe our time, he believed our culture was now in its winter phase. Lawrence Durrell opened his Alexandrian Quartet with the beautiful line ‘in the midst of winter you feel the inventions of spring’. In Spengler, this ‘feeling’ is a remembrance rather than an anticipation. The time of birth and rejuvenation is forever finished, metaphorically speaking. In this present phase, Spengler’s prophesising limns an authoritative ruler or ‘new emperor’ who emerges in response to the disintegration of culture. He called this the Caesarian age. Many Spenglerian commentators have identified the advent of Hitler and Nazism as an example of a Caesarian instance in cultural history and it would be an easy feat to find comparisons in politics today who fit the description of attributes Spengler so eerily expatiates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spengler’s approach to the philosophy of history – to how we see history and what meaning we can derive from an appraisal of past events – is informed by a myriad of unorthodox intellectual disciplines. Morphology, the study of the form and structure of organisms and their specific structural features, determines his perception of eras and their attributes. Mathematics is used to reveal the rational divergence of different cultures and to prove the sociocultural relativism of subjects that supposedly seek certainty. Art, economics, politics, literature and architecture are each discussed with a rare authority, but his factual errors and historical inaccuracies have galvanised his critics and stunted his appeal. However, Spengler’s holistic discernments distinguishes him from other philosophers of history and raises his status to a laudable level of exceptional intellectual skill. His analytical insight penetrates more deeply and disturbingly than Toynbee and his Nietzschean prose and encyclopaedically varied knowledge rewards his readers with a weird and widened perspective. Like most great thinkers, it is not the bleak conclusions he draws which are …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><figure><p>If you’re here, you’ve likely been tasked with building SAML-based SSO as a requirement for an enterprise deal. If you’re just diving into the problem space of SSO / SAML, we’d first suggest checking out <a href="https://workos.com/blog/the-developers-guide-to-sso">The Developer’s Guide to SSO</a>. Otherwise, buckle up for a brief but titillating foray into why XML-based authentication is... challenging.</p><h2>Why is SAML SSO so vulnerability-prone</h2><p>The attack surface for SAML authentication is extensive, mostly due to the fact that SAML is XML-based. <a href="https://everypageispageone.com/2016/01/28/why-does-xml-suck/">XML is a semantic-free meta-language</a> - it’s hard to form, hard to read, and hard to parse. Combined with the high complexity of the <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-tech-overview-2.0.pdf">SAML specification</a> and the number of parties involved in establishing authentication, we get what often feels like a <a href="http://www.laputan.org/mud/mud.html">big ball of mud</a> and all the accompanying implications. Be prepared to tackle a steep learning curve, lots of bugs, high maintenance costs, attack vectors galore, and an absurd spread of edge cases.</p><p>Most SAML SSO security vulnerabilities are introduced by Service Providers (SPs) improperly validating and processing SAML responses received from Identity Providers (IdPs). This happens because SAML SSO is typically not a core-value feature for an application, nor is the implementation common knowledge for most developers. Unknowns become even more unlikely to be identified and addressed when the pressure is on to just deliver <em>something </em>to unblock a high-value contract - as is oftentimes the case. However, to build SAML SSO safely and securely in-house requires significant buy-in and <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/07/11/single-sign-on-sso-stack-overflow-okta-integration/">investment by teams</a> - on the scale of months, representing hundreds of thousands of dollars in developer time.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>If not done right, you expose your application and your customers to potentially huge security risks. </strong>To drive that home, here are just a few recently published SAML-related vulnerabilities:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15585">January 27, 2020</a> - “... GitLab SAML integration had a validation issue that permitted an attacker to takeover another user's account.”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-4427">May 7, 2020</a> - “... an attacker could exploit this [SAML] vulnerability to bypass the authentication process and gain full administrative access to the system [IBM Data Risk Manager].”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-21263">June 19, 2020</a> - “An attacker could authenticate to a different user's [Mattermost] account via a crafted SAML response.”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-2021">June 29, 2020</a> - “... improper verification of signatures in PAN-OS SAML authentication enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker to access protected resources.”</li></ul><p>It should be evident by now that oversights in SAML implementations are ubiquitous and problematic, even among experienced engineering teams.</p><p>So let’s dive into some of the more common security pitfalls developers building SAML-based SSO should be aware of, as well as cover a few suggested countermeasures. Just to be clear, <strong>this guide is by no means comprehensive</strong> and is meant to provide a starting point for SAML security considerations as well as some follow-on resources.</p><h2>Brief anatomy of a SAML response</h2><p>Let's say we're integrating our application with Okta via SAML. Below is an example of an XML document we might get when attempting to authenticate a user, containing a simplified but valid SAML response:</p><p>Like we mentioned earlier, the SAML spec is complex and responses can get lengthy, so this example is comparatively quite terse. Keeping things to what you should know before we go into SAML vulnerabilities, let’s walk through what the response (<strong><em>&lt;saml2p:Response&gt;</em></strong>) is communicating:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Line 2 begins the SAML response, which has the unique ID <strong><em>id72697176167120131651975993</em></strong> and is intended for consumption by the <strong><em>workos-test</em></strong> service provider’s Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL, i.e. the endpoint <strong><em>https://api.workos-test.com/auth/okta/callback</em></strong>.</li><li>Line 3 specifies the issuer (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Issuer&gt;</em></strong>) and contains the unique URI (also referred to as EntityID) of the IdP that issued the response, in this case <strong><em>http://www.okta.com/exk1klancwHzz1SNi357.</em></strong></li><li>Line 7 begins the assertion (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Assertion&gt;</em></strong>) with the unique ID <strong><em>id7269717616793800631152500</em></strong>. An assertion is a package of information asserting the identity of a user, often containing additional user attributes like first / last name, email, ID, etc.</li><li>Line 8 specifies the issuer of the assertion itself, in this case also <strong><em>http://www.okta.com/exk1klancwHzz1SNi357</em></strong>.</li><li>Lines 9 - 30 contains the digital signature (<strong><em>&lt;ds:Signature&gt;</em></strong>) over the assertion, which should be validated to determine the authenticity of the assertion.</li><li>Lines 31 - 36 specify the subject (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Subject&gt;</em></strong>) of the assertion, i.e. the authenticated principal / user corresponding to the unique identifier found in <strong><em>&lt;saml2:NameID&gt;</em></strong>, who in this case is <strong><em><a href="https://workos.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="86e2e3ebe9c6f1e9f4ede9f5abe9edf2e7a8e5e9eb">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></em></strong>.</li><li>Line 37 (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Conditions&gt;</em></strong>) defines the window of time for which the assertion should considered valid, i.e. from <strong><em>NotBefore</em></strong> (inclusive) to <strong><em>NotOnOrAfter</em></strong> (exclusive).</li></ul><p>For the purposes of readability, the SAML 2.0 XML snippets in the remainder of this blog will be simplified, use shorthand, and be stripped of nodes that would otherwise be required in reality but are not relevant to what’s being illustrated. We’ll use a mythical IssueTracker, ContractManager, and PayrollService as hypothetical SPs that have implemented SAML authentication, which you should think of as placeholders for your application or other SAML SSO-enabled apps.</p><h2>Disable DTD processing</h2><p>The first step in processing a SAML response is parsing the payload. Parsing and loading an XML document into memory is an inherently expensive set of operations, but can be unexpectedly costly due to a feature of XML that allows references to external or remote documents, i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_type_definition">Document Type Definitions</a> (DTDs).</p><p>When a DTD is encountered, parsers will try to fetch and load the referenced document as well. If the referenced document is large enough or results in infinitely looping references, your server can be slowed or even brought down trying to complete the process. The same holds true if the payload itself is very large, DTDs or not.</p><p>Two low-hanging mitigations you should implement to prevent buffer overflows are:<br></p><ol role="list"><li>Limiting SAML payload size to &lt; 1MB. 1MB is a generous upper limit and should be tuned down based on average received payload size.</li><li>Configuring your XML parser to never fetch remote files or try to load and parse DTDs. Some XML parsers do so by default, for example, Python’s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html"><strong><em>xml.etree.ElementTree</em></strong></a> module.</li></ol><p>XML processing, and thus by extension SAML response processing, is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks from other scenarios described later on in this post. And unfortunately, protecting your application from a service outage is among the most mild of outcomes compared to the <a href="https://www.vsecurity.com//download/papers/XMLDTDEntityAttacks.pdf">possibilities exploiting XML DTD</a> allows - it is a dark and anxiety-inducing rabbit hole.</p><p>So, if you’re not writing your own XML parser (generally not suggested), it’s important to <strong>vet the XML parser(s) your application and its dependencies use</strong> - ensure they handle other exploits like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack">Billion Laughs</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb">Zip Bombs</a>.</p><h2>Validate the SAML response schema first<br></h2><p>The primary security mechanism in the SAML handshake is the cryptographic validation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Signature">XML Signatures</a> (XML-DSig) - which establishes the trust chain between IdPs and SPs. XML-DSig validation should always be done prior to executing business logic; however, the separation between signature verification and operating on the rest of a SAML payload opens up SAML authentication to vulnerabilities exposed by what are called XML Signature Wrapping (XSW) attacks. &nbsp;These attacks have numerous permutations which can result in outcomes such as (but not limited to):<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Denial-of-service by inserting arbitrary elements that lead to buffer overflows.</li><li>Escalating permissions by injecting assertions that allow an adversary to impersonate and be authenticated as another user, like an account admin.</li></ul><p>The exploit here consists of modifying the payload without invalidating any signatures - think <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection">SQL Injection</a> or <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/">Cross Site Scripting,</a> but for for XML.</p><p>Original response (pre-XSW):</p><p>Modified response (post-XSW):</p><p>The broadest countermeasure to XSW attacks is <strong>validating the schema</strong> of the SAML XML document. Payloads for SAML responses of any given IdP should have a deterministic standard schema that can be used as a reference in a schema compliance validation module, which should be executed prior to XML-DSig verification. Here are <a href="https://github.com/onelogin/python3-saml/tree/master/src/onelogin/saml2/schemas">example schemas</a> used by OneLogin’s <strong><em>python3-saml</em></strong> package to perform <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/python-saml/library/saml2.html#saml2.utils.OneLogin_Saml2_Utils.validate_xml">XML schema validation</a>. <strong>Schemas should be vetted local copies</strong> as opposed to being fetched from 3rd party remote locations at runtime or on server start.</p><p>All of that being said, <a href="https://www.nds.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/media/nds/veroeffentlichungen/2013/03/25/paper.pdf">schema validation isn’t foolproof</a>; there is room for error in the validation module logic itself, as well as in the syntactic rigor of the reference schema. A second low-hanging countermeasure to XSW attacks that should be employed for the sake of redundancy is to <strong>always use absolute XPath expressions</strong> to select elements in processes post-schema validation. Explicit absolute XPath expressions set an unambiguous expectation for the location of elements.</p><p>Here’s an example of a valid response that’s been modified in an XSW attack (specifically a signature exclusion attack, more on that later):</p><p>This modification also exploits the common, incorrect, but not unreasonable assumption that a well-formed SAML response will only ever have a single assertion. So while XML-DSig verification would succeed for the signature returned by <strong><em>doc.getElementsByTagName(“Signature”)[0]</em></strong>, the assertion returned and processed by <strong><em>doc.getElementsByTagName(“Assertion”)[0]</em></strong> would be the injected <strong><em>snek</em></strong> assertion. This attack would have been more likely to fail if the XPath expression&nbsp;<strong><em>“/Response/Assertion[0]/Signature”</em></strong> was used in the assertion signature validation logic.</p><h2>Check that you’re the intended recipient</h2><p>This sounds obvious, but make sure to check that a SAML response is intended for your app. This is low-hanging fruit that can prevent attacks exploiting IdPs that use a shared private signing key for all integrated SPs of a given tenant, as opposed to issuing unique keys per application. The most common attack entails the …</p></figure></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Today I want to demonstrate a “well-known” Haskell technique among library authors, that I haven’t ever seen written down. It allows you to do all sorts of amazing things, such as: generate lenses for arbitrary data-types without resorting to TemplateHaskell; <code>sequence</code> over data-types; and automatically track dependencies for usages of record fields.</p>
<p>As for this post, we’ll look at how to build type-level sequencing, and investigate some other uses in subsequent ones. For our examples, let’s define the following (completely arbitrary) data-type:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a><span>data</span> <span>Person</span> <span>=</span> <span>Person</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2"></a>  {<span> pName ::</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3"></a>  ,<span> pAge  ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4"></a>  } <span>deriving</span> (<span>Generic</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>That’s cool and all, I guess. For purposes of discussion, let’s imagine that we want to let the user fill in a <code>Person</code> via a web-form or something. Which is to say, it’s possible they’ll screw up filling in some piece of information without necessarily invalidating the rest of the datastructure. If they successfully filled in the entire structure, we’d like to get a <code>Person</code> out.</p>
<p>One way of modeling this would be with a second datatype:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>data</span> <span>MaybePerson</span> <span>=</span> <span>MaybePerson</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a>  {<span> mpName ::</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3"></a>  ,<span> mpAge  ::</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4"></a>  } <span>deriving</span> (<span>Generic</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>and a function:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a><span>validate ::</span> <span>MaybePerson</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Person</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2"></a>validate (<span>MaybePerson</span> name age) <span>=</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3"></a>  <span>Person</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> name <span>&lt;*&gt;</span> age</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This works, but it’s annoying to write by hand, since it’s completely mechanical. Furthermore, having duplicated this effort means we’ll need to use our brains in the future to make sure all three definitions stay in sync. Wouldn’t it be cool if the compiler could help with this?</p>
<p>SURPRISE! IT CAN! And that’s what I want to talk about today.</p>
<p>Notice that we can describe both <code>Person</code> and <code>MaybePerson</code> with the following higher-kinded data (henceforth “<strong>HKD</strong>”) definition:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a><span>data</span> <span>Person'</span> f <span>=</span> <span>Person</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2"></a>  {<span> pName ::</span> f <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3"></a>  ,<span> pAge  ::</span> f <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4"></a>  } <span>deriving</span> (<span>Generic</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here we’ve parameterized <code>Person'</code> over something <code>f</code> (of kind <code>* -&gt; *</code>), which allows us to do the following in order to get our original types back:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a><span>type</span> <span>Person</span>      <span>=</span> <span>Person'</span> <span>Identity</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2"></a><span>type</span> <span>MaybePerson</span> <span>=</span> <span>Person'</span> <span>Maybe</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>While this works, it’s kind of annoying in the <code>Person</code> case, since now all of our data is wrapped up inside of an <code>Identity</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; :t pName @Identity
pName :: Person -&gt; Identity String

&gt; :t runIdentity . pName
runIdentity . pName :: Person -&gt; String</code></pre>
<p>We can fix this annoyance trivially, after which we will look at why defining <code>Person'</code> as such is actually useful. To get rid of the <code>Identity</code>s, we can use a type family (a function at the type-level) that erases them:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1"></a><span>{-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies #-}</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2"></a></span>
<span id="cb7-3"><a href="#cb7-3"></a><span>-- "Higher-Kinded Data"</span></span>
<span id="cb7-4"><a href="#cb7-4"></a><span>type</span> <span>family</span> <span>HKD</span> f a <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb7-5"><a href="#cb7-5"></a>  <span>HKD</span> <span>Identity</span> a <span>=</span> a</span>
<span id="cb7-6"><a href="#cb7-6"></a>  <span>HKD</span> f        a <span>=</span> f a</span>
<span id="cb7-7"><a href="#cb7-7"></a></span>
<span id="cb7-8"><a href="#cb7-8"></a><span>data</span> <span>Person'</span> f <span>=</span> <span>Person</span></span>
<span id="cb7-9"><a href="#cb7-9"></a>  {<span> pName ::</span> <span>HKD</span> f <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb7-10"><a href="#cb7-10"></a>  ,<span> pAge  ::</span> <span>HKD</span> f <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb7-11"><a href="#cb7-11"></a>  } <span>deriving</span> (<span>Generic</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Using the <code>HKD</code> type family means that GHC will automatically erase any <code>Identity</code> wrappers in our representations:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; :t pName @Identity
pName :: Person -&gt; String

&gt; :t pName @Maybe
pName :: Person -&gt; Maybe String</code></pre>
<p>and with that, the higher-kinded version of <code>Person</code> can be used as a drop-in replacement for our original one. The obvious question is what have we bought ourselves with all of this work. Let’s look back at <code>validate</code> to help us answer this question. Compare our old implementation:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1"></a><span>validate ::</span> <span>MaybePerson</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Person</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a href="#cb9-2"></a>validate (<span>MaybePerson</span> name age) <span>=</span></span>
<span id="cb9-3"><a href="#cb9-3"></a>  <span>Person</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> name <span>&lt;*&gt;</span> age</span></code></pre></div>
<p>with how we can now rewrite it with our new machinery:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1"></a><span>validate ::</span> <span>Person'</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Person</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2"><a href="#cb10-2"></a>validate (<span>Person</span> name age) <span>=</span></span>
<span id="cb10-3"><a href="#cb10-3"></a>  <span>Person</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> name <span>&lt;*&gt;</span> age</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Not a very interesting change is it? But the intrigue lies in how little needed to change. As you can see, only our type and pattern match needed to change from our original implementation. What’s neat here is that we have now consolidated <code>Person</code> and <code>MaybePerson</code> into the same representation, and therefore they are no longer related only in a nominal sense.</p>
<p>We can write a version of <code>validate</code> that will work for any higher-kinded datatype.</p>
<p>The secret is to turn to <a href="https://www.stackage.org/haddock/lts-11.0/base-4.10.1.0/GHC-Generics.html"><code>GHC.Generics</code></a>. If you’re unfamiliar with them, they provide an isomorphism from a regular Haskell datatype to a generic representation that can be structurally manipulated by a clever programmer (ie: us.) By providing code for what to do for constant types, products and coproducts, we can get GHC to write type-independent code for us. It’s a really neat technique that will tickle your toes if you haven’t seen it before.</p>
<p>To start with, we need to define a typeclass that will be the workhorse of our transformation. In my experience, this is always the hardest part – the types of these generic-transforming functions are exceptionally abstract and in my opinion, very hard to reason about. I came up with this:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1"></a><span>{-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses #-}</span></span>
<span id="cb11-2"><a href="#cb11-2"></a></span>
<span id="cb11-3"><a href="#cb11-3"></a><span>class</span> <span>GValidate</span> i o <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb11-4"><a href="#cb11-4"></a><span>  gvalidate ::</span> i p <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> (o p)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I only have “soft-and-slow” rules for reasoning about what your typeclass should look like, but in general you’re going to need both an <code>i</code>nput and an <code>o</code>utput parameter. They both need to be of kind <code>* -&gt; *</code> and then be passed this existentialized <code>p</code>, for dark, unholy reasons known not by humankind. I then have a little checklist I walk through to help me wrap my head around this nightmarish hellscape that we’ll walk through in a later installment of the series.</p>
<p>Anyway, with our typeclass in hand, it’s now just a matter of writing out instances of our typeclass for the various GHC.Generic types. We can start with the base case, which is we should be able to validate a <code>Maybe k</code>:</p>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1"><a href="#cb12-1"></a><span>{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances #-}</span></span>
<span id="cb12-2"><a href="#cb12-2"></a><span>{-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators     #-}</span></span>
<span id="cb12-3"><a href="#cb12-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb12-4"><a href="#cb12-4"></a><span>instance</span> <span>GValidate</span> (<span>K1</span> a (<span>Maybe</span> k)) (<span>K1</span> a k) <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb12-5"><a href="#cb12-5"></a>  <span>-- gvalidate :: K1 a (Maybe k) -&gt; Maybe (K1 a k)</span></span>
<span id="cb12-6"><a href="#cb12-6"></a>  gvalidate (<span>K1</span> k) <span>=</span> <span>K1</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> k</span>
<span id="cb12-7"><a href="#cb12-7"></a>  <span>{-# INLINE gvalidate #-}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>K1</code> represents a “constant type”, which is to say that it’s where our structural recursion conks out. In our <code>Person'</code> example, it’s the <code>pName :: HKD f String</code> bit.</p>
<p>Most of the time, once you have the base case in place, the rest is to just mechanically provide instances for the other types. Unless you need to access metadata about the original type anywhere, these instances will almost always be trivial homomorphisms.</p>
<p>We can start with products – if we have <code>GValidate i o</code> and <code>GValidate i' o'</code>, we should be able to run them in parallel:</p>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1"><a href="#cb13-1"></a><span>instance</span> (<span>GValidate</span> i o, <span>GValidate</span> i' o')</span>
<span id="cb13-2"><a href="#cb13-2"></a>    <span>=&gt;</span> <span>GValidate</span> (i <span>:*:</span> i') (o <span>:*:</span> o') <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb13-3"><a href="#cb13-3"></a>  gvalidate (l <span>:*:</span> r) <span>=</span> (<span>:*:</span>)</span>
<span id="cb13-4"><a href="#cb13-4"></a>                    <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> gvalidate l</span>
<span id="cb13-5"><a href="#cb13-5"></a>                    <span>&lt;*&gt;</span> gvalidate r</span>
<span id="cb13-6"><a href="#cb13-6"></a>  <span>{-# INLINE gvalidate #-}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If <code>K1</code> referred directly to the selectors of our <code>Person'</code>, <code>(:*:)</code> corresponds roughly to the <code>,</code> piece of syntax we separate our record fields with.</p>
<p>We can define a similar instance of <code>GValidate</code> for coproducts (corresponding to a <code>|</code> in a data definition):</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1"><a href="#cb14-1"></a><span>instance</span> (<span>GValidate</span> i o, <span>GValidate</span> i' o')</span>
<span id="cb14-2"><a href="#cb14-2"></a>    <span>=&gt;</span> <span>GValidate</span> (i <span>:+:</span> i') (o <span>:+:</span> o') <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb14-3"><a href="#cb14-3"></a>  gvalidate (<span>L1</span> l) <span>=</span> <span>L1</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> gvalidate l</span>
<span id="cb14-4"><a href="#cb14-4"></a>  gvalidate (<span>R1</span> r) <span>=</span> <span>R1</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> gvalidate r</span>
<span id="cb14-5"><a href="#cb14-5"></a>  <span>{-# INLINE gvalidate #-}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Furthermore, if we don’t care about looking at metadata, we can simply lift a <code>GValidate i o</code> over the metadata constructor:</p>
<div id="cb15"><pre><code><span id="cb15-1"><a href="#cb15-1"></a><span>instance</span> <span>GValidate</span> i o</span>
<span id="cb15-2"><a href="#cb15-2"></a>    <span>=&gt;</span> <span>GValidate</span> (<span>M1</span> _a _b i) (<span>M1</span> _a' _b' o) <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb15-3"><a href="#cb15-3"></a>  gvalidate (<span>M1</span> x) <span>=</span> <span>M1</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> gvalidate x</span>
<span id="cb15-4"><a href="#cb15-4"></a>  <span>{-# INLINE gvalidate #-}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Just for kicks, we can provide the following trivial instances, for uninhabited types (<code>V1</code>) and for constructors without any parameters (<code>U1</code>):</p>
<div id="cb16"><pre><code><span id="cb16-1"><a href="#cb16-1"></a><span>instance</span> <span>GValidate</span> <span>V1</span> <span>V1</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb16-2"><a href="#cb16-2"></a>  gvalidate <span>=</span> <span>undefined</span></span>
<span id="cb16-3"><a href="#cb16-3"></a>  <span>{-# INLINE gvalidate #-}</span></span>
<span id="cb16-4"><a href="#cb16-4"></a></span>
<span id="cb16-5"><a href="#cb16-5"></a><span>instance</span> <span>GValidate</span> <span>U1</span> <span>U1</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb16-6"><a href="#cb16-6"></a>  gvalidate <span>U1</span> <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>U1</span></span>
<span id="cb16-7"><a href="#cb16-7"></a>  <span>{-# INLINE gvalidate #-}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The use of <code>undefined</code> here is safe, since it can only be called with a value of <code>V1</code>. Fortunately for us, <code>V1</code> is uninhabited, so this can never happen, and thus we’re morally correct in our usage of <code>undefined</code>.</p>
<p>Without further ado, now that we have all of this machinery out of the way, we can finally write a non-generic version of <code>validate</code>:</p>
<div id="cb17"><pre><code><span id="cb17-1"><a href="#cb17-1"></a><span>{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts #-}</span></span>
<span id="cb17-2"><a href="#cb17-2"></a></span>
<span id="cb17-3"><a href="#cb17-3"></a>validate</span>
<span id="cb17-4"><a href="#cb17-4"></a><span>    ::</span> ( <span>Generic</span> (f <span>Maybe</span>)</span>
<span id="cb17-5"><a href="#cb17-5"></a>       , <span>Generic</span> (f <span>Identity</span>)</span>
<span id="cb17-6"><a href="#cb17-6"></a>       , <span>GValidate</span> (<span>Rep</span> (f <span>Maybe</span>))</span>
<span id="cb17-7"><a href="#cb17-7"></a>                   (<span>Rep</span> (f <span>Identity</span>))</span>
<span id="cb17-8"><a href="#cb17-8"></a>       )</span>
<span id="cb17-9"><a href="#cb17-9"></a>    <span>=&gt;</span> f <span>Maybe</span></span>
<span id="cb17-10"><a href="#cb17-10"></a>    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> (f <span>Identity</span>)</span>
<span id="cb17-11"><a href="#cb17-11"></a>validate <span>=</span> <span>fmap</span> to <span>.</span> gvalidate <span>.</span> from</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I always get a goofy smile when the signature for my function is longer than the actual implementation; it means we’ve hired the compiler to write code for us. What’s neat about <code>validate</code> here is that it doesn’t have any mention of <code>Person'</code>; this function will work for <em>any</em> type defined as higher-kinded data. Spiffy.</p>
<p>That’s all for today, folks. We’ve been introduced to the idea of higher-kinded data, seen how it’s completely equivalent with a datatype defined in a more traditional fashion, and also caught a glimmer of what kind of things are possible with this approach. This is where we stop for today, but in the next post we’ll look at how we can use the HKD approach to generate lenses without resorting to TemplateHaskell.</p>
<p>Happy higher-kinding!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div onclick="clearMenu()"><div><p>Thursday, September
24th,
2020</p><hr><p>Semantic versioning is a surprisingly interesting topic when you get into it. Recently, myself and a few colleagues (<a href="http://patricklam.ca/">Patrick</a> &amp; <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jensdietrich/">Jens</a>) have been giving it some thought (and we even wrote an <a href="https://whileydave.com/publications/ldp20/">essay on it</a>)! If you haven’t seen it already, check out the <a href="https://semver.org/">manifesto for semantic versioning</a>. Whilst that provides a nice overview, there is a lot left unsaid. There are two different perspectives on semantic versioning:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Downstream</strong>. This is perhaps the more obvious scenario. Downstream developers (clients) want access to the library features offered by (upstream) developers! They also want both <em>stability</em> and <em>protection</em>. That is, they don’t want future releases of a library to break their code but (ideally) they want to get future releases automatically (e.g. for critical security updates).</p></li><li><p><strong>Upstream</strong>. On the flip-side, upstream (library) developers want <em>flexibility</em> to continue improving their libraries with new features, refactorings, etc. They also want to fix bugs and security vulnerabilities as and when they arise.</p></li></ol><p>In some sense, semantic versioning is just a communication mechanism between upstream and downstream developers. Now, a three point version number is (at best) a low fidelity communication channel. <em>But, this post is not about that</em>. Rather, it is about figuring out how to make the most of semantic versioning as it is.</p><h3 id="economics">Economics</h3><p>An important aspect of semantic versioning is <em>trust</em>. Downstream developers must trust upstream developers not to break the protocol (e.g. by putting out minor releases with breaking changes). When trust is lost, clients become hesitant to upgrade and the <em>lag</em> between a new release and the client upgrading increases. This makes sense as clients balance the costs of upgrading against their benefits. For example, if upgrading requires only a few minor tweaks to your code base, but offers important security patches then it seems worth it. But, when upgrading requires significant changes to your code (e.g. because library developer decided randomly to refactor the API) and the only benefit is some features you don’t need — it doesn’t.</p><p><em>We can view all this through the lens of economic theory and treat it as a market system</em>. Then, trustworthy upstream developers should succeed where others fail, etc. This seems like that’s it all sorted out! But, the reality is different as, unfortunately, mistakes are made all the time by developers we think should be trustworthy (see examples below). The problem is that the system is not yet efficient because:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Downstream developers</strong> have real difficulties determining what the costs and benefits are.</p></li><li><p><strong>Upstream developers</strong> cannot easily tell when they inadvertently make breaking changes (more on this below).</p></li></ol><p><em>In thinking about this, we’re interested in what techniques could be brought to bear on this to make the market system more efficient.</em></p><h3 id="breaking-changes">Breaking Changes</h3><p>An important question here is: <em>what are “breaking changes” anyway?</em> Knowing this is somehow key to a smoothly functioning system. Some thoughts:</p><ul><li><p><em>Should a change of license be considered a breaking change?</em></p></li><li><p><em>Should a bug-fix which changes an implementation’s behaviour be considered a breaking change?</em></p></li><li><p><em>Should a change which degrades system performance be considered breaking?</em></p></li><li><p><em>Should a change to the contract of a method be considered breaking?</em></p></li><li><p><em>Should a change in the <em>purity</em> of a method be considered breaking?</em></p></li><li><p><em>Should a change in the order of elements returned by a method be considered breaking?</em></p></li></ul><p>Most of these could be considered breaking changes in certain
situations (i.e. depending on the client):</p><p><strong>Exhibit A.</strong> Firefox (downstream developer) uses
<a href="http://fontconfig.org/">fontconfig</a> (upstream developer). A
<a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/fontconfig/commit/?id=95af7447dba7c54ed162b667c0bb2ea6500e8f32">commit</a>
to fontconfig <code>v2.10.92</code> meant it now rejected empty filenames. It’s
documentation didn’t say whether empty filenames were allowed or not,
<em>so this was reasonable right?</em> Well, it <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=857922">broke
Firefox</a>.</p><p><strong>Exhibit B.</strong> <a href="https://jsoup.org/">JSoup</a> <code>v1.10.1</code> included a
performance refactoring for “<em>reducing memory allocation and garbage
collection</em>”. Again, this seemed reasonable but clients quickly
started <a href="https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/830">reporting problems</a>.</p><p>These are just some examples and you can easily find more with a
little digging. The point is that upstream developers miss (or
ignore) changes affecting downstream clients all the time. <em>So, what
can we do?</em></p><h3 id="tooling">Tooling</h3><p><a href="https://revapi.org/">RevAPI</a> provides food-for-thought here. If you haven’t come across it before, this tool compares two versions of a Jar file and identifies certain kinds of breaking change. Examples of breaking changes include: reducing the visibility of a method; removing a <code>public</code> declaration; or, modifying a <code>public</code> class so that it no longer implements some interface. <em>This is actually awesome!</em> <em>People should use this stuff all the time!</em></p><p>Our interest here is not what the tool thinks <em>are</em> breaking changes, but what it <em>doesn’t</em>. For example, when a method no longer accepts <code>null</code> for some parameter, or moves from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">linear to quadratic time</a>, or returns the elements of an array in a different order, etc. Ok, we have to be reasonable — one tool cannot do everything and these are <em>hard</em> problems. Still, RevAPI offers a glimmer of hope that semantics versioning could be much more than it currently is. And, there are others:
<a href="https://medium.com/@Max_Goldstein/how-to-publish-an-elm-package-3053b771e545">Elm Bump</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rust-dev-tools/rust-semverver">rust-semverver</a>, and <a href="http://clirr.sourceforge.net/">clirr</a> to name a few.</p><p><em>So, there should be tools, and lots of 'em!</em> Both upstream <em>and</em> downstream developers should be using them to spot inadvertent breaking changes, or to gauge the cost of upgrades. Whilst current tools are fairly shallow in their assessment of breaking changes, there is a wealth of techniques from fields like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis">static analysis</a> and automated testing which could be used here.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>Well, that’s enough for now!! If you made it this far, then you should check out our <a href="https://whileydave.com/publications/ldp20/">essay</a> which goes into way more detail.</p><p>And finally, just to get you thinking, here’s a cool idea for upstream
developers: <strong>know your dependencies!</strong> These days, its easy to find
your downstream clients. Before releasing a new version, just check
for breaking changes by <em>running all your clients’ tests!</em> That’s
exactly what <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/crater">Crater does for
Rust</a> and also what <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3379597.3387476">these
folks</a> and
<a href="https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2018/9239/">these folks</a>
are suggesting.</p><h3 id="related-articles">Related Articles</h3><p>Here are a few related articles on semantic versioning which are definitely worth a read!</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://gist.github.com/jashkenas/cbd2b088e20279ae2c8e">Why Semantic Versioning Isn’t</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/12/16/semantic-versioning">Semantic Versioning Sucks!

      <p id="5c4b93f6-b8cc-45d4-ba88-1d69f70d789e">Here I highlighted some key elements of the argument table. Notice that there are quotes around some of the arguments. That means, that they will be wrapped with quotes in the output. Notice That <code>nargs</code> don't have quotes, so I have to insert them manually. That is because sometimes you want to use something like <code>argparse.REMAINDER</code> or some other variables.</p>
      <p id="0ca4dfec-cc78-4545-bcc7-aa4c99620743">You can also choose actions and it changes some of the properties in the table. For example, I want the second argument to be binary, so I choose <code>store_true</code> from the dropdown menu.</p>

      <p id="b9f1f916-2b1b-4a04-81a8-6e267cbffec6">I highly suggest remembering the keywords <em>"argparse builder"</em> and just google it next time you need to add argparse interface to your script, it should be first result in google.</p>

  </figure><p>Our team evaluated several options, and wound up pursuing a pragmatic approach which we were able to implement for our entire application in less than six weeks. We are excited to share some details for others who might be thinking through similar decisions.</p><h2>State of the Art</h2><p>There are two dominant approaches to multi-user collaboration today: <strong>Operational Transforms</strong> and <strong>Conflict-free Replicated Data Types</strong>. Both are powerful, although they come with trade-offs that make implementation challenging, particularly for smaller teams like ours. There is also a lesser-known hybrid approach—originally pioneered by Figma—geared towards ease of implementation.</p><h3>Operational Transforms</h3><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Operational Transforms</a> (OT) has been around for years. This technology is famously used to back Google Docs, and there are a number of reference implementations available on the web.</p><div><div><p><strong>The basic idea of OT</strong> is to decompose all state mutations to specific operations.</p><p>As an example, let's say we want two editors to simultaneously edit the string <code>ello</code>. Editor 1 sends an operation that inserts <code>!</code> at position 4 (or <code>[!, 4]</code> for short) and Editor 2 sends another operation that inserts <code>H</code> at position 0 (or <code>[H, 0]</code>).</p><p>If received in this order, a client can process these operations as they are and get the desired text <code>Hello!</code>. However, if a client were to receive <code>[H, 0]</code> first and <code>[!, 4]</code> second, the resulting string would be the incorrect <code>Hell!o</code>. OT implementations need to account for this, and implement a transformation to correct or "transform" the second operation to <code>[!, 5]</code> in order to preserve the user's intent and get <code>Hello!</code>.</p></div></div><p>In order to properly broker operations between clients, OT requires a centralized server, which may not be acceptable for all use cases.</p><p>OT offers a lot of control to the developer over how user actions are de-conflicted, making it easy to preserve user intent and context.</p><p>The "transform" part, however, can be quite tricky and error-prone since an implementor needs to account for each pair of operations. The number of possible combinations grows quadratically with the number of operations, meaning even with extensive testing it's possible to miss an edge case. This combinatorial complexity means an application gets harder and harder to reason about over time. <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></p><h3>Conflict-free Replicated Data Types</h3><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Conflict-free Replicated Data Types</a> (CRDTs) are a newer alternative that sidesteps much of the complexity that burdens OT.</p><div><div><p><strong>The basic idea of CRDT</strong> is to use data structures that are inherently (you guessed it) conflict-free.</p><p>There are <a href="https://github.com/pfrazee/crdt_notes/tree/68c5fe81ade109446a9f4c24e03290ec5493031f#portfolio-of-basic-crdts" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">several different CRDTs</a>, each with their own implementation details. An example CRDT is a <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/java-conflict-free-replicated-data-types#grow-only-set" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Grow Only Set</a>, which can only have elements added to it, but never removed. Conflicts are avoided since it is impossible to add/remove an item at the same time.</p><p>A multiplayer application can compose different types of CRDTs to create more complex structures for modeling its state.</p></div></div><p>CRDTs avoid the combinatorial complexity that comes along with OT, and also enable direct client-to-client communication, removing the need for a central server. Despite these advantages, they still have major trade-offs.</p><p>While CRDTs are correct from a mathematical standpoint, they might not have the correct semantics for a specific application. For example, the result of a state mutation is always consistent, but it may not be exactly what was expected since it's possible to lose user intent. <sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup></p><p>CRDTs also trade off the complexity of resolving conflicts for a more challenging initial implementation, due to their reliance on algorithms like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_clock" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">vector clocks</a>. They also incur a fair amount of storage overhead—while there is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7drE24geUw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3198" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">progress being made</a>, avoiding this problem requires foresight and cleverness. And since CRDTs are newer, there are fewer reference implementations. <sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup></p><h3>Figma's Hybrid Approach</h3><p>While at first we considered OT and CRDTs as our two main options, we were intrigued by <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the pragmatic approach taken by Figma</a>. They borrowed some ideas from CRDTs, like a <a href="https://github.com/pfrazee/crdt_notes/tree/68c5fe81ade109446a9f4c24e03290ec5493031f#last-writer-wins-register-lww-register" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">last-writer-wins data register</a>. Instead of using vector clocks to provide an ordering guarantee, however, they used a central authority, similar to OT.</p><p>By using the best parts of both OT and CRDTs, Figma avoided challenges with de-conflicting operations and difficulty of implementation. The main trade-off is that certain functionality, such as multi-user editable text strings, is not easily supported.</p><p>Figma's hybrid technique resonated with us as being both practical and elegant, although it was surprising that we couldn't find examples of others pursuing a similar approach. <sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup></p><p>

<figcaption>From Figma's Blog Post</figcaption></p><h2>Choosing a Path</h2><p>As we assessed our options, we weighed a few key factors:</p><h3>Taking it step by step</h3><p>It was important to us that our solution was <a href="https://hex.tech/blog/incremental-shipping" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">shippable incrementally</a> and completable within a reasonable time frame. Any solution that required rewriting significant parts of our code base all at once, or a "big bang" cutover, would have not been acceptable.</p><h3>Our current stack</h3><p>Some existing multiplayer frameworks, such as <a href="https://github.com/share/sharedb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ShareDB</a>, require storing the model in a specific format and shape, or that the frontend connects to the model in a particular way.</p><p>We wanted to avoid major changes like this. An ideal solution would need to work well with our current tools, including:</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Apollo + GraphQL</a> to build an API schema shared by our frontend and backend services</li>
<li><a href="https://graphql-code-generator.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GraphQL Code Generator</a> and Typescript to ensure type safety across the entire stack</li>
<li><a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Apollo Client</a> on the frontend to store requested data in a normalized object cache that allows React to intelligently subscribe to changes</li>
<li>PostgreSQL and relational database patterns/features like normalization, constraints, and transactions to help guarantee data consistency and correctness</li>
</ul><p>This stack strikes a good balance between feature velocity and stability, and we wanted to build on top of it—not replace it.</p><h3>Controlling our destiny</h3><p>As we considered these approaches, we evaluated a number of open source libraries. We're generally enthusiastic about adopting and contributing to OSS, and originally thought to do so here.</p><p>While there are some great projects out there, like <a href="https://github.com/automerge/automerge" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Automerge</a> and <a href="https://github.com/yjs/yjs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Y.js</a>, it can be risky to outsource something as core as our application state. Even really promising projects can lose momentum: <a href="https://github.com/Operational-Transformation/ot.js/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ot.js</a>, for example, is an Operational Transform library with over 1.2k stars on Github, but is no longer under active development and is looking for a maintainer.</p><h2>Atomic Operations</h2><p>After considering our options, we pursued an approach inspired by Figma's hybrid solution. We call it <strong>Atomic Operations (AO),</strong> as all edits to application state are broken down to their smallest <em>atomic</em> parts.</p><p>For us, this technique struck the right balance between ease of implementation, compatibility with our stack, and control over the application foundations.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><h3>Splitting the Atom</h3><p>AO mutations exist at the single property update level, such that <strong>two operations of different types cannot conflict with each other.</strong></p><p>It is, however, still possible for two operations of the <em>same type</em> to conflict. This is determined by an operation's <code>conflictId</code>, which is a concatenation of its type and the ID of the object being edited. <sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup> Since we use last-writer-wins semantics, we don't merge conflicts, we just pick a winner.</p><p>For determining which operation is "last", the server keeps track of a monotonically increasing counter per object that increments with each write. Upon acknowledging an operation, the server includes the latest value of this counter. To determine which operation is a winner, the client simply chooses the operation with the higher value. A central authority is required to implement this monotonic counter, prohibiting any distributed implementations.</p><p>As an example, take a hypothetical object type "foobar":</p><div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>interface</span> <span>Foobar</span> <span>{</span>
  id<span>:</span> <span>string</span>
  name<span>:</span> <span>string</span>
  color<span>:</span> <span>string</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>Here are some examples of atomic operations for creating and editing a foobar:</p><div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>type</span><span>:</span> <span>"CREATE_FOOBAR"</span><span>,</span>
  conflictId<span>:</span> <span>"CREATE_FOOBAR-123ABC"</span><span>,</span>
  payload<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    id<span>:</span> <span>"123ABC"</span><span>,</span>
    name<span>:</span> <span>"My new foobar"</span><span>,</span>
    color<span>:</span> <span>"#DE1738"</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>{</span>
  <span>type</span><span>:</span> <span>"SET_FOOBAR_COLOR"</span><span>,</span>
  conflictId<span>:</span> <span>"SET_FOOBAR_COLOR-123ABC"</span><span>,</span>
  creationId<span>:</span> <span>"CREATE_FOOBAR-123ABC"</span><span>,</span>
  payload<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    id<span>:</span> <span>"123ABC"</span><span>,</span>
    newColor<span>:</span> <span>"#0B6623"</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>Again: by breaking down all edits to a foobar object to changing individual properties, we remove the need to worry about how different operations might merge—<strong>at this level of granularity, only one write <em>can</em> win.</strong></p><p>A nice benefit of this decomposition is that all mutations to state are described by plain objects. A keen eye might note some parallels with how <a href="https://redux.js.org/basics/actions" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Redux defines actions</a>, and indeed AO similarly benefits from making state mutations predictable, transparent, and easily testable.</p><p>Finally, we implemented undo / redo by requiring all atomic operation to include an additional operation that can undo the change. As an example:</p><div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>type</span><span>:</span> <span>"SET_FOOBAR_NAME"</span><span>,</span>
  conflictId<span>:</span> <span>"SET_FOOBAR_NAME-123ABC"</span><span>,</span>
  creationId<span>:</span> <span>"CREATE_FOOBAR-123ABC"</span><span>,</span>
  payload<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    id<span>:</span> <span>"123ABC"</span><span>,</span>
    newName<span>:</span> <span>"My slightly less new foobar"</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  undo<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>type</span><span>:</span> <span>"SET_FOOBAR_NAME"</span><span>,</span>
    conflictId<span>:</span> <span>"SET_FOOBAR_NAME-123ABC"</span><span>,</span>
    creationId<span>:</span> <span>"CREATE_FOOBAR-123ABC"</span><span>,</span>
    payload<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      id<span>:</span> <span>"123ABC"</span><span>,</span>
      newName<span>:</span> <span>"My new foobar"</span> 
    <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><h3>Getting fractional</h3><p>A drawback of AO is that certain types of mutations can be difficult to express as simple last-writer-wins operations.</p><p>One such case is ordered collections. With classic integer indexing of a collection, …</p></div></div></div>

          networks</a>. NSL provides a simulation environment simplifying the 
          task of modeling neural networks. In particular, NSL supports neural 
          models having as basic data structure neural layers with similar properties 
          and similar connection patterns, where neurons are modeled as leaky 
          integrators with connections subject to diverse learning rules. Development 
          of NSL has gone hand in hand with modeling of neural mechanisms underlying 
          visuomotor coordination, with special emphasis on the analysis of data 
          from anurans, monkeys, and humans. NSL follows an object-oriented design, 
          providing higher level programming abstraction corresponding to neural 
          elements. NSL provides system development tools, such as visualization 
          capabilities and a run-time interpreter, which give the user powerful 
          tools in developing and analyzing models. NSL has been widely used throughout 
          the world for both teaching and research. </span></p>
        <p><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Current development 
          goals of NSL are to link between the multiple levels of neural modeling 
          and express the fact that neural networks can themselves be interconnected 
          in a hierarchical way, creating higher level assemblages, such as those

        <p>Moonshot Papers</p>
        
	<p>2020-10-01</p>

<p>I wrote four papers on fundamental questions in math and science.</p>

<p>Original ideas on these topics are usually wrong,
but hope springs eternal.</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="#quantum">Quantum Mechanics</a></li>
<li><a href="#negation">Negation</a></li>
<li><a href="#diagonal">Diagonal Arguments</a></li>
<li><a href="#halting">The Halting Problem</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Do the laws of physics affect big and small things differently?</p>

<p><em>A Deterministic Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics</em>,
<a href="https://davidwyde.com/docs/wyde-quantum.pdf">4 pages</a>.</p>

<p>Quantum mechanics describes particles with wave-like behavior,
entangled particles whose measurements are correlated, and other phenomena that
are hard to explain with ideas developed before 1900.</p>

<p>Different interpretations of quantum mechanics make the same real-world predictions but tell divergent stories about why and how things happen.
Bohm’s interpretation handles the wave-particle duality well, but its explanation of entanglement
is incompatible with relativity.</p>

<p>A modified version of Bohm’s interpretation can explain entanglement as a past
interaction between two independent particles. This new theory is deterministic and resolves paradoxes such as Schrödinger’s cat and Wigner’s friend.</p>


<p>What is the opposite of a self-referential sentence?</p>

<p><em>Two Ways to Negate Self-Referential Sentences</em>, <a href="https://davidwyde.com/docs/wyde-negation.pdf">2 pages</a>.</p>

<p>One form of the liar paradox is “this sentence is false.”
Trying to evaluate this paradoxical statement leads to a type of infinite loop: if it is true it must be false, and if it is false it must be true.</p>

<p>Kurt Gödel’s incompleteness theorems are based on an undecidable sentence, roughly
“this statement is not provable.” As in the liar paradox, neither that sentence nor its negation is provable.</p>

<p>One way to bypass the liar paradox and Gödel’s incompleteness theorems is to have the negation
of a self-referential sentence refer to the new sentence (itself) rather than to the original statement.</p>

<p>With this approach, the negation of the liar sentence is “this sentence is true”, which resolves
the paradox. A similar analysis applies to Gödel’s undecidable sentence.</p>


<p>What do we learn when we try to list the elements of an infinite set?</p>

<p><em>Diagonal Arguments and Infinite Sets</em>, <a href="https://davidwyde.com/docs/wyde-diagonal.pdf">2 pages</a>.</p>

<p>A diagonal argument is a proof technique that creates a contradiction by attempting to list every element of an infinite set.</p>

<p>Georg Cantor used a diagonal argument to prove that the infinite set of real numbers is larger than
the infinite set of natural numbers. Alonzo Church used a similar proof to show that some
algorithms are impossible to implement.</p>

<p>I think Cantor’s and Church’s diagonal arguments prove only that it is
impossible to list every element of an infinite set. In each case, the argument should
end before the final step that proves the intended result.</p>


<p>Are there problems that no computer can solve?</p>

<p><em>The Halting Problem: Proofs and Demos</em>, <a href="https://davidwyde.com/docs/wyde-halting.pdf">7 pages</a>.</p>

<p>A program <code>halts(f)</code> determines if a function <code>f</code> terminates or runs
forever. <code>halts</code> must handle three cases: 1) <code>f</code> halts, 2) <code>f</code> doesn’t halt, and 3)
<code>f</code> halts if and only if a call to <code>halts(f)</code> returns false. Given these
three types of input, <code>halts</code> returns a Boolean: true if <code>f</code> halts and false
if <code>f</code> runs forever.</p>

<p>Computer science theory says that case 3) programs are contradictions that
show <code>halts</code> cannot exist. I argue that all three cases are valid, but it is
unclear how to categorize three types of programs into a true or false output
without grouping two cases together.</p>

<p>After writing this paper, I saw that <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hehner/halting.html">Eric Hehner</a> came to similar conclusions. My main contributions are to simplify the problem to 3 inputs being mapped
  to 2 outputs, analyze Alan Turing’s 1954 paper in addition to his 1936 one, and provide Python sample code.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemprop="articleBody">
      <p><a href="https://github.com/blitz-js/superjson">SuperJSON</a> is a high-fidelity replacement to <code>JSON.stringify</code>.
It supports data types like <code>Date</code>, <code>RegExp</code>, <code>Map</code>, <code>Set</code> etc., preserves referential equality and supports circular references.
This blog post aims to compare it to alternatives and explain how it works.</p>

<!--more-->

<h3 id="whats-the-problem">What’s the Problem?</h3>

<p>JSON is the defacto standard data interchange format for web applications.
It’s human-readable, has broad tooling support and its choice on data types are compatible with most platforms.</p>

<p>As usage of JavaScript across backend and frontend became more popular, one of its value propositions have been let down by JSON: It doesn’t support data types like <code>Date</code>, <code>RegExp</code>, <code>Map</code> or <code>Set</code>, forcing developers to write cumbersome adapter logic to work around these limitations.</p>

<p>This problem became especially apparent while working on <a href="https://blitzjs.com/">Blitz.js</a>.
Blitz.js is a fullstack React framework that (amongst other things) generates your applications’ API layer at compile time.
It thus allows developers to import backend functions straight from the frontend, completely abstracting away network calls.
Here’s the problem: If we used <code>JSON.stringify</code>, our developers would be surprised because it destroyed their nice data types!
That’s where SuperJSON comes into play: It’s able to serialize any JavaScript value and thus saves our developers from quite some headache.</p>

<h2 id="other-ways-to-solve-this">Other ways to solve this</h2>

<p>SuperJSON is not the first contender, other approaches that solve this problem have existed.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Rich-Harris/devalue">devalue</a> by Rich Harris is an algorithm that encodes value into JavaScript code that creates it - it turns <code>{ foo: "bar", self: this }</code> into <code>(function(a){a.foo="bar";a.self=a;return a}({}))</code>, which can then be evaluated to get back the original value.
While it’s incredibly efficient<sup id="fnref:benchmark" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:benchmark">1</a></sup>, there isn’t any tooling support for it, and it also can’t be used to send data to the server -
what if a malicious client sent <code>while (true) { /* do nothing */ }</code>?</p>

<p>A similar approach is taken by Yahoo’s <a href="https://github.com/yahoo/serialize-javascript">Serialize JavaScript</a>, but it suffers from the same problems.</p>

<h2 id="goals-of-superjson">Goals of SuperJSON</h2>

<p>Contrary the approaches mentioned above, SuperJSON aims to …</p>

<ul>
  <li>… support any JavaScript value</li>
  <li>… be safe from remote code execution</li>
  <li>… be JSON-compatible, so existing tooling can be leveraged</li>
  <li>… support circular references</li>
  <li>… preserve referential equalities</li>
  <li>… be human-readable, so it’s easy to debug</li>
  <li>… be easy-to-understand, even if you don’t know it’s SuperJSON</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-does-superjson-solve-it">How does SuperJSON solve it?</h2>

<p>There are two parts to what we’re trying to achieve. We need to …</p>

<ol>
  <li>… transform any JavaScript value into a JSON-compatible one</li>
  <li>… be able to reverse it!</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="transforming-into-a-json-compatible-value">Transforming into a JSON-compatible value</h3>

<p>Transforming is quite easy, actually:
For already compatible ones, it’s trivial: <code>42</code> becomes <code>42</code>, <code>"lol"</code> becomes <code>"lol"</code>, <code>true</code> becomes <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> becomes <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>It’s a bit harder for values where there is no JSON counterpart: <code>Set { "foo", "bar" }</code> becomes <code>["foo", "bar"]</code>, <code>Map { 1 =&gt; 11, 2 =&gt; 22 }</code> becomes <code>[ [1, 11], [2, 22] ]</code> and <code>NaN</code> becomes <code>"NaN"</code>.</p>

<p>So given this value …</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span>
    <span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>new</span> <span>Set</span><span>([</span> <span>/a-Z/g</span> <span>]),</span>
    <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>new</span> <span>Map</span><span>([</span>
        <span>[</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>NaN</span> <span>],</span>
        <span>[</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>NaN</span> <span>]</span>
    <span>])</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>… we’ll create this json:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"a"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"/a-Z/g"</span><span>],</span><span>
    </span><span>"b"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>
        </span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"NaN"</span><span>],</span><span>
        </span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"NaN"</span><span>]</span><span>
    </span><span>]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Easy, right? This can done recursively and fits into a couple of lines of code.</p>

<p>But we won’t be able to reverse this, right? Unless … we just take notes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"a"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"set"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"a.0"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"RegExp"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"b"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"map"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"b.0.1"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"number"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"b.1.1"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"number"</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This contains notes on any non-trivial transformations.<sup id="fnref:notes-confession" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:notes-confession">2</a></sup></p>

<p>We can then safely send both our JSON-ified value and the notes over the network.
During deserialization, we then apply the notes to recreate the original value:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>value</span><span>[</span><span>"</span><span>b</span><span>"</span><span>][</span><span>1</span><span>][</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>Number</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>[</span><span>"</span><span>b</span><span>"</span><span>][</span><span>1</span><span>][</span><span>1</span><span>])</span>
<span>value</span><span>[</span><span>"</span><span>b</span><span>"</span><span>][</span><span>0</span><span>][</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>Number</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>[</span><span>"</span><span>b</span><span>"</span><span>][</span><span>0</span><span>][</span><span>1</span><span>])</span>
<span>value</span><span>[</span><span>"</span><span>b</span><span>"</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Map</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>[</span><span>"</span><span>b</span><span>"</span><span>])</span>
<span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Not so hard, right? Now that we can preserve types, let’s see how to preserve referential equalitites.</p>

<h3 id="preserving-referential-equalities">Preserving Referential Equalities</h3>

<p>Imagine the object that’s created by the following code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>a</span><span>"</span> <span>}</span>
<span>const</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>b</span><span>"</span> <span>}</span>

<span>{</span> <span>options</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>],</span> <span>selected</span><span>:</span> <span>a</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As stated in the <a href="#goals-of-superjson">Goals</a>, we want to preserve the fact that <code>options[0] === selected</code>.
This can be done by not only taking notes on types to recreate, but also on referential equality.
For the value above, SuperJSON takes the following notes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"selected"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"options.0"</span><span>]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can then use these notes during deserialization like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>value</span><span>[</span><span>"</span><span>options</span><span>"</span><span>][</span><span>"</span><span>0</span><span>"</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>value</span><span>[</span><span>"</span><span>selected</span><span>"</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This feature can also be used to preserve circular references.</p>

<h2 id="go-use-it">Go use it!</h2>

<p>SuperJSON is currently in beta, it should be ready for you to use in your own projects:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>npm install --save superjson
yarn add superjson
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>SuperJSON</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>superjson</span><span>"</span>

<span>const</span> <span>string</span> <span>=</span> <span>SuperJSON</span><span>.</span><span>stringify</span><span>(</span><span>yourValue</span><span>)</span>
<span>const</span> <span>profit</span> <span>=</span> <span>SuperJSON</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>string</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’re currently testing support for preserving <code>class</code> and <code>Symbol</code> instances, we’ll also work on making SuperJSON faster and smaller.</p>

<p>I’d love to hear what you think of it! Tweet at me: <a href="https://twitter.com/skn0tt">@skn0tt</a> or write a comment below.</p>

									Welcome to the second interview on 'The Observer Effect'. We are lucky to have one
									of the most influential founders/CEOs in technology and media - Daniel Ek, Founder
									and CEO of Spotify. This interview was published on 4th October, 2020.

							</em></p><p><em>Daniel does things very differently from other business leaders and was generous to go
								deep with us on his leadership style, time management, decision making, Spotify's impact
								on the world and much, much more. Enjoy!
								</em>
							</p><p><b><a href="https://sriramk.com/">Sriram Krishnan</a></b><br>
								<em><strong>Let’s start with the basics. Walk me through a typical day in the life of
										Daniel Ek.</strong></em>
							</p><p><strong>Daniel Ek</strong><br>
								So, this will sound incredibly lazy compared to some leaders. I wake up at around 6:30
								in the morning and spend some time with my kids and wife. At 7:30, I go work out. At
								8:30, I go for a walk – even in the winter. I’ve found this is often where I do my best
								thinking. At 9:30, I read for thirty minutes to an hour. Sometimes I read the news, but
								you’ll also find an ever-rotating stack of books in my office, next to my bed, on tables
								around the house. Books on history, leadership, biographies. It’s a pretty eclectic mix
								– much like my taste in music. Finally, my “work” day really starts at 10:30.
							</p><p>
								Many people make big decisions early on in the day, I make them later in the day--at
								least later in the day here in Europe. Ironically, it's not actually because I'm more
								productive then, rather because we have so many of our staff in the US, and as a result,
								I've kind of primed myself to work that way.
							</p><p>
								So the earlier part of my day is focused on coaching, one-on-ones, and planning. Then, I
								typically tackle one topic a day which takes a lot of my time. That's my big thing for
								the day. Before we go into a live team discussion on that particular topic, I invest
								time to prepare beforehand – reading and talking to members of the team who are either
								part of the decision-making process or who have insights and context. I sometimes even
								get external perspectives.
							</p><p>
								I also think about what my role is at that meeting. Sometimes I'm the approver. Other
								times, I'm supposed to come with a thoughtful perspective on whether an initiative makes
								sense or not.
							</p><p>
								I’ve found that creating this clarity of role for myself is critical. It’s something I
								challenge my direct reports to think about as they engage with their own teams. I remind
								them that all meetings are not the same. Even when we are meeting to discuss really,
								really complicated topics I always ask myself: “What am I going to do in this meeting?
								What does my involvement really need to be?”
							</p><p>
								The truth is: it's entirely contextual. I find it crucial to be upfront about everyone’s
								role in different meetings, I think this is super, super important. Often that's my
								number one thing: to make sure I know what role I'm playing.</p><p>
								<b><i>Wow, okay, there are multiple things in there ranging from how you choose to spend
										your time to how you handle meetings. To work backwards, what makes a good
										meeting in your mind?
									</i></b></p><p>A great meeting has three key elements: the desired outcome of the meeting is clear ahead
								of time; the various options are clear, ideally ahead of time; and the roles of the
								participants are clear at the time.
							</p><p>
								I often find that meetings lack one of those elements. Sometimes they lack all those,
								which is when you have to say, “This is a horrible meeting, let's end it and regroup so
								it can be more effective for everyone.”
							</p><p>
								To clarify outcomes, options, and roles ahead of time, we sometimes rely upon a preread.
								Prereads are a great way to share context so that attendees can quickly get into the
								meat of the issue and not waste time getting everyone up to speed. What I find is when
								you use a tool like a Google Doc, you can take in a great deal of information by reading
								comments, assessing options, and understanding how opinions have evolved over time. With
								this uniform background and context, attendees can focus on discussing the matter at
								hand versus getting on the same page. When the latter happens, the meeting becomes an
								incredible waste of time.
							</p><p>
								I think that's the single largest source of optimization for a company: the makeup of
								their meetings. To be clear, it's not about fewer meetings because meetings serve a
								purpose. Rather, it’s key to improve the meetings, themselves. A lot of my efforts focus
								on teaching people this framework. Ironically, I find that most people are just
								challenged by that stuff.
							</p><p>
								Candidly, that’s my role as leader: to coach others on how best to make use of their
								limited time. Not only is time the most precious resource the company has, it’s also the
								most precious resource they have! It’s crucial that they approach the use of their time
								with a holistic perspective. By way of example, I had a recent call with one of my
								directors who had not taken a vacation in six months. Our conversation delved into why
								this person thought that they could not be away for two weeks, and me arguing for why
								the person had to take two weeks to recharge!
							</p><p>
								There is never enough time – for work, for family and friends – and it takes work to
								make the best use of it. It's all about fostering a holistic perspective in life.

							</p><p>
								<b><i>
										That’s fascinating. Let’s turn to your team.

										Your direct reports are highly accomplished people; what are the common mistakes
										you see executives at that level make when it comes to personal time management?
									</i>
							</b></p><div>
							<div><p>
								I don’t think most executives dedicate enough time to thinking. They spend too much time
								in meetings. By the way, I will say as a caveat, I do know people who are incredibly
								organized and succeed with a lot of “do time.” Shishir Mehrotra [Co-founder and CEO of
								Coda] is a great example. If you've seen the docs on how he organizes his time...
								</p><p>

								<b><i>Oh yeah, he has a lot of very well-organized docs! [laughs]</i></b></p></div><p>
								He is a source of inspiration. For a while, I tried to mimic his style because I was so
								impressed with his thinking behind it. But in the end, it just wasn’t for me. It
								actually drove me nuts. <i>[Sriram laughs]</i>
								But I respect him. I would say he's a highly effective executive. His system works for
								him. It's not one size fits all. Some of my direct reports thrive on lots of meetings.
								But, in general, I would say the largest mistake is that they conflate meetings with
								productivity. Often fewer meetings and better decisions drive the business forward.

							</p>
							<h2 id="opencalendar"><b>On Creating an Open Calendar</b></h2>
							<p>


								<b><i>This dovetails nicely with something that fascinates many of your colleagues: how
										do you have so much open time on your calendar?

										This drastically differs from your typical “successful CEO” who is booked from
										8:30am to 6pm. Walk us through your calendar and how you manage to create this
										open space.
									</i></b>

							</p>

							<p>

								My friends know me well! I do keep a lot of open time. I understand this comes from a
								place of privilege and I’m very lucky to have this flexibility.
							</p>
							<p>

								I feel like synchronous time is very costly; asynchronous time is better. I know there
								are some leaders who prefer to have all executive decisions travel through them. But
								then, you have to wait until the leader has availability to review things. Sometimes you
								run into delays in that process.
							</p>
							<p>
								I typically don't have more than really three or four meetings per day. There are
								exceptions; when I travel, I book in a lot more and I don't keep to my normal schedule.
								That said, most of the time it's three or four meetings a day.

							</p>
							<p>
								My way is to plan long term and do so ahead of time so that people better understand the
								direction in which they're going. You have to be incredibly crisp and clear when doing
								that. For instance, right now we're finalizing our five year plans and long range
								planning. These are actual, real targets fueled by real insights. They are made up of
								lots of super-detailed quarterly and annual goals. I don’t spend much time on the
								quarterly goals and instead focus on our so-called “big rocks.”
							</p>


							<h2 id="bets"><b>On Company Bets</b></h2>
							<p>
								At Spotify, we have something called “Company Bets.” These are large-scale initiatives
								that we believe will have a significant impact on the business within a relatively short
								period of time. I find that these bets are a much better use of my time. Our Company
								Bets typically update every six months, so I'm not needed that much in between. This
								way, I can constantly be thinking: “Where are we headed in the next six months?” Right
								now, I am thinking more about H2 2021. From a timeline perspective, that's the earliest
								place where I focus most of my time.
							</p>
							<p>
								It’s also my role to think far beyond that. For instance, I’m immersing myself in our
								2025 plans. I trust my team to manage the day-to-day, shorter-term initiatives and
								iterate as needed based on data and insights. They’re the best at that and I appreciate
								that this then frees me up to think about the long term.
							</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>RudderStack is an open source data collection and routing tool. It collects data from your website with a bit of Javascript and allows you to send it to different tools like a database or 3rd party analytics tool. Three months ago, I reported a serious issue where under certain circumstances, RudderStack will collect passwords.</p><p>The specific issue is that their autotrack feature <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-js/blob/888f5e9ce15f6771c10f18a66e53d7a3343a7af9/utils/autotrack.js#L216">collects every DOM attribute of any element a user clicks on:</a></p><p>{% c-block language="js" %}<br>const attrLength = elem.attributes.length<br>for (let i = 0; i &lt; attrLength; i++) {<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;const { name } = elem.attributes[i];<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;const { value } = elem.attributes[i];<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;if (value) {<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;props[`attr__${name}`] = value;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;}<br>...<br>}<br>{% c-block-end %}<br>DOM attributes can sometimes contain passwords and other sensitive information in them. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/05/mixpanel-passwords/">This is the exact same issue that affected Mixpanel two years ago.</a> In the email Mixpanel sent out, they mentioned two specific scenarios where sensitive information can wind up in DOM attributes:</p><p><em>We immediately began investigating further and learned that the behavior the customer was observing was due to a change to the React JavaScript library made in March 2017. This change placed copies of the values of hidden and password fields into the input elements’ attributes, which Autotrack then inadvertently received. Upon investigating further, we realized that, because of the way we had implemented Autotrack when it launched in August 2016, this could happen in other scenarios where browser plugins (such as the 1Password password manager) and website frameworks place sensitive data into form element attributes.</em></p><p>In fact it looks like RudderStack's implementation of autotrack is based on <a href="https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-js/blob/a369b4ce7312713140ceead88217b364c68a1825/src/autotrack.js">Mixpanel's buggy autotrack implementation</a>.</p><p>When Mixpanel discovered the issue, they <a href="https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-js/commit/b1d2a38e7cab22df9d95a531c62ef7af1c06af1d#diff-5328f5c4505ca0b5bf48cff18d6c85a8L60-L66">put safeguards in place to prevent capturing attributes from input fields</a>. Specifically they added a function shouldTrackElement that prevents the collection of attributes from input fields:</p><p>{% c-block language="js" %}<br>// don't send data from inputs or similar elements since there will always be<br>// a risk of clientside javascript placing sensitive data in attributes<br>if (<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;isTag(el, 'input') ||<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;isTag(el, 'select') ||<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;isTag(el, 'textarea') ||<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;el.getAttribute('contenteditable') === 'true'<br>) {<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;return false;<br>}<br>{% c-block-end %}<br>When RudderStack based their code off of Mixpanel's library, they decided not to include this code, even though it explicitly warns what can happen. After I notified RudderStack of the issue, <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-js/commit/e94fb28d04f0d0d6544c5da6eef602a0951047bd">they put back the safeguards Mixpanel had put in place</a>.</p><p>Personally, I don't think the safeguards are enough. The safeguards only prevent the capture of attributes from input elements. Attributes on all other elements will still be captured. Given that attributes can hold any internal program state, there's no reason sensitive information would be limited to only input elements. After writing their fix, RudderStack asked me to review it. I told them I did not think their fix was enough, but I have yet to hear back from them.</p><p>Other companies do provide autotrack functionality, but are more careful about not collecting data attributes. Notably:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052608053-Using-Element-Attributes-in-Search-Page-Analytics-Beta-">Fullstory allows only a whitelist of attributes.</a></li><li><a href="https://support.pendo.io/hc/en-us/articles/360031861612-HTML-Attributes">Pendo requires you to whitelist attributes you want to collect.</a></li><li>Freshpaint does not collect data attributes.</li></ul><p>Because these companies only collect a specific set of data attributes, they don't have to worry about accidentally collecting passwords.</p></div></div>]]>

<h3 id="orleans-is-a-cross-platform-framework-for-building-robust-scalable-distributed-applications">Orleans is a cross-platform framework for building robust, scalable distributed applications</h3>
<p>Orleans builds on the developer productivity of .NET and brings it to the world of distributed applications, such as cloud services. Orleans scales from a single on-premises server to globally distributed, highly-available applications in the cloud.</p>
<p>Orleans takes familiar concepts like objects, interfaces, async/await, and try/catch and extends them to multi-server environments. As such, it helps developers experienced with single-server applications transition to building resilient, scalable cloud services and other distributed applications. For this reason, Orleans has often been referred to as "Distributed .NET".</p>
<p>It was created by <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/projects/orleans/">Microsoft Research</a> and introduced the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=210931">Virtual Actor Model</a> as a novel approach to building a new generation of distributed systems for the Cloud era. The core contribution of Orleans is its programming model which tames the complexity inherent to highly-parallel distributed systems without restricting capabilities or imposing onerous constraints on the developer.</p>

"If by collecting information about people, our nation is made secure and ready for terrorist attacks, it's totally fine by me" <sup><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24">[24]</a></sup></p><p>This is why the argument against "nothing to hide" is very difficult to get across, since the protection against terrorist attacks outweighs whatever basic or moderate privacy interests someone might have. <sup><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">[25]</a></sup></p><p>"Nobody really seems to have any clear idea what privacy really is." <sup><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26">[26]</a></sup></p><p>"It's too vague and complex." <sup><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27">[27]</a></sup></p><p>Understanding what privacy is, is essential to addressing privacy issues.</p><p>"Privacy covers <em>intimate</em> information, access and decisions" <sup><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28">[28]</a></sup></p><p>The problem with conceptualizing privacy with intimacy is that not all private information or decision we make are considered intimate (political views, social security number, religion etc). <sup><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29">[29]</a></sup></p><p>Orwell's 1984 metaphor: focuses on the harms of surveillance (such as inhibition and social control) <sup><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30">[30]</a></sup></p><p>Another metaphor: Franz Kafka’s The Trial, a bureaucracy with inscrutable purposes that uses people’s information to make important decisions about them, yet denies the people the ability to participate in how their information is used <sup><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31">[31]</a></sup></p><p>Read about <a href="https://teachprivacy.com/taxonomy-of-privacy/">Taxonomy of Privacy</a> in more detail.</p><p>The problem is the underlying assumption that privacy is about hiding bad things. <sup><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32">[32]</a></sup></p><p>The "Nothing to hide" argument comes from a wrong “premise that privacy is about hiding a wrong.” <sup><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33">[33]</a></sup></p><p>It's also not about "secrecy". <sup><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34">[34]</a></sup></p><p>And neither is it about data you give to third-parties (bank records, telephone numbers, messages, etc). <sup><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35">[35]</a></sup></p><p>Because third party records result in the government’s ability to access an extensive amount of personal information with minimal limitation or oversight. <sup><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36">[36]</a></sup></p><p>Information collection is a form of surveillance. dataveilleince (Roger Clarke) <sup><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37">[37]</a></sup></p><p>This misuse and collection of information can and will harm your right to free-speech, democracy and thought expression (there is doubt about that). <sup><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37:1">[37]</a></sup></p><p>Refer to <a href="https://www.socialcooling.com/">socialcooling.com</a> for more info.</p><p>Another problem is "secondary use": the use of data for an unrelated use, ignoring the real reason why data was collected. this of course without the person's consent. <sup><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38">[38]</a></sup></p><p>This is of course a very "modern" problem, never before in history of humanity had we had so much information available (digitally or physically).</p><p><strong>The problem with the nothing to hide argument is that it focuses on just one or two particular kinds of privacy problems (the disclosure of personal information or surveillance) and not others.</strong> <sup><a href="#fn39" id="fnref39">[39]</a></sup></p><p>Privacy problems are often difficult to recognize, since it's a very complicated and delicate matter.</p><p>In many instances, privacy is threatened not by singular egregious acts, but by a slow series of relatively minor acts which gradually begin to add up <sup><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40">[40]</a></sup></p><p>The nothing to hide argument speaks to some problems, but not to others. <sup><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41">[41]</a></sup></p><p>It represents a singular and narrow way of conceiving of privacy, and it wins by excluding consideration of the other problems often raised in government surveillance and data mining programs.</p><p>This is definitely the most interesting paper I've ever read about Privacy.</p><p>Do yourself a favor and read it here: <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=998565">“I've Got Nothing to Hide” and Other Misunderstandings of Privacy</a>.</p><h5>Check out <a href="https://decent.social/">Decent.Social</a>, an ad-free &amp; privacy-friendly Twitter reader!</h5><div><div><div><h3>Decent is an ad-free, privacy-first Twitter reading experience</h3><h4><b>Join <b>15</b> others in the waiting list!</b></h4></div></div></div><h2>Foot notes</h2><hr><section><ol><li id="fn1"><p>James Risen &amp; Eric Lichtblau, Bush Lets U.S. Spy on Callers Without Courts: Secret Order to Widen Domestic Monitoring, N.Y.

                <p>A few months ago I made the decision to purchase an already operating Software as a Service (SaaS) business. <a href="https://myclientspot.com/">MyClientSpot</a> offers project, client, contractor, and time management software as a service.</p>
<p>This was a pretty big decision for me. Like a lot of developers, I’ve always been of the opinion “Why purchase something that I can easily build?” I’ve had limited success building products from the ground up before and decided to try something different this time by starting with an existing product that had a solid base of loyal customers.  My hope is that the customers will be able to inform product development and speed the discovery processes.</p>

<p>I blame Patrick McKenzie for documenting how he’s sold multiple SaaS businesses for putting the idea in my head.  You can read his excellent account from the seller side <a href="https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/selling_software_business">here</a>.
I plan on documenting the other side of the sales transaction and where I take it from here.</p>
<p>As a full-stack senior web developer/consultant, I’ve worked on legacy SaaS products many times in the past.  I usually parachute in, do some poking around to understand the system then either fix a bad bug or implement a feature that they lack lack the skills and/or time to complete internally.</p>
<p>Something I’ve learned is that there are thousands (millions?) of small applications out there, limping along on shared hosting and making a few thousand dollars a month.  Most haven’t been updated in years and the owner is usually a non-tech person who enjoys the stable revenue but doesn’t have the ability to take the product to the next level.</p>
<p>Why not find one of those businesses that still have a solid customer base, update it’s tech a bit, and grow the user count?  Nothing I haven’t done before but this time I’d be the beneficiary of the growth.  Of course I’d be forgoing the fat consulting check that usually goes along with the job, but hopefully it’ll pay off as the company grows.</p>
<p>I subscribed to the buyers listing at <a href="https://feinternational.com/">FE International</a> and after a few months found a  likely listing.  After signing a non-disclosure agreement they sent me a slim prospectus on “MyClientSpot”.  The company seemed like a cross between project and outsourcing management, with a few weird database type features thrown into the mixture.</p>
<p>The website had that distinct mid-2000’s look and was still using tables for it’s page layouts.  If I was approaching this a consultant, I would have been immediately drafting a “This is a problem and here’s how I can help” proposal with a quote attached, because there was no way it could be signing up many trials let alone converting them to paid accounts.</p>
<p>After discussing it with my team, we were all in agreement that there was potential for this software and made an offer a bit below the listing price. After a little haggling back and forth, we finally came to an agreement to start the purchase process.  In order for our proposal to be more attractive we offered to close very quickly in a matter of weeks.</p>
<p>We then had a few weeks to perform due diligence on the website but were limited here by the lack of technical knowledge by the sellers.  They’d never had to really dig into the operations and had outsourced the support.</p>
<p>Major red flags we found were:</p>
<ul>
<li>There weren’t any analytics running on the website, so no real way to guess at how much traffic the site was getting because the seller also lacked access to the log files.</li>
<li>There was very little ability to allow us to view the source code.  We finally managed to view that via FTP from the (very outdated) cPanel and viewed enough to determine that it was running php with a early version of the codeigniter framework.  Codeigniter was a big plus; that indicated that the code probably had some structure and wasn’t your typical mid-2000’s Php ugly mess.</li>
<li>Email for the site was self hosted on the server and completely overwhelmed with spam.</li>
<li>The non-application web pages were hosted on an outdated and insecure wordpress.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above didn’t deter me because it was all items that I would be working on changing as soon as we took possession.  Some of the issues were potentially very serious, and there wasn’t much time to waste with updates.  It wouldn’t take much for the site to suffer significant downtime which would cause the existing customers to evaporate, leaving the site worthless and our money down the drain.</p>
<p>The good news was the prospectus showed it had a cadre of very stable core customers which had not changed substantially in the past year, and several that had been customers for a few years. To us that said the existing customers must be very satisfied, the challenge would be to attract new ones.</p>
<p>We gave the go-head to FE that we’d like to close the deal and this is where Patrick’s recommendation to “always use a broker” was proven completely correct.  FE made sure that all the documents were in order and had a step-by-step procedure that listed exactly what would be transferred and the steps to do so. This made the transfer of sale and monies go very smoothly. And we had them to go to for advice when there were things we did not quite understand.</p>
<p>Despite that we still managed to encounter a few small hiccups.</p>
<ul>
<li>Credit card processing was with Authorize.net and they required a new merchant account be setup.  Some of the customers were also using American Express for billing and that required an entirely different merchant account to be established.  This took a credit check, validation, and almost 30 days to accomplish which was much longer than we expected.  The seller went above and beyond though and left his merchant account in place and transferred the funds back to us.</li>
<li>We were slow on sending a welcome email out to the customers.  A few noticed that the billing name on their credit cards statement had changed and didn’t know what was going on.  In our defense the invoicing, credit card processing and system customer list did not match.  It took a substantial amount of investigation to even figure out who all of our currently active customers were.</li>
<li>Rackspace is a strange company.  They refuse to transfer service without sending multiple signed and scanned forms.  We finally just gave up on transferring and took over the original account.  We later learned that they ALSO don’t allow renaming accounts without sending more PDFs around.  Come on guys, it’s just a $10/month account that stores a few files.</li>
</ul>
<p>After closing, I immediately went around changing all the passwords, setup hourly backups, put analytics on the website so we could discover how it was actually being used, and downloaded a copy of the website source code for in-depth evaluation.</p>
<p>We sent out an email to all the current users introducing ourselves and requesting feedback on what they’d like to see improved.  We got several fantastic responses that we are currently prioritizing into a proper product road-map. And most importantly, we started using the service for ourselves, not only does this help us to understand the processes, keep our tasks inline, but also gives us a good idea of future improvements also.</p>
<p>Lessons learned from the process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you completely understand how the billing process works.  Even though we were focused on the financials we didn’t pay attention to the actual invoicing process to understand what was needed for a smoother transfer of receivables.</li>
<li>Use a broker if at all possible!  I shudder to think of what would have went wrong if we’d tried to do this as a private sale without FE’s processes in place, as well as their guidance.</li>
<li>Get a good contact list of current active customers for efficient and transparent communication with them.  Since your customer base is you bread and butter, keep them in the loop so they stick with you!</li>
</ul>
<p>Would we do it again? Absolutely! We’ve been running <a href="https://myclientspot.com/">MyClientSpot</a> for several months now and just completed an update to modernized the user-interface.</p>
<p>I’ll do a further write-up of the updates that’ve been completed next month and how things are progressing.  Want to read about Mysql to Postgresql?  Introducing tests to a code base that utterly lacks them? Augmenting Php with graphql? Then tune in next time to hear more about these transactions.</p>

<p>A newly discovered phishing campaign makes the recipient solve captchas in an effort to both add some legitimacy to itself and evade detection systems.</p>



<p>Typically, captchas are a puzzle or a challenge that humans are made to solve to prove to a web server they are not an automated system (“robot”) accessing the server.</p>



<p>Use of captchas helps distinguish legitimate (human-initiated) traffic from automated bot traffic as the latter can have nefarious motives. </p>



<p>Captchas, therefore, help prevent security attacks – such as rogue pentesting bots by just fuzzing a website and Denial of Service (DoS).</p>



<p>But, what good would a phishing page achieve from making its victims solve captchas?</p>



<h2>Evades automated security systems</h2>



<p>Not only does the phishing campaign employ captchas to appear more legitimate to its recipients, but addition of captchas means <em>bots</em> can’t access the page.</p>



<p>While the term “bot” may have a negative connotation in this context, these <em>also</em> <em>include</em> automated security research tools looking to detect and deter such phishing campaigns.</p>



<p>Menlo Security analyzed such a phishing campaign that comprised a fake Microsoft Office 365 page.</p>



<p>Vinay Pidathala, Director of Security Research at Menlo Security explained in a <a href="https://www.menlosecurity.com/blog/menlo-threat-labs-uncovers-a-phishing-attack-using-captchas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog</a> post:</p>



<p>“To defeat automated crawling systems and ensure that a human is interacting with the page, the attackers put the credential phishing page behind layers of visual captchas, so the user would have to click the right set of images to ensure that they are not a bot,” providing screenshots.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.menlosecurity.com/hs-fs/hubfs/images/blog/iSOC_Blog/iSOC_Figure3.png?width=600&amp;name=iSOC_Figure3.png" alt="iSOC_Figure3" data-src="https://www.menlosecurity.com/hs-fs/hubfs/images/blog/iSOC_Blog/iSOC_Figure3.png?width=600&amp;name=iSOC_Figure3.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption>Image: Google reCaptcha integrated with phishing spam</figcaption></figure>



<p><br>“In addition to the first check, the attackers have designed two other captchas, in case the first one gets defeated by automated systems,” continued Pidathala.</p>



<p>Only after two different captchas are successfully solved by the victim, does the page redirect them to a final landing page.</p>



<p>This landing page is a Microsoft Office 365 login page-lookalike which tries to phish user’s credentials.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.menlosecurity.com/hs-fs/hubfs/images/blog/iSOC_Blog/iSOC_Figure4.png?width=600&amp;name=iSOC_Figure4.png" alt="iSOC_Figure4" data-src="https://www.menlosecurity.com/hs-fs/hubfs/images/blog/iSOC_Blog/iSOC_Figure4.png?width=600&amp;name=iSOC_Figure4.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption>Image: Office 365 phishing page loads after captcha challenges are solved</figcaption></figure>



<p>A phishing campaign such as this one may appear simple but it is in fact crafted with a very clever purpose in mind.</p>



<p>The addition of widely recognized Google reCaptcha used by many legitimate websites may trick a novice user into believing the authenticity of the phishing page.</p>



<p>But further, email gateways and web proxies that may have otherwise intercepted and blocked the final landing page are now rendered moot. </p>



<p>Because, for them to be able to analyze this page they need to solve the captcha, to prove they are <em>human.</em> The irony behind this setup is tough to miss.</p>



<p>As attackers constantly evolve their tactics when it comes to phishing campaigns, unsolved challenges keep growing for enterprise security customers and IT professionals alike.</p>



<p>There’s the challenge to support a large scale infrastructure that works flawlessly and delivers the business value that it’s designed for, yet there is an expectation to battle these kinds of novel phishing attacks from infiltrating corporate networks.</p>



<p>Staying up to date with the latest intel on cyberattacks, and being on the lookout for security tools equipped with this constantly evolving information are great ways to tackle these challenges.</p>

<p>As a Data Scientist you will be spending a large chunk of your time doing repetitive work across projects. You get a new data set and you run the same boilerplate code for your analysis: Import data, check for missing values, distribution check, cleansing, yada yada …</p>

<p>I know, datasets are very different yet I still see how often times the very same steps are repeated blindly in notebooks over and over again. Despite common software engineering principles telling us to not repeat ourselves, we still do it. I started noticing this pattern in my own work and got frustrated. Is there a way to break this recurring cycle?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Over and over and over and over, like a monkey with a miniature cymbal, the joy of repetition really is in you.  <em>Over and Over - Hot Chip</em></p>

<p>My tip: build your personal library of frequently needed analysis helper functions to make your life easier. See yourself as data science practitioner and master your tools over time. Rather than having them scrambled around all over your workbench, you need a central place to store them. That is your personal toolkit. It is different for everybody but you will recognize its importance and appreciate it the more you will use it. Upgrade and sharpen your knives regularly. It is your toolkit.</p>

<p>In this post I will show you some good practices around Python packaging with a focus on Data Science applications. In detail, we are going to:</p>

<ul>
<li>create a package of frequently used functions,</li>
<li>test our code with unit-tests,</li>
<li>and finally distribute through git.<br></li>
</ul>



<p>In order to get started, think about the steps that you regularly do when starting a new data project (e.g. at school, work or personal).</p>

<p>Here is a list of recurring tasks I can think of right from the top of my head:</p>

<ul>
<li>Analysis

<ul>
<li>Plot distributions for all columns/features</li>
<li>Outlier detection for various datatypes (categoric, numeric, timestamps etc.)</li>
<li>Missing values detection and handling</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Database and File IO

<ul>
<li>Write helper functions for easier access data stores specific to your work. It might be the ugly ERP that you are using at your BigCorp™️ or just plain database connectors. Think of useful abstractions to read/write to these.<br></li>
<li>Writing files to S3 and other file stores.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Machine Learning

<ul>
<li>Feature creation</li>
<li>Train-Test splits beyond sklearn</li>
<li>Model Validation
<br></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Many posts have been written about structuring Python packages, I can warmly recommend the following for more in-depth discussions on this topic:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://godatadriven.com/blog/a-practical-guide-to-using-setup-py/">A Practical Guide to Using Setup.py - GoDataDriven</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/">Structuring Your Project — The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python</a></li>

<li><a href="https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/">Packaging Python Projects — Python Packaging User Guide</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Obviously your Data Science toolkit should be tailored to your own work and needs. So be selfish and name it after yourself … or come up with a cool sounding name, how about <a href="https://blog.reedsy.com/character-name-generator/">Swahili character names</a>?</p>

<p>For the example project in this post, we are going to start with a simple package called <code>frnz-sample</code>, named after yours truly.</p>

<p>Find a link to the Github repository <a href="https://github.com/alfranz/frnz-sample">here</a> to have a look at the exact structure.</p>

<p>The project looks something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">frnz-sample
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── frnz
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── __init__.py
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── analytics.py
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── data.py
├── setup.py
└── tests
    └── test_analytics.py</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>frnz</code>directory contains two core modules, the first one <code>analytics.py</code></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="analytics.py"><span>import</span> pandas <span>as</span> pd
<span>from</span> typing <span>import</span> Dict

<span>def</span> count_missing(dataframe: pd.DataFrame) -&gt; Dict[<span>str</span>, <span>int</span>]:
    <span>return</span> <span>dict</span>(dataframe.isna().sum())</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>count_missing</code> function will return the number of missing values for every column in the supplied DataFrame. This is only one sample for a  convenience function that will be part of your toolkit. Add more over time!</p>

<h2 id="shipping-toy-data">Shipping toy-data 🕹</h2>

<p>Another key aspect of the Data Science toolkit is of course data! This is useful for two primary reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>use it as a starting place for analysis tasks or data pipelines,</li>
<li>Most importantly: Use them to unit-test your core functions. More on that later.</li>
</ul>

<p>Shipping little toy-dataset with your package avoids external API calls to download (potentially) larger datasets.  You can find similar dataset loading utilities within other packages such as <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html">scikit-learn</a>.</p>

<p>Keep in mind the main functionalities you want to cover by your code and design your toy-data accordingly. Typos, missing data and outliers are only some of the things you will encounter in your work.</p>

<p>In our case, I created a small Pandas DataFrame with containing city names that can be used for other analysis functions. Even though we don’t have many rows here, we can potentially test a few important things:</p>

<ul>
<li>(fuzzy) duplicates

<ul>
<li>there are two “Cape Towns” in this dataset, how do we find the <em>real</em> one?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>outliers

<ul>
<li>numerical: Mumbai is quite populated but really by that much?</li>
<li>categorical: Sydney is in Australia but the 3 digit country code deviates from the majority used 2 digit country ISO codes shown. How do we find these anomalies programmatically?</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>missing values</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="data.py"><span>import</span> pandas <span>as</span> pd

cities = pd.DataFrame(
data={
    <span>"city"</span>: [
        <span>"Berlin"</span>,
        <span>"Vienna"</span>,
        <span>"Montreal"</span>,
        <span>"Mumbai"</span>,
        <span>"cape-town"</span>,
        <span>"Cape Town"</span>,
        <span>"Sydney"</span>,
    ],
    <span>"country"</span>: [<span>"DE"</span>, <span>"AT"</span>, <span>"CA"</span>, <span>"IN"</span>, pd.NA, <span>"ZA"</span>, <span>"AUS"</span>],
    <span>"population"</span>: [<span>3750000</span>, <span>1900000</span>, <span>1780000</span>, <span>184100000</span>, <span>430000</span>, <span>440000</span>, pd.NA],
}
)</code></pre></div></li>
</ul>

<p>You have finished your first core functions? Time for testing!</p>



<p>Unit-testing our code ensures that it performs as expected. Especially when using Jupyter notebooks and using ad-hoc code, we often run into risks of using untested functions. This is fine for quick analysis but if those functions are repeatedly used, they should become part of your library. And that means writing tests.</p>

<p>Here is an example for a unit-test for our <code>count_missing</code> function from the <code>analytics</code> module.  I will use the <code>pytest</code> framework for this as it provides the simplest way to get started with testing in Python.</p>

<p>In a folder called <code>tests</code>, create the following file <code>test_analytics.py</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> frnz.data <span>import</span> cities
<span>from</span> frnz.analytics <span>import</span> count_missing
<span>import</span> pytest


<span>def</span> test_counting_nas_return_correct_count():
    result = count_missing(cities)
    expected = {<span>"city"</span>: <span>0</span>, <span>"country"</span>: <span>1</span>, <span>"population"</span>: <span>1</span>}
    <span>assert</span> <span>len</span>(result) == <span>len</span>(expected)
    <span>assert</span> result[<span>"country"</span>] == expected[<span>"country"</span>]</code></pre></div>
<p>First, we have to import all objects that we need for that specific test.
In our case, this test will also import the sample DataFrame that we created earlier.</p>

<p>The structure of a test file is quite simple: you create a new function that will test a specific behavior of your code by comparing an expected outcome with the actual result. In this case, we will test the length and result of the function call to <code>count_missing</code> with our sample <code>cities</code>dataframe. Because we already know how many missing values each column of our sample data contains, we can explicitly create a dictionary of expected results in the test.</p>

<p>By calling <code>assert</code> for both expected and actual results, we specify the expected equality and thus make sure the function works correctly.</p>

<p>When we are testing our code, we should just be able to call the
<code>pytest</code> command from the CLI in the root of our package. This will start the test-runner and automatically find the unit test we just wrote. Make sure to add the <code>test_</code> prefix to the name of your Python files containing your tests. This is essentially the cue for pytest to pick up that file as a unit-test.
Pytest will run your tests and output a message whether they have failed or passed.</p>

<h2 id="distribute-through-github">Distribute through Github</h2>

<p>The great thing about using git for version control is that you can directly <code>pip install</code>  your package from Github (without publishing to PyPI). Just use:</p>

<p><code>pip install -e git+https://github.com/alfranz/frnz-sample.git@master#egg=frnz</code></p>

<p>and/or specify it as part of a <code>requirements.txt</code> in your project like:</p>
<div><pre>frnz @ git+https://github.com/alfranz/frnz-sample.git@master#egg=frnz</pre></div>
<h2 id="using-the-package-in-the-wild">Using the package in the wild 💪</h2>

<p>Now you should be able to simply install your new package through <code>pip install</code> and call the your functions like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> frnz

df = frnz.data.cities

<span>print</span>(frnz.analytics.count_missing(df))</code></pre></div>
<p>Awesome, your package should now be working. You are now ready to not repeat yourself as frequently as before and super-charge your analytics workflows.</p>

      A step by step instruction for compiling a Java program into Android executable and using ADB to run it.
    </p><div>

<p>When you want to create a system / commandline tool for Android, you have to write it in C(++)… or do you?</p>

<p><strong>TLDR;</strong> here’s the final <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/run-java-app-android/helloworld.zip">proof of concept</a>.</p>

<p>Sticking with Java would have the benefit of avoiding all of the native ABI hassle and also being able to call into the Android runtime. So how do we do that?</p>

<h2 id="a-not-so-simple-hello-world-program">A (not so) simple Hello World program</h2>

<p>Let’s start with the Java program we want to run. In order to make it a bit more interesting (and because any useful program has dependencies), it won’t just print the obligatory “Hello World” message, but also use the <a href="https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-cli/">Apache Commons CLI</a> library to parse its commandline arguments:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>package</span> com.example<span>;</span>

<span>import</span> org.apache.commons.cli.DefaultParser<span>;</span>
<span>import</span> org.apache.commons.cli.HelpFormatter<span>;</span>
<span>import</span> org.apache.commons.cli.Option<span>;</span>
<span>import</span> org.apache.commons.cli.Options<span>;</span>
<span>import</span> org.apache.commons.cli.ParseException<span>;</span>

<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>HelloWorld</span> <span>{</span>

	<span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span>String<span>[]</span> args<span>)</span> <span>throws</span> ParseException <span>{</span>
		Option version <span>=</span> <span>new</span> Option<span>(</span><span>"v"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Print version"</span><span>);</span>
		Option help <span>=</span> <span>new</span> Option<span>(</span><span>"h"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Print help"</span><span>);</span>
		Options options <span>=</span> <span>new</span> Options<span>();</span>
		options<span>.</span><span>addOption</span><span>(</span>help<span>);</span>
		options<span>.</span><span>addOption</span><span>(</span>version<span>);</span>
		<span>for</span> <span>(</span>Option opt <span>:</span> <span>new</span> DefaultParser<span>().</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span>options<span>,</span> args<span>).</span><span>getOptions</span><span>())</span> <span>{</span>
			<span>if</span> <span>(</span>opt<span>.</span><span>equals</span><span>(</span>version<span>))</span> <span>{</span>
				String os <span>=</span> System<span>.</span><span>getProperty</span><span>(</span><span>"os.arch"</span><span>);</span>
				System<span>.</span><span>out</span><span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello World ("</span> <span>+</span> os <span>+</span> <span>") v0.1"</span><span>);</span>
			<span>}</span>
			<span>if</span> <span>(</span>opt<span>.</span><span>equals</span><span>(</span>help<span>))</span> <span>{</span>
				<span>new</span> HelpFormatter<span>().</span><span>printHelp</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello World"</span><span>,</span> options<span>);</span>
			<span>}</span>
		<span>}</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>

<h2 id="setting-up-the-working-directory">Setting up the working directory</h2>

<p>We will have to <strong>manually</strong> run several commandline tools in the next step, assuming the following <strong>final</strong> directory structure:
</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">.
├── android-sdk-linux
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── build-tools
│&nbsp;&nbsp;     └── <span>23</span>.0.2
│&nbsp;&nbsp;         └── dx
├── bin
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── com
│&nbsp;&nbsp;     └── example
│&nbsp;&nbsp;         └── HelloWorld.class
├── lib
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── commons-cli-1.3.1.jar
├── src
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── com
│&nbsp;&nbsp;     └── example
│&nbsp;&nbsp;         └── HelloWorld.java
├── helloworld.jar
└── helloworld.sh</code></pre></div>

<p>Start by creating an empty directory in a convenient place. Download and unpack the following items there:</p>

<ul>
<li>Android SDK (either via <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio">Android Studio</a> or the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/sdkmanager">SDK Manager</a>). <strong>NOTE:</strong> If you are an Android developer, you’ll have the Android SDK already installed. In that case, you don’t actually need to copy it to the working directory as long as you know the path to the <code>dx</code> tool.</li>
<li>Apache Commons CLI library v1.3.1</li>
</ul>

<p>Afterwards copy&amp;paste the HelloWorld code from above into the source folder.</p>

<h2 id="compiling-and-dexing-the-java-class">Compiling and dexing the Java class</h2>

<p>Next step is to compile the java class (keep in mind that Android is stuck with Java 7 - bytecode for later versions won’t work). In case you are not used to doing this outside of an IDE, here’s the command:
</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">javac -source <span>1</span>.7 -target <span>1</span>.7 -d bin -cp lib/commons-cli-1.3.1.jar src/com/example/HelloWorld.java</code></pre></div>

<p>Make sure the program compiled properly:
</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">java -cp lib/commons-cli-1.3.1.jar:bin com.example.HelloWorld -h
usage: Hello world
 -h   Print help
 -v   Print version</code></pre></div>

<p>Android cannot run Java class files directly. They have to be converted to Dalvik’s DEX format first (yes, even if you using ART):
</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">./android-sdk-linux/build-tools/23.0.2/dx --output<span>=</span>helloworld.jar --dex ./bin lib/commons-cli-1.3.1.jar</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Android Build Tools v28.0.2 and later contain a <code>dx</code> upgrade, called <code>d8</code>. The <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/d8">d8 tool</a> can process Java 8 class files. I’ll stick with <code>dx</code> for backwards compatibility reasons here.</p>

<h2 id="creating-the-startup-shellscript">Creating the startup shellscript</h2>

<p>Android does not have a (normal) JRE, so JAR files cannot be started the same way as on a PC. You need a shellscript wrapper to do this. Copy&amp;paste the one below to the workspace.
</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">base<span>=</span>/data/local/tmp/helloworld
export CLASSPATH<span>=</span>$base/helloworld.jar
export ANDROID_DATA<span>=</span>$base
mkdir -p $base/dalvik-cache
exec app_process $base com.example.HelloWorld <span>"</span>$@<span>"</span></code></pre></div>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> DEX files can also be started directly using the <code>dalvikvm</code> command, but going through <code>app_process</code> gives us a pre-warmed VM from the Zygote process (it is also the method employed by framework commands like <code>pm</code> and <code>am</code>).</p>

<h2 id="installing-and-running-the-non-app">Installing and running the (non-) app</h2>

<p>Time to push everything to the device:
</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">adb shell mkdir -p /data/local/tmp/helloworld
adb push helloworld.jar /data/local/tmp/helloworld
adb push helloworld.sh /data/local/tmp/helloworld
adb shell chmod <span>777</span> /data/local/tmp/helloworld/helloworld.sh</code></pre></div>

<p>Moment of truth (fingers crossed):
</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">adb shell /data/local/tmp/helloworld/helloworld.sh -v
Hello World <span>(</span>armv7l<span>)</span> v0.1</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Since nothing was installed into the system, getting rid of the program is simply done by deleting the directory again.</p>

<h2 id="it-works-but-how-do-i-get-a-context">It works, but how do I get a Context?!</h2>

<p>You don’t!</p>

<p>Contexts represent an environment that is associated with an app (which we explicitly did not build) and are also device dependant. They can only be created by the ActivityThread class (a hidden system class that you cannot instantiate). If you want to interact with the Android runtime, you have to talk to the system services directly through their Binder interfaces. But that’s a topic for another article.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hook="post-description"><article><div><div data-rce-version="7.19.2"><div dir="ltr"><div><p id="viewer-dnutn">Here at Sleuth, we live in Zoom, and have accumulated a list of tips to make video meetings better. I'm going to talk about three quick tips to go from a muddled dungeon dweller to a clear, engaging talking head, all without spending a dime. If you want even more,</p><p id="viewer-6c0ca">the above video shows you 9 <em>more</em> tips, including one advanced (but still completely free) tip to turn a video call into a real-time broadcast experience.</p><p id="viewer-aolmv">Remote Zoom or WebEx calls used to be a bit of a novelty but now they are simply how we do business. The better you look and sound on a video call, the more professional and confident your boss and colleagues will perceive you. To improve your video meetings, you need to look at three areas: sound, framing, and lighting.</p><p id="viewer-b3at8"><strong>Tip 1 - Move the microphone closer</strong></p><p id="viewer-dgia5">Sound is the most important factor in the success of your video meeting, because if they can't hear you, you simply can't communicate anything, no matter how great the picture quality. The biggest mistake people make here is to use their laptop mic, multiple feet away from their mouth, where all the noise of the room is picked up at similar volumes as their voice. Worse, they don't use a headphone, so the pic starts picking up the audio of the very meeting they are in.</p><p id="viewer-4g5o9">The fix here is simple - put the mic closer to your mouth. If the mic can pick up your voice louder than the ambient noises, your audio quality will immediately clean up and people will be able to hear you again. If you have an extra set of headphones with a mic, use that, or if you only have your laptop, put it closer to your face.</p><p id="viewer-1m7s8"><strong>Tip 2 - Position the camera at eye level</strong></p><div id="viewer-4cujo"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.sleuth.io/post/3-9-quick-video-meeting-tips-we-use-every-day" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e447f2_5f0a591b63fb4aa8b4c1f4bd67ce93f7~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e447f2_5f0a591b63fb4aa8b4c1f4bd67ce93f7~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-8g28j">Framing is how the camera captures you and your surroundings. You want frame yourself such that the focus is on you and not the distractions in the background. To get the best picture of you, you need to position the camera at eye level.  If you have the laptop on your, well, lap, the camera will be looking up your nose with a lovely view of that double chin that you normally don't have, but you do now.</p><p id="viewer-82fte">Another simple fix - set the laptop on a shelf, stand, or even a few books to raise the camera up to eye level. This will make your face look much better, draw the attention to your eyes, and be more engaging for your audience.</p><p id="viewer-amdcd"><strong>Tip 3 - Light you more than your background</strong></p><div id="viewer-fqan2"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.sleuth.io/post/3-9-quick-video-meeting-tips-we-use-every-day" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e447f2_f5cdd0823acf4767bb790ce8fe72a481~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e447f2_f5cdd0823acf4767bb790ce8fe72a481~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-a5pv0">Lighting is often forgotten about when doing a video call, but the wrong lighting will drown your image, draw unflattering shadows on your face, or distract your audience with what's behind you.</p><p id="viewer-16gbj">First, avoid big light sources behind you such as a window or doorway. These force the camera to try to adjust the exposure to the light, making your face dark and brooding. Second, avoid overhead lights as it casts unflattering shadows on your face, particularly the nose onto the mouth region. Second, light your face from the front with a lamp or sunlight so that your face can be clearly seen.</p><p id="viewer-cq5dn">You can dramatically improve your video meetings without spending a lot of time or money. I've found these tips useful because the better you look over video, the more professional and confidence you come across, giving you that little leg up.

<span>Mon Oct 5, 2020</span></h4><hr><br></p><p><strong>Let’s talk about that thing nobody’s talking about.
Let’s talk about a vulnerability that’s exposing 2018-2020 Macs while most are declining to act nor report about the matter.
Oh, and did I mention it’s unpatchable?</strong></p><p><strong>Buckle up buckaroo, we’re in for a wild ride.</strong></p><p>Skip to <a href="#security-issues">#security-issues</a> for the technical mumbo-jumbo.</p><h2 id="preface">Preface</h2><h3 id="attribution">Attribution</h3><p>The following post is an industry analysis of the code and research performed by <a href="https://twitter.com/axi0mx/">twitter.com/axi0mx</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/h0m3us3r/">twitter.com/h0m3us3r</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/aunali1/">twitter.com/aunali1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mcmrarm/">twitter.com/mcmrarm</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/su_rickmark/">twitter.com/su_rickmark</a> who poured endless hours of work into this, allowing companies and users to understand their risks concerning this issue.</p><h3 id="intel-vs-silicon">Intel vs Silicon</h3><p>This blog post only applies to macOS systems with an Intel processor and the embedded T2 security chip.
Apple silicon systems will run completely on a set of Apple-designed ARM processors and mighth have a different topology, e.g. based on the A12.
Since the A12 chip seems to have fixed this issue (to be confirmed), it’s highly likely the new Apple Silicon machines will not be vulnerable.
And while the new upcoming Intel Macs at the end of year will probably receive a new hardware revision of the T2 chip (e.g. based on the A12), we are still stuck with this vulnerability on Macs between 2018 and 2020.</p><h3 id="so-about-this-t2-thing">So about this T2 thing</h3><p>In case you are using a recent macOS device, you are probably using <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208862">the embedded T2 security chip</a> which runs <em>bridgeOS</em> and is actually based on watchOS. This is a custom ARM processor designed by Apple based on the A10 CPU found in the iPhone 7.
The T2 chip contains a <em>Secure Enclave Processor</em> (SEP), much like the A-series processor in your iPhone will contain a SEP.</p><p>While newer Macs and/or Apple Silicon (including the dev kit) will use a more recent A-series processor such as the one found in the recent iPhone (A12), current Macs still use the A10.</p><p>It performs a predefined set of tasks for macOS such as audio processing, handling I/O, functioning as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module">Hardware Security Module</a> for e.g. Apple KeyChain or 2FA, hardware accelerating media playback, whitelisting kernel extensions, cryptographic operations and <strong>ensuring the operating system you are booting is not tampered with</strong>.
The T2 chip runs its own firmware called <em>bridgeOS</em>, which can be updated when you install a new macOS version. (ever notice the screen flickering? that’s the display driver being interrupted and possibly updated.)</p><p><em>Edit</em>: I first mentioned the iPad Pro to be impacted by the T2 vulnerability, but while it could suffer from the same vulnerability, it does not contain a T2 chip.</p><h3 id="the-macos-boot-sequence">The macOS boot sequence</h3><p>So let’s focus on the boot image verification on macOS. What exactly happens when you press that power button?
<a href="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/bootprocess.png">There’s also a visual representation for any <em>conaisseurs</em></a>.
For the enthusiasts, I personally find <a href="https://michaellynn.github.io/2018/07/27/booting-secure/">Booting Secure by mikeymikey</a> a more in-depth description.</p><ol><li><p>The T2 chip is fully booted and stays on, even if your Mac device is shutdown.</p></li><li><p>The press of the power button or the opening of the lid triggers the System Management Controller (SMC) to boot.</p></li><li><p>The SMC performs a Power-On-Self-Test (POST) to detect any EFI or hardware issues such as bad RAM and possibly redirect to Recovery.</p></li><li><p>After those basic sanity checks, the T2 chip is triggered and I/O connectors are setup. (USB, NVMe, PCIe, …) It will use NVMe and PCIe to talk to NAND storage.</p></li><li><p>The applicable boot disk is selected and a disk encryption password is asked if enabled to mount <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_File_System">APFS</a> volumes possibly via FileVault2 disk encryption.</p></li><li><p><code>/System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi</code> is located on your System APFS volume and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208330">depending on your secure boot settings</a> is validated.</p></li><li><p><em>boot.efi</em> is ran which loads the Darwin kernel <em>(throwback to BSD)</em> (or Boot Camp if booting Microsoft Windows) &amp; IODevice drivers. If a kernel cache is found in <code>/System/Library/PrelinkedKernels/prelinkedkernel</code>, it will use that.</p></li><li><p>Any User Approved Kernel Extensions are initialized &amp; added to the kernel space -if- they are approved by the T2 chip.
<em>This will go away with System Extensions</em>.</p></li></ol><h3 id="macos-security-features">macOS security features</h3><p>So Apple has a couple of tricks up its sleeve to limit the attack surface of any potential security vulnerabilities. A small summary of related measures since macOS Big Sur on Intel processors:</p><ul><li><p><em>System Integrity Protection</em> (SIP): a read-only <code>/System</code> partition so the base install of macOS (including the kernel) cannot be tampered with.</p></li><li><p><em>System Extensions</em>: a move to away from Kernel Extensions, getting external code out of the Kernel framework-wise.</p></li><li><p><em>Secure Boot</em>: verifies the signature validity of the operating system on disk.</p></li><li><p><em>Filesystem seals</em>: every byte of data is compared to a hash in the filesystem metadata tree, recursively verifying integrity.</p></li></ul><h3 id="apple-marketing">Apple marketing</h3><p>As you probably all already know, Apple pushes forward privacy &amp; security as important weapons in todays world of technology.
They tout their devices as highly secure and vouch to handle your personal data using a privacy-centric approach.
While there have been mistakes made in the past (who can blame them?), Apple has been generally quick to fix any security issues that were disclosed to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201220">their responsible disclosure program</a> or in public.</p><h2 id="security-issues">Security issues</h2><h3 id="jailbreaking">Jailbreaking</h3><h3 id="the-core-problem">The core problem</h3><p>The mini operating system on the T2 (<em>SepOS</em>) suffers from a security vulnerable also found in the iPhone 7 since it contains a processor based on the iOS A10. Exploitation of this type of processor for the sake of installing homebrew software is very actively discussed in the <a href="https://reddit.com/r/jailbreak/">/r/jailbreak</a> subreddit.</p><p>So using the <a href="https://checkm8.info/">checkm8 exploit</a> originally made for iPhones, the checkra1n exploit was developed to build a semi-tethered exploit for the T2 security chip, exploiting a flaw. This could be used to e.g. circumvent activation lock, allowing stolen iPhones or macOS devices to be reset and sold on the black market.</p><p>Normally the T2 chip will exit with a fatal error if it is in DFU mode and it detects a decryption call, but thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/windknown/presentations/blob/master/Attack_Secure_Boot_of_SEP.pdf">blackbird vulnerability</a> by team Pangu, we can completely circumvent that check in the SEP and do whatever we please.</p><p>Since sepOS/BootROM is <em>Read-Only Memory</em> for security reasons, interestingly, Apple cannot patch this core vulnerability without a new hardware revision.
This thankfully also means that this is not a persistent vulnerability, so it will require a hardware insert or other attached component such as a malicious USB-C cable.</p><h3 id="debugging">Debugging</h3><p>Every Apple iDevice (which includes the T2 and the Watch, via a port under the band) ships with a firmware recovery USB interface called Device Firmware Update (DFU), which is triggered when the device is not be able to boot or by pressing a particular set of buttons when turned on.

This is the mode in which checkm8 runs.</p><p>Apple also leaves the ability to access various debug functionality which is disabled on production devices unless a special boot payload is used which runs in DFU. Since Apple is the only one who can sign code for DFU, they can demote any device they like, including the most recent A14 processors.
But since the checkm8 vulnerability runs so early in the boot process, we too can demote the T2 into DFU mode.
Without checkm8, we would not be able to run unsigned code in DFU and thus not be able enable debug interfaces.

Good news is that if you are using FileVault2 as disk encryption, they do not have access to your data on disk <em>immediately</em>.
They can however inject a keylogger in the T2 firmware since it manages keyboard access, storing your password for retrieval or transmitting it in the case of a malicious hardware attachment.</p><p>The functionality of locking an Apple device remotely (e.g. via MDM or FindMy) can be bypassed (<em>Activation Lock</em>).</p><p>A firmware password does not mitigate this issue since it requires keyboard access, and thus needs the T2 chip to run first.</p><p>Any kernel extension could be whitelisted since the T2 chip decides which one to load during boot.</p><p>If the attack is able to alter your hardware (or sneak in a malicious USB-C cable), it would be possible to achieve a semi-tethered exploit.</p><p>While this may not sound as frightening, be aware that this is a perfectly possible attack scenario for state actors.

      <span>May 28, 2014</span>
    </p>
    
<p>This week, spreadsheets hit the news again, when data for a book written by economist Pikkety turned out to contain&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/05/23/financial_times_on_piketty_his_data_is_wrong.html">spreadsheet errors</a>. On this, Daniele Lemire wrote a blog post warning people&nbsp;<a href="http://lemire.me/blog/archives/2014/05/23/you-shouldnt-use-a-spreadsheet-for-important-work-i-mean-it/">not to use spreadsheets for serious work</a>. This is useless advice, let me explain why.</p>
<p><strong>1) Only a fool blames their&nbsp;tool</strong></p>
<p>Heathcare.gov is built in Java. Did people go around the interwebs shouting&nbsp;we all should stop using Java? Of course not! Because it is easy to see that the problems stemmed from other areas: process, time pressure, lack of testing and other (human) factors probably. See how silly it is to blame a tool? The same goes for spreadsheets. Yes, they are not so easy to test,&nbsp;but they have many benefits, like ‘liveness’ (immediate feedback), having data, metadata and calculations in one view, ease of deployment. In that sense, they have&nbsp;benefits over other programming environments.</p>
<p><strong>2) No, we do not know better!&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I have been working on spreadsheets as a researcher for about 5 years now, and during that time I spoke with a lot of spreadsheet users. Of course, I asked them why they would run a bank/insurance company/airline on spreadsheets. You know what many of them say?</p>
<p><em>“We asked IT to build this, they said it would take 6 months and half a million euros. And most likely it will be more expensive and not what we want.”</em></p>
<p>The reality is that it is just not feasible to build software for all business processes. We don’t have the manpower, and frankly, in many cases also not the domain skill needed. So what we need to do isn’t ridicule spreadsheet users.&nbsp;They have been disappointed by us many times. I already mentioned healthcare.gov and there are so many other IT screw-ups that it is almost&nbsp;arrogant to claim superiority over the spreadsheet users.</p>
<p><strong>3) Like democracy, spreadsheets are the worst, except for all others</strong></p>
<p>Then, in addition to our riducule, we try to push tools to them, “real” programming languages, that nor fit their needs nor their skills. They will never learn Java or C#. Python maybe, that seems to be easy to use for end-users, but certainly not for all of them. End-users are not programmers, they don’t want to be and they should not need to be.</p>
<p>Instead of shaming spreadsheet users, let’s focus on inventing better spreadsheet-killers tools (Tableau is my personal favorite at the moment). Or, and this is my line of research, help spreadsheet users to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.felienne.com/archives/2957">test</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://figshare.com/articles/Detecting_and_refactoring_code_smells_in_spreadsheet_formulas/980655">measure</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.felienne.com/archives/2964">refactor</a>. No one, really, no one, is helped with your judgement without thinking about alternatives.</p>

  <p>I meet regularly with early-career software developers. A few recurring meetings, 1x/week, plus ad-hoc calls as needed with others.</p>

<p>A question came up recently:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My three-month internship is close to wrapping up. The Co-founder/CEO/lead developer of the consulting company I’m at likes me, said he wishes he could hire me but cannot, because they don’t have enough work in the pipeline.</p>

  <p>He said he’d write me a letter of recommendation, and asked me to draft it for him.</p>

  <p>How do I write my own letter of recommendation, for my first real software development job?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Feels like a trap, huh?</p>

<p><img src="https://josh.works/images/office-hours-tufts.jpeg" alt="who are you?"></p>

<p><a href="https://admissions.tufts.edu/blogs/jumbo-talk/post/the-office-hours/"><em>source</em></a></p>

<p>Or, maybe they know you. They know you <em>too well</em></p>

<p><img src="https://josh.works/images/recommendation-warning.jpg" alt="untrustworthy"></p>

<p><a href="https://blacklawyermagic.wordpress.com/"><em>source</em></a></p>

<p>I explained a few concepts that we wanted to “speak to” in the letter. I’ll explain.</p>

<p>The software developer that I meet with mentioned that the CEO’s advice on the next job included “be able to speak to low liability”.</p>

<p>I wanted to dig into this “liability” piece.</p>

          How much does a bad hire cost? <a href="#how-much-does-a-bad-hire-cost">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>What’s the biggest risk in hiring?</p>

<p>It’s <em>the risk of a bad hire</em>.</p>

<p>How much does it cost to make a bad hire?</p>

<p>I would conservatively estimate that it costs $100,000 and nine months of your life. Here’s how the math works from a hiring manager’s point of view:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Spend a month and 25 hours of labor dev team manager labor to find/interview the candidate(s) and winnow the applicants down to someone to make an offer.  (the hiring manager would prefer to be doing <em>literally anything else but hiring</em>.)</li>
  <li>Extend an offer, wait 2-6 more weeks before the new candidate starts. It can be painful to wait another six weeks, because the team is currently short-staffed, and has been for a long time. That’s why they’re hiring!</li>
  <li>Start date! Start paying $150,000/yr or $3000/week for your shiny new employee.</li>
  <li>Pay $12,000 for the first month of them working, figuring out your dev environment, ticket management, who knows what parts of the codebase, and a few easy bug fixes.</li>
  <li>Start getting nervous. Employee not batting it out of the park like you’d hoped. Maybe still onboarding, give it another month (and $12,000 in payroll expense).</li>
  <li>OK. Three months in and another $36,000 in payroll later, you’re pretty sure there’s a problem.</li>
  <li>Start the pre-Performance Improvement Plan work. Talk to their team, their manager, them. Why is it not working? Why is the team <em>working slower</em> with this new team member, instead of working faster? <em>Not only are you wasting five figures of payroll, the rest of your expensive dev team is producing less as well!</em></li>
  <li>Pre-PIP work is over. Another $5k in payroll gone forever. Now it’s time to give the formal PIP, which everyone knows is “beginning the firing process”</li>
  <li>Two more months and $24,000 in payroll later, you fire the employee.</li>
  <li>You feel relief with having gotten rid of the bad employee. You’re thrilled that you can get back to normal work.</li>
  <li>Check the clock and balance sheet. It took you nine months and $100k to get to where you were at step 1.</li>
</ol>

<p>Add up the time/expense:</p>

<ol>
  <li>1-2 months to to find/hire a candidate.</li>
  <li>7-8 months (and $84K-$96k) to hire, trial them, try to help them be successful, give up on that plan, and fire them.</li>
  <li>Many hours spent thinking about this specific problem, talking with others about it.</li>
</ol>

<p>There’s nine months of your life. That’s 9 months of time, sure, but it’s also 9 months of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost">opportunity cost</a>. What if you’d hired a great candidate? They’d be rapidly approaching their first year on the job, and everyone would be happy about it, instead of this disaster you’ve had to deal with.</p>

<p>Here’s the really scary part: To large organizations (1000+ employees), <em>wasting $100k is meaningless compared to the wasted time and mis-directed effort</em>. The entire organization is more annoyed at having <em>lost the time of a productive software developer</em>. They don’t care that they lit a giant pile of money on fire, <em>they’re annoyed that their competitor is getting new features out the door and gaining marketshare and the future of their $x,000,000 company hangs in the balance</em>.</p>

<p>Oh, and the good managers, not only do they want to be wise with money and build features/gain market-share…</p>

<p>They want to see their team flourish.</p>

<p>Being fired is a life-defining moment. (I speak from experience)</p>

<p>If you’re a kind and empathetic person, <em>it’s particularly unpleasent to fire someone and it feels like a personal failure</em>.</p>

<p>You want to work for a kind and empathetic manager. (They’re not common, but they’re not impossible to find.)</p>

<p>So, tailor your letter to speak to the concerns of a kind and empathetic manager. This manager would:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Want to see you do well</li>
  <li>Want to see you develop your skills and competencies</li>
  <li>Want you to make meaningful contributions to the product</li>
  <li>Want a healthy team dynamic</li>
  <li>Want you to voice concerns and observations as relevant</li>
</ul>

<p>And much more</p>

          A Primary-goal for an early-career software developer: Telegraph Low Liability <a href="#a-primary-goal-for-an-early-career-software-developer-telegraph-low-liability">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>First, when I say <code>telegraph low liability</code> I mean it in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphing_(sports)">sports definition</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In sporting terminology, to <strong>telegraph</strong> is to unintentionally alert an opponent to one’s immediate situation or intentions. The sporting use of the term <em>telegraph</em> draws a direct comparison with the communication device of the same name. “Telegraphing” always refers to a reflexive physical action rather than a protracted or intellectual give-away. For example, a boxer rotating his shoulders to throw a hook would be telegraphing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should aim to “telegraph” that you’re a low-liability hire <em>without ever saying it so explicitely</em>. It’s a subtle thing, best communicated incidentally, not directly.</p>

<p>Five years ago, I wrote <a href="https://josh.works/so-you-want-to-work-remotely">So you want to work remotely…</a></p>

<p>Quoting myself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First, there’s the matter of framing how you go about working remotely. Obviously you want to work remotely, but put yourself in the shoes of a prospective employer. They don’t care if you work remotely or not - they want you to do great work for them and make them an effective, profitable organization.</p>

  <p>Companies that hire remotely tend to be younger, agile-er, and smaller. So every employee matters. Making a bad hire can be catastrophic in terms of money and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost">opportunity cost</a>. Your job is to make it very, very obvious that hiring YOU is a great decision. In fact, you want to be so good at what you do that passing up on you is a terrible decision.</p>

  <p>[…]</p>

  <p>When you can walk someone down the path from “Hire me” to “I’ll help you make <code>$x00,000/year</code> more than you would otherwise”, <em>you’re talking their language</em>. You’re <em>telegraphing</em> that you understand their concerns without ever stating their concern explicitly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To bring it full circle, here’s how I would go about <em>drafting</em> a CEO’s Letter of Recommendation <em>for me</em>. If you find this idea uncomfortable, don’t worry about it. That’s a sign of psychological health, that you don’t love putting flattering words <em>about yourself</em> into other people’s mouths.</p>
      
    

<p>Normally, that’s a good aversion to have. For this particular situation, you’ll have to bite the bullet and move on. I’m not going to give you the actual words (how could I?) but I’ll explain my process. I’ll include comments throughout:</p>
      <h3 id="1-draft-the-openingclosing">
        
        
          1. Draft the opening/closing <a href="#1-draft-the-openingclosing">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<div><div><pre><code>Hi there,

      <h3 id="2-provide-1-general-introductioncontext-sentence">
        
        
          2. Provide 1 general introduction/context sentence <a href="#2-provide-1-general-introductioncontext-sentence">#</a>

      </h3>
    

<p>This is the first uncomfortable sentence you’ll have to write:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Hi there,

I met {Zaniyah} {a few months ago} because {she and I crossed paths
at a local Ruby meetup}.

# No gushing required. A claim of "I would hire this

I wish I could hire them myself, but don't have the budget and work
lined up to utilize them to their full potential. 

Sincerely,
- Boss's name, Title, Company
</code></pre></div></div>
      
    

<p>This can be hard to think of an anecdote. It might take a few attempts to feel good about the one you’ve chosen and how you speak of it. Just write something down, see how you feel, delete it, write something else down, etc.</p>

make many updates to our onboarding documentation. 

It was rather out-of-date, and the team hadn't had new hires in a 
while. 

Any time she ran into friction or trouble, she would hunt down the 
answer, and immediately update the documentation so the next 
person would have a smoother process.

Sure enough, the next hire spent half the time she …</code></pre></div></div></article></div>

<p>We live in a world that is gradually and incessantly attracted by
over-rationality and order. In this article we’ll burst the enchanted
bubble and embrace corruption and chaos — We’re going to discuss the
topic of image glitch art.</p>

<h2 id="w̸h̸a̷t̴̶s̴-̶a̴-̷g̷l̸i̷t̴c̵h̵">w̸h̸a̷t̴’̶s̴ ̶a̴ ̷g̷l̸i̷t̴c̵h̵</h2>

<p>Welcome to the land of creative destruction: image glitch art. Our story
starts with a simple idea: glitching a wallpaper to create a slideshow
of corrupted pictures.<br>
The unfortunate victim of our crime: The world (Right click <strong>&gt;</strong> View
image, while keeping the <strong>Control</strong> key pressed, to admire it in more
details while its still in its pristine form):</p>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/glitch_art/world_map.jpg" alt="World Map, nominal case" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>Before we begin, let’s attempt to define what we’re trying to do: What
is glitch art?<br>
Like any art movement, words can barely express the essence behind the
meaning, they are but fleeting and nebulous. Regardless, I’ll be an
infidel and valiantly express what I think glitch art is.</p>

<p>A glitch is a perturbation, a minor malfunction, a spurious signal. In
computers, glitches are predominantly accidental events that are
undesirable and could possibly corrupt data.<br>
Glitch art started as people developed a liking for such unusual events
and the effects glitches had on the media they were perturbing. Some started
to collect these glitches that happened naturally in the wild, and others
started to intentionally appropriate the effects by manually performing them.<br>
In the art scene, some started using image processing to “fake” true
glitching effects.</p>

<p>Glitches happen all the time and everywhere, information is never as
durable and reliable as we might like it to be, and living in a physical
world makes it even less so. You’ve probably encountered or heard of the
effect of putting a magnet next to anything electronic that hasn’t been
rugged to withstand such scenario.<br>
That’s why many techniques have been put in place to avoid glitches,
at all layers, from the hardware storage, to the software reading
and interpreting it. Be it error correcting codes (ECC) or error detection
algorithms, they are all enemies of glitch art and the chaos we like.</p>

<p>However, this niche aesthetic is more than a fun pass-time for computer
aficionado, there is a bigger picture. Similar to painters with
brushes on a canvas, we are offered a material, an object to work with
— a material made of bits and formatted in a specific way.<br>
Like any object, our medium has a form and meaning, it can move, it has
a size, it can be transferred, and interpreted — information theory
is the field interested in this.<br>
Like any object, our medium can be subject and react to deformations,
forces, and stressors. How it flows is what the field of rheology
is interested in (not to be confused with computational rheology, the
field of fluid simulation.) The medium fluidity can be studied to answer
questions such as: is it elastic, solid, viscous, or oily, how does it
respond, within the bound of information theory, to different types of
applied forces.</p>

<p>Here are some words you may encounter and that you definitely want
to know:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Misregistration: Whenever a physical medium misread data because of
damages caused by scratches, dirt, smudges, gamma rays, or any other
treasures the universe throws at us.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Datamoshing, Photomosh, Imagemosh: Abusing the format of a medium,
normally compression artefacts, to create glitches. For example, video
compression often use i-frames for fixed images and p-frame for the
movement/transition of pixels on that image. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datamoshing/">Removing i-frames is a
common glitching method</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Databending: An idea taken from circuit bending, bending the circuit
board of a toy to generate weird sounds. Databending is about bending
the medium into another unrelated one, reinterpreting it as something
it is not meant to be.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Let me add that glitch art is vast and fascinating, this article is but a
glimpse into this space. If you’re captivated as much as I am, please take
a look at <a href="http://gli.tc/h/0nline/">gli.tc</a> and <a href="https://beyondresolution.info/">Rosa Menkman’s Beyond
Resolution</a>. Images can be pleasantly
destroyed in a great number of ways to create masterpieces.</p>

<p>Before starting let’s give some advices:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Back up your precious files before corrupting them.</li>
  <li>Any glitching techniques can be combined and/or applied multiple times.</li>
  <li>Sometimes too little has no effect, and sometimes too much can destroy
the file.</li>
  <li>It’s all about trials and errors, especially errors that result in
glitches.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="̷h̷o̵w̶-̵t̸o̴-̶i̷n̶d̸u̷c̶e̵-̶a̸-̶g̸l̵i̷t̶c̸h̴">̷H̷o̵w̶ ̵T̸o̴ ̶I̷n̶d̸u̷c̶e̵ ̶A̸ ̶G̸l̵i̷t̶c̸h̴</h3>

<p>Now it’s time to think about how we can apply our mischievous little
stimuli, its size, the level or layer at which it’ll be applied, and
the methodological recipe we’ll concoct to poison our images.</p>

<p>Glitch artist Benjamin Berg classifies glitches into 3 categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Incorrect Editing: Editing a file using a software that
wasn’t made to edit such file. Like editing an image file as if it
was a text file.</li>
  <li>Reinterpretation aka Databending: Convert or read a file as if it was
another type of medium. Like listening to an image file as if it was
an audio file (aka sonification).</li>
  <li>Forced errors, Datamoshing, and Misregistration: A software or hardware
bug to force specific errors in the file. This can be about the
corruption of specific bytes in the file to induce glitches, or
something happening accidentally like a device turning off when saving
a file.</li>
</ul>

<p>So let’s get to work!</p>

<h3 id="m̷a̵s̵h̸i̶n̶g̷-̴t̶h̷e̷-̷d̶a̸t̵a̸-̸r̷a̸n̶d̶o̸m̴l̵y̷">M̷a̵s̵h̸i̶n̶g̷ ̴T̶h̷e̷ ̷D̶a̸t̵a̸ ̸R̷a̸n̶d̶o̸m̴l̵y̷</h3>

<p>The easiest, but roughest, way to glitch a file is to put on our monkey
suit and overwrite or add random bytes in our image. As you would have
guessed, this isn’t very efficient but half the time it does the trick
and forces errors.</p>

<p>This technique is better suited for stronger materials like images in
raw format — without metadata and headers. We’ll understand why in a bit.<br>
To convert the file to raw format, open it in GIMP, select <strong>Export As</strong>,
select the file by extension, and choose the raw type. For now, it doesn’t
matter if you pick pixel-ordered or planar, but we’ll come back to this
choice later because it’s an important one.</p>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/glitch_art/gimp_saveas_raw.jpg" alt="GIMP process to save image as raw" loading="lazy"></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">file world_map.data
<span># world_map.data: Targa image data - Map (771-3) 771 x 259 x 1 - 1-bit alpha "\003\003\003\003\003\003\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001\001"</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You should also note the width and height of the image as it now doesn’t
contain this information anymore, and we’ll need those to reopen it in
GIMP. In our case it is <code>2000x1479</code>.</p>

<p>We now proceed to hand over the file to our least favorite
staff and let them have an anger tantrum at it. So what does
it look like, let’s take a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6NMiuU0ys">the result our monkey
did</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/glitch_art/world_map_random_bytes.jpg" alt="World Map, monkey have been randomly mashing the
world" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>Not bad at all for something random, but we can do better.</p>

<h3 id="c̸o̶m̸p̷r̶e̷s̸s̵i̸o̶n̴-̶d̵e̵f̶o̶r̴m̷a̶t̷i̵o̸n̷">C̸o̶m̸p̷r̶e̷s̸s̵i̸o̶n̴ ̶D̵e̵f̶o̶r̴m̷a̶t̷i̵o̸n̷</h3>

<p>Some medium are more malleable when squished properly and squished
in different ways. The image sheds a lot of information and only the
essence stays. That’s a form of databending.<br>
For example, increasing the compression of JPEG images can open the path
for glitches to happen more frequently. This is a key asset, especially
when trying to create errors related to the compression parameters within
the format of the file.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">convert <span>-quality</span> 2 world_map.jpg world_map_compressed.jpg</code></pre></figure>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/glitch_art/world_map_compressed.jpg" alt="World Map, compressed to extract its
essence" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>Keep this in your toolbox to use along with other techniques.</p>

<h3 id="g̵e̴t̵t̶i̸n̵g̷-̴i̸n̵t̷i̵m̷a̴t̸e̴-̸w̶i̵t̸h̶-̴t̵h̸e̸-̴f̷o̴r̶m̸a̴t̷">G̵e̴t̵t̶i̸n̵g̷ ̴I̸n̵t̷i̵m̷a̴t̸e̴ ̸W̶i̵t̸h̶ ̴T̵h̸e̸ ̴F̷o̴r̶m̸a̴t̷</h3>

<p>We want to corrupt in the most efficient way possible, to create
attractive chaos from the smallest change possible. To do that we have to
get intimate with the medium, to understand its deepest secrets, tickle
the image in the right places. This is what we previously referred to
as imagemoshing.</p>

<p>There’s a panoply of image formats, and they all are special in their
own ways. However, there’s still some commonality:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Header, Footer, and Metadata: If the format contains these extra
information, be it extraneous or essential, what they represent, and
how they affect the rest of the image.</li>
  <li>Compression: The format can either be compressed or not. When it is
compressed, there can be extra bits of information to help other software
uncompress the image data.</li>
  <li>How the data is laid out: Usually, the image color information is
decomposed into its components such as HSL, RGB, or others. These
components then need to be represented in the image data, either in
an interleaved or planar manner. Planar refers to writing components
independently in the data (<em>ex:</em> all R, then all G, then all B),
while interleaved refers to having them joined non-contiguously in an
alternate sequence (<em>ex:</em> RGB, then RGB, then RGB..).</li>
</ul>

<p>Manipulating these to our advantage can lead to wonderful glitches. For
example, in our previous raw image example — an image bare of header,
footer, and without compression — the pixels were interleaved which
gave rise to the effect we’ve seen, namely shifts and changes in some
colors. Having them in planar form would’ve led to different glitches
in separate color channels.</p>

<h3 id="r̵e̷i̷n̴t̶e̷r̶p̸r̴e̸t̸a̷t̶i̷o̵n̴-̵a̸s̵-̵r̸i̷c̵h̸-̸t̷e̵x̵t̴-̴a̴k̷a̸-̷w̶o̴r̵d̴p̴a̸d̵-̷e̵f̸f̴e̶c̶t̶">R̵e̷i̷n̴t̶e̷r̶p̸r̴e̸t̸a̷t̶i̷o̵n̴ ̵A̸s̵ ̵R̸i̷c̵h̸ ̸T̷e̵x̵t̴ ̴A̴K̷A̸ ̷W̶o̴r̵d̴P̴a̸d̵ ̷E̵f̸f̴e̶c̶t̶</h3>

<p>Let’s give this a try with the well-known WordPad effect, which is about
databending an image into rich text: opening the image in WordPad and
saving it.<br>
Keep in mind that this only works with raw images as it’s highly
destructive and otherwise could break fragile key info in the header
and footer. So let’s reuse our interleaved raw image of earlier but also
get a planar one.</p>

<p>This is our results for interleaved:</p>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/glitch_art/world_map_wordpad.interleaved.corrupt.jpg" alt="World Map, WordPad effect interleaved" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>And for planar:</p>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/glitch_art/world_map_wordpad.planar.corrupt.jpg" alt="World Map, WordPad effect planar" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>Technically, what happens is that during the bending and interpretations
as rich text, some bytes are inserted in some …</p></article></div></div>

        <blockquote><p>Applications need to go global, but language support comes at a cost. For one thing, supporting multiple languages demands additional testing rigor.</p></blockquote>
<p>For many businesses trying to get ahead in an increasingly competitive world, multi-language support is a must-have feature. Internationalization – or I18N, as it’s frequently abbreviated for the 18 letters between the I and the N – helps to make software more accessible to users in other countries and also can provide an important advantage for non-native speakers in your own country.</p>
<p>There’s an entire software development side to I18N, obviously. However, testing can be as critical, if not more so, than plopping language support into the code. Below are five gotchas to look out for when testing software internationalization.</p>
<h3>The German problem</h3>
<p>German has become the poster child for words and phrases that can blow up on you when translated. Consider a label for a form with the text “Job Description.” That’s 14 characters in English, but the corresponding German phrase is “Arbeitsbeschreibung,” which clocks in at a whopping 19 characters.</p>
<p>This can create headaches on several fronts. The most obvious is that if the layout is tight and you didn’t make allowances for labels to expand and contract, you can end up with truncated text (or worse, abominations such as “Arbeit…reibung”). Modern responsive web design has minimized this issue, but in “pixel-perfect” apps such as games, it can bite you in a tender place.</p>
<p>Also, languages such as German can string many words into one long mega-word, which can cause text to break awkwardly in a paragraph if the text field is too narrow. Even if there’s space for all the text in, for example, a scrolling text box, it may end up looking like an ugly staircase if there are lines with only one or two words and a lot of white space at the end. And speaking of the end…</p>
<h3>Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left Right, B, A, Start</h3>
<p>English speakers are used to certain conventions as to text and forms. Labels are on the left, fields on the right. But what happens when you translate an application into Hebrew (which reads right to left), or Asian languages that read top to bottom. As far as I know, there are no languages that read bottom to top, thank goodness, but you do still need to make sure that all of your text lays out correctly to the regional norms for each languages.</p>
<p>This may mean reversing the entire screen layout, or perhaps just changing justification rules. But when testing, you need to make sure that it make sense and follows the natural flow for native speakers.</p>
<h3>Injection molding</h3>
<p>It’s very common for programmers to create formatting strings that inject a value in the middle. For example, in pseudo-code, you might have something like:</p>
<p><code>print(“You have “ + balance + “ points.”)</code></p>
<p>Inevitably, someone points out that when you have one point, the application prints “1 points” – so you fix the code to:</p>
<p><code>if points == 1:<br>
print(“You have 1 point”)<br>
else<br>
print(“You have “ + balance + “points”)</code></p>
<p>The problem with this strategy comes when you internationalize your software. When you substitute the “You have” and “points” into other languages, you can encounter problems with plurals. You may also have to watch out for things like the genders of objects (“el” vs “la” in Spanish, for example, and then add in plural rules for “los” and “las”). If you don’t get these things right when you do your string construction and formatting, you can end up with things that are the equivalent of “You has three banana in your carts.”</p>
<h3>Reuse abuse</h3>
<p>Most internationalization is accomplished by maintaining a dictionary file that maps a key (i.e. “THANK_YOU”) to a value in each language (Gracias, etc.). When a developer needs to internationalize a string, they usually start by looking for an existing mapping. That’s all well and good until you get a word that has multiple meanings.</p>
<p>Consider the entry for “trolley.” You might be referring to a cart in one case, and a form of mass transit in another. A shopping site might sell tea trolleys and also have directions for how to get to the store by public transportation. If the developer used the same word (el carrito) for both, you might end up asking your customers to ride a beverage cart to the store.</p>
<p>Of course, blindly literal translations of idioms or jargon can also lead to hilarity down the road. In general, you really need a native speaker (or at least a highly proficient speaker) to QA internationalized application versions.</p>
<h3>Dollars, cents, and other regionalization</h3>
<p>Does your application display currency information? How about dates? temperatures?</p>
<p>Well, depending on the region, there can be very different conventions for how to display them. In France, the Euro symbol goes after the amount, while in the UK, it goes before. Europe uses DD/MM/YYYY while the U.S. uses MM/DD/YYYY. This can affect not only display fields, but input fields too.</p>
<p>Metric vs. Imperial units is another fun example. Consider this variation on an earlier code snippet.</p>
<p><code>if temp == 1:<br>
print(“It is one degree out”)<br>
else<br>
print(“It is “ + convertToLocal(temp) + “degrees out”)</code></p>
<p>In this case, convertToLocal is a function that converts to the device/user’s unit preference (C or F).&nbsp; If it’s 32.5F (1C), you end up with “It is 1 degrees out” because the comparison isn’t done on the localized temperature. This type of stuff crops up all the time.</p>
<h2>A final word</h2>
<p>Testing I18N functionality isn’t just a matter of making sure that all the text in the application appears to be in the correct language. Formatting, context, appropriate grammar, and differences in conventions can all lead to software that is off-putting to someone in a difference region, or even downright offensive. If you’re going to make the effort to localize your software, it makes sense to invest in appropriate testing resources.</p>

When developing large scale software projects it was difficult to manage changes to source code over time, as revision control tools were only starting to enter mainstream computing.</p><p>The adoption of version control tools, first centralized and then distributed, changed all that, and now even when a developer works alone, she’ll find it easier to work with Git than to manage the files on her own.</p><p>Version control systems were only the beginning of the revolution in efficiency, but they were the basis for the CI/CD capabilities by allowing to cleanly separate the development and release phases. Today working without these is unimaginable.</p><p>The world of data is now where the world of code was 50 years ago. We manage large data sets on object storages (e.g. S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCS), essentially a huge shared folder, and hope for the best. Although this environment has proven to be cost effective and scalable, managing data pipelines over it is highly error prone.</p><p>As data engineers, we should manage data the way we manage code. We should have a simple way to create a development environment, a safe way to consciously ingest data into our data lake, and a resilient production environment we deploy new data to. It was with this need in mind that lakeFS was created.</p><h2>Development Environment</h2><p>As part of our routine work with data we develop new code, improve and upgrade old code, upgrade infrastructures, and test new technologies.</p><p>lakeFS enables a safe development environment on your data lake without the need to copy or mock data, work on the pipelines or involve DevOps.</p><p>Creating a <a href="https://docs.lakefs.io/branching/model.html">branch</a> provides you an isolated environment with a snapshot of your repository (any part of your data lake you chose to manage on lakeFS). While working on your own branch in isolation, all other data users will be looking at the repository’s master branch. They can’t see your changes, and you don’t see changes to master done after you created the branch.&nbsp;</p><p>No worries, no data duplication is done, it’s all metadata management behind the scenes.</p><p>Let’s look at 3 examples of a development environment and their branching models.</p><h4><strong>Example 1: Upgrading Spark and using Revert action</strong></h4><p>You installed the latest version of Apache Spark. As a first step you’ll test your Spark jobs to see that the upgrade doesn’t have any undesired side effects.</p><p>For this purpose, you may create a branch (testing-spark-3.0) which will only be used to test the Spark upgrade, and discarded later. Jobs may run smoothly (the theoretical possibility exists!), or they may fail halfway through, leaving you with some intermediate partitions, data and metadata.</p><p>In this case, you can simply <strong>revert</strong> the branch to its original state, without worrying about the intermediate results of your last experiment. You can perform another (hopefully successful) test in an isolated branch. Revert actions are atomic and immediate, so no manual cleanup is required.</p><p>Once testing is completed and you have achieved the desired result, you can delete this experimental branch. Data that wasn’t used on any other branch will be deleted with it.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/4muYGGlBlctZCojZZ-atiEXDcezASOKsPlEBrJvx59RxZy0n_rPlXiJWCPhVHlNqZa_x4ANVUTK00OAmun_cpKUJFjVxlE4FQTruHjAmt6uNf0ImLLqtt4YM0yCQReR8rjhtVz1m" alt="Safe experimentation on your data" width="580" height="218" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption><span>Example 1: Safe experimentation&nbsp;</span></figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Example 2: Compare – Which option is better?</strong></h4><p>Easily compare by testing which one performs better on your data set.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Benchmarks may be:</strong></p><ul><li>Different computation tools, e.g Spark vs. <a href="https://lakefs.io/2020/08/31/the-quick-guide-for-running-presto-locally-on-s3/">Presto</a></li><li>Compression algorithms</li><li>Spark configurations</li><li>Code versions of an ETL</li></ul><p>Run each experiment on its own independent branch, while the master remains untouched. Once both experiments are done, create a comparison query (using <a href="https://docs.lakefs.io/using/glue_hive_metastore.html">hive or presto</a> or any other tool of your choice) to compare data characteristics, performance or any other metric you see fit.</p><p>With lakeFS you don’t need to worry about creating data paths for the experiments, copying data, and remembering to delete it. It’s substantially easier to avoid errors and maintain a clean lake after.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/axR5MOFKm0ltk-YRMzfwaKpQ3lRhRLa4CgyCCjt49yqsPnrBkNXFQ1btxbkhttEEnTrCAwQLzYOVBXZjKLNqkEPdXRexNvorIalQ_kKtUlSySg5eU3qE0bcRnR4e0dnHA4fO-q3a" alt="Fast and reliable comparisons on real data" width="580" height="293" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption><span>Example 2: Fast and reliable comparisons&nbsp;</span></figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Example 3: Reproduce – A bug in production</strong></h4><p>You upgraded spark and deployed&nbsp; changes in&nbsp; production. A few days or weeks later, you identify a data quality issue, a performance degradation or an increase to your infra costs. Something that requires investigation and fixing (aka, a bug).</p><p>lakeFS allows you to open a branch of your lake from the specific merge/commit that introduced the changes to production. Using the metadata saved on the merge/commit you can reproduce all aspects of the environment, then reproduce the issue on the branch and debug it.</p><p>Meanwhile,&nbsp; you can revert the master to a previous point in time, or keep it as is, depending on the use case.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TvnxIDLXqb9VElUN8xKvyR9R4Ytv00jATc3ewhalu_Dm7dxXV31kIIDC0RedLtPpg6Mo-EqlrIntSX2TPfIp6fK89ucEJ9fRUaN10Q9nE7JS85D_y7Qyxjjv7MUfe1WIFMRpiPWe" alt="Branch to reproduce " width="576" height="250" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption><span>Example 3: Branch to reproduce&nbsp;</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Continuous Integration</h2><p>Everyday data lake management includes ingestion of new data collections, and a growing number of consumers reading and writing analysis results to the lake.</p><p>In order to ensure our lake is reliable we need to validate new data sources, enforce good practices to maintain a clean lake (avoid the swamp) and validate metadata.</p><p>lakeFS simplifies continuous integration of data to the lake by supporting ingestion on a designated branch. Merging data to master is enabled only if conditions apply. To make this tenable, let’s look at a few examples:</p><h4><strong>Example 1: Pre-merge hooks – enforce best practices</strong></h4><p>Examples of good practices enforced in organizations:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul><li>No user_* columns except under /private/…</li><li>Only (*.parquet | *.orc | _delta_log/*.json) files allowed</li><li>Under /<strong>production</strong>, only backwards-compatible schema changes are allowed</li><li>New tables on master must be registered in our metadata repository first, with owner and SLA</li></ul><p>lakeFS will assist in enforcing best practices by giving you a designated branch&nbsp; to ingest new data (“new-data-1” in the drawing). . You may run automated tests to validate&nbsp; predefined&nbsp; best practices as pre-merge hooks. If the validation passes, the new data will be automatically and atomically merged to the master branch. However, if the validation fails, you will be alerted, and the new data will not be exposed to consumers.</p><p>By using this branching model and implementing best practices as pre merge hooks, you ensure the master lake is never compromised.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pp0SCgLhZC9gPDgHWS4sPtbrqFOGQIEJ3_hg6Y0SddVF-QyXoLKSKQ3GwAC7N1ueyRihKtF_lOgVlDbbcUntK7XUfrZg1lzQEmBeURyuHBfETkek-D5t0iZz205asn5hM8zD3uyT" alt="Branch enabling pre-commit hooks" width="577" height="281" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption><span>Example 1: Branch enabling pre-commit hooks</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Continuous Deployment</h2><p>Not every day we introduce new data to the lake, or add/change ETLs, but we do have recurring jobs that are running, and updates to our existing data collections. Even if&nbsp; the code and infra didn’t change, the data might, and those changes introduce quality issues.</p><p>This is one of the complexities of a data product, the data we consume changes over the course of a month, a week, or even a single day.&nbsp;</p><p>Examples of changes to data that may occur:</p><ul><li>A client side bug in the data collection of website events</li><li>A new Android version that interferes with the collecting events from your App</li><li>COVID-19 abrupt impact on consumers behavior, and its effect on the accuracy of ML models</li><li>During a change to Salesforce interface, the validation requirement from a certain field was lost</li></ul><p>lakeFS helps you validate your expectations and assumptions from the data itself.</p><h4><strong>Example 1: Pre merge hook – a data quality issue</strong></h4><p>Continuous deployment of existing data we expect to consume, flowing from our ingest-pipelines into the lake. Similar to the Continuous Integration use-case, we create an ingest branch (“events-data”). This allows us to create tests using data analysis tools or data quality services (e.g. <a href="https://greatexpectations.io/">Great Expectations</a>, <a href="https://www.montecarlodata.com/">Monte Carlo</a>) to ensure reliability of the data we merge to the master branch. Since merge is atomic, no performance issue will be introduced by using lakeFS, but your master branch will only include quality data.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/L0LmOd2venczg6b0fG_gGoFLhiiMZRBikBJpdPCXnHZ60ha_bhngnSKgRwVCTBO8KNfX9PMg-fBT8KpKluldMLCWANZsR80uxTnQzWwCRCq3Kd-skALOpIaReBdgR-x94vycpH31" alt="Pre-merge hooks for data quality" width="581" height="283" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption><span>Example 1: Pre-merge hooks for data quality</span></figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Example 2: RollBack! Data ingested from a Kafka stream</strong></h4><p>If you introduce a new code version to production and discover it has a critical bug, you can simply roll back to the previous version. But you also need to roll back the results of running it.&nbsp; lakeFS gives you the power to rollback your data if you introduced low quality data.</p><p>The rollback is an atomic action that prevents the data consumers from receiving low quality data until the issue is resolved.</p><p>As previously mentioned, with lakeFS the recommended branching schema is to ingest data to a dedicated branch. When streaming data, we can decide to merge the incoming data to master at a given time interval or checkpoint, depending on how we chose to write it from <a href="https://docs.lakefs.io/using/kakfa.html">Kafka</a>. You can run quality tests for each merge (as presented in Example 1). Alas, tests are not perfect and we might still introduce low quality data at some point. In such a case, we can rollback master to the last known high quality commit, since our commits for streaming will include the metadata of the Kafka offset.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/SohaYl1t6ggaXNSp-TgzgwN6QeEAUebOa8hgMfc1oVYcmOafYJAQEbitvaF2KRcNVQbB4qgvLkE055vEPflyhXh1YxDZYe0Q-wHCJIzG5vzLYGzSKLJjq2uOBoxNpaHO_uPAstkL" alt="Rollback to safety" width="581" height="281" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption><span>Example 2: Rollback to safety</span></figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Example 3: Cross collection consistency</strong></h4><p>We often need consistency between different data collections. A few examples may be to:</p><ul><li>Join different collections in order to create a unified view of an account, a user or another entity we measure.</li><li>Introduce the same data in different formats</li><li>Introduce the same data with a different leading index or sorting due to performance considerations</li></ul><p>lakeFS will help ensure you introduce only consistent data to your consumers by exposing the new collections and their join in one atomic action to master. Once you consumed the collections on a different branch, and only when both are synchronized, we calculated the join and merged to master.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/LDjuIPQyIwcWc2e5UbbXFWNRE9DxuCD2Pcnm8q3tpgfMasVswq1tLK_dDJLy275ln0NMMLUkukNah458i3v7KNoFU99AJYXBoz6rSPxTL5lrvDcNFeJOfMCfBCAuZKAxf7CfldyE" alt="Cross collection consistency" width="576" height="259" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption><span>Example 3: Cross collection consistency</span></figcaption></figure><p>In this example you can see two data sets (Sales data and Marketing data) consumed each to its own independent branch.</p><p>Once the write of both data sets is completed, they are merged to a different branch (leads branch) where the join ETL runs and creates a joined collection by account. The joined table is then merged to master.</p><p>The same logic can apply if the data is ingested in streaming, using standard formats, or formats that allow upsert/delete such as Apache Hudi, Delta Lake or Iceberg.</p><h5><strong>Check out the project’s&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS">GitHub …</a></strong></h5></div></div></article></div>

    &nbsp; — &nbsp;
    April 24, 2020
  </p>
  <p>I show how two domain-specific type systems, information flow control and two-party communication protocols, can be implemented in Rust using type-level programming. I explain how interesting properties of these domains can be verified at compile-time. Finally, I construct a general correspondence between type operators, logic programs, and their encoding in Rust.</p>
  <p>Typestate is the concept of encoding state machines in a programming language’s type system. While not specific to Rust, typestate has been <a href="http://cs242.stanford.edu/f19/lectures/08-2-typestate">explored</a> <a href="https://yoric.github.io/post/rust-typestate/">elsewhere</a> <a href="https://blog.systems.ethz.ch/blog/2018/a-hammer-you-can-only-hold-by-the-handle.html">at length</a> in the context of Rust. Typestate boils down to four ideas:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Each state is represented as a unique type.</li>
  <li>State transitions are only available as methods for the corresponding state type.</li>
  <li>Taking a state transition returns a state machine of the new state type.</li>
  <li>State transitions invalidate old state.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, here’s a state machine for a send-then-receive channel:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Each state is a unique type</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Receiving</span><span>;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Sending</span><span>;</span>

<span>// The state machine is parameterized by the state</span>
<span>#[repr(transparent)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Channel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>State</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>chan</span><span>:</span> <span>...</span><span>,</span>
  <span>_</span><span>state</span><span>:</span> <span>PhantomData</span><span>&lt;</span><span>State</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>}</span>


<span>// Methods for the state are uniquely associated with only the state</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>Channel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Receiving</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// recv consumes ownership, ensuring old state is invalidated</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>recv</span><span>(</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>Channel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Sending</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>msg</span> <span>=</span> <span>self</span><span>.chan</span><span>.recv</span><span>();</span>
    <span>// The state type changes after executing a transition</span>
    <span>(</span><span>unsafe</span> <span>{</span> <span>transmute</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>},</span> <span>msg</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>Channel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Sending</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<p>This pattern works effectively for simple finite state machines, where the logic to determine the next state is straightforward. In this note, I will explore situations where determining the next state is not so simple. In the process, we’ll talk about <strong>type-level programming</strong>, or how you can use Rust’s type system to encode <strong>computations on types</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Part of the goal of this note is to show the value of type-level programming in practice. These same mechanisms have already been used for more esoteric purposes like <a href="https://sdleffler.github.io/RustTypeSystemTuringComplete/">showing Rust’s type system is Turing complete</a>, but I think type-level programming can really help us design better systems!</p>

<h2 id="1-information-flow-control">1. Information flow control</h2>

<p>As a first example, consider a basic information flow control problem. In our program we have low security values (anyone can read them) and high security values (only authorized users can read them).</p>

<p>We represent this idea like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Each security level is a type</span>

<span>// Constructors for building items of a particular security</span>

    <span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>.t</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We would like to have a vector of these items with the following property:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If all of the items are low security, anyone can read any item.</li>
  <li>If any of the items are high security, only an authorized user can read any item.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, our vector should pass this test:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>SecureVec</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>lo</span> <span>=</span> <span>Item</span><span>::</span><span>low_sec</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>let</span> <span>hi</span> <span>=</span> <span>Item</span><span>::</span><span>high_sec</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>);</span>
<span>let</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>v</span><span>.push</span><span>(</span><span>lo</span><span>);</span>         <span>// v is still low sec</span>
<span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>v</span><span>.get</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>),</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>   <span>// ok to read v</span>

<span>let</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>v</span><span>.push</span><span>(</span><span>hi</span><span>);</span>         <span>// v is now high sec</span>
<span>// assert_eq!(v.get(0), 1); // can't read any more, compiler error</span>

<span>let</span> <span>w</span> <span>=</span> <span>HighSecWitness</span><span>::</span><span>login</span><span>();</span>
<span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>v</span><span>.get_secure</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>w</span><span>),</span> <span>2</span><span>);</span> <span>// can read after login</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A basic type-state attempt looks like this. We can create and read a low-security vector:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#[repr(transparent)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>SecureVec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>Level</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>items</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Item</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>Level</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>,</span>
  <span>_</span><span>marker</span><span>:</span> <span>PhantomData</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Level</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>SecureVec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>new</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>SecureVec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>SecureVec</span> <span>{</span> <span>items</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(),</span> <span>_</span><span>marker</span><span>:</span> <span>PhantomData</span> <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>get</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>:</span> <span>usize</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>T</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>.items</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And we can protect a high-security vector through a witness:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>HighSecWitness</span><span>;</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>HighSecWitness</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// sprinkle some high-security authentication in here...</span>
  <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>login</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>HighSecWitness</span> <span>{</span> <span>HighSecWitness</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>


<span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>SecureVec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>HighSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>get_secure</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>:</span> <span>usize</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>witness</span><span>:</span> <span>HighSecWitness</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>T</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>.items</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, to the main idea: how can we implement <code>push</code>? There are four possible state combinations: a high/low security vector with a high/low security item. While we can implement each combination as a separate method, it’s simpler to consider the underlying logic. <code>push</code> should return a vector of level <code>max(vec_level, item_level)</code> where <code>max(hi, lo) = hi</code>.</p>

<p>Our goal is to encode <code>max</code> as a <em>type-level computation</em>, i.e. an operator on types. The high-level idea:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Traits definitions are function signatures from types to types.</li>
  <li>Trait type parameters represent inputs and associated types represent outputs.</li>
  <li>Trait implementations define individual mappings from inputs to outputs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are those ideas in action to compute the max security level:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Self (implicitly) is the left operand, Other is the right operand,</span>
<span>// and Output is the output</span>
<span>trait</span> <span>ComputeMaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Other</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>type</span> <span>Output</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// These impls define the core computation</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>ComputeMaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>LowSec</span><span>&gt;</span>  <span>for</span> <span>LowSec</span>  <span>{</span> <span>type</span> <span>Output</span> <span>=</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>;</span>  <span>}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>ComputeMaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HighSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>LowSec</span>  <span>{</span> <span>type</span> <span>Output</span> <span>=</span> <span>HighSec</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>ComputeMaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>LowSec</span><span>&gt;</span>  <span>for</span> <span>HighSec</span> <span>{</span> <span>type</span> <span>Output</span> <span>=</span> <span>HighSec</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>ComputeMaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HighSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>HighSec</span> <span>{</span> <span>type</span> <span>Output</span> <span>=</span> <span>HighSec</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>

<span>// The type alias gives us a more convenient way to "call" the type operator</span>
<span>type</span> <span>MaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>L</span><span>,</span> <span>R</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>L</span> <span>as</span> <span>ComputeMaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>R</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>::</span><span>Output</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most confusing part is the <code>MaxLevel</code> alias. In brief: <code>L as ComputeMaxLevel&lt;R&gt;</code> says “treat <code>L</code> as the trait object <code>ComputeMaxLevel&lt;R&gt;</code>”. This is necessary since multiple computation traits may have associated <code>Output</code> with <code>L</code>, so the explicit cast disambiguates the <code>MaxLevel</code> computation from the rest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s an example of using the type operator:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>_</span> <span>:</span> <span>MaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HighSec</span><span>,</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>HighSec</span><span>;</span> <span>// ok</span>
<span>let</span> <span>_</span> <span>:</span> <span>MaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>LowSec</span> <span>,</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>;</span>  <span>// ok</span>
<span>let</span> <span>_</span> <span>:</span> <span>MaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>LowSec</span> <span>,</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>HighSec</span><span>;</span> <span>// type error</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, we can implement <code>SecureVec::push</code> in one method:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>VecLevel</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>SecureVec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>VecLevel</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>push</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ItemLevel</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span>
    <span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>,</span>
    <span>t</span><span>:</span> <span>Item</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ItemLevel</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
  <span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>SecureVec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>MaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ItemLevel</span><span>,</span> <span>VecLevel</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span>
  <span>where</span>
    <span>ItemLevel</span><span>:</span> <span>ComputeMaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>VecLevel</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>unsafe</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>self</span><span>.items</span><span>.push</span><span>(</span><span>transmute</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>));</span>
      <span>transmute</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice the usage of <code>MaxLevel</code> in the return type of <code>push</code>. This is the key use of the type operator as a type-level computation. The other main component is the <code>where</code> clause: when used generically (over any possible <code>ItemLevel</code>), we have to use a trait bound to ensure that <code>ComputeMaxLevel</code> can be “called” on <code>ItemLevel</code>.</p>

<p>Excellent! We’ve now used a type-level computation to more abstractly specify typestate in our information flow control API. Next, we’ll look at an example with a more complex type-level program.</p>

<h2 id="2-two-party-communication-protocols">2. Two-party communication protocols</h2>

<p>When two parties synchronously communicate with each other (e.g. a client and server exchanging information), that communication protocol can be modeled as a session type. We’re going to look at session types <a href="https://munksgaard.me/papers/laumann-munksgaard-larsen.pdf">implemented in Rust</a>. While their full implementation is beyond the scope of the post (see the linked paper or my <a href="http://cs242.stanford.edu/f19/lectures/09-1-session-types">course notes</a>), I will focus on the aspects of session types that showcase type-level programming.</p>

<p>Session types are a domain-specific language of state machines, described by this grammar:</p>



<p>For example, this session type describes a ping server that sends and receives a ping in a loop, exiting on demand. The label/goto scheme uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_index">de Bruijn indices</a> to locally encode label names as integers.</p>



<p>The grammar, and this example, can be encoded in Rust like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Send</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>S</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>PhantomData</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>S</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span><span>);</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The runtime communication API uses the type-state concept as a channel whose type changes as the protocol advances. Initially, a <code>Chan</code> is created for the server and the client (the “dual” of the server). Here’s an example where the type annotations show the change.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>example_ping_server</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

<p>Note that the <code>Chan</code> has two type arguments: an environment <code>Env</code> and a current action <code>Sigma</code>. The environment contains a list of session types generated by calls to <code>label</code>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week I made a <a href="https://leoloso.com/posts/proposal-for-embeddable-fields-in-graphql-query/">proposal to add embeddable fields to GraphQL</a>, but it didn't get a lot of support. I got the feedback that the extra complexity added to the server doesn't justify the benefits of this new feature, as in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/graphql/comments/j043rw/proposal_for_embeddable_fields_in_graphql/g6pvqcj">this comment on Reddit</a> (which I replied to through <a href="https://leoloso.com/posts/justifying-embeddable-fields-in-graphql-query/">this post</a>).</p><p>My proposed feature then appears to be not about GraphQL as we know it nowadays, but about an über GraphQL, or what GraphQL could possibly be. That's either a problem, or an opportunity. In <a href="https://artsy.github.io/blog/2018/05/08/is-graphql-the-future/">this write-up</a>, Alan Johnson says:</p><blockquote><p>[...] the execution model of GraphQL is in many ways just like a scripting language interpreter. The limitations of its model are strategic, to keep the technology focused on client-server interaction. What's interesting is that you as a developer provide nearly all of the definition of what operations exist, what they mean, and how they compose. For this reason, I consider GraphQL to be a <strong>meta-scripting language</strong>, or, in other words, a toolkit for building scripting languages.</p></blockquote><p>I agree with this observation, but then I wonder: Where do these limitations start? What should be allowed, and what not? If any feature made GraphQL's scripting capabilities a bit more visible, gave a bit more control to the developer, and made the query a bit more powerful, should that be straightforward rejected? Or could it be given a chance?</p><h2 id="heading-show-me-the-stuff!">Show me the stuff!<a href="#heading-show-me-the-stuff!"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>Let's talk business now. Here is something that GraphQL is not good at.</p><p>Say that you have a <code>@translate</code> directive that is applied on a <code>String</code>, as in <a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/graphiql/?query=query%20%7B%0A%20%20posts%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20id%0A%20%20%20%20title%20%40translate(from%3A%20%22en%22%2C%20to%3A%20%22es%22)%0A%20%20%7D%0A%7D">this query</a>:</p><pre><code><span><span>{</span></span><br><span>  posts <span>{</span></span><br><span>    id</span><br><span>    title <span>@translate</span><span>(</span><span>from</span><span>:</span> <span>"en"</span><span>,</span> <span>to</span><span>:</span> <span>"es"</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>  <span>}</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>You cannot apply <code>@translate</code> on a field different than a <code>String</code>. If you need to, you must then create a new directive, which involves extra effort (often being ad-hoc) and pollutes the schema:</p><ul><li><p>If a field returns <code>[String]</code>, you'd need to create another directive <code>@translateArrays</code></p></li><li><p>If only some entries from the array must be translated, you need to add an optional argument <code>$keys: [String]</code> to specify which keys to translate</p></li><li><p>If the keys are not strings, but are numeric, you need another argument <code>$numericKeys: [Int]</code> as to avoid type conflicts</p></li><li><p>If instead of an array, you get an array of arrays, you need yet another directive</p></li></ul><p>And so on, concerning any random requirement from your clients.</p><p>As a result, the schema might eventually become unwieldy.</p><hr><p>So, how could this situation be improved for GraphQL?</p><p>If GraphQL had capabilities to compose or manipulate fields, then a few elements could already satisfy all possible combinations.</p><p><a href="https://graphql-by-pop.com/">GraphQL by PoP</a> (the engine powering the recently launched <a href="https://github.com/GraphQLAPI/graphql-api-for-wp">GraphQL API for WordPress</a>) is a GraphQL server because it respects the <a href="https://spec.graphql.org/">GraphQL spec</a>, but is also a non-standard API server that provides other capabilities, including <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/682">composable fields</a> and <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/683">composable directives</a>.</p><p>Let's see how this server can satisfy all combinations described above, with just a few elements:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>GraphQL by PoP relies on the URL-based <a href="https://graphql-by-pop.com/docs/extended/pql.html">PQL syntax</a>, so you can click on the links to execute the query and see its response</li><li>Field <code>Root.echo</code> is used to build the arrays</li><li><code>forEach</code> and <code>advancePointerInArray</code> are directives that composes another directive</li></ul></blockquote><p>Translating posts as strings (<a

														<p><strong>The Struggle with China is not a Replay of the Cold War</strong><br>
Remarks to the Asia American Forum</p>
<p>Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.)<br>
Visiting Scholar, Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, Brown University&lt;<br>
By video link from Washington, D.C., 25 September 2020</p>
<p>Washington has declared war on China.&nbsp; The administration and its allies hope that the war will be “cold,” but have no strategy for keeping it so.&nbsp; I find it noteworthy that the most belligerently anti-Chinese members of the current U.S. Senate are also its youngest.&nbsp; They came to adulthood after the end of the post-World War II “Cold War” and have no experience of its anxieties.&nbsp; They appear to take its sudden end as predestined – something that was so inevitably right ideologically that it can and should be taken for granted.&nbsp; Their military experience, if any, has been in the contemporary equivalent of the 19<sup>th</sup> century’s Indian Wars – combat with gun-toting farmers with no air forces, air defenses, navies, guided missiles, or nuclear weapons with which to answer U.S. hostility. &nbsp;To paraphrase Hilaire Belloc’s riff on Britain’s hubris in its colonial wars:</p>
<p>“Whatever happens, we have got<br>
Close air support and they have not.”</p>
<p>The Cold War was radically different from this.&nbsp; It was a global struggle between two competing ideological blocs and nuclear-armed power centers capable of destroying not just each other but all life on the planet except maybe the cockroaches.&nbsp; It began as a series of squabbles over the spoils of a worldwide war.&nbsp; Each side strove to consolidate spheres of politico-military and economic influence and deny the other access to them.&nbsp; But each learned to avoid confrontations that might lead to armed combat directly with the other.&nbsp; Each limited itself to proxy wars aimed at sustaining or imposing its ideology somewhere not in the grip of the other.&nbsp; Each sought to minimize and contain interaction with the other.&nbsp; That was not difficult, given the utter lack of interdependence between the two and the blocs of nations they formally and informally commanded.</p>
<p>The struggle we Americans have now initiated with China has none of these characteristics.&nbsp; To analogize it to the Cold War of 1947 – 1991 is intellectually lazy.&nbsp; More important, it is profoundly misleading and delusional.&nbsp; The Sino-American split is not the sequel to a bloody world war.&nbsp; However politically convenient it may be for Americans to cast antagonism to China in all-encompassing Manichean terms, this is a contest born of contending national self-images and ambitions, not ideologies.&nbsp; The struggle with China on which Americans have embarked is a bilateral contest in which others may or may not choose to take sides, not one between two committed blocs of nations.&nbsp; China is both a much less inherently hostile and far more robust rival than the Soviet Union was.</p>
<p>Emulating China’s autocracy by closing America to foreign goods, services, people, and ideas, as the United States is now doing, is self-defeating.&nbsp; Modeling China policy on Ronald Reagan’s treatment of the USSR before he met Mikhail Gorbachev, as Secretary of State Pompeo has done, is the path to receipt of a national “Darwin award.”&nbsp; The U.S. contention with a resurgent China cannot be conducted in the same manner as the Cold War.&nbsp; It will not end, as the Cold War did, with the voluntary resignation of an ideologically disillusioned and exhausted adversary.</p>
<p>Before I discuss China and how our contest with it is likely to proceed, it may be useful to spend a minute or two on what China is <u>not</u>.</p>
<p>In Chinese literature, there is a beast called a 四不像that is satirically defined by the “four things it ain’t.” &nbsp;The head and face of a “four ain’t<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>” is slender like a horse, but it ain’t a horse.&nbsp; Its horns are like a deer’s, but different.&nbsp; Its neck is like a camel’s, but it is no camel.&nbsp; Its tail is like a donkey’s, but it’s not an ass. &nbsp;The point is that describing a “four ain’t” by reference to previously encountered animals it does not resemble is worse than no help at all in understanding and dealing with it.</p>
<p>China is the “four ain’t” of today’s geopolitics.&nbsp; It is ruled by a “Communist Party” but is an overachieving participant in global capitalism, committed to free trade, expanded foreign investment, and a market economy guided by industrial policy, not central planning. &nbsp;China is armed with nuclear weapons, but it has sized and configured its arsenal for a retaliatory response to an attack on it by other nuclear powers, not for a first strike, which it has abjured and is not equipped to conduct.&nbsp; China is a threat to American global primacy, but mostly in economic and technological rather than political or military terms, in which it remains decidedly inferior.&nbsp; China is once again the immovable economic and cultural center of its native region – where the United States has for seventy-five years been the resident overlord – but China seeks no “allies” and has no political satrapies or military dependencies.</p>
<p>Crucially, <strong>China is not the Soviet Union</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>China has no messianic ideology to export. Its appeal derives from its performance, not its ideas.&nbsp; It is happy to be emulated, but justly charged with callous indifference to how foreign societies govern themselves.</li>
<li>China is not engaged in regime change operations to create an ideological sphere of influence. It seeks to prevent the overthrow of its own authoritarian system of governance but does not oppose democracy or promote authoritarianism abroad.&nbsp; Where tested, as in Korea, it often has a better relationship with democracies than with their undemocratic opponents.</li>
<li>China’s relationships with foreign nations are transactional rather than sentimental. It has no “satellites,” “allies,” or entente partners to divert its attention from its own defense. &nbsp;Beijing has no ideological soul mates, committed followers, or dedicated sycophants abroad.</li>
<li>China’s economy dwarfs that of the USSR. It accounts for 30 percent of global manufacturing and continues to grow.&nbsp; China has an economy that is almost one-third larger than that of the United States in purchasing power terms and that is rapidly approaching parity at nominal exchange rates.</li>
<li>China is now the largest consumer market on the planet and the biggest trading partner of three-fourths of the world’s other economies. It is fully integrated into the global capitalist system and cannot be walled off from it.</li>
<li>China already possesses one-fourth of the world’s scientific, technological, engineering, and mathematics workforce. It is steadily increasing its ascendancy.</li>
<li>China’s “Belt and Road Initiative” is an order-setting geoeconomic strategy with no Soviet parallel that dwarfs the nearest American equivalent – the Marshall Plan.</li>
<li>China spends two percent or less of GDP on its military vs. the estimated 9 – 15 percent of the USSR and the current 7.9 percent spent by the United States.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> Unlike the USSR, if pushed to do so, China has the capacity to more than match any U.S. military spending increases.</li>
<li>Despite much wishful thinking on the part of its detractors, premising a policy on China’s collapse from systemic defects, as George Kennan shrewdly did in the case of the USSR in 1947, is – on the evidence – delusional.</li>
<li>China has not built a nuclear arsenal to match that of either the United States or Russia. It has instead adopted a “no first use” policy for nuclear weapons backed by a modest <em>force de frappe</em> that can conduct a limited but devastating retaliatory counterstrike to any foreign nuclear attack on it.</li>
<li>There are no U.S. arms control agreements, exchanges of information, understandings on mutual restraint, or escalation control mechanisms between the U.S. and Chinese armed forces as there were with the USSR</li>
<li>American military intervention in the Russian civil war lasted only two years (1918-1920). Overt U.S. intervention in China’s ongoing civil war, sparked by the Korean War, began in 1950.&nbsp; Seventy years later, U.S. support for the heirs to Chiang Kai-shek’s defeated Chinese regime not only continues but is escalating.</li>
<li>The United States backs challenges to China’s sovereignty over Taiwan and islets in its near seas. By contrast, despite rhetorical opposition to its incorporation of the three Baltic states, America never actively contested the USSR’s territorial integrity.</li>
<li>The armed forces of the United States aggressively patrol China’s shorelines and test its defenses, as they did those of the Soviet Union. But, so far, unlike the USSR, China has not reciprocated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Equally important, <strong>the United States of the 2020s is not the America of the early Cold War</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>As the Cold War began, the United States produced one-half or more of the world’s manufactures. It now makes about one-sixth.</li>
<li>For the first time in American history, foreigners do not envy American freedoms. Once almost-universal admiration for the United States has been overwritten by repeated displays of racism, gun violence, political venality, xenophobia, and – most recently – executive incompetence and legislative default in the face of national challenges.&nbsp; No one abroad now seeks to emulate the U.S. political system or believes that the United States illustrates the possibilities of democracy.</li>
<li>During the Cold War, the United States was the uncontested leader of a bloc of dependent nations that it called “the free world.” That bloc is now in an advanced state of decay.&nbsp; America’s international followership is greatly diminished and its capacity to organize coalitions that integrate lesser powers in support of common objectives has atrophied.</li>
<li>Legacy U.S. alliances formed to contain the USSR have little relevance to American contention with China:
<ul>
<li>US-European alliances like NATO are withering. Though cautious about China, Europeans do not and will not support an effort to “contain” it.</li>
<li>No Asian security partner of the United States wants to choose between America and China.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> S. “alliances” in Asia embody U.S. undertakings to protect partners …</li></ul></li></ul></div></div>

		<p>After spending part of the last 12 months <a href="https://blog.luap.info/travelling-with-24-monitors.html">travelling in Europe</a> I'm now settling down around Paris and I need to adapt my multi-screens setup.</p>
<p>You probably have seen an ads for <a href="https://altwork.com/">the altwork desk</a> <em>a $7000 desk that let you work laying down</em>. Spending a big part of my day in front of a computer I want to have the most comfortable position as possible, but well $7000 + $1000 for the delivery seems so expensive. There is also <a href="http://www.ergoquest.com/">this company</a> but this is still about $4000 all included. Let's be creative and build it myself.</p>
<p>Here is the result</p>
<p><img alt="complete desk" src="https://blog.luap.info/drafts/static/desk/complete.jpg"> </p>
<p>The things I have to take into account are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I have three monitors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have no diy tools</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want a laying down position</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This should be easy to use</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This should be light and not take too much space</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have only a bike to move the parts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I haven't found anyone who has done something similar and so don't really have examples</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So instead of doing the waterfall way I decided to go the agile way and to not do any plans, I didn't know what to expect, so let's do it step by step and see how it goes</p>
<h2>Take care of the chair</h2>
<p>There are several options:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Built a chair from scratch including the 'mattress' part</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a reclined chair</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adapt a chair</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The issue with the first option is that I will not be sure of the result, is it going to be comfortable ? How I'm going to wash the seat covers ? I have no idea of the things to take into account for building a comfortable chair.</p>
<p>Reclined chairs are great but they are very heavy (except the garden ones but not very comfortable) and expensive. So again let's be creative, I got inspired by <a href="https://www.ikeahackers.net/2017/04/poang-gravity-recliner.html">this</a> and <a href="https://www.ikeahackers.net/2020/04/remove-poang-arms.html">this</a> ikea hacks which use a IKEA POANG chair and transform it into a reclined chair.</p>
<p>Here is the result :</p>
<p><img alt="ikea poang adaptation" src="https://blog.luap.info/drafts/static/desk/chair.jpg"></p>
<p>The chair is 69 euro, I had to buy three cushions to extend it</p>
<p>The most complex part was to do 7km with the chair on a bike. I do not recommend doing the same, particularly because I have done it on a rainy day but well a bit of challenge in my life is always welcome!</p>
<p><img alt="ikea bike" src="https://blog.luap.info/drafts/static/desk/ikea_bike.jpg"></p>
<p>Great, the chair is comfortable, let's do something for the desk part.</p>
<h2>What structure for the desk</h2>
<p>The biggest issue you are going to have with the lay down position, is that the desk is going to be on your legs and you cant 'enter' or 'leave' the desk if you can't move the desk. So you need the 'desk' part to be dynamic from the 'chair' part.</p>
<p>I had two ideas for that, either the Altwork way, the structure goes above your head and can incline, or the the base is on the side and the desk can move somewhere (writing that, having the desk in front of me, I wonder if having the base where the foot are is not an even better solution ? Damn, too late). Having the base on the side seems better because it would be smaller and lighter and also you can balance the weight much better. But the structure also needs to be more rigid and I need to find a way to incline the desk, anyway I haven't found a way to do it :(, after a night of thinking I went the altwork way.</p>
<p>There are two parts to design:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The base + the incline system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The desk + the screen supports</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>1. Base + incline system</h3>
<p>The base is pretty standard, you need something strong enough so that it can suppot the whole thing. At that point I still didn't know the weight of the complete platform so I didn't know how strong it should be. After a few failing choices, I ended up with a main pole of 7cm x 7cm.</p>
<p>Now the complex part, how to design the rotation part ? How heavy is going to be the rest of desk ? How much does the desk need to move so that I can 'enter' the desk ? So many questions I didnt have an answer for.</p>
<p>So let's try something and see how it goes, I bought an <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B00H8SZ87W">gaz actuator on Amazon</a> which can support 70kg with a range of 31cm, it is built for cars and pretty cheap, 19euro. Actually 70kg is a lot. So at least I have a some freedom on the weight of the structure.</p>
<p>I had two issues with the actuator:</p>
<ul>
<li>70kg IS A LOT, it is so much that when I was fixing it on the wood of the base, it was breaking the wood. The best would be to have an iron piece that I can fix to the wood but I didnt have the tools for that so I used stronger woods but this is still fragile. </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="fixation verrin" src="https://blog.luap.info/drafts/static/desk/fixation_verrin.jpg"></p>
<ul>
<li>The desk follows a circular trajectory when you move it up and down. As a result the barycenter of the structure changes depending on the Y position of the 'desk part' and so there is more strength applied on the actuator when it is up than when it is down. So basically the desk will not stay by itself when in the up position.  I need to find a way to get the desk in the up position.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not really proud of the way I've done it, but it somewhat works. I've built a piece of wood that inserts itself in the area between the two poles where the actuator is. There is a counterweight which drags the piece into the zone when in up position, and when I want to release it, I just need to pull on the rope. (I think I will replace the actuator with a real electric actuator when the current system breaks so that I can control the movement, it is about 120euro)</p>
<p><img alt="system block" src="https://blog.luap.info/drafts/static/desk/blocking_system.jpg"></p>
<h3>2. Desk + screens support</h3>
<p>I bought a chipboard plate of 80cm x 120cm, and cut some space for my body</p>
<p><img alt="plaque bois" src="https://blog.luap.info/drafts/static/desk/agglo.jpg"> </p>
<p>This is pretty solid, so I can directly screw this plate to the pole and we have a desk surface</p>
<p><img alt="plaque bureau" src="https://blog.luap.info/drafts/static/desk/bureau_with_plaque.jpg"></p>
<p>For holding the monitors I did something pretty basic, I created a box for each screen. Then comes the position of the screen, how to know the position of each screen ? I didnt know how to know it beforehand, so I just created dynamic arms and adjusted them while in front of the screens</p>
<p><img alt="support monitor" src="https://blog.luap.info/drafts/static/desk/support_monitor.jpg"></p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>This is only a few days old so I can't really make a feedback but there are already a few things that I need to fix</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I can't use a mouse anymore, as the mouse would fall down, I'm probably going to replace it by a trackball</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I need to invest in an ergonomic keyboard to get really comfortable, probably going to buy the kenesis advantage 2, but this is expensive !</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a video of the complete desk:</p>

</video>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>When you want to build this kind of structure, I'm not sure you can plan everything beforehand, there are always things that will happen that you didn't expect, like when you code: if you want to modify the actuator when the 60kg setup is mounted how do you do ? (I have done it 6 times) When your base can't support the weight because it lacks one screw and you need to unmount everything what do you do ? ...</p>
<p>I'm really annoyed by the actuator part, I hope I will find something more reliable</p>
<p>Overall it cost me :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>45 euro for tools</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>130 euro for wood pieces, screws, joins, ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>110 euro for the IKEA chair + cushions</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and I spent 26 hours working, excluding the transport and the time shopping for pieces</p>
<p>Don't forget when you do woodworking to clean afterwards  :)</p>
<p><img alt="dirty" src="https://blog.luap.info/drafts/static/desk/dirty_floor.jpg"></p>
<p>If you have done something similar and know a few advice, please send me an email</p>
<p>PS: If you wonder whether you can do that or not, everyone can do it, basic woodworking is not complex, you need to know how to cut wood, how to join wood, how to screw and a little bit of imagination, you dont even need a car to transport parts, I transported everything: pole of 2m40, big plate ... on a bike</p>

		<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_numbers">Very big numbers</a> like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham's_number">Graham’s Number</a> are often expressed with lengthy, clumsy, semi formal explanations. But it’s concise and&nbsp;convenient to express such numbers precisely in the pure <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">lambda calculus</a>, using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding">Church numerals</a>. Starting with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth's_up-arrow_notation">Knuth’s up-arrow</a>, if we define <em>f<sub>n,a</sub></em>(<em>b</em>) = <em>a</em>↑<sup><em>n</em></sup><em>b</em>, then <em>f<sub>0,a</sub></em>(<em>b</em>) = <em>ab</em> and <em>f<sub>n+1,a</sub></em>(<em>b</em>) = <em>f<sub>n,a</sub></em><sup><em>b</em></sup>(1). From this we get that the lambda expression <strong>upify</strong> = λ<em>f b</em>. <em>b f</em> <strong>1</strong> yields <em>f<sub>n+1,a</sub></em> given <em>f<sub>n,a</sub></em>, and so <strong>uparrow</strong> = λ<em>n a b</em>. <em>n</em> <strong>upify</strong> (<strong>times</strong> <em>a</em>) <em>b. </em>A similar process yield’s Graham’s Number, given that <em>G = f<sup>64</sup></em>(4) where <em>f</em>(<em>n</em>) = 3↑<sup><em>n</em></sup>3:</p>
<p><strong>1</strong> = λ<em>f x</em>.&nbsp;<em>f x</em><br>
<strong>2</strong> = λ<em>f x</em>. <em>f</em> (<em>f x</em>)<br>
<strong>3</strong> = λ<em>f x</em>. <em>f</em> (<em>f</em> (<em>f x</em>))<br>
<strong>4</strong> = <strong>2 2</strong><br>
<strong>64</strong> = <strong>3 4</strong></p>
<p><strong>times</strong> = λ<em>a b f</em>. <em>a</em> (<em>b f</em>)<br>
<strong>upify</strong> = λ<em>f b</em>. <em>b f</em> <strong>1</strong><br>
<strong>uparrow</strong> = λ<em>n a b</em>. <em>n</em> <strong>upify</strong> (<strong>times</strong> <em>a</em>) <em>b</em><br>
<strong>grahamf</strong> = λ<em>n</em>. <strong>uparrow</strong> <em>n</em> <strong>3 3</strong><br>
<strong>graham</strong> =<strong> 64</strong> <strong>grahamf</strong> <strong>4</strong></p>
<p>Putting it all together:</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong> = (λ<em>c2 c3</em>.(λ<em>c4</em>.<em> c3 c4 </em>(λ<em>n</em>.<em> n </em>(λ<em>f b</em>.<em> b f </em>(λ<em>x</em>.<em> x</em>)) (λ<em>b f</em>.<em> c3 </em>(<em>b f</em>))<em> c3</em>)<em> c4</em>) (<em>c2 c2</em>)) (λ<em>f x</em>.<em> f </em>(<em>f x</em>)) (λ<em>f x</em>.<em> f </em>(<em>f </em>(<em>f x</em>)))</p>
<p>In <a href="https://tromp.github.io/cl/cl.html">John Tromp’s “binary lambda calculus”</a>, this expression takes up&nbsp; 120 bits—exactly as many bits, as Doug Clow points out below, as the string “Graham’s Number” in Unicode. Don’t try evaluating this in your favourite lambda calculus interpreter unless you’re very, very patient.</p>
<p>Updated 2020-02-20:&nbsp; I blogged about a beautiful way to see this as a&nbsp;<a href="https://mindsarentmagic.org/2020/02/19/a-picture-of-grahams-number/">picture</a>.</p>

<p>
In this article, we're only measuring the performance on the CPU. Both libraries,
Deep Diamond, and Keras with TensorFlow use <a href="https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDNN">Intel's oneDNN</a> low level performance
library under the hood, and I confirmed that both installations exploit AVX2 instructions that are
available on my (old-ish) CPU i7-4790k, so the difference is completely due to the higher-level implementations.
</p>

<p>
Deep Diamond completes this training in <b>368</b> seconds while Keras + TensorFlow takes <b>509</b> seconds.
</p>

<p>
TensorFlow is not famous for being the fastest deep learning library, but
keep in mind that that info is from the times before they integrated
Intel's oneDNN. Now that all major frameworks have oneDNN support,
the underlying performance is usually on more equal footing.
</p>

<p>
That's why this result is good. Even though all high performance
operations are backed by the same native operations, Keras + TensoFlow
still add 140 seconds of overhead, almost 50% to Deep Diamond's running time. Not bad!
</p>

<p>
I know what you'll complain about: "Nobody trains their networks on
CPU anyway. The GPU performance is what is relevant! Clojure certainly
can't challenge TensorFlow there?" You're right about the first part;
GPU performance is much more relevant. Let's keep the suspense then,
until the next article, which will compare Deep Diamond to Keras + TensorFlow on the GPU with CUDA.

            <p>
    Posted on May 11, 2019
</p>



<p>This post demonstrates a simple encoding of a (typed) concatenative language in Haskell.</p>
<p>Point-free style is one of the distinctive markers of functional programming languages. Want to sum a list? That’s as easy as:</p>

<p>Now I want to sum every number after adding one to it.</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1">sumSuccs <span>=</span> <span>foldr</span> (<span>+</span>) <span>0</span> <span>.</span> <span>map</span> ((<span>+</span>) <span>1</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>One more step to make this function truly abstract™ and general™: we’ll allow the user to supply their own number to add</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1">sumAdded <span>=</span> <span>foldr</span> (<span>+</span>) <span>0</span> <span>.</span> <span>map</span> <span>.</span> (<span>+</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And here the trouble begins. The above expression won’t actually type check. In fact, it’ll give a pretty terrible error message:</p>
<pre><code>• Non type-variable argument in the constraint: Num [a]
  (Use FlexibleContexts to permit this)
• When checking the inferred type
    sumThoseThat :: forall a.
                    (Num [a], Foldable ((-&gt;) [a])) =&gt;
                    a -&gt; [a]</code></pre>
<p>I remember as a beginner being confused by similar messages. What’s <code>FlexibleContexts</code>? I had thought that the “point-free style” just meant removing the last variable from an expression if it’s also the last argument:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>sum</span> xs <span>=</span> <span>foldr</span> (<span>+</span>) <span>0</span> xs</span>
<span id="cb5-2"><span>sum</span> <span>=</span> <span>foldr</span> (<span>+</span>) <span>0</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Why doesn’t it work here?</p>
<p>Well, it doesn’t work because the types don’t line up, but I’m going to try and explain a slightly different perspective on the problem, which is <em>associativity</em>.</p>
<p>To make it a little clearer, let’s see what happens when we point-fill the expression:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1">sumAdded n xs <span>=</span> (<span>foldr</span>(<span>+</span>) <span>0</span> <span>.</span> (<span>map</span> <span>.</span> (<span>+</span>))) n xs</span>
<span id="cb6-2">             <span>=&gt;</span> <span>foldr</span>(<span>+</span>) <span>0</span> ((<span>map</span> <span>.</span> (<span>+</span>)) n) xs</span>
<span id="cb6-3">             <span>=&gt;</span> <span>foldr</span>(<span>+</span>) <span>0</span> (<span>map</span> ((<span>+</span>) n)) xs</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Indeed, the problem is the placement of the parentheses. What we want at the end is:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1">             <span>=&gt;</span> <span>foldr</span>(<span>+</span>) <span>0</span> (<span>map</span> ((<span>+</span>) n) xs)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But, no matter. We have to jiggle the arguments around, or we could use something terrible like this:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><span>infixr</span> <span>9</span> <span>.:</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2">(<span>.:</span>) <span>=</span> (<span>.</span>)<span>.</span>(<span>.</span>)</span>
<span id="cb8-3"></span>
<span id="cb8-4">sumAdded <span>=</span> <span>foldr</span> (<span>+</span>) <span>0</span> <span>.:</span> <span>map</span> <span>.</span> (<span>+</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Is there something, though, that could do this automatically?</p>

<p>We run into a similar problem in Agda. We’re forever having to prove statements like:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>(</span>x + y<span>)</span> + z ≡ x + <span>(</span>y + z<span>)</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2">x ≡ x + <span>0</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are a couple of ways to get around the issue, and for monoids there’s a rich theory of techniques. I’ll just show one for now, which relies on the <em>endomorphism</em> monoid. This monoid is created by partially applying the monoid’s binary operator:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1">Endo <span>:</span> <span>Set</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2">Endo <span>=</span> ℕ <span>→</span> ℕ</span>
<span id="cb10-3"></span>
<span id="cb10-4">⟦<span>_</span>⇑⟧ <span>:</span> ℕ <span>→</span> Endo</span>
<span id="cb10-5">⟦ n ⇑⟧ m <span>=</span> n + m</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And you can get back to the underlying monoid by applying it to the neutral element:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1">⟦<span>_</span>⇓⟧ <span>:</span> Endo <span>→</span> ℕ</span>
<span id="cb11-2">⟦ n ⇓⟧ <span>=</span> n <span>0</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here’s the important parts: first, we can lift the underlying operation into the endomorphism:</p>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1"><span>_</span>⊕<span>_</span> <span>:</span> Endo <span>→</span> Endo <span>→</span> Endo</span>
<span id="cb12-2">xs ⊕ ys <span>=</span> <span>λ</span> x <span>→</span> xs <span>(</span>ys x<span>)</span></span>
<span id="cb12-3"></span>
<span id="cb12-4">⊕-homo <span>:</span> <span>∀</span> n m <span>→</span> ⟦ ⟦ n ⇑⟧ ⊕ ⟦ m ⇑⟧ ⇓⟧ ≡ n + m</span>
<span id="cb12-5">⊕-homo n m <span>=</span> cong <span>(</span>n +<span>_)</span> <span>(</span>+-identityʳ m<span>)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>And second, it’s <em>definitionally</em> associative.</p>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1">⊕-assoc <span>:</span> <span>∀</span> x y z <span>→</span> <span>(</span>x ⊕ y<span>)</span> ⊕ z ≡ x ⊕ <span>(</span>y ⊕ z<span>)</span></span>
<span id="cb13-2">⊕-assoc <span>_</span> <span>_</span> <span>_</span> <span>=</span> refl</span></code></pre></div>
<p>These are all clues as to how to solve the composition problem in the Haskell code above. We need definitional associativity, somehow. Maybe we can get it from the endomorphism monoid?</p>

<p>You’re probably familiar with Haskell’s state monad:</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1"><span>newtype</span> <span>State</span> s a <span>=</span> <span>State</span> {<span> runState ::</span> s <span>-&gt;</span> (a, s) }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It can help a lot when you’re threading around fiddly accumulators and so on.</p>
<div id="cb15"><pre><code><span id="cb15-1"><span>nub ::</span> <span>Ord</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb15-2">nub <span>=</span> go Set.empty</span>
<span id="cb15-3">  <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb15-4">    go seen [] <span>=</span> []</span>
<span id="cb15-5">    go seen (x<span>:</span>xs)</span>
<span id="cb15-6">      <span>|</span> x <span>`Set.member`</span> seen <span>=</span> go seen xs</span>
<span id="cb15-7">      <span>|</span> <span>otherwise</span> <span>=</span> x <span>:</span> go (Set.insert x seen) xs</span></code></pre></div>
<div id="cb16"><pre><code><span id="cb16-1"><span>nub ::</span> <span>Ord</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb16-2">nub <span>=</span> <span>flip</span> evalState Set.empty <span>.</span> go</span>
<span id="cb16-3">  <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb16-4">    go [] <span>=</span> <span>pure</span> []</span>
<span id="cb16-5">    go (x<span>:</span>xs) <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb16-6">        seen <span>&lt;-</span> gets (Set.member x)</span>
<span id="cb16-7">        <span>if</span> seen</span>
<span id="cb16-8">          <span>then</span> go xs</span>
<span id="cb16-9">          <span>else</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb16-10">              modify (Set.insert x)</span>
<span id="cb16-11">              (x<span>:</span>) <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> go xs</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Of course, these days state is a transformer:</p>
<div id="cb17"><pre><code><span id="cb17-1"><span>newtype</span> <span>StateT</span> s m a <span>=</span> <span>StateT</span> {<span> runStateT ::</span> s <span>-&gt;</span> m (a, s) }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This lets us stack multiple effects on top of each other: error handling, IO, randomness, even another state monad. In fact, if you <em>do</em> stack another state monad on top, you might be surprised by the efficiency of the code it generates:</p>
<div id="cb18"><pre><code><span id="cb18-1"><span>type</span> <span>DoubleState</span> s1 s2 a <span>=</span> <span>StateT</span> s1 (<span>State</span> s2) a</span>
<span id="cb18-2">                        <span>=&gt;</span> s1 <span>-&gt;</span> <span>State</span> s2 (a, s1)</span>
<span id="cb18-3">                        <span>=&gt;</span> s1 <span>-&gt;</span> s2 <span>-&gt;</span> ((a, s1), s2)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It’s nothing earth shattering, but it inlines and optimises well. That output is effectively a left-nested list, also.</p>

<p>If we can do one, and we can do two, why not more? Can we generalise the state pattern to an arbitrary number of variables? First we’ll need a generic tuple:</p>
<div id="cb19"><pre><code><span id="cb19-1"><span>infixr</span> <span>5</span> <span>:-</span></span>
<span id="cb19-2"><span>data</span> <span>Stack</span> (<span>xs ::</span> [<span>Type</span>])<span> ::</span> <span>Type</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb19-3">    <span>Nil</span><span>  ::</span> <span>Stack</span> '[]</span>
<span id="cb19-4"><span>    (:-) ::</span> x <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Stack</span> xs <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Stack</span> (x <span>:</span> xs)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then, the state type.</p>
<div id="cb20"><pre><code><span id="cb20-1"><span>newtype</span> <span>State</span> xs a <span>=</span> <span>State</span> {<span> runState ::</span> <span>Stack</span> xs <span>-&gt;</span> (a, <span>Stack</span> xs) }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can actually clean the definition up a little: instead of a tuple at the other end, why not push it onto the stack.</p>
<div id="cb21"><pre><code><span id="cb21-1"><span>newtype</span> <span>State</span> xs a <span>=</span> <span>State</span> {<span> runState ::</span> <span>Stack</span> xs <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Stack</span> (a <span>:</span> xs) }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In fact, let’s make this as polymorphic as possible. We should be able to change the state is we so desire.</p>
<div id="cb22"><pre><code><span id="cb22-1"><span>infixr</span> <span>0</span> <span>:-&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb22-2"><span>type</span> (<span>:-&gt;</span>) xs ys <span>=</span> <span>Stack</span> xs <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Stack</span> ys</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And suddenly, our endomorphism type from above shows up again.</p>
<p>We can, of course, get back our original types.</p>
<div id="cb23"><pre><code><span id="cb23-1"><span>newtype</span> <span>State</span> xs a <span>=</span> <span>State</span> {<span> runState ::</span> xs <span>:-&gt;</span> a <span>:</span> xs }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And it comes with all of the instances you might expect:</p>
<div id="cb24"><pre><code><span id="cb24-1"><span>instance</span> <span>Functor</span> (<span>State</span> xs) <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb24-2">    <span>fmap</span> f xs <span>=</span> <span>State</span> (\s <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> runState xs s <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb24-3">        (x <span>:-</span> ys) <span>-&gt;</span> f x <span>:-</span> ys)</span>
<span id="cb24-4">        </span>
<span id="cb24-5"><span>instance</span> <span>Applicative</span> (<span>State</span> xs) <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb24-6">    <span>pure</span> x <span>=</span> <span>State</span> (x <span>:-</span>)</span>
<span id="cb24-7">    fs <span>&lt;*&gt;</span> xs <span>=</span> <span>State</span> (\s <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> runState fs s <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb24-8">        (f <span>:-</span> s') <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> runState xs s' <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb24-9">            (x <span>:-</span> s'') <span>-&gt;</span> f x <span>:-</span> s'')</span>
<span id="cb24-10">            </span>
<span id="cb24-11"><span>instance</span> <span>Monad</span> (<span>State</span> xs) <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb24-12">    xs <span>&gt;&gt;=</span> f <span>=</span> <span>State</span> (\s <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> runState xs s <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb24-13">        y <span>:-</span> ys <span>-&gt;</span> runState (f y) ys)</span></code></pre></div>

<p>But what’s the point? So far we’ve basically just encoded an unnecessarily complicated state transformer. Think back to the stacking of states. Written in the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl">mtl</a> style, the main advantage of stacking monads like that is you can write code like the following:</p>
<div id="cb25"><pre><code><span id="cb25-1"><span>pop ::</span> (<span>MonadState</span> [a] m, <span>MonadError</span> <span>String</span> m) <span>=&gt;</span> m a</span>
<span id="cb25-2">pop <span>=</span> get <span>&gt;&gt;=</span> \<span>case</span></span>
<span id="cb25-3">    [] <span>-&gt;</span> throwError <span>"pop: empty list"</span></span>
<span id="cb25-4">    x<span>:</span>xs <span>-&gt;</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb25-5">        put xs </span>
<span id="cb25-6">        <span>pure</span> x</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In other words, we don’t care about the rest of <code>m</code>, we just care that it has, somewhere, state for an <code>[a]</code>.</p>
<p>This logic should apply to our stack transformer, as well. If it only cares about the top two variables, it shouldn’t care what the rest of the list is. In types:</p>
<div id="cb26"><pre><code><span id="cb26-1"><span>infixr</span> <span>0</span> <span>:-&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb26-2"><span>type</span> (<span>:-&gt;</span>) xs ys <span>=</span> <span>forall</span> zs<span>.</span> <span>Stack</span> (xs <span>++</span> zs) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Stack</span> (ys <span>++</span> zs)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And straight away we can write some of the standard combinators:</p>
<div id="cb27"><pre><code><span id="cb27-1"><span>dup ::</span> '[a] <span>:-&gt;</span> '[a,a]</span>
<span id="cb27-2">dup (x <span>:-</span> xs) <span>=</span> (x <span>:-</span> x <span>:-</span> xs)</span>
<span id="cb27-3"></span>
<span id="cb27-4"><span>swap ::</span> '[x,y] <span>:-&gt;</span> '[y,x]</span>
<span id="cb27-5">swap (x <span>:-</span> y <span>:-</span> xs) <span>=</span> y <span>:-</span> x <span>:-</span> xs</span>
<span id="cb27-6"></span>
<span id="cb27-7"><span>drop</span><span> ::</span> '[x,y] <span>:-&gt;</span> '[y]</span>
<span id="cb27-8"><span>drop</span> (_ <span>:-</span> xs) <span>=</span> xs</span>
<span id="cb27-9"></span>
<span id="cb27-10"><span>infixl</span> <span>9</span> <span>!</span></span>
<span id="cb27-11">(f <span>!</span> g) x <span>=</span> g (f x)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You’ll immediately run into trouble if you try to work with some of the more involved combinators, though. Quote should have the following type, for instance:</p>
<div id="cb28"><pre><code><span id="cb28-1"><span>quote ::</span> (xs <span>:-&gt;</span> ys) <span>-&gt;</span> '[] <span>:-&gt;</span> '[ xs <span>:-&gt;</span> ys ]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But GHC complains again:</p>
<pre><code>• Illegal polymorphic type: xs :-&gt; ys
  GHC doesn't yet support impredicative polymorphism
• In the type signature:
    quote :: (xs :-&gt; ys) -&gt; '[] :-&gt; '[xs :-&gt; ys]</code></pre>
<p>I won’t go into the detail of this particular error: if you’ve been around the block with Haskell you know that it means “wrap it in a newtype”. If we do <em>that</em>, though, we get yet more errors:</p>
<div id="cb30"><pre><code><span id="cb30-1"><span>newtype</span> (<span>:~&gt;</span>) xs ys <span>=</span> <span>Q</span> {<span> d ::</span> xs <span>:-&gt;</span> ys }</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>• Couldn't match type ‘ys ++ zs0’ with ‘ys ++ zs’
  Expected type: Stack (xs ++ zs) -&gt; Stack (ys ++ zs)
    Actual type: Stack (xs ++ zs0) -&gt; Stack (ys ++ zs0)
  NB: ‘++’ is a type function, and may not be injective</code></pre>
<p>This injectivity error comes up often. It means that GHC needs to prove that the input to two functions is equal, but it only knows that their outputs are. This is a doubly serious problem for us, as we can’t do type family injectivity on two type variables (in current Haskell). To solve the problem, we need to rely on a weird mishmash of type families and functional dependencies:</p>
<div id="cb32"><pre><code><span id="cb32-1"><span>type</span> <span>family</span> (<span>++</span>) xs ys <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb32-2">    '[] <span>++</span> ys <span>=</span> ys</span>
<span id="cb32-3">    (x <span>:</span> xs) <span>++</span> ys <span>=</span> x <span>:</span> (xs <span>++</span> ys)</span>
<span id="cb32-4">    </span>
<span id="cb32-5"><span>class</span> (xs <span>++</span> ys <span>~</span> zs) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Conc</span> xs ys zs <span>|</span> xs zs <span>-&gt;</span> ys <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb32-6"><span>    conc ::</span> <span>Stack</span> xs <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Stack</span> ys <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Stack</span> zs</span>
<span id="cb32-7">    </span>
<span id="cb32-8"><span>instance</span> <span>Conc</span> '[] ys ys <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb32-9">    conc _ ys <span>=</span> ys</span>
<span id="cb32-10">    </span>
<span id="cb32-11"><span>instance</span> <span>Conc</span> xs ys zs <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Conc</span> (x <span>:</span> xs) ys (x <span>:</span> zs) <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb32-12">    conc (x <span>:-</span> xs) ys <span>=</span> x <span>:-</span> conc xs ys</span>
<span id="cb32-13"></span>
<span id="cb32-14"><span>infixr</span> <span>0</span> <span>:-&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb32-15"><span>type</span> (<span>:-&gt;</span>) xs ys <span>=</span> <span>forall</span> zs yszs<span>.</span> <span>Conc</span> ys zs yszs <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Stack</span> (xs <span>++</span> zs) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Stack</span> yszs</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And it does indeed work:</p>
<div id="cb33"><pre><code><span id="cb33-1"><span>pure</span><span> ::</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> '[] <span>:-&gt;</span> '[a]</span>
<span id="cb33-2"><span>pure</span> <span>=</span> (<span>:-</span>)</span>
<span id="cb33-3"></span>
<span id="cb33-4"><span>newtype</span> (<span>:~&gt;</span>) xs ys <span>=</span> <span>Q</span> {<span> d ::</span> xs <span>:-&gt;</span> ys }</span>
<span id="cb33-5"></span>
<span id="cb33-6"><span>quote ::</span> (xs <span>:-&gt;</span> ys) <span>-&gt;</span> '[] <span>:-&gt;</span> '[ xs <span>:~&gt;</span> ys ]</span>

<span id="cb33-13">true <span>=</span> swap <span>!</span> <span>drop</span> <span>!</span> dot</span>
<span id="cb33-14"></span>
<span id="cb33-15"><span>false ::</span> (xs <span>:~&gt;</span> ys) <span>:</span> (xs <span>:~&gt;</span> ys) <span>:</span> xs <span>:-&gt;</span> ys</span>
<span id="cb33-16">false <span>=</span> <span>drop</span> <span>!</span> dot</span>

<span id="cb33-19">test <span>=</span> quote dup</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Interestingly, these combinators represent the monadic operations on state (<code>dot</code> = <code>join</code>, <code>pure</code> = <code>pure</code>, etc.)</p>
<p>And can we get the nicer composition of the function from the intro? Kind of:</p>
<div id="cb34"><pre><code><span id="cb34-1">sumAdded <span>=</span> quote add <span>!</span> <span>curry</span> <span>!</span> dot <span>!</span> <span>map</span> <span>!</span> <span>sum</span></span></code></pre></div>

  <article>
    <p>I’m back from cryosleep. After <a href="https://www.eidel.io/2020/01/31/pioneers-vs-process-people/">leaving Merantix Healthcare</a> 7 months ago I haven’t
been writing much. I took the summer off to finish my pilot’s license and to try out a few things on the
side.</p>

<p>One of them was doing regulatory consulting for medical software startups. Remember: At Merantix Healthcare
(now: Vara), we managed to pass all regulatory hurdles to bring our Machine Learning - based Radiology
software to market. At the time I thought this was quite an unspectacular achievement, but apparently many
other companies fail at it.</p>

<p>So, shortly after becoming unemployed, random people started emailing me with requests like “Hey, work as a
consultant for us, we pay you money, start tomorrow”. I started calling it the <em>magical consulting business
with zero marketing</em>.</p>

<p>It’s not like I was keen to do it, but it was worth a try.</p>

<p>I approached it with an open mind. Half a year later, after having succesfully worked with four companies,
here’s my verdict: It sucks.</p>

<p>Why? Many reasons. But let’s take a step back first.</p>

<p>What is regulation? (Bear with me) in human language, <em>regulation</em> is a list of hoops some authority puts in
your way of accessing the market. Everyone in your industry has to jump through these hoops.</p>

<p>Here’s the thing: In a sane world, with rational people, we wouldn’t need any regulation. People would be
building perfectly safe software. Like, they wouldn’t write buggy code that crashes and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25" target="_blank">shoots high doses of
radiation at patients</a>.</p>

<p>Having perfect software is a utopic scenario. Software is never perfect. And even if most people build safe
stuff most of the time, just a small group of reckless individuals is enough to cause disaster.</p>

<p>That’s where regulation comes in. Regulation basically says: “Hey, this one company screwed up big time
recently, so from now on, every company has to comply with this list of things we came up with. Those measures
will surely prevent that from happening again!”.</p>

<p>And that sucks. Because what did we do? We took the maximum observed stupidity of our society (writing buggy
code that emits radiation) and now we <em>assume</em> that 1) everyone else is just as stupid and 2) that some rules
we came up with will prevent the problem in the future.</p>

<p>Let’s think about these assumptions.</p>

<h3 id="1-can-we-assume-everyone-to-be-stupid">1) Can We Assume Everyone to Be Stupid?</h3>

<p>Does it really sound like a good approach to subject everyone to the same standards? Standards which were
created based on the most incapable person, the <em>most-stupid-denominator</em>?</p>

<p>This reminds me of working at the office (good times). In any company, there are always some people who are
more messy than others. Or should we rather say: Less diligent. While you’re trying to write code, they have
loud phone calls on speakerphone. They enter your meeting room and don’t close the door. Sometimes they
“forget” to use the toilet brush after deploying a large payload.</p>

<p>Now, how do you deal with these problems? You have two options:</p>

<p>You talk to those people individually. This is not only the most discreet, but also the most effective
way. It’s also the hardest. At least for you: It takes courage to approach that person and deliver that sort
of message. But it’s the right thing to do.</p>

<p>The other option would be: You attempt to <em>generalize</em> the problem and solve it <em>generically</em> by establishing
new company policies. You put up a sign in the open office saying “No loud phones calls!”. On all meeting room
doors, you write “Please close the door”. And in each bathroom, you hang up a framed SOP for when to use the
toilet brush.</p>

<p>This is how large companies deal with those problems, and companies in which people don’t have the guts to
talk about problems one on one. It’s a cowardly and ineffective move. Guess what - the dude who has loud phone
calls will most likely not read a random sign on the wall. And all other people who were behaving perfectly
fine are now subjected to a barrage of useless signs which assume they’re utterly incompetent at breathing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, regulation tries to solve problems in the same way.</p>

<p>Developers are expected to create hundreds of pages of documentation to prove that they’ve really tested
everything. They must write a development plan to ensure that they’re actually capable of developing whatever
they wanted to build (?). They have to make a list of their dependencies and test them (!).</p>

<p>If your development team is incompetent, forcing them to write a development plan won’t increase their code
quality. It only increases overhead.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, the same incompetent developers will pass all regulatory hurdles as long as they’re creating
the right documentation. A scary thought. Which leads me to the next question:</p>

<h3 id="2-will-our-rules-prevent-the-problem">2) Will Our Rules Prevent the Problem?</h3>

<p>Anyone who has ever observed complex systems knows: It’s hard to come up with interventions which actually
provide the desired outcome.</p>

<p>Say, your garden has snakes. You don’t like that because you want to sit on your patio and you’re scared of
snakes. So you put a honey badger there to chase away the snakes. Great, the snakes are gone. But now the
honey badger is settling down on your patio and has invited all his honey badger friends to hang out
there. Bad luck for you. A second order effect!</p>

<p>Is developing (medical) software a complex process? And, if so, can regulation be compared to a honey badger?
I think so.</p>

<p>We are introducing measures which we <em>assume</em> will improve things, because they were <em>associated</em> with certain
problems in the past. But in reality we don’t know if they were <em>causing</em> them. We just mixed up correlation
and causation.</p>

<p>It’s like observing people with Covid and saying “Aha! Those Covid patients are coughing! So let’s tell all
healthy people not to cough and they’ll be fine!”. Luckily our standards of medical science are better than
that. New treatments have to undergo clinical trials in which they must show an improvement in patient
outcome. Do our regulatory measures undergo similar testing? I’m not sure.</p>

<p>But one things <em>will</em> happen for sure: The list of hoops all future companies have to jump through just became
longer. And guess what? The useful time they can spend on developing their product has shrunk, again.</p>

<p>But here’s the worst part. After we’ve introduced our measures, software actually became safer. That leads us
to wrongly assume that <em>we chose the right measures</em> and <em>those measures caused improvements in safety</em>. But I
don’t think that’s true. Sure, we achieved our goal, but we don’t know <em>how</em>. Sounds like alchemy! A dangerous
situation.</p>

<p>I call these <em>second order effects of regulation</em>.</p>

<h2 id="second-order-effects">Second Order Effects?</h2>

<p>Do our regulatory measures <em>cause</em> us to develop safer software? Or are we kicking off second-order effects
and just accomplishing our goals by coincidence?</p>

<p>Let’s look at the facts.</p>

<p>Building medical software has tons of additional overhead. This leads to slower development, additional hires
and more audits. What do companies need when development slows down, head count increases and auditors knock
on your door? Right - more money.</p>

<p>We’re severely limiting the number of companies who can enter the market by raising the bar of funding
required.</p>

<p>What are the consequences?</p>

<p>Only companies with a lot of funding (and time) are able to enter the market. A two-person startup can’t
afford to hire expensive staff for regulatory compliance. And they sure as hell can’t afford to put countless
man-hours into documenting regulatory-compliant processes! What sort of processes do you need in a two-person
startup, anyway?</p>

<p>So: We’ve successfully prevented small startups from entering the market.</p>

<p>What’s the main difference between small startups and large companies? Small startups develop products which
solve existing problems in a novel way. They accomplish this through innovation which others deemed
infeasible, or too <em>risky</em>, or both.</p>

<p><em>Risky</em>. That’s the difference.</p>

<p>GE, Philips, Siemens - do you expect those enterprises to ship a <em>risky</em>, groundbreaking Machine Learning -
based Radiology software which radically automates radiology assessments? Hell no. You can hardly expect them
to ship any features at all. They’re too scared of changing things. They’re scared of things going wrong,
their public image taking a hit and losing their existing customers. They are <em>risk-averse</em>.</p>

<p>So, yes, our medical software has become safer, but not due to our regulatory requirements. Rather because
we’ve created a heavy selection bias of only allowing large, well-funded, risk-averse companies to enter the
market.</p>

<p>We achieved safety at the cost of killing innovation. Flying an airplane, we would say: Great landing, wrong
airport.</p>

<h2 id="a-decision-we-have-to-make">A Decision We Have to Make</h2>

<p>Nowadays, the daring two-person startup can no longer enter the market and reach patients. That’s where
innovation would have happened.</p>

<p>Is that a bad thing? Well, it depends.</p>

<p>Safety and progress are often on opposing ends of a spectrum - in most cases, you can’t have both. We, as a
society, have chosen to heavily favor safety over progress. Better keep things the way they are, because new
things can go wrong. And that’s a fair decision to make.</p>

<p>But I think we’re making the wrong decision. Because most of us are blind to the opportunity cost of <em>not
innovating</em>. We don’t see what would have happened to patients if we had had better software.</p>

<p>While I was working in the hospital, I would regularly be involved in admitting new patients. You won’t
believe how often they didn’t have an up-to-date list of their medication. I’d have to call their GP and
request their medication list to be <em>faxed</em>, if I could reach the GP at all. This process was slow and
error-prone.</p>

<p>Consider: If you’re hit by a car and wheeled into the ER, do you want your medication list to be unavailable
because your GP is unreachable? Do you want your patient history to be lost because it’s on paper, stashed
away in some drawer? Do you want to be exposed to additional radiation for imaging because your old images
are on a CD at your parents place?</p>

<p>Just how many …</p></article></div></div>

<p>This chapter is an attempt to illustrate what are the core principles of Data Oriented Programming as I understand them.
It is highly influenced by my programming experience in Clojure, but I believe that those principles are language agnostic.</p>
<p>One could adhere to them in an Object Oriented (OO) language like Java or C# and one could break them
in a Functional Programming (FP) language like Ocaml, Haskell, JavaScript (or even in Clojure).</p>
<p>In fact, in this chapter, I am going to illustrate how those principles could be applied or broken
in JavaScript, a programming language that supports both FP and OOP.</p>
<p>The principles of Data Oriented (DO) Programming are:</p>

<p>Each principle is explored in a separate article.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

  <p>A basic property of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature">digital signature scheme</a> is that it should specify which signatures are valid and which signatures are invalid, so that all implementations can accept only valid signatures and reject only invalid signatures. <em>Unfortunately, Ed25519 signatures don’t provide this property, making their use in distributed systems fragile and risky.</em></p>
<p>Although the scheme was standardized in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032">RFC8032</a>, the RFC does not specify validation criteria, and does not require conformant implementations to agree on whether a particular signature is valid. In addition, because the specification changed validation criteria years after deployment, it is incompatible with almost all existing implementations. Worse still, some implementations added extra ad-hoc criteria, making them further incompatible.</p>
<p>The result is an extremely wide variation in validation criteria across implemententations. The diagram below plots verification results of a \(14 \times 14\) grid of edge cases, with light squares representing accepted signatures, and dark squares representing rejected ones. As the diagram illustrates, verification results are generally inconsistent not just between implementations, but also between different versions and different modes. <img src="https://hdevalence.ca/images/ed25519-comparison.png"></p>
<p>Some protocols may tolerate this variation, but it is unacceptable for any protocol that requires participants to reach consensus on signature validity. A malicious participant can submit signatures that are accepted by some implementations but rejected by others, causing a network partitition or a consensus fork. Having only a single implementation makes this problem less obvious, but it doesn’t go away, since behavior can vary across versions of the ‘same’ implementation. This occurred in practice with the widely used <code>libsodium</code> library, which made breaking changes to validation criteria in a point release.</p>
<p>Finally, although all of these problems occur when verifying signatures individually, they also prevent the use of batch verification, which can provide a significant performance benefit.</p>
<p>This post describes:</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="the-scope-of-potential-divergence">The scope of potential divergence</h2>
<h3 id="the-ed25519-signing-process">The Ed25519 signing process</h3>
<p>Before explaining the validation criteria, it’s useful to briefly review the signing process. An honest signer generates their signing key, a random scalar \(a\), through a complicated procedure not relevant here. Then, they multiply their signing key by the Curve25519 basepoint \(B\) to obtain their verification key, a curve point \(A = [a]B\). The <em>signing</em> and <em>verification</em> keys are more commonly referred to as the <em>private</em> and <em>public</em> keys, but (following Daira Hopwood), I prefer to use the capability-based terminology, since it more precisely captures the role of the key material.</p>
<p>To sign a message <code>M</code>, a signer first generates a secret random nonce \(r\), through a procedure that is also not relevant here, and then form a public commitment to this randomness by computing \(R = [r]B\). Next, they use a hash function \(H\) to compute a challenge scalar as \( k \gets H(R, A, M) \). Finally, they compute a response scalar as \( s \gets r + ka \).</p>
<h3 id="divergence-in-ed25519-signature-validation-criteria">Divergence in Ed25519 signature validation criteria</h3>
<p>To understand the scope of potential divergence in validation criteria, let’s walk through the steps to verify a signature <code>sig</code> with verification key \(A\) on the message <code>M</code>, noting each step with a possibly divergent behavior choice. Then, in subsequent sections, we’ll look at the scope and implications of each divergence.</p>
<p>Ed25519 signatures are 64 bytes long, structured as two 32-byte components: <code>sig = R_bytes || s_bytes</code>. The first 32 bytes store an encoding of \(R\), and the second 32 bytes store an encoding of \(s\). Ed25519 verification keys are 32 bytes long, storing an encoding of \(A\).</p>
<p>Next, the verifier parses <code>s_bytes</code> as \(s\). It’s always possible to interpret a byte string as a little-endian encoded integer, so parsing \(s\) can’t fail. However, \(s\) is supposed to represent an integer \(\mod q\), where \(q\) is the order of the prime-order subgroup of Curve25519. Honestly-generated signatures will have \(0 \leq s &lt; q\), and implementations can choose to reject \(s \ge q\). Call this check <em>canonical \(s\)</em>.</p>
<p>Next, the verifier attempts to parse <code>A_bytes</code> as \(A\). Not all byte strings are valid point encodings, so parsing \(A\) can fail, causing the signature to be rejected. Points can be encoded non-canonically, although in contrast to the encoding of \(s\), the mechanism is somewhat more complicated and subtle, as will be described <a href="#canonical-a-r">below</a>. Implementations can choose to reject non-canonically encoded curve points. Call this check <em>canonical \(A\)</em>.</p>
<p>The verifier then uses <code>A_bytes</code>, <code>R_bytes</code>, and the message <code>M</code> to recompute the challenge value \(k \gets H(R, A, M)\). (Note that since \(H\) is a hash function, it actually operates on the encodings <code>A_bytes</code> and <code>R_bytes</code>, not their decoded internal representations).</p>
<p>Implementations then make a <em>choice of verification equation</em>, choosing which of two verification equations to check. They can use either the <em>batched equation</em> \[ [8]R = [8]([s]B - [k]A), \] or the <em>unbatched equation</em> \[ R = [s]B - [k]A. \] The naming of <em>batched equation</em> versus <em>unbatched equation</em> suggests that the difference is related to batched versus individual verification, but in fact these give different behavior even in the case of individual verification, as will be explained <a href="#choice-of-verification-equation">below</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, to actually check whichever equation is used, an implementation must choose an <em>equality check</em>. Recall that we didn’t actually decode <code>R_bytes</code> to \(R\) yet. When using the batched equation, an implementation must operate on \(R\), so it must decode <code>R_bytes</code> to \(R\), and check equality of curve points. This also means it must make a choice of whether to require <em>canonical \(R\)</em>.</p>
<p>When using the unbatched equation, however, an implementation can choose to either check equality of curve points, or to compute \(R’ \gets [s]B - [k]A\), encode \(R’\) to <code>Rprime_bytes</code>, and check equality of byte strings. When \(R\) is canonically encoded, these equality checks produce the same result. But because the encoding procedure produces canonical encodings, if <code>R_bytes</code> contains a non-canonical encoding of \(R\), then even if \(R’ = R\) (as curve points), <code>Rprime_bytes</code> may differ from <code>R_bytes</code> (as byte strings).</p>
<h3 id="points-of-potential-divergence">Points of potential divergence</h3>
<p>In summary, there are a number of points of potential divergence between implementations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Whether to require <em>canonical \(s\)</em> or to allow non-canonical encodings.</li>
<li>Whether to require <em>canonical \(A\)</em> or to allow non-canonical encodings.</li>
<li>The <em>choice of verification equation</em>, either <em>batched</em> or <em>unbatched</em>.</li>
<li>The <em>choice of equality check</em>, and the related choice of <em>canonical \(R\)</em>.</li>
<li>Any other <em>ad-hoc checks</em> added by a particular implementation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before comparing the choices made by RFC8032 and actually existing implementations, let’s examine the exact mechanism and implications of each of these points of potential divergence.</p>
<h3 id="canonical-s">Canonical \(s\)</h3>
<p>The values <code>A_bytes</code>, <code>R_bytes</code>, and <code>M</code> are all fed into the hash function, so they cannot be modified without changing the challenge value. However, a third party could replace \(s\) with \(s’ = s + nq\). Because \(s’ \equiv s \pmod q\), the modified signature \((R, s’)\) would still pass verification. Requiring that <code>s_bytes</code> encodes \(s &lt; q\) prevents this.</p>
<p>This check is simple, low-cost, prevents malleability, is required by RFC8032, and is performed by most implementations. The only notable exception is the original reference implementation of Ed25519, which chose to write a paragraph arguing that signature malleability is never a problem instead of performing the check.</p>
<p>Because this check is fairly common, well-known, and unobjectionable, I didn’t focus on it, and didn’t comprehensively test implementation behavior.</p>
<h3 id="canonical-a-r">Canonical \(A\), \(R\)</h3>
<p>While the mechanism for constructing non-canonically encoded scalar values is fairly simple, the mechanism for constructing non-canonically encoded point values is somewhat more complicated, as mentioned <a href="#divergence-in-ed25519-signature-validation-criteria">above</a>. To explain it, we need to describe the “compressed Edwards \(y\)” encoding used by Ed25519.</p>
<p>Curve25519 is defined over the finite field of order \(p = 2^{255} - 19\), so the coördinates of curve points \((x,y)\) are integers \(\mod p\). The curve equation in (twisted) Edwards form is \[ - x^2 + y^2 = 1 + d x^2 y^2, \] where \(d\) is a curve parameter. This means that \[ x^2 = \frac { y^2 - 1} {d y^2 + 1}. \] If the fraction on the right-hand side is nonsquare, then there is no \(x\) so that the right-hand side equals \(x^2\), and the \(y\) value is not the \(y\)-coördinate of a curve point. If it is square, then there is a square root \(x\), and the value of \(y\) is sufficient to recover \(x\) up to a choice of sign.</p>
<p>Because \(p &lt; 2^{255}\), the encodings of field elements fit in 255 bits. The compressed Edwards \(y\) format uses the first 255 bits to store the \(y\) coördinate, and the 256th bit to indicate the sign of the \(x\) …</p></div></div></div></div>

You can find perfect tools to automate your routine tasks or build fantastic processes causing you no trouble. You can get all other issues resolved, but the human factor will still be your biggest risk.</p><p id="ece5">Currently, I wear two official corporate hats. I am a Marketing Strategy Adviser at <a href="https://maddevs.io/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=new-manager" rel="noopener">Mad Devs</a> and a Senior Community Manager at <a href="https://postgrespro.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=new-manager" rel="noopener">Postgres Professional</a>. So I am deeply involved in managing contractors, supervising my colleagues’ work, and <strong>people management</strong> in general.</p><p id="1124">Below is the list of dos and don’ts taken from my own experience. I decided to share it as these simple rules have brought me a lot of good at work and in my volunteer projects, too.</p><p id="4726">I’ve seen my team striving not just to do their job — they said, they were trying to please me, too. I managed to become a person of high trust. I got sensitive info from them on time and, thus, could prevent disasters. I got informed about blockers and enjoyed 100% smooth collaboration. So this list is battle-tested. It proved to be working well.</p><h2 id="945c"><strong>1. Build trust</strong></h2><p id="f5e8">I have always enjoyed the difference between <em>fight against</em> and <em>fight with</em>. If your team feels that you fight with them, being their brother or sister in arms, they will trust you. If your team member is looking for external help from anyone except you, it is not a good sign. They feel some tension as you fight against them, consciously or not.</p><p id="a11d">Let’s imagine that you are not the first person your inferiors share their concerns with. What will they do then? They will escalate all issues to your manager or leave your team. How to avoid this?</p><p id="d406">Don’t pretend to be a superhero — share with people your failures, not only wins. Use self-irony where possible. Don’t treat people as functions. Remember that they have families, health issues, hobbies. Let them live a life, no one is obliged to sacrifice themselves to work. Share their grief and joy — be a human, not a function, too.</p><h2 id="4804"><strong>2. Be thankful</strong></h2><p id="47f4">Another person can never meet your expectations by 100% because they are not you. Great managers say, if work is done the right way by at least 50%, thank the guy and provide them actionable feedback. Another 50% of issues might be resolved thanks to your remarks. You never know until you try.</p><p id="a372">Very often we are focusing on what people under us are doing wrong. You will surely spot the loose points and things you are unhappy with, criticizing is the easy part of it. Try to find words of support for what people do the right way. Someone has completed an important mission on time? Express some gratitude, not all people are responsible enough to do so! If someone works long hours and weekends, don’t pretend that it’s okay. Thank the hard worker and make sure they have enough time for rest, too.</p><h2 id="1a53"><strong>3. Give credits</strong></h2><p id="1c77">People hate when the results of their efforts are stolen. Don’t position yourself as the only one working on important tasks. Otherwise, you’ll face many departures in your team. If you report the completion of an important project, mention all contributors. Use public praise extensively. Communicate the progress every team member makes to C-levels and HR. Ensure that timely promotions and bonus payments go to everyone who deserves them.</p><p id="4d7f">People want fair treatment. Bear in mind, that everyone tends to overestimate their role and contribution. It’s normal and you need to stay aligned with your team’s expectations. And they expect praise and respect for what they do. Whoever authored a win, always mention this guy. If you are great at that, it will also encourage people to own their mistakes. If they know that you prefer to praise people, not scold them, they are less likely to conceal their failures.</p><h2 id="c26a"><strong>4. Support initiatives</strong></h2><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Managers in office." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/10368/0*nwPXykrgKpYDWgDM" width="5184" height="3888" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*nwPXykrgKpYDWgDM 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/0*nwPXykrgKpYDWgDM 500w" sizes="500px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*nwPXykrgKpYDWgDM?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="afc9">People feel discouraged if they share a good idea in vain. Be a person who cares for people’s proposals. Otherwise, they’ll find a better workplace where their voices can be heard. Let them speak freely and criticize you, too.</p><p id="9284">Caring staff members are never silent, they bring innovation to the table. Of course, you cannot accept each and every idea. This might introduce chaos and break the existing process. However, if their initiatives are not even considered, people usually stop even trying. Consider every proposal. Let your answer be well-grounded, be it a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’. If you cannot implement 100% of the employee’s plan, put in place 50% — sane people will be grateful for it, too. Your staff doesn’t expect change to happen in the blink of an eye. They simply want to see things moving and take part in this process.</p><h2 id="0bbe"><strong>5. Take details into account</strong></h2><p id="3cad">On a busy day, we all tend to scan our inbox rather than read emails one by one. Yet, not all people are great at subject lines or clear messages. Something important can always slip away because we are not robots. Re-read emails from the silent team members who rarely remind you of their existence. They might be important.</p><p id="c143">What looks easy to handle for you, might be a matter of life and death for your employee. Remember that your starters might be frustrated and see a tragedy in every minor mistake. Remember that your most experienced game players might need more rest. While reading a message, try to see the person’s emotional condition behind the lines. Are they stressed or disappointed? People do expect advice and interest from you. If you feel that something is wrong, you’d better ask about it. In many cases, it decreases turnover. Just ask.</p><h2 id="5e79"><strong>1. Don’t overpromise</strong></h2><p id="3eb8">Setting wrong expectations is a common mistake. Not only with customers, with your staff too. Imagine that you know for sure that the company won’t promote a person from your department any time soon. Don’t use promotion as motivation in this case. Don’t pretend that it became impossible all of a sudden due to the employee’s recent failure.</p><p id="eb22">Underpromising is much better than overpromising. If you surprise your team members by a special bonus, it will trigger excitement. Imagine that the bonus is just being discussed. You know that it depends on a contract with a big name customer which might or might not be signed. Don’t talk about it in advance. Otherwise, your inferiors will blame you for extra expectations and the consequent disappointment. If you are not sure about something yet, don’t mention it.</p><h2 id="2d5e"><strong>2. Don’t micromanage</strong></h2><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Wall with just don't." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/7194/0*eACMQJEz4eZRPFd0" width="3597" height="2391" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*eACMQJEz4eZRPFd0 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/0*eACMQJEz4eZRPFd0 500w" sizes="500px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*eACMQJEz4eZRPFd0?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="f2ac">Let people go for the tasks assigned to them. Don’t prevent them from doing their job popping up here and there and criticizing what is not yet ready for review. This is disrespectful, and this proves that you are not a mature manager. If your team perceives you as someone willing to catch them by the hand for a round of scolding, it won’t bring you any good.</p><p id="314e">Let’s say you need to control the progress your team makes on a large task. Find a special time for demo sessions where the team will present the changes to you. Discuss all blockers there and correct mistakes on the go. Let people know that you struggle for the best possible result. Give them a hint that you don’t need the crown of the smartest person. In this case, they will take your criticism much easier.</p><h2 id="8b17"><strong>3. Don’t play games</strong></h2><p id="7e07">A good result should be the only goal of any work-related activity. Usually, it’s a measurable thing. An amount of money on your recent contract. A number of your software downloads, or repo followers. Non-profit organizations also track the number of people served monthly.</p><p id="531a">Don’t use your workplace to play any kind of ‘superior-inferior’ games. It will ruin your career and reputation with time. Do you make people feel bad to enjoy yourself as someone possessing power? It’s the sign of a mental disorder, and you’d better consult a psychotherapist taking a break off work. Do you give a person a task they obviously cannot cope with? Deliberately propose unrealistic deadlines? Make long hours a regular practice without any real need? Compare two team members making them compete with each other? All these things should be on your ‘avoid’ list. Make sure that you are King Arthur for your team, not a suppressor. People hate being insulted or humiliated. They quit.</p><h2 id="3530"><strong>4. Don’t pretend to be a saint</strong></h2><p id="abe8">Everybody makes mistakes, and you are no exception. In fact, you are in a position to make fatal mistakes — the ones that may affect the future of the entire team. If you have come up with a misconception that proves to be a failure for your co-workers, own it. You haven’t researched things or even had not enough qualifications. So people wasted their time. They might be even deprived of their bonuses and promotions due to your lack of vision.</p><p id="c29c">Be honest about the mistakes you have made recently or in the past. Only strong people admit that they are imperfect. You won’t lose your team’s respect honestly saying that you were wrong. Especially if you do something about your mistake. Moreover, other people on the team will more likely share their mistakes too. Be their fellow sinner.</p><h2 id="bf64"><strong>5. Don’t look for scapegoats</strong></h2><p id="1d8a">No one likes that “boss &amp; fools” game. Don’t look for a person to blame for every failure. It is unproductive and bad from an ethical viewpoint. After investigating what went wrong, focus on fixing things asap, not punishment. You can look into the reasons after firefighting. Most likely you’ll discover that there is more than one person and factors behind every problem.</p><p id="6f98">If you have a ‘scapegoat on duty’ on the team, you are obviously biased against this person. Take immediate action. If you don’t like working with someone, talk to HR and other hiring managers. Discuss the possible transfer opportunities for this person. Make sure that these opportunities are communicated to them. If you cannot work together for some reason, be honest about it. Someone incompatible with you can still bring value elsewhere within the company. Good managers handle such cases fast if they inherited a team from another manager. If you hired a wrong person for your team, you own it, too. Invest your time in training them. You might have to let them go, sharing the …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p id="DIY"><h2>DIY R&amp;D vs outsourcing R&amp;D to Ukraine</h2></p><div><div><p>If you intend to set up your own R&amp;D center, you’ll need at least three times deeper pockets than you will set up shop in Ukraine. If you’re in a hurry to get going</p><p>The decision to set up an R&amp;D center is one that shouldn’t be made without a solid due diligence effort. You’ll need to examine risks and advantages, scope of effort, objectives, impact on your core strategy. Next, cost assessments which should be compared against your options – by location and relative to outsourcing opportunities. If you go ahead with it locally, you’ll need to source a location, possible construction or infrastructure requirements, and start hiring.</p><p>Aside from cost of options, the set up time between DIY and Outsourcing R&amp;D can vary by six months, on average. Depending upon your requirements, outsourcing options are likely to be up and running within 1-3 months. Setting up an R&amp;D center from scratch and staffing it can take a year or more, or perhaps 6 months if a suitable facility is already available.</p><p>As we’ve discussed several times, the all inclusive <a href="https://perceptionbox.io/business/san-francisco-hiring-vs-outsourcing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">costs of Ukrainian developers</a> are 25-50% less than their Western European and North American counterparts. For an example, factoring on a basis of (an all-inclusive) $50k per Ukrainian developer vs. a US median wage of $107k + $20k in taxes and bare-benefits:</p><ul><li>A team of 20 developers in Ukraine will cost $1 million + office space, annually.</li><li>A team of 20 developers in the US will cost $2.5 million + office space, annually.</li></ul><p>If you get into the nitty-gritty, extending purchasing power parity across all line items, Ukraine will easily offer a 3-to-1 cost advantage for your R&amp;D dollar.</p></div></div><p id="How"><h2>How &amp; why tech leaders are doing R&amp;D in Ukraine</h2></p><div><div><p>United States companies account for about 50% of all IT related investments in Ukraine, but it is truly open to international partnerships. Companies from South Korea, Japan, France, and Sweden, to name a few are all active here. How they enter the Ukraine R&amp;D sector varies considerably – from mergers and acquisitions to strategic partnerships, to direct investments. Their reasons – or the technologies attracting them reflect the full range of high-tech spectrum.</p><p>The following list reflects R&amp;D activities in Ukraine by the largest tech companies – how they entered, their tech focus, and staffing – where available.</p></div></div><p id="Amazon"><h2>#1. Amazon: Merger &amp; Acquisition - IoT &amp; Pattern Recognition</h2></p><div><p>Amazon has its hands in everything and wants to get into consumer homes in a big way. In 2018, Amazon acquired Ring for over $1 billion, picking up its R&amp;D office in Kyiv. Ring specializes in IoT doorbells, security cameras, and facial recognition technology. Since then, <a href="https://www.uadn.net/2019/02/22/amazon-subsidiary-ring-opens-new-rd-office-in-western-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ring has expanded</a> from 300 to 900 IT specialists, with an additional office opened in Lvov, in 2019.</p></div><p id="Alphabet"><h2>#2. Alphabet/Google: Merger &amp; Acquisition - VMware &amp; Cloud</h2></p><div><p>Like Amazon, Google has a tendency to gobble up enterprising startups. In late 2019, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/inside-google-cloud/helping-customers-run-more-vmware-workloads-in-the-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google acquired CloudSimple</a>, with undisclosed terms. CloudSimple makes it easy for companies to, “migrate their VMware workloads from on-premises data centers directly into Google Cloud.” Google opened its first office in Kyiv in 2006 for customer support. CloudSimple’s Ukrainian office has 30 engineers,</p></div><p id="Oracle"><h2>#3. Oracle - Merger &amp; Acquisition - Cloud</h2></p><div><p>In August of 2015, <a href="https://www.oracle.com/corporate/pressrelease/oracle-buys-maxymiser-082015.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oracle acquired Maxymiser</a> – a New York based company with offices in Kyiv and Dnipro, for $160 million. Oracle is the 2nd largest software company by revenue and market capitalization. Maxymiser provides cloud-based software to help marketers, “test, target and personalize what a customer sees on a Web page or app.”</p></div><p id="Samsung"><h2>#4. Samsung -  Own Offices - AI, Security, and Next Gen Imaging</h2></p><div><p>One of the largest R&amp;D centers in all of Europe, <a href="https://research.samsung.com/srk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Samsung R&amp;D Institute Ukraine</a> was established in 2009 in Kyiv. In 2013, Samsung opened up an additional R&amp;D facility in Kharkov bringing its estimated IT staff to over a thousand. Samsung’s R&amp;D efforts focus on artificial intelligence, data intelligence, information security, next-generation communications and visual technologies to include AR/VR.</p></div><div><p><img src="https://perceptionbox.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2.jpg" data-src="https://perceptionbox.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2.jpg" alt="image"></p></div><p id="Ubisoft"><h2>#5. Ubisoft: Own Offices - Game Development</h2></p><div><p>Ubisoft has over 700 staff in development offices in Kyiv and Odessa. Headquartered in France, Ubisoft is the fifth largest publicly traded game company in the US and EU. It’s known for blockbusters like Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon and other hits, while also recently entering into movie production.</p></div><p id="Wargaming"><h2>#6. Wargaming.net: Strategic Partnership - Game Development</h2></p><div><p>In 2011, Wargaming.net established a strategic partnership with Persha Studia and its 550 employees. Founded in 2000, Persha Studia has collaborated with Electronic Arts, Activision, and Cryptic. Now it handles development for Wargaming’s World of Warplanes and World of Tanks: Generals.</p></div><p id="Ebay"><h2>#7. Ebay and Adobe: Merger and Acquisition - eCommerce</h2></p><div><p>In 2011, the online auction-platform eBay acquired Magento, a Los Angeles-based company, for $180 million. Magento is an open-source eCommerce platform. It’s entire development process was defined by its Kyiv development office which has about 200 staff. Then, 7 years later, <a href="https://100cms.org/news/magento/710-Adobe-buys-Magento-company-with-office-in-Ukraine-for-$-168-billion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adobe purchased Magento from eBay for $1.68 billion</a>, with its Ukrainian team intact. That’s almost a 10x increase!</p></div><p id="And"><h2>And for Startups? Looksery</h2></p><div><div><p>There are many, manor more Research and Development centers throughout Ukraine. They can be found working for other big names like Siemens (automation), Boeing (aeronautics), Netcracker (Telecom), Ericsson (IoT, eHealth and eGov), and Rakuten (eCommerce). But, there’s a lot of potential for startups and small R&amp;D teams, too — the opportunities are not exclusive to the big boys.</p><p>Looksery, founded in 2013, had a small development team in Odessa – less than 10 developers in total. One of the first popular Augmented Reality apps, it was backed by a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/looksery/looksery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$45k Kickstarter campaign</a> in March of 2015. Six months later? Snapchat acquired it for $150 million.</p></div></div><p><h4>Summary</h4></p><div><div><p>Though just a superficial snapshot and proverbial iceberg, the R&amp;D opportunities in Ukraine continue to grow. The largest of tech companies have found, in their words, that Ukraine offers an incredible cost-advantage. Every $1 spent or invested in Ukrainian R&amp;D efforts is roughly the equivalent of $3 in the United States. These examples also show that Ukrainian offices are not just jettisoned or closed after acquisitions – but retained. Afforded an opportunity, Ukrainian developers and IT specialists can propel truly dramatic growth and profitability – for megacorps or bootstrapping startups.</p><p>If you’d like to find out more about your R&amp;D options in Ukraine – we’d love to hear from you!</p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

			<p>The ECB, as guardian of the euro, provides currency in two forms: we issue banknotes and we transfer electronic deposits to banks and other financial institutions.</p>
			<p>Digitalisation has spread to every corner of our lives and transformed how we pay. In this new era, a digital euro would guarantee that citizens in the euro area can maintain free access to a simple, universally accepted, safe and trusted means of payment. A digital euro is not meant to replace cash, but rather to complement it. Together, they give people more choices about how to pay, and make it easier for them to do so,  increasing financial inclusion. </p>

			<p>The Eurosystem will continue to ensure that all citizens have access to euro banknotes and coins across the euro area.</p>

				<p>A digital euro would make your daily payments faster, easier and more secure.
						It could support the digitalisation of the European economy and actively encourage innovation in retail payments. 			
				</p>
				<p>The ECB and the national central banks of the euro area are exploring the benefits and risks so that money continues to serve Europeans well.</p>

				<h3>What are other benefits of a digital euro?</h3>
				<p>A digital euro would preserve the benefits that the euro provides to all of us. It would help to deal with situations in which people no longer prefer cash. </p>
						<p>It would help cushion the impact of extreme events – such as natural disasters or pandemics – when traditional payment services may no longer function. It could also be crucial if people were to turn to foreign digital means of payment, which might undermine financial stability and monetary sovereignty in the euro area.

			<h3>When will it be ready?</h3>
			<p>During the preparation phase, we are working on the concept, starting practical experimentation on possible designs, and discussing with stakeholders and international partners.
					Towards the middle of 2021 we will decide whether to launch a digital euro project. This will be followed by an investigation phase on user requirements and service providers.
								
			</p>
			<p>It would take time to develop a safe, accessible and efficient digital currency. We will ensure that the systems we use to pay keep up with the needs of the people who use them.   </p>

				<h3>Why would a digital euro not be a crypto-asset?</h3>
				<p>Crypto-assets are fundamentally different from central bank money: their prices are volatile because they lack any intrinsic value and there is no reliable institution backing them. 
				</p>
			<p>People using a digital euro would have the same level of confidence as with cash, since they are both backed by a central bank, which is something crypto-assets such as stablecoins cannot provide.  </p>

		<h3>Share your opinion with us!</h3>
		
		 <p>Like the euro we already use every day, the design of a digital euro should meet the needs of a broad range of users. Any assessment must therefore take into account all of its implications, for instance for monetary policy and financial stability.

		<em>The story of a bug, and how I addressed it.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		Okay, I admit it: I could have given this article all sorts of alternative titles, each of which would have made as much sense as the one I chose. I didn't want to go with some of the other titles I had in mind, because they would give it all away up front. I didn't want to spoil the surprise.
	</p>
	<p>
		I recently ran into this bug, it took me hours to troubleshoot it, and I was appalled when I realised what the problem was.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is the story of that bug.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are several insights from this story, and I admit that I picked the most click-baity one for the title.
	</p>
	<h3 id="94bc204499df483897121bb0343f73f7">
		Yak shaving <a href="#94bc204499df483897121bb0343f73f7" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		I was working on the umpteenth variation of an online restaurant reservations system, and one of the features I'd added was a schedule only visible to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma%C3%AEtre_d%27h%C3%B4tel">maître d'</a>. The schedule includes a list of all reservations for a day, including guests' email addresses and so on. For that reason, I'd protected that resource by requiring a valid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token">JSON Web Token</a> (JWT) with an appropriate role.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'd deployed a new version of the API and went for an ad-hoc test. To my surprise, that particular resource didn't work. When I tried to request it, I got a <code>403 Forbidden</code> response.
	</p>
	<p>
		"That's odd," I though, "it worked the last time I tried this."
	</p>
	<p>
		The system is set up with continuous deployment. I push <em>master</em> to a remote repository, and a build pipeline takes over from there. It only deploys the new version if all tests pass, so my first reaction was that I might have made a mistake with the JWT.
	</p>
	<p>
		I wasted significant time decoding the JWT and comparing its contents to what it was supposed to be. I couldn't find any problems.
	</p>
	<p>
		I also meticulously compared the encryption key I'd used to sign the JWT with the key on the server. They were identical.
	</p>
	<p>
		Incredulous, and running out of ideas, I tried running all tests on my development machine. Indeed, all 170 tests passed.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, I gave up and ran the API on my development machine. It takes all of a 30 seconds to configure the code to run in that environment, so you're excused if you wonder why I didn't already do that. What can I say? I've almost two decades of experience with automated test suites. Usually, if all tests pass, the problem is environmental: a network topology issue, a bad or missing connection string, a misconfigured encryption key, an invalid JWT, things like that.
	</p>
	<p>
		To my surprise, the problem also manifested on my machine.
	</p>
	<h3 id="b726532ae06844eb8aeaa2c27ca0d913">
		Not my code <a href="#b726532ae06844eb8aeaa2c27ca0d913" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Okay, even with hundreds of tests, perhaps some edge case went unnoticed. The only problem with that hypothesis was that this was hardly an edge case. I was only making a <code>GET</code> request with a <code>Bearer</code> token. I wasn't going through some convoluted sequence of steps.
	</p>
	<pre>GET /restaurants/1/schedule/2020/9/30 HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5c[...]</pre>
	
	<p>
		I expected a successful response containing some JSON, but the result was <code>403 Forbidden</code>. That was the same behaviour I saw in the production environment.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now, to be clear, this is indeed a protected resource. If you present an invalid JWT, <code>403 Forbidden</code> is the expected response. That's why I wasted a few hours looking for problems with the the JWT.
	</p>
	<p>
		I finally, hesitatingly, concluded that the problem might be somewhere else. The JWT looked okay. So, hours into my troubleshooting I reluctantly set a breakpoint in my code and started the debugger. It isn't rational, but I tend to see it as a small personal defeat if I have to use the debugger. Even so, if used judiciously, it can be an effective way to identify problems.
	</p>
	<p>
		The debugger never hit my breakpoint.
	</p>
	<p>
		To be clear, the beginning of my Controller method looked like this:
	</p>
	<pre>[<span>Authorize</span>(Roles&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span>"MaitreD"</span>)]
[<span>HttpGet</span>(<span>"restaurants/{restaurantId}/schedule/{year}/{month}/{day}"</span>)]
<span>public</span>&nbsp;<span>async</span>&nbsp;<span>Task</span>&lt;<span>ActionResult</span>&gt;&nbsp;Get(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>int</span>&nbsp;restaurantId,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>int</span>&nbsp;year,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>int</span>&nbsp;month,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>int</span>&nbsp;day)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>if</span>&nbsp;(!AccessControlList.Authorize(restaurantId))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>return</span>&nbsp;<span>new</span>&nbsp;<span>ForbidResult</span>();</pre>
	
	<p>
		My breakpoint was on the first line (the <code>if</code> conditional), but the debugger didn't break into it. When I issued my <code>GET</code> request, I immediately got the <code>403 Forbidden</code> response. The breakpoint just sat there in the debugger, mocking me.
	</p>
	<p>
		When that happens, it's natural to conclude that the problem occurs somewhere in the framework; in this case, ASP.NET. To test that hypothesis, I commented out the <code>[Authorize]</code> attribute and reissued the <code>GET</code> request. My hypothesis was that I'd get a <code>200 OK</code> response, since the attribute is what tells ASP.NET to check authorisation.
	</p>
	<p>
		The hypothesis held. The response was <code>200 OK</code>.
	</p>
	<h3 id="fdff404f12644a898b6a3e695fb6533f">
		Test interdependency <a href="#fdff404f12644a898b6a3e695fb6533f" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		I hate when that happens. It's up there with fixing other people's printers. The problem is in the framework, not in my code. I didn't have any authorisation callbacks registered, so I was fairly certain that the problem wasn't in my code.
	</p>
	<p>
		I rarely jump to the conclusion that there's a bug in the framework. In my experience, <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-first-rule-of-programming-its-always-your-fault">select is rarely broken</a>. My new hypothesis had to be that I'd somehow managed to misconfigure the framework.
	</p>
	<p>
		But where? There were automated tests that verified that a client could request that resource with a valid JWT. There were other automated tests that verified what happened if you presented an invalid JWT, or none at all. And all tests were passing.
	</p>
	<p>
		While I was fiddling with the tests, I eventually ran a parametrised test by itself, instead of the entire test suite:
	</p>
	<pre>[<span>Theory</span>]
[<span>InlineData</span>(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>"Hipgnosta"</span>,&nbsp;2024,&nbsp;11,&nbsp;&nbsp;2)]
[<span>InlineData</span>(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>"Nono"</span>,&nbsp;2018,&nbsp;&nbsp;9,&nbsp;&nbsp;9)]
[<span>InlineData</span>(<span>"The&nbsp;Vatican&nbsp;Cellar"</span>,&nbsp;2021,&nbsp;10,&nbsp;10)]
<span>public</span>&nbsp;<span>async</span>&nbsp;<span>Task</span>&nbsp;GetRestaurantScheduleWhileAuthorized(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>string</span>&nbsp;name,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>int</span>&nbsp;year,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>int</span>&nbsp;month,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>int</span>&nbsp;day)</pre>
	
	<p>
		This parametrised test has three test cases. When I ran just that test method, two of the test cases passed, but one failed: the <em>Nono</em> case, for some reason I haven't yet figured out.
	</p>
	<p>
		I didn't understand why that test case ought to fail while the others succeeded, but I had an inkling. I commented out the <em>Nono</em> test case and ran the test method again.
	</p>
	<p>
		One passed and one failing test.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now <em>The Vatican Cellar</em> test case was failing. I commented that out and ran the test method again. The remaining test case failed.
	</p>
	<p>
		This reeks of some sort of test interdependency. Apparently, <em>something</em> happens during the first test run that makes succeeding tests pass, but it happens too late for the first one. But what?
	</p>
	<h3 id="c95c3e707f46467abbf8ff02a9594c4c">
		Bisect <a href="#c95c3e707f46467abbf8ff02a9594c4c" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Then something occurred to me that I should have thought of sooner. This feature used to work. Not only had the tests been passing, but I'd actually interacted with the deployed service, presenting a valid JWT and received a <code>200 OK</code> response.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once than dawned on me, I realised that it was just a manner of performing a binary search. Since, of course, I use version control, I had a version I knew worked, and a version that didn't work. The task, then, was to find the commit that introduced the defect.
	</p>
	<p>
		As I've already implied, the system in question is an example code base. While I have a cloud-based production environment, none but I use it. It had been four or five days since I'd actually interacted with the real service, and I'd been busy making changes, trusting exclusively in my test suite. I tend to make frequent, small commits instead of big, infrequent commits, so I had accumulated about a hundred and fifty commits since the 'last known good' deployment.
	</p>
	<p>
		Searching through hundreds of commits sounds overwhelming, but using binary search, it's actually not that bad. Pick the commit halfway between the 'last known good' commit and the most recent commit, and check it out. See if the defect is present there. If it is, you know that it was introduced somewhere between the commit you're looking at, and the 'last known good' commit. If it isn't present, it was introduced later. Regardless of the outcome, you know in which half to look. You now pick a new commit in the middle of that set and repeat the exercise. Even with, say, a hundred commits, the first bisection reduces the candidate set to 50, the next bisection to 25, then 13, then 7, 4, 2, and then you have it. If you do this systematically, you should find the exact commit in less than eight iterations.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is, as far as I understand it, the algorithm used by <em>Git bisect</em>. You don't have to use the <code>bisect</code> command - the algorithm is easy enough to do by hand - but let's see how it works.
	</p>
	<p>
		You start a <code>bisect</code> session with:
	</p>
	<pre><span>mark@Vindemiatrix</span> <span>MINGW64</span> <span>~/Documents/Redacted/Restaurant</span> <span>((93c6c35...))</span>
$ git bisect start

<span>mark@Vindemiatrix</span> <span>MINGW64</span> <span>~/Documents/Redacted/Restaurant</span> <span>((93c6c35...)|BISECTING)</span></pre>
	
	<p>
		This starts an interactive session, which you can tell from the Git integration in Git Bash (it says <code>BISECTING</code>). You now mark a commit as being bad:
	</p>
	<pre>$ git bisect bad

<span>mark@Vindemiatrix</span> <span>MINGW64</span> <span>~/Documents/Redacted/Restaurant</span> <span>((93c6c35...)|BISECTING)</span></pre>
	
	<p>
		If you don't provide a commit ID at that point, Git is going to assume that you meant that the current commit (in this case <code>93c6c35</code>) is bad. That's what I had in mind, so that's fine.
	</p>
	<p>
		You now tell it about a commit ID that you know is good:
	</p>
	<pre>$ git bisect good 7dfdab2
Bisecting: 75 revisions left to test after this (roughly 6 steps)
[1f78c9a90c2088423ab4fc145b7b2ec3859d6a9a] Use InMemoryRestaurantDatabase in a test

<span>mark@Vindemiatrix</span> <span>MINGW64</span> <span>~/Documents/Redacted/Restaurant</span> <span>((1f78c9a...)|BISECTING)</span></pre>
	
	<p>
		Notice that Git is already telling us how many iterations we should expect. You can also see that it checked out a new commit (<code>1f78c9a</code>) for you. That's the half-way commit.
	</p>
	<p>
		At this point, I manually ran the test method with the three test cases. All three passed, so I marked that commit as good:
	</p>
	<pre>$ git bisect good
Bisecting: 37 revisions left to test after this (roughly 5 steps)

Now my name shows up (it didn’t before!) as someone who violates Twitter rules (I didn’t!) and was accordingly suspended.</p><p>I tried to boost my visibility via social media but ended up hurting it: people <em>have</em> referred to my handle but anyone who looks at it will see a <a href="https://twitter.com/SableMeyer">suspended account with no activity</a></p></section><section id="motivation"><h2>Motivation</h2><p>I consider most social media to be harmful at the individual and societal level. A position I can afford because, while I sometime rant against events organized solely on Facebook, I am lucky to be in an environnement where I can avoid them and remain socially connected.</p><p>Recent discussions and readings made me reconsider this position when it comes to Twitter. While I can wave it off my personal life and lose nothing, evidence piles up that for my professional career in academia, having a presence on twitter matters, notably to improve cites <span data-cites="eysenbach2011can luc2020does">[1, 2]</span> and to be informed of new papers before/as they are published.</p><p>I was convinced to open a Twitter account about a month ago, mid 2020. My research advisor was speaking in a conference of high attendance and presented joint work. After the talk he asked me for my account so that he could cite me when twitting the article he mentioned. I could have replied that I didn’t want or need an account, but my advisor’s account has over 20k followers – including pretty much anywhere I could imagine myself applying after a PhD – and declining seemed so unwise I created an account and sent an email on the spot.</p></section><section id="the-downfall"><h2>The downfall</h2><p>Opening an account was a pleasant experience and done in less than a minute. The “phone number” field is optional: while I don’t doubt they already have it (as of this writing the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android">android app</a> requires contact access), this was meant to be a professional account and I consider my phone number personal so I was happy to be given the possibility not to fill that field.</p><p>I proceeded to add two pictures of me, update my profile a bit, and follow my research advisor. Then I could do nothing else. My account was immediately suspended and I received an email stating: “Your account appears to have exhibited automated behavior that violates the Twitter Rules”. Trying to log it now required my phone number. Given the process so far, I thought I could do without so instead I chose to click the “contact support” link and wrote a gentle note saying that I did not have a phone number to give<span><label for="sn-0"></label><span>This was probably a bad call, but I stand by the fact that (i) I was implicitly promised that it would not be a requirement, and (ii) I do not have a “professional” phone number and giving my personal one seemed innapropriate</span></span>, but that my account was legitimate nonetheless. After having to confirm my email address once more, I didn’t hear a thing from Twitter, ever. I wrote follow up emails after two weeks, then waited more, to no avail. Eventually my email received an automated response: “You tried to update a case that has been closed. Please submit a new case at&nbsp;http://support.twitter.com/forms”, which I did.</p></section><section id="the-hostage-situation"><h2>The hostage situation</h2><p>Up until now, looking for me on Twitter resulted in not finding me, which I’m fine with. Where it gets messy is that for the past month, if you look for me you’ll see an account that has both my face and the text “Account suspended: Twitter suspends accounts which violate the Twitter Rules”. In a very Kafkaesque way, no one but twitter know which rule I violated or how (recall, I didn’t have time to do anything!), and I don’t know how to redeem myself in Twitter’s eyes.</p><p>I should have known better: this part of <em>why</em> I think current big social media are harmful: they’re not public spaces and have to answer to close to no one. Twitter is free to do whatever they want on their website, and ultimately they get to decide who has a say. But still, I find what they did rather odd: they have such a dominant position that the incentives to register were stronger than my (very strong!) dislike of the website. This is a net win for them: I could have been part of the snowball, and maybe take other people around me who are Twitter-sceptics. Yet instead of rewarding me for making the jump and embracing their newly gained user, they crushed me, leaving a sour taste of abuse of power.</p></section><section id="what-ill-do"><h2>What I’ll do</h2><p>I don’t think there’s much I can do. The dark pattern “no phone required” into “if you don’t give a phone you’ll get banned” won’t look good if looked into seriously by the French DGCCRF (consumers’ protection) but I doubt they will lift a finger, and even if they did we’re talking long timescale. I could create another account, “give up my phone”, but then I’d also give up the handle and the tweets that already reference it. I can forever give up on twitter after being bitten exactly by what I feared would bite me.</p></section><section id="edit-update-mid-september"><h2>Edit: Update mid-September</h2><p>Waiting for an update, so far I didn’t do anything except, every other week, trying to submit a request again. I get automatic (accurate) replies in the form of “It looks like this is connected with your original case <ticket number="">, so we’ve added it to that first report.” and that’s it.</ticket></p></section><section id="edit-update-early-october"><h2>Edit: Update early-October</h2><p>Nothing to report except automatic “acknowledgement” emails (as if…)</p><hr><div id="refs" role="doc-bibliography"><p>[1] Eysenbach, G. 2011.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I'm not a Tailwind shill. I'm a <a href="https://www.swyx.io/guo-lai-ren/">Guo Lai Ren</a> - someone who has changed their mind on it recently and am a happy user despite acknowledged tradeoffs. "Crossover people" can often be more persuasive to skeptics than born-and-bred believers. So I hope to contribute my perspective to the discussion, if you are open to it.</p>
<p>A while ago Adam Wathan <a href="https://twitter.com/tailwindcss/status/1303740401967390720?s=20">asked</a>: "Did you think Tailwind was a horrible idea until you actually built something with it?"</p>
<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1303769383278268416">replied</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I once complained to @samselikoff that Tailwind caused ugly unreadable classname soup and said zero-runtime CSS-in-JS could do more with a lower learning curve.</p>
  <p>I was wrong on 2 counts: Tailwind is easier to learn than I thought, and CSSinJS's flexibility can be a <em>negative</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After shipping a few projects (including my <a href="https://www.swyx.io/">personal site</a> and <a href="https://www.learninpublic.org/">book site</a>) with <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind</a> now, I feel I should probably jot down my thoughts on what I like about it. Since Tailwind is the predominant Utility CSS framework and the only one I've tried, I'll make no effort to distinguish the points below from the general benefits of Utility CSS (but <a href="https://css-tricks.com/need-css-utility-library/">here's a list of others</a>).</p>
<section>
  <h2 id="tldr"><a href="#tldr">TL;DR</a></h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Inlining Styles reduces Naming</strong>: Ship faster by solving one of the known hard problems in Computer Science!</li>
    <li><strong>"System" Values reduce Magic Numbers</strong>: Decrease hardcoded values, Increase consistency.</li>
    <li><strong>Responsive Design in the Browser</strong>: Prototype in browser, copy and paste to codebase, using consistent system values.</li>
    <li><strong>Inlining Styles Optimizes for Change</strong>: Make code easy to delete and move, by reducing cognitive distance to zero.</li>
    <li><strong>Zero JS &amp; Sublinear Scaling of CSS</strong>: Scale at O(log N), not O(N).</li>
    <li><strong>Utility-First, not Utility-Only</strong>: Respect the Principle of Least Power, use CSS-in-JS only when warranted.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Before you listen to me, you may wish to check out the most influential pieces on the "utility classes" revolution in CSS right now:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Adam Wathan's blogpost on <a href="https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/">CSS Utility Classes and "Separation of Concerns"</a></li>
    <li>Simon Vrachilotis' talk on <a href="https://twitter.com/simonswiss/status/1057078025118871552?s=20">A Real Life Journey into the Opinionated World of Utility-First CSS</a> (see also: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R50q4NES6Iw">Sarah Dayan's talk</a>)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I am heavily influenced by these people and others, so if I repeat some points poorly below, the fault is mine. At least I gave you the canonical sources first.</p>

<section>
  <h2 id="inlining-styles-reduces-naming"><a href="#inlining-styles-reduces-naming">Inlining Styles reduces Naming</a></h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.swyx.io/how-to-name-things/">Naming Things</a> is a known hard problem. We waste a lot of time bickering over naming classes. With Styled-Components, you often write a bunch of intermediate styled components you have to name. With <a href="http://getbem.com/naming/">BEM</a>, we replace one naming problem with three and a half naming problems (I've had PRs held up on whether I should've used <code>--</code> or <code>__</code> - what a total waste of time). How many millions in developer-hours do we waste every year bickering over names?</p>
  <p>With utility CSS we significantly reduce the total number of names in our codebase. This feels minor until you've worked on a codebase where it isn't. What price are you willing to pay to eliminate one of the known known hard problems? I'm not kidding - this is a conversation worth having. Names don't matter to machines but they matter to humans.</p>
  <p>The tradeoff is you have to learn the names from the utility CSS framework. <code>-mb-5</code> and <code>space-x-reverse</code> aren't parseable without docs. The difference is that traditional CSS naming is bespoke per project, whereas you learn Tailwind once and can use them in every project. Yes, you could try to roll your own utilities, but Tailwind's naming is probably more thoughtfully designed than whatever you come up with.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Alternatives exist: Emotion's <code>css</code> prop and <code>styled-jsx</code> also let you skip naming.</p>
  </blockquote>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="system-values-reduce-magic-numbers"><a href="#system-values-reduce-magic-numbers">"System" Values reduce Magic Numbers</a></h2>
  <p>CSS is extremely flexible, which makes it powerful, but also gives you a lot of footguns to shoot yourself with. Constraints are needed, or else we sprinkle "magic numbers" all over our codebase.</p>
  <p><a href="https://css-tricks.com/magic-numbers-in-css/">Magic Numbers in CSS are a bad thing</a>, says Chris Coyier. He defines it to mean "<em>values which “work” under some circumstances but are frail and prone to break when those circumstances change</em>", but honestly any hardcoded number, like <code>px</code> in margins and media queries, or color variants, is difficult to manage well at scale. The temptation to break rules just to ship a fix is there, and the difficulty of refactoring when design requirements change is too high. If you are working by yourself, there is nothing enforcing that you stick to a consistent set of well designed number scales, which can lead to bad-looking design.</p>
  <p>The solution, of course, is to draw only from a preset range of number values, which I call a "system" (note that I don't call this a "Design System", a debate I have no interest in getting into). Tailwind comes with a good set of font and color systems by default. Again, you could try to roll your own system with CSS variables, but you don't have <a href="https://www.steveschoger.com/speaking/">Steve Schoger</a> on your team.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Alternatives exist: <a href="https://styled-system.com/">Styled-System</a> and <a href="https://theme-ui.com/home/">Theme UI</a> from the <a href="https://jxnblk.com/">jxnblk</a>-verse are the basis for this in CSS-in-JS land.</p>

<section>
  <h2 id="responsive-design-in-the-browser"><a href="#responsive-design-in-the-browser">Responsive Design in the Browser</a></h2>
  <p>This point is most relevant to developers-who-do-design: the best development workflow is to preview your site on <code>localhost</code>, make adjustments in the browser until you are happy with it, and then copy-and-paste your changes <strong>straight into your codebase</strong>. Let's call this the <strong>Design in Browser</strong> workflow.</p>
  <p>If you want this workflow, you rule out using React's inline styling (which make you use object syntax). But let's say you do use some form of "Write Real CSS"™ solution like Styled-Components or Vue or Svelte scoped styles, where design-in-browser is possible. What else does Tailwind offer you?</p>
  <ol>
    <li>You can pull directly from preset "system" values (elaborated above) while prototyping in browser</li>
    <li>You can do responsive and pseudo-class design while in browser too - e.g. to apply styles at different breakpoints, or on hover or focus, you can just prefix inline, e.g. for a link, <code>text-green-400 hover:text-green-300 md:text-blue-400</code>.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>I did a demo of this in a recent video:</p>
  
  <p>Designing in the Browser is not quite Bret-Victor-style <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII">Inventing on Principle</a>, but you are getting at least closer to being able to "play" in context by reducing the cognitive distance yet again. With Tailwind, you can even add <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/transition-property#app">transitions</a> and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/animation#app">animations</a> inline while you play. This is extremely underrated - we developers might offer more movement in our apps if only it were easier to prototype and add them.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="inlining-styles-optimizes-for-change"><a href="#inlining-styles-optimizes-for-change">Inlining Styles Optimizes for Change</a></h2>
  <p>A lot of production CSS is <a href="https://css-tricks.com/oh-no-stylesheet-grows-grows-grows-append-stylesheet-problem/">append only</a>. This is because the <strong>cognitive distance</strong> between the CSS and the markup it affects is often far - sometimes in a different folder, different file, or same file but dozens of lines away. On top of that, you have to remember the CSS cascade and run every element against every matching rule, in your head.</p>
  <p>Pretty soon, you have a codebase you are scared to even open! Developer velocity slows down, and eventually you back yourself into a corner where nothing less than a full rewrite will do.</p>
  <p>By design, CSS is easy to extend. Just add specificity! But <a href="https://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/write-code-that-is-easy-to-delete-not-easy-to">it is not easy to delete</a>. This adds complexity, in <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/">the best Rich Hickey sense of the word</a> (because position matters in CSS, you know have to remember all positions). It's easy to build up the house of cards, but take one thing out and the whole edifice may fall apart, and you WON'T KNOW until you check for visual regressions or emulate the browser in your head.</p>
  <p>You can use tooling (CSS modules, static CSS in JS, Vue or Svelte <a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/the-zen-of-just-writing-css">scoped styles</a>) or naming conventions (BEM, etc) to control specificity, but that reduces the cognitive distance rather than eliminates it. The only option with zero "spooky action at a distance" is inline styling. Inline styling <a href="https://overreacted.io/optimized-for-change/">optimizes for change</a>.</p>
  <p>"Galaxy Brain" time: Tailwind offers the developer velocity benefits of inline styles without its downsides.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Alternatives exist: Other solutions like Emotion's <code>css</code> prop and <code>styled-jsx</code> offer similar benefits of inline styles, but they run into the standard CSS in JS downsides</p>

  <h2 id="zero-js--sublinear-scaling-of-css"><a href="#zero-js--sublinear-scaling-of-css">Zero JS &amp; Sublinear Scaling of CSS</a></h2>
  <p>A lot of ink has been spilled about the performance tradeoffs of using CSS in JS, and their mitigating factors. You can check my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qox56z4xH6o">What's New in React talk</a> for more, but rest assured it is hotly debated with passionate, intelligent people on both sides. But we all agree that the less JS you ship, the better, and we also agree that byte-for-byte, shipping 1kb of JS has a far bigger performance impact than 1kb of CSS. Those are well understood.</p>
  <p>The point I'm keen on exploring here is that many CSS and CSS in JS solutions scale linearly with the number of components in your app. Because CSS scopes each declaration to your identifier, you have to repeat it everywhere you want to apply it. This is how we ended up with &gt;50 declarations of <code>font-weight: bold</code> at a previous workplace. Individually, these don't matter, but in bulk, they add up.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"On our old site, we were loading more than 400 KB of compressed CSS (2 MB uncompressed)... We didn’t start out with that much CSS; it just grew over time and rarely decreased. This happened in part because every new feature meant adding new CSS." - <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/web/facebook-redesign/">Facebook Engineering</a></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>You can defer this problem with code-splitting, but eventually people ship and implement hacky workarounds to the point where the CSS gets out of control again (particularly if it is append-only!).</p>
  <p>The solution here is (arguably!) to ship "atomic" CSS, so that your CSS scales by <code>O(log N)</code> instead of <code>O(N)</code> (where <code>N</code> is your number of components). <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1187411809667436550">Facebook's unreleased stylex library</a> lets you write CSS in JS and generates atomic CSS for you, but you could also just choose to hand-write atomic CSS, which is what utility frameworks like Tailwind guide you do.</p>
  <p>To be fair, I put this point at the bottom, because it is unlikely that most apps get to the scale where this really starts to matter, especially when taking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip">gzip</a> into account. However, like with all optimizations, these things are premature until they are not.</p>

									Welcome to the second interview on 'The Observer Effect'. We are lucky to have one
									of the most influential founders/CEOs in technology and media - Daniel Ek, Founder
									and CEO of Spotify. This interview was published on 4th October, 2020.

							</em></p><p><em>Daniel does things very differently from other business leaders and was generous to go
								deep with us on his leadership style, time management, decision making, Spotify's impact
								on the world and much, much more. Enjoy!
								</em>
							</p><p><b><a href="https://sriramk.com/">Sriram Krishnan</a></b><br>
								<em><strong>Let’s start with the basics. Walk me through a typical day in the life of
										Daniel Ek.</strong></em>
							</p><p><strong>Daniel Ek</strong><br>
								So, this will sound incredibly lazy compared to some leaders. I wake up at around 6:30
								in the morning and spend some time with my kids and wife. At 7:30, I go work out. At
								8:30, I go for a walk – even in the winter. I’ve found this is often where I do my best
								thinking. At 9:30, I read for thirty minutes to an hour. Sometimes I read the news, but
								you’ll also find an ever-rotating stack of books in my office, next to my bed, on tables
								around the house. Books on history, leadership, biographies. It’s a pretty eclectic mix
								– much like my taste in music. Finally, my “work” day really starts at 10:30.
							</p><p>
								Many people make big decisions early on in the day, I make them later in the day--at
								least later in the day here in Europe. Ironically, it's not actually because I'm more
								productive then, rather because we have so many of our staff in the US, and as a result,
								I've kind of primed myself to work that way.
							</p><p>
								So the earlier part of my day is focused on coaching, one-on-ones, and planning. Then, I
								typically tackle one topic a day which takes a lot of my time. That's my big thing for
								the day. Before we go into a live team discussion on that particular topic, I invest
								time to prepare beforehand – reading and talking to members of the team who are either
								part of the decision-making process or who have insights and context. I sometimes even
								get external perspectives.
							</p><p>
								I also think about what my role is at that meeting. Sometimes I'm the approver. Other
								times, I'm supposed to come with a thoughtful perspective on whether an initiative makes
								sense or not.
							</p><p>
								I’ve found that creating this clarity of role for myself is critical. It’s something I
								challenge my direct reports to think about as they engage with their own teams. I remind
								them that all meetings are not the same. Even when we are meeting to discuss really,
								really complicated topics I always ask myself: “What am I going to do in this meeting?
								What does my involvement really need to be?”
							</p><p>
								The truth is: it's entirely contextual. I find it crucial to be upfront about everyone’s
								role in different meetings, I think this is super, super important. Often that's my
								number one thing: to make sure I know what role I'm playing.</p><p>
								<b><i>Wow, okay, there are multiple things in there ranging from how you choose to spend
										your time to how you handle meetings. To work backwards, what makes a good
										meeting in your mind?
									</i></b></p><p>A great meeting has three key elements: the desired outcome of the meeting is clear ahead
								of time; the various options are clear, ideally ahead of time; and the roles of the
								participants are clear at the time.
							</p><p>
								I often find that meetings lack one of those elements. Sometimes they lack all those,
								which is when you have to say, “This is a horrible meeting, let's end it and regroup so
								it can be more effective for everyone.”
							</p><p>
								To clarify outcomes, options, and roles ahead of time, we sometimes rely upon a preread.
								Prereads are a great way to share context so that attendees can quickly get into the
								meat of the issue and not waste time getting everyone up to speed. What I find is when
								you use a tool like a Google Doc, you can take in a great deal of information by reading
								comments, assessing options, and understanding how opinions have evolved over time. With
								this uniform background and context, attendees can focus on discussing the matter at
								hand versus getting on the same page. When the latter happens, the meeting becomes an
								incredible waste of time.
							</p><p>
								I think that's the single largest source of optimization for a company: the makeup of
								their meetings. To be clear, it's not about fewer meetings because meetings serve a
								purpose. Rather, it’s key to improve the meetings, themselves. A lot of my efforts focus
								on teaching people this framework. Ironically, I find that most people are just
								challenged by that stuff.
							</p><p>
								Candidly, that’s my role as leader: to coach others on how best to make use of their
								limited time. Not only is time the most precious resource the company has, it’s also the
								most precious resource they have! It’s crucial that they approach the use of their time
								with a holistic perspective. By way of example, I had a recent call with one of my
								directors who had not taken a vacation in six months. Our conversation delved into why
								this person thought that they could not be away for two weeks, and me arguing for why
								the person had to take two weeks to recharge!
							</p><p>
								There is never enough time – for work, for family and friends – and it takes work to
								make the best use of it. It's all about fostering a holistic perspective in life.

							</p><p>
								<b><i>
										That’s fascinating. Let’s turn to your team.

										Your direct reports are highly accomplished people; what are the common mistakes
										you see executives at that level make when it comes to personal time management?
									</i>
							</b></p><div>
							<div><p>
								I don’t think most executives dedicate enough time to thinking. They spend too much time
								in meetings. By the way, I will say as a caveat, I do know people who are incredibly
								organized and succeed with a lot of “do time.” Shishir Mehrotra [Co-founder and CEO of
								Coda] is a great example. If you've seen the docs on how he organizes his time...
								</p><p>

								<b><i>Oh yeah, he has a lot of very well-organized docs! [laughs]</i></b></p></div><p>
								He is a source of inspiration. For a while, I tried to mimic his style because I was so
								impressed with his thinking behind it. But in the end, it just wasn’t for me. It
								actually drove me nuts. <i>[Sriram laughs]</i>
								But I respect him. I would say he's a highly effective executive. His system works for
								him. It's not one size fits all. Some of my direct reports thrive on lots of meetings.
								But, in general, I would say the largest mistake is that they conflate meetings with
								productivity. Often fewer meetings and better decisions drive the business forward.

							</p>
							<h2 id="opencalendar"><b>On Creating an Open Calendar</b></h2>
							<p>


								<b><i>This dovetails nicely with something that fascinates many of your colleagues: how
										do you have so much open time on your calendar?

										This drastically differs from your typical “successful CEO” who is booked from
										8:30am to 6pm. Walk us through your calendar and how you manage to create this
										open space.
									</i></b>

							</p>

							<p>

								My friends know me well! I do keep a lot of open time. I understand this comes from a
								place of privilege and I’m very lucky to have this flexibility.
							</p>
							<p>

								I feel like synchronous time is very costly; asynchronous time is better. I know there
								are some leaders who prefer to have all executive decisions travel through them. But
								then, you have to wait until the leader has availability to review things. Sometimes you
								run into delays in that process.
							</p>
							<p>
								I typically don't have more than really three or four meetings per day. There are
								exceptions; when I travel, I book in a lot more and I don't keep to my normal schedule.
								That said, most of the time it's three or four meetings a day.

							</p>
							<p>
								My way is to plan long term and do so ahead of time so that people better understand the
								direction in which they're going. You have to be incredibly crisp and clear when doing
								that. For instance, right now we're finalizing our five year plans and long range
								planning. These are actual, real targets fueled by real insights. They are made up of
								lots of super-detailed quarterly and annual goals. I don’t spend much time on the
								quarterly goals and instead focus on our so-called “big rocks.”
							</p>


							<h2 id="bets"><b>On Company Bets</b></h2>
							<p>
								At Spotify, we have something called “Company Bets.” These are large-scale initiatives
								that we believe will have a significant impact on the business within a relatively short
								period of time. I find that these bets are a much better use of my time. Our Company
								Bets typically update every six months, so I'm not needed that much in between. This
								way, I can constantly be thinking: “Where are we headed in the next six months?” Right
								now, I am thinking more about H2 2021. From a timeline perspective, that's the earliest
								place where I focus most of my time.
							</p>
							<p>
								It’s also my role to think far beyond that. For instance, I’m immersing myself in our
								2025 plans. I trust my team to manage the day-to-day, shorter-term initiatives and
								iterate as needed based on data and insights. They’re the best at that and I appreciate
								that this then frees me up to think about the long term.

And I can, for example, start drafting a blog post on one computer, but finish it on another.</p><p>All I need is a cheap rented virtual private server and Visual Studio Code on every machine I want to code from.</p><hr><p>But first of all the reason why I got the idea in the first place:</p><p>To program in Go, I mainly used <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IDEA Ultimate</a> from JetBrains in the past. The best IDE a developer can wish for. Excellent for Java, Kotlin, Go and a lot of other programming languages. And pretty cool: As a student you can get the full IDE for free.</p><p>However, since I won’t be a student forever and IDEA Ultimate or as an alternative just <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoLand</a> from JetBrains <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/store/#personal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren’t very cheap</a> (at least for hobby projects), I thought I might get used to a different workflow now that will cost me less money later.</p><p>The second best option for developing Go is probably <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visual Studio Code</a>. The Go team took over the development of <a href="https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Go extension</a> not too long ago, which will hopefully make it more and more pleasant to develop Go programs with VS Code in the future.</p><p>VS Code is free, partly even <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open source</a> and I already use it for quite a lot of things anyway, be it for writing longer blog articles or if I need to write some JavaScript. In itself it is just a text editor, but there are quite a few extensions that add all kinds of functionality. And VS Code is fast and available for all three major computer operating systems.</p><p>For VS Code there is an extension called “Remote - SSH” (documentation is available <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>) with which it is possible to connect to another computer or server via SSH. On the remote computer VS Code installs a remote server to provide almost all functionality that is possible locally. It’s like running VS Code directly on the remote computer and developing from there.</p><p>As a server I use the cheapest option from <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hetzner Cloud</a>. With just a few clicks I created a VPS with Ubuntu 20.04, two Gigabytes of RAM and 20 GB SSD storage. I also use Ubuntu 20.04 on my desktop computer and laptop, the environment I am used to. And if the server should be too weak for certain tasks, I can scale it up with a few clicks, even temporarily. The costs are 2,89 € per month. If I don’t need the server for a longer period of time, I could also create an image of the hard drive, delete the server and create a new one later based on the image. That would cost only a few cents per month.</p><p>This way I only have to install all the tools I need on the server. Like Go for the programming of various private projects or Hugo for this blog and my website. But I don’t have to install these tools on all my devices anymore, namely my desktop computer, my Ubuntu-ThinkPad and my Surface Go. There I only need Visual Studio Code with the “Remote - SSH” extension.</p><p>It definitely takes some getting used to in order to adapt to the less comfort you might be used to through the JetBrains IDE. But once you have found the right settings of the Go extension (for example that the Go language server <code>gopls</code> is used), then programming with this setup works quite well.</p><p>My favorite feature is definitely the ability to forward ports from the server to the local machine.</p><p>The only possible negative point is that I need an internet connection to develop so that I can connect to the server. But so often I am not without internet and even in Germany the mobile network should be sufficient for SSH. And when I am offline, I will just have to do something else.</p></div></div>]]>

            <p>The most common piece of advice you'll receive if you want to learn programming is that you should do programming to learn it. While this is well-meaning advice, since doing programming is better than reading about it, it's incomplete.</p>

<p>Following this incomplete advice alone can prevent you from falling in love with programming. One of the worst implementations of this advice is learning programming by solving programming riddles.</p>

<h2>Problems with puzzles</h2>

<p>There are many problems with solving riddles, but let's start with isolation. They are isolated from the real world, so once you complete them, you're done with them. They never change. Real-world software does not behave like this. Real-world software has to deal with the only real constant — change. How adaptable your software is to change will tell you how well you're programming. You don't get this feedback by solving puzzles. Change is a great teacher, and it will teach you about the importance of tests early. Riddles can't teach you that.</p>

<p>The next problem with riddles is that they are too focused on algorithms. Unless you plan to work on algorithm-heavy products like Google Search, you shouldn't focus on that. Sure, that knowledge might get handy for technical interviews with companies that emulate FAANG interview practices, but that's a topic for another article.</p>

<p>Another problem with solving riddles is that they give you the wrong picture of programming. Solving puzzles encourages cleverness, while code that's too clever is a smell in real-world software. If it's difficult to understand for people that have to maintain it (this includes your future self, a more forgetful individual than you might think), it's not well written. As Donald Knuth famously said, "Programs are meant to be read by humans and only incidentally for computers to execute. "Good programmers make their code as easy to understand as possible, and solving riddles discourages that. Solving puzzles encourages the most innovative hacks possible, which is excellent if you want to compete in programming competitions, but real-world software is not like that.</p>

<p>Solving riddles can discourage you from learning to program and falling in love with it. I haven't yet met a programmer who said that solving programming riddles made him fall in love with programming. Maybe they exist, but it's usually something else.</p>

<h2>Importance of having a bigger goal</h2>

<p>Solving riddles is the impulsive implementation of this incomplete advice. You are rushing to do some programming, without having a bigger goal. The problem with this is that it's not sustainable. If you don't have a bigger goal, your motivation will be shallow, and you'll be more likely to quit when things get tough. Having a bigger goal will push you through obstacles.</p>

<p>An excellent bigger goal is solving a problem that's currently painful for you. Your local bus has a shitty website, and you have to search like a madman to find the next bus? Scrape their data and build the one yourself, and you'll never have that problem again. You are searching for a new apartment, but you're getting tired of continually refreshing the website for ads? Build a program that does that for you.</p>

<p>Whatever it is, if there's a real-life problem that you would like to get rid of with some programming, that's much better than solving riddles for the sake of it. By doing this, you'll have a much better picture of what programming is and realize how useful it is.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Streaming systems continuously ingest and process data from a variety of data sources. They build on append-only data structures to enable efficient write and read access, targeting low-latency end-to-end. As more of the data sources in applications are machines, the expected volume of continuously generated data has been growing and is expected to grow further [1][2]. Such growth puts pressure on streaming systems to handle machine-generated workloads not only with low latency, but also with high throughput to accommodate high volumes of data.</p>
<p><a href="https://pravega.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pravega</a>&nbsp;(“good speed” in Sanskrit) is an open-source storage system for streams that we have built from the ground up to ingest data from continuous data sources and meet the <a href="https://pravega.io/docs/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stringent requirements</a> of such streaming workloads. It provides the ability to store an unbounded amount of data per stream using&nbsp;<a href="https://pravega.io/docs/latest/pravega-concepts/#a-note-on-tiered-storage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tiered storage</a>&nbsp;while being <a href="https://pravega.io/docs/latest/pravega-concepts/#elastic-streams-auto-scaling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elastic</a>, <a href="https://pravega.io/docs/latest/pravega-concepts/#architecture">durable</a> and <a href="https://pravega.io/docs/latest/pravega-concepts/#ordering-guarantees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistent</a>. Both the write and read paths of Pravega have been designed to provide low latency along with high throughput for event streams in addition to features such as long-term retention and stream scaling. This post is a performance evaluation of Pravega focusing on the ability of reading and writing.</p>
<p>To contrast with different design choices, we additionally show results from other systems: <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a> and <a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/">Apache Pulsar</a>. Initially qualified as messaging systems, both Pulsar and Kafka make a conscious effort to become more like a storage system; they have recently added features like tiered storage. These systems have made fundamentally different design choices, however, leading to different behavior and performance characteristics that we explore in this post.</p>
<p>The main aspects covered in this post and the highlights of our results are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="#pravega-ingestion">Overall ingestion performance</a>.</em>&nbsp;A Pravega writer produces over <strong>1 million events</strong>&nbsp;<strong>per second</strong>&nbsp;<strong>for small events</strong> (100 bytes) and <strong>sustains 350MB/s throughput for large events</strong> (10,000 bytes), both with <strong>single-digit millisecond latency</strong>&nbsp;(at the 95th percentile).</li>
<li><a href="#durability"><em>Durability</em></a>. <strong>Pravega always makes the data durable on acknowledgment</strong>. The write throughput of Kafka is at least 40% less compared to Pravega for a single-segment stream, independent of flushing on every message or not. For a 16-segment stream, the Pravega writer provides comparable throughput to the Kafka writer flushing on every message, but Pravega write latency is lower (<em>i.e.</em>, single-digit millisecond vs. 1+ seconds for Kafka).</li>
<li><em><a href="#dynamic-batching">Dynamically adjusting batches</a>.</em>&nbsp;Pravega <strong>does not</strong>&nbsp;<strong>require a complex configuration for client batching</strong>. The Pulsar client can achieve either low latency or high throughput, but not both. For Kafka, configuring large batches is detrimental for throughput when the application uses routing keys (throughput is 80% lower for a 16-segment stream). In both cases, forcing the user to statically configure batching is undesirable.</li>
<li><em><a href="#high-throughput">Behavior in the presence of large events for throughput-oriented workloads</a>. </em><strong>Pravega obtains up to 350MB/s for a 16-segment stream with 10kB events.&nbsp;</strong>The throughput&nbsp;is 40% higher than the one of Pulsar and comparable to the throughput of Kafka (about 6% difference). However, the latency in the case of Kafka is over 800ms while the one of Pravega is in single-digit milliseconds.</li>
<li><em><a href="#end-to-end-latency">End-to-end latency</a></em>. When tailing a stream, the Pravega reader also provides <strong>single-digit millisecond latency</strong>&nbsp;<strong>end-to-end&nbsp;</strong>while serving data at high throughput. It provides a higher throughput (roughly 80% more) for a single-segment stream when compared to Kafka. For Pulsar, adding partitions and readers leads to lower performance (single-partition case achieves 3.6x the throughput of the 16-segment case).</li>
<li><em><a href="#routing-keys">Use of routing keys</a></em>. <strong>Pravega does not present any significant performance difference when using or omitting routing keys.</strong>&nbsp;For moderate/high throughput rates, Kafka and Pulsar show over 2x end-to-end latency when using routing keys and, specifically for Kafka, a maximum read throughput that is over 37% lower.</li>
<li><em><a href="#historical-catchup">Tiered storage for catch-up and historical reads</a>.</em>&nbsp;Pravega can&nbsp;<strong>catch up with 100GB of historical data dynamically</strong>&nbsp;<strong>while ingesting 100MB per second of new data</strong>. Pulsar with tiering enabled was not able to catch up for the same scenario, inducing a backlog that grows without bounds.</li>
<li><em><a href="#auto-scaling">Performance with auto-scaling</a>. </em><strong>Auto-s</strong><strong>caling is a unique feature of Pravega</strong>. Scaling up a stream provides higher ingestion performance. We show that scaling up a stream using a constant ingestion rate of 100MB/s causes&nbsp;<strong>write latency to drop.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Except when we show time series, we plot latency along with throughput. It is a problem we commonly find across blog posts; they plot either latency or throughput, whereas both are jointly relevant for streaming workloads. For example, the maximum throughput for a given configuration might look very good while the latency is of the order of hundreds of milliseconds to a few seconds. We plot latency-throughput graphs to avoid misleading conclusions. We additionally provide tables with the data points used to complement the plots. The tables give more data than the plots (<em>e.g.</em>, different percentile ranks) for completeness.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Pravega is a complex system, and we encourage the reader to investigate further our documentation, including <a href="https://blog.pravega.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous blog posts</a>. Here, we provide a very brief summary of the write and read paths, along with some key points of Kafka and Pulsar.</p>
<h3>The Pravega write path</h3>
<p>Pravega has different APIs for adding data to a stream. In this section, we primarily focus on the <a href="https://pravega.io/docs/latest/javadoc/clients/index.html"><em>event stream API</em></a>.</p>
<p>The <em>event stream writer&nbsp;</em>writes events to a stream. A stream can have parallel segments that can change dynamically according to an auto-scaling policy. When an application provides routing keys, the client uses them to map events to segments.&nbsp; If the routing key is omitted when writing an event, then the client selects a segment randomly.</p>
<p>The client opportunistically batches event data, and writes such batches to a segment. The client controls when to open new batches and close them, but the data for a batch accumulates on the server. The component in Pravega managing segments is called the <em><a href="https://blog.pravega.io/2019/04/22/events-big-or-small-bring-them-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">segment store</a></em>. The segment store receives such requests to write to a segment, and both add the data to a cache and appends it to a <em>durable log</em>, currently implemented with <a href="https://bookkeeper.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apache BookKeeper</a>. When appending to the durable log, the segment store performs a second round of batching. We have this second level of aggregation to sustain high throughput for use cases in which the message size is small and possibly infrequent.</p>
<p>The log guarantees durability: Pravega acknowledges events once they are made durable to the log, and uses such logs only for recovery. As the segment store keeps a copy of the written data to its cache, it flushes data out of the cache to tiered storage, called <em>long-term storage </em>(LTS), asynchronously.</p>
<p>BookKeeper splits its storage among journal, entry logger, and index. The journal is an append-only data structure, and it is the only data structure critical for the write path. Entry loggers and indexes are used in the read path of BookKeeper. In Pravega, the BookKeeper read path is only exercised during the recovery of segment stores. Consequently, the capacity of the write path depends primarily on the journal and not the other data structures, setting aside any occasional interference they can induce.</p>
<h3>The Pravega read path</h3>
<p>An application reads events individually using instances of the <em>event stream reader</em>. Event stream readers form part of a reader group and internally coordinate the assignment of stream segments. Stream readers read from the assigned segments, and they pull segment data from the segment store. Each time a reader fetches segment data, it fetches as much as it is available, up to a maximum of 1MB.</p>
<p>The segment store always serves data from the cache. If it is a cache hit, then serving the read does not require an additional IO. Otherwise, the segment store fetches the data from LTS in blocks of 1MB, populates the cache, and responds to the client. The segment store does not serve reads reading data from the durable log.</p>
<h3>Pulsar and Kafka</h3>
<p>Both Pulsar and Kafka define themselves as streaming platforms. Pulsar implements a broker that builds on Apache BookKeeper. The broker builds on the abstraction of a managed ledger, which is an unbounded log comprising BookKeeper ledgers that are sequentially organized. BookKeeper is the primary data store of Pulsar, although it optionally enables as part of a recent feature to <a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/concepts-tiered-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tier data to long-term storage</a>.</p>
<p>Pulsar exposes the topic abstraction, and enables topics to be partitioned. Pulsar producers produce messages to topics.&nbsp; It provides different options for receiving and consuming messages, such as different subscription modes and reading manually from topics.</p>
<p>Kafka also implements a broker and exposes partitioned topics. Kafka does not use an external storage dependency like Pravega and Pulsar; it relies on local broker storage as the primary storage of the system. There is a proposal for <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-405%3A+Kafka+Tiered+Storage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adding tiered storage to Kafka in open-source</a>, but to our knowledge, it is only available as a <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/infinite-kafka-storage-in-confluent-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preview feature in the Confluent platform</a>. Consequently, we only compare tiered storage with Pulsar.</p>
<p>Both Pulsar and Kafka implement client batching, and enable the configuration of such batching. For both, two main parameters control client-side batching:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maximum batch size</strong>: this is the maximum amount of data that the client is willing to accumulate for a single batch.</li>
<li><strong>Maximum wait time or linger</strong>: this is the maximum amount of time that the client is willing to wait to close a batch and submit it.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is an inherent trade-off between maximum batch size and waiting time: larger batches favor throughput in detriment of latency, whereas shorter waiting times have the opposite effect. If batches can be accumulated fast enough, then it is possible to obtain both high throughput and low …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting" id="applying-make-invalid-states-unrepresentable">
  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><time itemprop="datePublished">02 October 2020</time></p>

<p>Here are some real life cases of applying one of my
<a href="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/articles/my-principles-for-building-software/">favourite principles</a>.</p>

<p>I’ll try to update this as I come across good examples.</p>

<h2 id="case-1-contiguous-time-periods">Case 1: Contiguous Time Periods</h2>

<p>A straightforward way to represent a period of time is by its start
and end dates (<code>(Date, Date)</code>):</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/c1.png"></p>

<p>If we need to represent a timeline split in to contiguous periods, it
may be tempting to represent this as a sequence of periods (e.g. <code>List
(Date, Date)</code>):</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/c2.png"></p>

<p>However, with this representation there can be both gaps in the
timeline and overlapping periods:</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/c3.png"></p>

<h3 id="improved-representation">Improved Representation</h3>

<p>We can improve this representation so that the contiguous and
non-overlapping constraints always hold, and we can do this in a way
that may remind you of database normalisation - by removing
redundancy.</p>

<p>In a well formed contiguous timeline, the joint start/end
of the adjacent periods are redundant. Contiguous, non-overlapping
splits can simply be represented by a set of dates (<code>Set Date</code>):</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/c4.png"></p>

<p>You can begin to see how this representation simplifies the system
when you consider how to make a further split in the timeline. In the
list representation, splitting a period requires carefully modifying
the data-structure and ensuring constraints aren’t violated. In the
‘set of dates’ representation you simply add a date to the set.</p>

<p>It is sometimes still useful to represent the periods as a sequence of
start and end dates. It is trivial to project the set of dates in to
this form. As long as the canonical representation is the set, the
constraints will still hold.</p>

<h2 id="case-2-default-contracts">Case 2: Default Contracts</h2>

<p>In this system, a customer pays us a recurring rent based upon a contract.
Contracts last for a fixed amount of time, and when they expire we fall back to
a ‘default contract’. The customer can have many fixed contracts, and can
sign new contracts at any time.</p>

<p>This was represented as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A ‘customers’ table storing
    <ul>
      <li>The customer start date.</li>
      <li>An optional end date, should the customer leave.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A ‘contracts’ table storing
    <ul>
      <li>The contract start date.</li>
      <li>An optional end date, for default contracts that don’t end.</li>
      <li>If it was a ‘fixed’ or ‘default’ contract.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/f1.png"></p>
<p>Customer and contract timelines</p>

<p>This representation allows for some undesirable states that are trivial to prevent:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The customer may have gaps in their contracts.</li>
  <li>A fixed contract may not have an end date.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/f2.png"></p>
<p>Contract gaps</p>

<p>To make matters worse, the API for these contracts allowed you to
modify each individual contract, fixed or default, without guarding against
these states. This shows how a poor choice of
representation propagates itself through the design of a system.</p>

<p>This poor choice was not just a theoretical problem -
gaps in contracts were found on more than one occasion, requiring
hours of engineering effort to hunt down and fix.</p>

<h3 id="improved-representation-1">Improved Representation</h3>

<p>This is easily improved by removing the ‘default’ contracts from the
contract table. If the customer doesn’t have a fixed contract, it is
assumed they are on a default contract:</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/f3.png"></p>
<p>Inferred default contracts</p>

<p>Now there can no longer be any gaps, and 
the end date of a contract no longer needs to be optional as it only represents fixed contracts.</p>

<p>It’s worth reiterating that this representation can be projected in to the previous
representation using a database view if that form is more convenient. What is
important is that the underlying representation enforces these constraints, it
is not important how you view the data.</p>

<p>As with the first case, a better representation makes the manipulation
of the data structure simpler. In this case, adding a new fixed contract is
greatly simplified. There is no need to create or modify default contracts, or ensure
that the contracts are contiguous.</p>

<h3 id="the-influence-of-object-oriented-thinking">The Influence of Object-Oriented Thinking</h3>

<p>If this improvement seems obvious to you, you may wonder how the
original design happened in the first place.</p>

<p>I think this happens because of atomistic, object-oriented thinking.</p>

<p>In this mindset, the fixed contracts are <em>objects</em>, the default contracts are
<em>objects</em>, and each of these concepts must be reified as a row in a table and
never inferred.
There is a distrust of using any features the database
offers beyond storing or retrieving <em>objects</em>.</p>

<p>This approach is antithetical to quality relational design and
the principle of making invalid states unrepresentable.</p>

<p>It may feel “simpler” on some level, as you don’t really need
to think about your design.
However, as we see here, this lack of forethought inevitably
leads to complexity.</p>

<p>Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon…</p>



<p>Combined, the “Big 4” tech giants are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-valuable-tech-companies-total-worth-trillions-alphabet-stock-record-2020-1">worth over $5 trillion dollars.</a></p>



<p>Humans have a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/grasping-giant-numbers-is-far-from-second-nature-1490952621">problem grasping giant numbers</a>, so to put that figure in perspective, it’s equal to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/insights/worlds-top-economies/">2019 GDP of Japan</a> — and almost a quarter that of the United States.</p>



<p>Despite being <a target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/the-worlds-most-valuable-brands/#dd07f06119c0">the world’s second-most valuable company,</a> Google’s had a tough month.</p>



<p>The fact that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/24/technology/google-service-outage.html?">a brief service outage in the US</a> made <a target="_blank" href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/1530213/google-gmail-youtube-hangout-crashed-down/">front-page news worldwide</a> goes to show how dependent people have become on Google and its products…</p>



<p>But far more distressing to the C-Suite must be the news that US Attorney General William Barr is hellbent on bringing an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/technology/justice-dept-case-google-search-dominance.html">antitrust lawsuit against Google</a> before the election in November — and maybe as early as the beginning of October.</p>



<p>Barr’s Justice Department has set its sights square on Google’s dominance in search.</p>



<p>At the risk of biting the hand that feeds us, I’m going to take a look at what brought Google to this point — and some possible outcomes of the threats to Google’s monopoly on both search and digital advertising.</p>



<h2><strong>Antitrust and Technology</strong></h2>



<p>In the US, antitrust laws <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/antitrust.asp">date back to the Sherman Act,</a> passed in the 1890s.</p>



<p>Antitrust regulations are designed to protect consumers from the adverse impact of one or less than a handful of companies having a monopoly on an essential product or service.</p>



<p>Monopolies represent a barrier to competition — and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/games/off-site/youarehere/pages/pdf/FTC-Competition_How-Comp-Works.pdf">competition is essential</a> in a free-market economy.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="945" height="630" src="https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Monopoly-Graphic.png" alt="" srcset="https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Monopoly-Graphic.png 945w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Monopoly-Graphic-300x200.png 300w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Monopoly-Graphic-768x512.png 768w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Monopoly-Graphic-600x400.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 945px) 100vw, 945px" data-srcset="https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Monopoly-Graphic.png 945w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Monopoly-Graphic-300x200.png 300w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Monopoly-Graphic-768x512.png 768w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Monopoly-Graphic-600x400.png 600w" data-src="https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Monopoly-Graphic.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption><em>(Source: </em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.thebalance.com/monopoly-4-reasons-it-s-bad-and-its-history-3305945"><em>The Balance</em></a><em>)</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Some of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thebalance.com/monopoly-4-reasons-it-s-bad-and-its-history-3305945">commonly cited adverse effects</a> of a monopoly include price-fixing, inferior products and services, and the stifling of innovation.</p>



<p>The first antitrust lawsuits were brought against <a target="_blank" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/274/693">International Harvester</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._American_Tobacco_Co.">American Tobacco…</a></p>



<p>Apparently, both farm machinery and cigarettes were both viewed as essential at the turn of the twentieth century.</p>



<p>Antitrust laws are often used to prevent mergers between large companies that might harm consumers.</p>



<p>When oil giants Exxon and Mobil merged in the late 1990s, they were forced to sell 2,431 gas stations before the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dividend.com/how-to-invest/5-major-antitrust-mergers/">$80.3 billion deal</a> was allowed to proceed.</p>



<p>Despite this divestiture, Exxon-Mobil was the world’s most valuable company until <a target="_blank" href="https://money.cnn.com/2012/01/25/markets/apple_stock/index.htm">Apple surpassed it in 2012.</a></p>



<p>Digital technology companies have had their fair share of skirmishes over monopoly and antitrust issues with the government, both in the US and around the world.</p>



<p>IBM faced <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#Twentieth-century_market_power_and_antitrust">over 20 government and private antitrust actions</a> in the 20th century.</p>



<p>On the cusp of the 2000s, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/microsoft-antitrust.asp">Microsoft was sued by the Department of Justice (DoJ)</a> and others to “determine whether the company’s bundling of additional programs into its operating system constituted monopolistic actions.”</p>



<p>These actions were partly a result of the <a target="_blank" href="https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/browser-wars/">“Browser Wars”</a> between Microsoft’s Internet Explorer and their now long-defunct competitor, Netscape.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Microsoft was accused of intentionally making it difficult for consumers to install software from competitors on Windows machines — and delete Microsoft’s bundled programs.</p>



<p>Microsoft <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theringer.com/tech/2018/5/18/17362452/microsoft-antitrust-lawsuit-netscape-internet-explorer-20-years">lost the case,</a> and the judge called for the company to split into two separate entities called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/babybills.asp">Baby Bills</a>, a reference to the “Baby Bells” created when the government broke up AT&amp;T in the 1980s.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Windows OS side of Microsoft’s business was to become a separate corporate entity from the software side.</p>



<p>Ultimately, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/long-antitrust-saga-ends-for-microsoft/">Microsoft settled with the US government</a>, and escaped being split up but it was forced to make <a target="_blank" href="https://www.justice.gov/atr/usdoj-antitrust-division-us-v-microsoft-corporation-information-settlement">significant concessions</a> that limited its anticompetitive tactics.</p>



<p>Many observers speculate that the antitrust lawsuits against Microsoft led to Bill Gates stepping down as CEO.</p>



<p>The lawsuits and settlement also fostered a more competitive environment that allowed fledgling startups like Google, Facebook, and Amazon to survive and thrive.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Threats to Google’s Monopoly on Search and Digital Advertising</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>Antitrust in the US</strong></h3>



<p>Federal government concerns about Google’s dominance in both search and online advertising really began to pick up steam in summer 2019 when the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/technology/justice-dept-case-google-search-dominance.html?searchResultPosition=1">opened antitrust investigations</a> into all of the “Big Four” tech giants.</p>



<p>Additionally, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20857440/google-antitrust-investigation-attorneys-general-advertising-search">Google finds itself targeted for investigation by 50 state attorneys general</a> for its anticompetitive practices, particularly its dominant share of the digital advertising market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only California and Arizona declined to join the probe.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Top-5-Companies-Search.png" alt="" width="720" height="537" srcset="https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Top-5-Companies-Search.png 560w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Top-5-Companies-Search-300x224.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-srcset="https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Top-5-Companies-Search.png 560w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Top-5-Companies-Search-300x224.png 300w" data-src="https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Top-5-Companies-Search.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption>(<em>Source: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.geekwire.com/2019/amazon-gaining-google-search-advertising-market-share/">Geekwire</a></em>)</figcaption></figure>



<p>In 2019, Google accounted for a 31.6% market share of overall digital ad spending and a 73.1% share of search advertising.</p>



<p>Google’s dominance in search is even more staggering…</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1000" height="743" src="https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/statistic_id216573_global-market-share-of-search-engines-2010-2020.png" alt="" srcset="https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/statistic_id216573_global-market-share-of-search-engines-2010-2020.png 1000w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/statistic_id216573_global-market-share-of-search-engines-2010-2020-300x223.png 300w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/statistic_id216573_global-market-share-of-search-engines-2010-2020-768x571.png 768w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/statistic_id216573_global-market-share-of-search-engines-2010-2020-600x446.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-srcset="https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/statistic_id216573_global-market-share-of-search-engines-2010-2020.png 1000w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/statistic_id216573_global-market-share-of-search-engines-2010-2020-300x223.png 300w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/statistic_id216573_global-market-share-of-search-engines-2010-2020-768x571.png 768w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/statistic_id216573_global-market-share-of-search-engines-2010-2020-600x446.png 600w" data-src="https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/statistic_id216573_global-market-share-of-search-engines-2010-2020.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption><strong>Global Market Share of Search Engines</strong><em> (Source: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/">Statista</a>)</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As of July 2020, Google held an 87% market share in desktop search — its nearest competitor, Bing, accounted for just over 6%.</p>



<p>This disparity has led critics of both major political parties, as well as President Donald Trump, to argue that Google needs to be more strictly regulated — or even split up into smaller entities.</p>



<p>There is precedent for breaking up monopolies in the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 1904, John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil controlled <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/15/doj-and-state-ags-likely-to-file-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google-wsj.html">91% of oil production and 85% of oil sales in the US.</a></p>



<p>The Supreme Court ruled in 1911 that Standard Oil was in violation of federal antitrust laws and split the company up into 34 separate entities, including companies that became <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Rockefeller">ExxonMobil and Chevron.</a></p>



<p>In more recent history, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/att-breakup-spinoff.asp">antitrust lawsuits filed in the early 1970s against AT&amp;T</a> — which operated a legal monopoly on local and long-distance telecommunications for almost a century — broke the company up into seven smaller entities known as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/babybells.asp">“Baby Bells.”</a></p>



<p>In addition to the DoJ and State’s attorney investigations into Google, all of the Big 4’s CEOs were recently summoned to appear remotely before Congress’s <a target="_blank" href="https://judiciary.house.gov/subcommittees/antitrust-commercial-and-administrative-law-116th-congress/">House Judiciary subcommittee on Antitrust.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The subcommittee held the hearing after investigating the Big 4 for over a year.</p>



<p>In the current American political environment, where it often seems like Republicans and Democrats agree on practically nothing, the hearing was surprisingly bipartisan.</p>

<p>Here are the elements of Google’s vast empire that are thought to be most vulnerable to punitive antitrust actions.</p>

<h4>Advertising&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Not only does Google command a lopsided market share in both search advertising and digital advertising as a whole, but it also faces investigation because Google effectively owns and controls every aspect of the online marketplace for selling and purchasing advertising.</p>



<p>Google has achieved its advertising hegemony primarily through acquiring competitors, such as it’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.com/2008/03/google-seals-do/">2008 buyout of ad-tech firm DoubleClick.</a></p>



<p>Over <a target="_blank" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/266249/advertising-revenue-of-google/">70% of Google’s revenue comes from advertising</a> — over $160 billion in 2019.</p>



<p>Any threat to this income stream could have devastating effects on the value of the company.</p>



<p>Investigators and competitors charge that allowing Google to have such complete control over digital advertising is harmful to competition and gives Google an unfair advantage.</p>



<h4>Content</h4>



<p>Content creators and publishers big and small were likely thrilled when Rep. David Cicilline, chairman of the antitrust subcommittee <a target="_blank" href="https://news.yahoo.com/why-does-google-steal-content-201052393.html">straight up asked Pichai,</a> “Why does Google steal content?”</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, Pichai disagreed with the characterization, but Cicilline rejected his response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Congress, he said, has “heard throughout this investigation that Google has stolen content to build your own business. These are consistent reports, and so your testimony that it doesn’t happen is really inconsistent with what we’ve learned during the course of the investigation.”</p>



<p>As Google continually finds new ways to answer search queries using third party content on its own platform, often without attribution or a link to the source, it seems likely that this strategy will come under growing scrutiny.</p>

<h4>Search</h4>



<p>Google’s near-total dominance of search has led to numerous allegations of anticompetition practices — including favoring its own products above competitors in search results.</p>



<p>Founder’s tales of businesses being decimated by Google’s search manipulation and favoritism towards its own offerings abound online — such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/02/14/googles-anti-competitive-practices-decimates-online-shopping-antitrust-column/4718626002/">this one</a> from the founder of comparison shopping site Kelkoo or this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-google-search-favoritism-20150630-story.html">Harvard and Columbia study funded by Yelp.</a></p>



<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/technology/justice-dept-case-google-search-dominance.html?">According to The New York Times</a>, the DoJ has narrowed its focus to search and may leave action on Google’s advertising practices to the state attorneys, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-doj-idUSKBN22R37I">led by Texas Attorney General, Ken Paxton.</a></p>



<p>Paxton says he has not ruled out any possible punishment, including breaking up the company.</p>



<p>By narrowing the focus to search, the DOJ hopes to have a stronger lawsuit that it can file in a more timely fashion.</p>



<p>The federal case is expected to largely drill down on Google’s agreements with Apple and other companies to have Google set as the default search engine on iPhones and other devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DoJ will likely argue this an anti-competitive practice that puts other search engines at a significant disadvantage.</p>

<h4>Android</h4>



<p>One other possible vulnerability regulators might exploit is the ubiquity of Google’s Android mobile operating system.</p>



<p>Android is by far the most popular mobile OS globally, with a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272698/global-market-share-held-by-mobile-operating-systems-since-2009/">74.6% market share.</a></p>



<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tech-antitrust-google-idUSKBN1XO2UQ">Reports say that the state attorneys</a> are also investigating Android for antitrust violations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The EU has already fined Google €4.34 billion for using Android “as a vehicle to cement the dominance of its search engine.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>What is open source</h3><p>Open-source software means that the source code of a software is publicly available. Everyone can read, copy or change the source code which makes the software more trustworthy and long-living than closed source software. Famous and big examples of open-source software projects are the <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linux kernel</a>, <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firefox</a>, <a href="https://git.libreoffice.org/core" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LibreOffice</a> or <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/?format=HTML" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a> but there are also many many small open-source software projects out there.</p><h3>Benefits</h3><p>If you can read code, you are actually able to understand and evaluate what is happening when you execute that software. Not only what the software pretends to do but rather what it really does.</p><p>This feature also allows everyone to scan the source code for security vulnerabilities or other weaknesses of any kind, which adds to the trustworthiness mentioned above.</p><p>Another main advantage is that you are able to request help from basically every user/contributor of that software which is mostly faster and provides more creative solutions than most commercial support.</p><p>Also, the software is not only dependent on the original author and can be maintained and extended by the community. There can be even different versions of the same software with different features. If the community thinks it would not be a good idea to add a specific feature, someone can copy the source code and release their own version of it.</p><p>You can learn a lot, and I mean really a lot! </p><p>Reading and understanding the source code of other programs may not be easy, especially if the software is relative complex, but you will learn a lot in the progress as you are confronted with ideas and solutions from many other people which spend sometimes hours, days or even longer with a specific problem and came up with a solution.</p><p>If you are also willing to contribute and not only to use the software you gain another few advantages.</p><p>You will be forced to think way more about your problem than with closed source. As the software will be used by many other people, it is not only your specific use case which is relevant. This forces you to gain a deeper understanding of the concrete problem and you are also forced to think of reasonable abstractions and edge cases as well as configurability.</p><p>Another important step, which is often not really recognized is that it is not only important to fix the problem or build that feature, it is also very important to write readable and maintainable code, otherwise no one will be able to touch it and as the software evolves it may be removed eventually because no one understands.</p><p>As everyone knows, good documentation is key, you actually need to write documentation, otherwise, no one will be able to use your cool new feature</p><p>and the community of that project will not be happy and may not even merge your cool new feature. This all may sound difficult, but I think you will learn key skills which are important or beneficial for your whole career as a software engineer.</p><p>It is especially beneficial for job applications because others can really see what you are doing rather than just talking about it or even worse, test your skills on a whiteboard.</p><p>Another major advantage is the joy you feel when others actually use the software you have written, especially if it will be used in ways you don't even consider.</p><h3>Disadvantages</h3><p>What may be viewed as a disadvantage is the monetization of your product. As this is true at the first glance, there are also ways of making money with open-source software.</p><p>If your software is a service you could provide a hosted solution where users would have to pay money to use it, but if they really want and have the resources they could also host it themselves.</p><p>On the other hand, you are an expert in using, customizing and developing the software, so if others need support they could hire you to help them.</p><p>Some individuals or companies are also sponsoring open source software maintainer through <a href="https://github.com/sponsors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Sponsors</a> or <a href="https://www.patreon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patreon</a> for example.</p><p>If your software grows and more and more people are contributing to it you will have no other choice than to set up some processes, like: "When is someone allowed to merge a PR?", "Who decides if something will be added or not?", "Who has the last word in case a conflict arises?", "What documentation is mandatory?", "Do we raise money?"(In case of a non-profit open-source project), "What kind of merchandising are producing?" and there are many many more, that are all questions that came to my mind in less than 5 minutes. To set up such rules and processes will feel cumbersome at the beginning, but you will not be able to grow your project without. There is no silver bullet, you will need to think of processes and rules on your own, what is applicable to your project, but sure you can grab inspiration from other open-source software projects.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>Open-source software is very popular because of the trust this gives its users. Contributing to it also has a bunch of advantages for the contributing</p><p>individuals although it is way harder than working on individual and closed source software as you need to pay attention to more and greater details and you can even earn some money with it. </p></div></div>]]>

      <h2>What you could steal from the Kakoune code editor right now, and get away with it</h2>

<p><a href="https://kakoune.org/">Kakoune</a> is a (fairly) young modal code editor
that has matured for as long and as well as a good red wine. It places
multiple-selections, operability and interactivity at the heart of its
distinctive characteristics. It provides users with an efficient and
comfortable text editing experience — but that’s not what this article
is about.</p>

<p>Now 8 years old at the time of writing, Kakoune has gone through several
iterations that removed a dependency here, optimised a core feature there,
even factorised entire parts of its codebase! And as any long-term user
will tell you, it’s easy to take all that good stuff for granted.</p>

<p>So here it is. I’m stopping time for a couple minutes, and listing in
this article a few things that the Kakoune project does well in several
dimensions. Some are technical, but the rest should hopefully be easily
adaptable to other projects (whether they are code editors or not), and
generic enough to be adopted seamlessly.</p>

<p>Now why does the title of this piece mention stealing? Read on, that’s item
number one.</p>

<h2 id="from-its-licensing-model">From its licensing model</h2>

<p>If something doesn’t belong to anybody, is it stealing if you take it for
yourself? What if it belongs equally to everybody?</p>

<p>Fortunately we don’t need to solve that problem: Kakoune is a public domain
project. Which means that anyone is free to do anything they want with the
source code of the editor, no questions asked.</p>

<p>This has several advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the tool can be shipped with any distribution or suite, regardless of
licensing</li>
  <li>users can modify the code (to fix bugs, add new features or tweak already
existing ones etc.) and publish it (or compiled binaries) without worrying
about attribution</li>
  <li>it lifts some weight of responsibility of the maintainer for the whole
project, which anyone can re-brand or heavily modify to their liking</li>
</ul>

<p>Users don’t like paying for tools, and when they are free and open-source,
I’d argue that they turn out to be more useful (with several iterations,
over time) in the end if they place no limits on what users are allowed to
do with the code.</p>

<p>I’m not in favour of abolishing licenses, I think it would be more
productive for everyone if specialised tools were in the public
domain. In fact, the Kakoune project <em>is</em> licensed, under the
<a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/unlicense/">terms</a> of the
<a href="https://unlicense.org/">UNLICENSE</a>, in order to avoid conflicts with
jurisdictions that don’t recognise the <em>public domain</em> model.</p>

<p>As for the small riddle above, that’s a tough one, bordering on the
philosophical, but since we’re talking about replicating data, we can easily
break out of that paradox: copying is not stealing.</p>

<h2 id="from-its-code">From its code</h2>

<p>New comers like to praise Kakoune for having a clean codebase, easy to
navigate and modify. And for good reason! Written in C++, the code uses the
smallest amount of bells and whistles possible to keep the code elegant,
compilable with (reasonably) old compiler versions, but more importantly
convenient.</p>

<p>And when it comes to convenience, Kakoune has some interesting assets your
project could benefit from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a header-only implementation of a diffing algorithm
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/v2020.09.01/src/diff.hh">diff.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>a regex engine mostly following the ECMA syntax — this implementation
allowed the project to drop
<a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_74_0/libs/regex/doc/html/index.html">boost::regex</a>
as a dependency
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/v2020.09.01/src/regex.hh">regex.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>a minimal JSON (un)marshaller
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/v2020.09.01/src/json.hh">json.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>a custom hash map implementation
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/v2020.09.01/src/hash_map.hh">hash_map.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>wrappers for string types (e.g. string view) and associated utilities:
join, wrap, split, quote, pad etc.
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/v2020.09.01/src/string.hh">string.hh</a>
· <a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/v2020.09.01/src/string_utils.hh">string_utils.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>various functional range filters: filter, transform, gather, map etc.
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/v2020.09.01/src/ranges.hh">ranges.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>an implementation of Go’s defer statement that runs code once the execution
flow leaves the current scope
(<a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec#Defer_statements">Go specification</a>
· <a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/v2020.09.01/src/utils.hh#L53">utils.hh</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The above snippets are not exactly drop-in, as they are still coupled to
custom types defined for the editor, but should nonetheless be adaptable
without much difficulty to other C++ projects.</p>

<h2 id="from-its-user-interface">From its user interface</h2>

<p>Originally an easter-egg that savvy users found out about by reading the
code that handles the terminal client’s user interface, the Clippy character
has become a mascot that is now enabled out of the box. However, although
it’s undeniable that nostalgia for Microsoft Office’s assistant has fuelled
prolonged interest in Clippy itself, the easter egg’s notoriety has cast a
shadow on the larger feature it’s a prisoner of: the auto-info pop up window.</p>

<p>The auto-info window is a big contributor to the general level of
interactivity the editor provide, as it pops up any time the user hits a
key in normal mode or has typed a function name in the command prompt. Its
purpose is to provide instant feedback to the user, communicate usage
information or possible options that are available to the user. Every time
I’m using a terminal program that lets me type commands but never hints
at what parameters they take, I sorely wished more people would steal that
from Kakoune!</p>

<p>Another command prompt related improvement that the editor proposes is
fuzzy matching: the user doesn’t need to type out letters that make up
the name of the command they need in order, which makes for much faster
completion selection, and increased discoverability.</p>

<p>All command names in Kakoune are WORDS that start with the name of the
functionality group they belong to. The examples below follow:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to figure out what commands interact with the buffer, typing <code>:buff</code>
would return candidates like <code>buffer-next</code>, <code>lint-buffer</code>,
<code>format-buffer</code>…</li>
  <li>to call the <code>lint-buffer</code> command, typing <code>:lb&lt;tab&gt;</code> would insert the
entire command name in the prompt</li>
</ul>

<p>Use Kakoune once, and you’ll wish your browser enabled fuzzy
matching in your history/bookmarks for the rest of your days. But
you might wonder: there are individual tools that handles
fuzzy-matching, like <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim">ctrlp</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/jhawthorn/fzy">fzy</a>, what if the user would rather
use them to handle opening, for example, files? Great question! Read on,
that’s the next dimension I want you to steal from.</p>

<h2 id="from-its-philosophy">From its philosophy</h2>

<p>The UNIX philosophy states that tools should focus on doing one thing,
and do it well. The implications are that tools that implement too many
unrelated features end up providing users with an underwhelming experience
because they only allow so much granularity over their behaviour, and that
their maintainers are spread too thin to improve/fix them.</p>

<p>If we re-frame this into the context of text editing, editors should only
worry about exactly that — text editing. And Kakoune does its job as
a UNIX citizen brilliantly, but it also goes one step further: it allows
other tools to interact with it, via shell scripting.</p>

<p>Remember the case of spawning a third-party fuzzy matching program,
above? Without getting into details, in Kakoune you’d implement that by
spawning a new terminal (or pane/tab), which would run the program, and
its output would be interpreted by the editor. Users are free to run any
program they want, any terminal or multiplexer they prefer.</p>

<p>And the concept isn’t bound to terminal programs either, although they are
probably the type of tools that Kakoune users would intuitively want to
interact with, on account of the editor being one itself. For example, do
you want to edit a file using a graphical interface? Try the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>:edit %sh{zenity --file-selection}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If that doesn’t sound anything special, it means that it makes
sense. Unfortunately, the field of text editors on UNIX systems has over
the years turned into an archipelago, in which every editor aims at being an
island. Job management, shell, terminal emulation,&nbsp;window multiplexing…
Text editors have turned into closed ecosystems (or Integrated Development
Environments) that provide many (sometimes cardboard-looking) features
unrelated to editing, which new comers have to buy into, or be left out in
the cold.</p>

<p>So here’s an idea everybody should not feel guilty about stealing, if
applicable to their projects: don’t re-invent the wheel, we have enough
bad imitations already<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> — instead, work on ways to make your tools
interface with others more easily!</p>

channel: #kakoune @ FreeNode.</p>

      <h2>What you could steal from the Kakoune code editor right now, and get away with it</h2>

<p><a href="https://kakoune.org/">Kakoune</a> is a (fairly) young modal code editor
that has matured for as long and as well as a good red wine. It places
multiple-selections, operability and interactivity at the heart of its
distinctive characteristics. It provides users with an efficient and
comfortable text editing experience — but that’s not what this article
is about.</p>

<p>Now 8 years old at the time of writing, Kakoune has gone through several
iterations that removed a dependency here, optimised a core feature there,
even factorised entire parts of its codebase! And as any long-term user
will tell you, it’s easy to take all that good stuff for granted.</p>

<p>So here it is. I’m stopping time for a couple minutes, and listing in
this article a few things that the Kakoune project does well in several
dimensions. Some are technical, but the rest should hopefully be easily
adaptable to other projects (whether they are code editors or not), and
generic enough to be adopted seamlessly.</p>

<p>Now why does the title of this piece mention stealing? Read on, that’s item
number one.</p>

<h2 id="from-its-licensing-model">From its licensing model</h2>

<p>If something doesn’t belong to anybody, is it stealing if you take it for
yourself? What if it belongs equally to everybody?</p>

<p>Fortunately we don’t need to solve that problem: Kakoune is a public domain
project. Which means that anyone is free to do anything they want with the
source code of the editor, no questions asked.</p>

<p>This has several advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the tool can be shipped with any distribution or suite, regardless of
licensing</li>
  <li>users can modify the code (to fix bugs, add new features or tweak already
existing ones etc.) and publish it (or compiled binaries) without worrying
about attribution</li>
  <li>it lifts some weight of responsibility of the maintainer for the whole
project, which anyone can re-brand or heavily modify to their liking</li>
</ul>

<p>Users don’t like paying for tools, and when they are free and open-source,
I’d argue that they turn out to be more useful (with several iterations,
over time) in the end if they place no limits on what users are allowed to
do with the code.</p>

<p>I’m not in favour of abolishing licenses, I think it would be more
productive for everyone if specialised tools were in the public
domain. In fact, the Kakoune project <em>is</em> licensed, under the
<a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/unlicense/">terms</a> of the
<a href="https://unlicense.org/">UNLICENSE</a>, in order to avoid conflicts with
jurisdictions that don’t recognise the <em>public domain</em> model.</p>

<p>As for the small riddle above, that’s a tough one, bordering on the
philosophical, but since we’re talking about replicating data, we can easily
break out of that paradox: copying is not stealing.</p>

<h2 id="from-its-code">From its code</h2>

<p>New comers like to praise Kakoune for having a clean codebase, easy to
navigate and modify. And for good reason! Written in C++, the code uses the
smallest amount of bells and whistles possible to keep the code elegant,
compilable with (reasonably) old compiler versions, but more importantly
convenient.</p>

<p>And when it comes to convenience, Kakoune has some interesting assets your
project could benefit from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a header-only implementation of a diffing algorithm
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/v2020.09.01/src/diff.hh">diff.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>a regex engine mostly following the ECMA syntax — this implementation
allowed the project to drop
<a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_74_0/libs/regex/doc/html/index.html">boost::regex</a>
as a dependency
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/v2020.09.01/src/regex.hh">regex.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>a minimal JSON (un)marshaller
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/v2020.09.01/src/json.hh">json.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>a custom hash map implementation
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/v2020.09.01/src/hash_map.hh">hash_map.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>wrappers for string types (e.g. string view) and associated utilities:
join, wrap, split, quote, pad etc.
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/v2020.09.01/src/string.hh">string.hh</a>
· <a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/v2020.09.01/src/string_utils.hh">string_utils.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>various functional range filters: filter, transform, gather, map etc.
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/v2020.09.01/src/ranges.hh">ranges.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>an implementation of Go’s defer statement that runs code once the execution
flow leaves the current scope
(<a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec#Defer_statements">Go specification</a>
· <a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/v2020.09.01/src/utils.hh#L53">utils.hh</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The above snippets are not exactly drop-in, as they are still coupled to
custom types defined for the editor, but should nonetheless be adaptable
without much difficulty to other C++ projects.</p>

<h2 id="from-its-user-interface">From its user interface</h2>

<p>Originally an easter-egg that savvy users found out about by reading the
code that handles the terminal client’s user interface, the Clippy character
has become a mascot that is now enabled out of the box. However, although
it’s undeniable that nostalgia for Microsoft Office’s assistant has fuelled
prolonged interest in Clippy itself, the easter egg’s notoriety has cast a
shadow on the larger feature it’s a prisoner of: the auto-info pop up window.</p>

<p>The auto-info window is a big contributor to the general level of
interactivity the editor provide, as it pops up any time the user hits a
key in normal mode or has typed a function name in the command prompt. Its
purpose is to provide instant feedback to the user, communicate usage
information or possible options that are available to the user. Every time
I’m using a terminal program that lets me type commands but never hints
at what parameters they take, I sorely wished more people would steal that
from Kakoune!</p>

<p>Another command prompt related improvement that the editor proposes is
fuzzy matching: the user doesn’t need to type out letters that make up
the name of the command they need in order, which makes for much faster
completion selection, and increased discoverability.</p>

<p>All command names in Kakoune are WORDS that start with the name of the
functionality group they belong to. The examples below follow:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to figure out what commands interact with the buffer, typing <code>:buff</code>
would return candidates like <code>buffer-next</code>, <code>lint-buffer</code>,
<code>format-buffer</code>…</li>
  <li>to call the <code>lint-buffer</code> command, typing <code>:lb&lt;tab&gt;</code> would insert the
entire command name in the prompt</li>
</ul>

<p>Use Kakoune once, and you’ll wish your browser enabled fuzzy
matching in your history/bookmarks for the rest of your days. But
you might wonder: there are individual tools that handles
fuzzy-matching, like <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim">ctrlp</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/jhawthorn/fzy">fzy</a>, what if the user would rather
use them to handle opening, for example, files? Great question! Read on,
that’s the next dimension I want you to steal from.</p>

<h2 id="from-its-philosophy">From its philosophy</h2>

<p>The UNIX philosophy states that tools should focus on doing one thing,
and do it well. The implications are that tools that implement too many
unrelated features end up providing users with an underwhelming experience
because they only allow so much granularity over their behaviour, and that
their maintainers are spread too thin to improve/fix them.</p>

<p>If we re-frame this into the context of text editing, editors should only
worry about exactly that — text editing. And Kakoune does its job as
a UNIX citizen brilliantly, but it also goes one step further: it allows
other tools to interact with it, via shell scripting.</p>

<p>Remember the case of spawning a third-party fuzzy matching program,
above? Without getting into details, in Kakoune you’d implement that by
spawning a new terminal (or pane/tab), which would run the program, and
its output would be interpreted by the editor. Users are free to run any
program they want, any terminal or multiplexer they prefer.</p>

<p>And the concept isn’t bound to terminal programs either, although they are
probably the type of tools that Kakoune users would intuitively want to
interact with, on account of the editor being one itself. For example, do
you want to edit a file using a graphical interface? Try the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>:edit %sh{zenity --file-selection}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If that doesn’t sound anything special, it means that it makes
sense. Unfortunately, the field of text editors on UNIX systems has over
the years turned into an archipelago, in which every editor aims at being an
island. Job management, shell, terminal emulation,&nbsp;window multiplexing…
Text editors have turned into closed ecosystems (or Integrated Development
Environments) that provide many (sometimes cardboard-looking) features
unrelated to editing, which new comers have to buy into, or be left out in
the cold.</p>

<p>So here’s an idea everybody should not feel guilty about stealing, if
applicable to their projects: don’t re-invent the wheel, we have enough
bad imitations already<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> — instead, work on ways to make your tools
interface with others more easily!</p>

channel: #kakoune @ FreeNode.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Recently, I came across a new embedded analytics database, <a href="https://duckdb.org/">DuckDB</a> which I found inspired from two of my favorite ones <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> and <a href="https://clickhouse.tech/">ClickHouse</a>. DuckDB looked very interesting since I find that it filled that gap of not having a strong embedded database for OLAP requirements really well.</p>
<p>In this post, we will load one month of <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page">NYC Taxi Dataset</a> in each of these three databases and run some queries to get an idea about each of them.</p>
<p>Don’t take it as a performance comparison in any way since SQLite &amp; DuckDB are embedded databases (they don’t have any separate server running) while ClickHouse runs a separate server, so obviously that won’t be apples-to-apples comparison.</p>
<h2 id="data-loading">Data Loading</h2>
<p>Each of the three databases support loading data from CSV files, we used the feature to import data</p>
<pre><code>$ sqlite3 sqlite3.db
SQLite version 3.33.0 2020-08-14 13:23:32
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite&gt; .mode csv
sqlite&gt; .import yellow_tripdata_2009-01.csv taxi
</code></pre>
<pre><code>$ duckdb duckdb.db
SQLite version DuckDB d9bceddc7
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
duckdb&gt; CREATE TABLE taxi AS SELECT * FROM read_csv_auto('yellow_tripdata_2009-01.csv');
</code></pre>
<p>For ClickHouse, we need to create the table beforehand with proper schema. In this case, I used all fields as strings since we aren’t thinking about any performance optimization.</p>
<pre><code>$ clickhouse-client
server :) CREATE TABLE default.taxi
(
    `vendor_name` String,
    `Trip_Pickup_DateTime` String,
    `Trip_Dropoff_DateTime` String,
    `Passenger_Count` String,
    `Trip_Distance` String,
    `Start_Lon` String,
    `Start_Lat` String,
    `Rate_Code` String,
    `store_and_forward` String,
    `End_Lon` String,
    `End_Lat` String,
    `Payment_Type` String,
    `Fare_Amt` String,
    `surcharge` String,
    `mta_tax` String,
    `Tip_Amt` String,
    `Tolls_Amt` String,
    `Total_Amt` String
)
ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY vendor_name
SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192

$ cat yellow_tripdata_2009-01.csv | clickhouse-client --query="INSERT INTO taxi FORMAT CSVWithNames";
</code></pre>
<h2 id="data-storage">Data Storage</h2>
<p>Let’s have a look how much disk each of these took to store this csv in their native data format.</p>
<p>The csv file which we imported above is around 2.4G.</p>
<pre><code>$ du -sh yellow_tripdata_2009-01.csv
2.4G	yellow_tripdata_2009-01.csv
</code></pre>
<p>In SQLite format, it took around 2.7G.</p>
<pre><code>$ ls -lh
Permissions Size User    Date Modified Name
.rw-r--r--  2.7G pradeep  4 Oct 12:30  sqlite3.db
</code></pre>
<p>In DuckDB format, it took around 1.9G.</p>
<pre><code>$ ls -lh
Permissions Size User    Date Modified Name
.rw-r--r--  1.9G pradeep  4 Oct 12:20  duckdb.data
.rw-r--r--    12 pradeep  4 Oct 13:03  duckdb.data.wal
</code></pre>
<p>In ClickHouse format, it took around 780M.</p>
<pre><code>$ clickhouse-client
server :) SELECT
    concat(database, '.', table) AS table,
    formatReadableSize(sum(bytes)) AS size,
    sum(rows) AS rows,
    sum(bytes) AS bytes_size,
    any(engine) AS engine,
    formatReadableSize(sum(primary_key_bytes_in_memory)) AS primary_keys_size
FROM system.parts
WHERE active
GROUP BY
    database,
    table
ORDER BY bytes_size DESC

┌─table────────────────┬─size───────┬─────rows─┬─bytes_size─┬─engine────┬─primary_keys_size─┐

</code></pre>
<h2 id="data-query">Data Query</h2>
<h3 id="counting-number-of-rows">Counting number of rows</h3>
<p>Let’s make a simple query to count the number of rows in each of three datastores.</p>
<p>In SQLite, it took around 1 second to complete the query.</p>
<pre><code>sqlite&gt; .timer on
sqlite&gt; SELECT COUNT(*) from taxi;
14092413
Run Time: real 1.053 user 0.291249 sys 0.759388
</code></pre>
<p>In DuckDB, the same query took around around 0.043 second.</p>
<pre><code>duckdb&gt; .timer on
duckdb&gt; SELECT COUNT(*) from taxi;
14092413
Run Time: real 0.043 user 0.042005 sys 0.000352
</code></pre>
<p>Wow, that’s around 20x faster.</p>
<p>In ClickHouse, the same query took around 0.006 second.</p>
<pre><code>$ clickhouse-client
server :) SELECT count(*) FROM taxi;
┌──count()─┐
│ 14092413 │
└──────────┘
1 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.006 sec.
</code></pre>
<h3 id="counting-distinct-rows">Counting distinct rows</h3>
<p>Let’s make a query to count distinct rows for column: vendor_name.</p>
<pre><code>sqlite&gt; SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT vendor_name) FROM taxi;
3

</code></pre>
<pre><code>duckdb&gt; SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT vendor_name) FROM taxi;

</code></pre>
<p>Let’s make a query to count distinct rows for multiple columns.</p>
<pre><code>sqlite&gt; SELECT
   ...&gt;   COUNT(DISTINCT vendor_name),
   ...&gt;   COUNT(DISTINCT Passenger_Count),
   ...&gt;   COUNT(DISTINCT Trip_Distance),

</code></pre>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Based on above data, we are conclude that DuckDB is a very good fit for analytical purposes. Although, it’s still in early phase of development, I am really excited about it. I am looking forward to use it in my projects soon.</p>

<p>This chapter is an attempt to illustrate what are the core principles of Data Oriented Programming as I understand them.
It is highly influenced by my programming experience in Clojure, but I believe that those principles are language agnostic.</p>
<p>One could adhere to them in an Object Oriented (OO) language like Java or C# and one could break them
in a Functional Programming (FP) language like Ocaml, Haskell, JavaScript (or even in Clojure).</p>
<p>In fact, in this chapter, I am going to illustrate how those principles could be applied or broken
in JavaScript, a programming language that supports both FP and OOP.</p>
<p>The principles of Data Oriented (DO) Programming are:</p>

<p>Each principle is explored in a separate article.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p><span color="#663300">ENCYCLICAL LETTER<i><br> <b><span size="4">FRATELLI TUTTI<br> </span></b></i>OF THE HOLY FATHER<br> <b>FRANCIS<br> </b>ON FRATERNITY AND SOCIAL FRIENDSHIP</span></p> 
 
<p>1. <i><a name="“FRATELLI_TUTTI”">“FRATELLI TUTTI”</a>.</i><a name="_ftnref1" title="" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> With these words, Saint Francis of Assisi addressed his brothers and sisters and proposed to them a way of life marked by the flavour of the Gospel. Of the counsels Francis offered, I would like to select the one in which he calls for a love that transcends the barriers of geography and distance, and declares blessed all those who love their brother “as much when he is far away from him as when he is with him”.<a name="_ftnref2" title="" href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> In his simple and direct way, Saint Francis expressed the essence of a fraternal openness that allows us to acknowledge, appreciate and love each person, regardless of physical proximity, regardless of where he or she was born or lives.</p> 
<p>2. This saint of fraternal love, simplicity and joy, who inspired me to write the Encyclical <i> <a href="http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html">Laudato Si’</a></i>, prompts me once more to devote this new Encyclical to fraternity and social friendship. Francis felt himself a brother to the sun, the sea and the wind, yet he knew that he was even closer to those of his own flesh. Wherever he went, he sowed seeds of peace and walked alongside the poor, the abandoned, the infirm and the outcast, the least of his brothers and sisters.</p> 
<p><a name="WITHOUT_BORDERS">WITHOUT BORDERS</a></p> 
<p>3. There is an episode in the life of Saint Francis that shows his openness of heart, which knew no bounds and transcended differences of origin, nationality, colour or religion. It was his visit to Sultan Malik-el-Kamil, in Egypt, which entailed considerable hardship, given Francis’ poverty, his scarce resources, the great distances to be traveled and their differences of language, culture and religion. That journey, undertaken at the time of the Crusades, further demonstrated the breadth and grandeur of his love, which sought to embrace everyone. Francis’ fidelity to his Lord was commensurate with his love for his brothers and sisters. Unconcerned for the hardships and dangers involved, Francis went to meet the Sultan with the same attitude that he instilled in his disciples: if they found themselves “among the Saracens and other nonbelievers”, without renouncing their own identity they were not to “engage in arguments or disputes, but to be subject to every human creature for God’s sake”.<a name="_ftnref3" title="" href="#_ftn3">[3]</a> In the context of the times, this was an extraordinary recommendation. We are impressed that some eight hundred years ago Saint Francis urged that all forms of hostility or conflict be avoided and that a humble and fraternal “subjection” be shown to those who did not share his faith.</p> 
<p>4. Francis did not wage a war of words aimed at imposing doctrines; he simply spread the love of God. He understood that “God is love and those who abide in love abide in God” (<i>1 Jn </i>4:16). In this way, he became a father to all and inspired the vision of a fraternal society. Indeed, “only the man who approaches others, not to draw them into his own life, but to help them become ever more fully themselves, can truly be called a father”.<a name="_ftnref4" title="" href="#_ftn4">[4]</a> In the world of that time, bristling with watchtowers and defensive walls, cities were a theatre of brutal wars between powerful families, even as poverty was spreading through the countryside. Yet there Francis was able to welcome true peace into his heart and free himself of the desire to wield power over others. He became one of the poor and sought to live in harmony with all. Francis has inspired these pages.</p> 
<p>5. Issues of human fraternity and social friendship have always been a concern of mine. In recent years, I have spoken of them repeatedly and in different settings. In this Encyclical, I have sought to bring together many of those statements and to situate them in a broader context of reflection. In the preparation of <i> <a href="http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html">Laudato Si’</a></i>, I had a source of inspiration in my brother Bartholomew, the Orthodox Patriarch, who has spoken forcefully of our need to care for creation. In this case, I have felt particularly encouraged by the Grand Imam Ahmad Al-Tayyeb, with whom I met in Abu Dhabi, where we declared that “God has created all human beings equal in rights, duties and dignity, and has called them to live together as brothers and sisters”.<a name="_ftnref5" title="" href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> This was no mere diplomatic gesture, but a reflection born of dialogue and common commitment. The present Encyclical takes up and develops some of the great themes raised in the Document that we both signed. I have also incorporated, along with my own thoughts, a number of letters, documents and considerations that I have received from many individuals and groups throughout the world.</p> 
<p>6. The following pages do not claim to offer a complete teaching on fraternal love, but rather to consider its universal scope, its openness to every man and woman. I offer this social Encyclical as a modest contribution to continued reflection, in the hope that in the face of present-day attempts to eliminate or ignore others, we may prove capable of responding with a new vision of fraternity and social friendship that will not remain at the level of words. Although I have written it from the Christian convictions that inspire and sustain me, I have sought to make this reflection an invitation to dialogue among all people of good will.</p> 
<p><a name="7">7</a>. As I was writing this letter, the Covid-19 pandemic unexpectedly erupted, exposing our false securities. Aside from the different ways that various countries responded to the crisis, their inability to work together became quite evident. For all our hyper-connectivity, we witnessed a fragmentation that made it more difficult to resolve problems that affect us all. Anyone who thinks that the only lesson to be learned was the need to improve what we were already doing, or to refine existing systems and regulations, is denying reality.</p> 
<p>8. It is my desire that, in this our time, by acknowledging the dignity of each human person, we can contribute to the rebirth of a universal aspiration to fraternity. Fraternity between all men and women. “Here we have a splendid secret that shows us how to dream and to turn our life into a wonderful adventure. No one can face life in isolation… We need a community that supports and helps us, in which we can help one another to keep looking ahead. How important it is to dream together… By ourselves, we risk seeing mirages, things that are not there. Dreams, on the other hand, are built together”.<a name="_ftnref6" title="" href="#_ftn6">[6]</a> Let us dream, then, as a single human family, as fellow travelers sharing the same flesh, as children of the same earth which is our common home, each of us bringing the richness of his or her beliefs and convictions, each of us with his or her own voice, brothers and sisters all.</p>

<p><a name="DARK_CLOUDS_OVER_A_CLOSED_WORLD">DARK CLOUDS OVER A CLOSED WORLD</a></p> 
<p>9. Without claiming to carry out an exhaustive analysis or to study every aspect of our present-day experience, I intend simply to consider certain trends in our world that hinder the development of universal fraternity.</p> 
<p><a name="SHATTERED_DREAMS">SHATTERED DREAMS</a> </p> 
<p>10. For decades, it seemed that the world had learned a lesson from its many wars and disasters, and was slowly moving towards various forms of integration. For example, there was the dream of a united Europe, capable of acknowledging its shared roots and rejoicing in its rich diversity. We think of “the firm conviction of the founders of the European Union, who envisioned a future based on the capacity to work together in bridging divisions and in fostering peace and fellowship between all the peoples of this continent”.<a name="_ftnref7" title="" href="#_ftn7">[7]</a> There was also a growing desire for integration in Latin America, and several steps were taken in this direction. In some countries and regions, attempts at reconciliation and rapprochement proved fruitful, while others showed great promise.</p> 
<p>11. Our own days, however, seem to be showing signs of a certain regression. Ancient conflicts thought long buried are breaking out anew, while instances of a myopic, extremist, resentful and aggressive nationalism are on the rise. In some countries, a concept of popular and national unity influenced by various ideologies is creating new forms of selfishness and a loss of the social sense under the guise of defending national interests. Once more we are being reminded that “each new generation must take up the struggles and attainments of past generations, while setting its sights even higher. This is the path. Goodness, together with love, justice and solidarity, are not achieved once and for all; they have to be realized each day. It is not possible to settle for what was achieved in the past and complacently enjoy it, as if we could somehow disregard the fact that many of our brothers and sisters still endure situations that cry out for our attention”.<a name="_ftnref8" title="" href="#_ftn8">[8]</a></p> 
<p>12. “Opening up to the world” is an expression that has been co-opted by the economic and financial sector and is now used exclusively of openness to foreign interests or to the freedom of economic powers to invest without obstacles or complications in all countries. Local conflicts and disregard for the common good are exploited by the global economy in order to impose a single cultural model. This culture unifies the world, but divides persons and nations, for “as society becomes ever more globalized, it makes us neighbours, but does not make us brothers”.<a name="_ftnref9" title="" href="#_ftn9">[9]</a> We are more alone than ever in an increasingly massified world that promotes individual interests and weakens the communitarian dimension of life. Indeed, there are markets where individuals become mere consumers or bystanders. As a rule, the advance of this kind of globalism strengthens the identity of the more powerful, who can protect themselves, but it tends to diminish the identity of the weaker and poorer regions, making them more vulnerable and dependent. In this way, political life becomes increasingly fragile in the face of transnational economic powers that operate with the principle of “divide and conquer”. </p>

  <p>A basic property of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature">digital signature scheme</a> is that it should specify which signatures are valid and which signatures are invalid, so that all implementations can accept only valid signatures and reject only invalid signatures. <em>Unfortunately, Ed25519 signatures don’t provide this property, making their use in distributed systems fragile and risky.</em></p>
<p>Although the scheme was standardized in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032">RFC8032</a>, the RFC does not specify validation criteria, and does not require conformant implementations to agree on whether a particular signature is valid. In addition, because the specification changed validation criteria years after deployment, it is incompatible with almost all existing implementations. Worse still, some implementations added extra ad-hoc criteria, making them further incompatible.</p>
<p>The result is an extremely wide variation in validation criteria across implemententations. The diagram below plots verification results of a \(14 \times 14\) grid of edge cases, with light squares representing accepted signatures, and dark squares representing rejected ones. As the diagram illustrates, verification results are generally inconsistent not just between implementations, but also between different versions and different modes. <img src="https://hdevalence.ca/images/ed25519-comparison.png"></p>
<p>Some protocols may tolerate this variation, but it is unacceptable for any protocol that requires participants to reach consensus on signature validity. A malicious participant can submit signatures that are accepted by some implementations but rejected by others, causing a network partitition or a consensus fork. Having only a single implementation makes this problem less obvious, but it doesn’t go away, since behavior can vary across versions of the ‘same’ implementation. This occurred in practice with the widely used <code>libsodium</code> library, which made breaking changes to validation criteria in a point release.</p>
<p>Finally, although all of these problems occur when verifying signatures individually, they also prevent the use of batch verification, which can provide a significant performance benefit.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="the-scope-of-potential-divergence">The scope of potential divergence</h2>
<h3 id="the-ed25519-signing-process">The Ed25519 signing process</h3>
<p>Before explaining the validation criteria, it’s useful to briefly review the signing process. An honest signer generates their signing key, a random scalar \(a\), through a complicated procedure not relevant here. Then, they multiply their signing key by the Curve25519 basepoint \(B\) to obtain their verification key, a curve point \(A = [a]B\). The <em>signing</em> and <em>verification</em> keys are more commonly referred to as the <em>private</em> and <em>public</em> keys, but (following Daira Hopwood), I prefer to use the capability-based terminology, since it more precisely captures the role of the key material.</p>
<p>To sign a message <code>M</code>, a signer first generates a secret random nonce \(r\), through a procedure that is also not relevant here, and then form a public commitment to this randomness by computing \(R = [r]B\). Next, they use a hash function \(H\) to compute a challenge scalar as \( k \gets H(R, A, M) \). Finally, they compute a response scalar as \( s \gets r + ka \).</p>
<h3 id="divergence-in-ed25519-signature-validation-criteria">Divergence in Ed25519 signature validation criteria</h3>
<p>To understand the scope of potential divergence in validation criteria, let’s walk through the steps to verify a signature <code>sig</code> with verification key \(A\) on the message <code>M</code>, noting each step with a possibly divergent behavior choice. Then, in subsequent sections, we’ll look at the scope and implications of each divergence.</p>
<p>Ed25519 signatures are 64 bytes long, structured as two 32-byte components: <code>sig = R_bytes || s_bytes</code>. The first 32 bytes store an encoding of \(R\), and the second 32 bytes store an encoding of \(s\). Ed25519 verification keys are 32 bytes long, storing an encoding of \(A\).</p>
<p>Next, the verifier parses <code>s_bytes</code> as \(s\). It’s always possible to interpret a byte string as a little-endian encoded integer, so parsing \(s\) can’t fail. However, \(s\) is supposed to represent an integer \(\mod q\), where \(q\) is the order of the prime-order subgroup of Curve25519. Honestly-generated signatures will have \(0 \leq s &lt; q\), and implementations can choose to reject \(s \ge q\). Call this check <em>canonical \(s\)</em>.</p>
<p>Next, the verifier attempts to parse <code>A_bytes</code> as \(A\). Not all byte strings are valid point encodings, so parsing \(A\) can fail, causing the signature to be rejected. Points can be encoded non-canonically, although in contrast to the encoding of \(s\), the mechanism is somewhat more complicated and subtle, as will be described <a href="#canonical-a-r">below</a>. Implementations can choose to reject non-canonically encoded curve points. Call this check <em>canonical \(A\)</em>.</p>
<p>The verifier then uses <code>A_bytes</code>, <code>R_bytes</code>, and the message <code>M</code> to recompute the challenge value \(k \gets H(R, A, M)\). (Note that since \(H\) is a hash function, it actually operates on the encodings <code>A_bytes</code> and <code>R_bytes</code>, not their decoded internal representations).</p>
<p>Implementations then make a <em>choice of verification equation</em>, choosing which of two verification equations to check. They can use either the <em>batched equation</em> \[ [8]R = [8]([s]B - [k]A), \] or the <em>unbatched equation</em> \[ R = [s]B - [k]A. \] The naming of <em>batched equation</em> versus <em>unbatched equation</em> suggests that the difference is related to batched versus individual verification, but in fact these give different behavior even in the case of individual verification, as will be explained <a href="#choice-of-verification-equation">below</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, to actually check whichever equation is used, an implementation must choose an <em>equality check</em>. Recall that we didn’t actually decode <code>R_bytes</code> to \(R\) yet. When using the batched equation, an implementation must operate on \(R\), so it must decode <code>R_bytes</code> to \(R\), and check equality of curve points. This also means it must make a choice of whether to require <em>canonical \(R\)</em>.</p>
<p>When using the unbatched equation, however, an implementation can choose to either check equality of curve points, or to compute \(R’ \gets [s]B - [k]A\), encode \(R’\) to <code>Rprime_bytes</code>, and check equality of byte strings. When \(R\) is canonically encoded, these equality checks produce the same result. But because the encoding procedure produces canonical encodings, if <code>R_bytes</code> contains a non-canonical encoding of \(R\), then even if \(R’ = R\) (as curve points), <code>Rprime_bytes</code> may differ from <code>R_bytes</code> (as byte strings).</p>
<h3 id="points-of-potential-divergence">Points of potential divergence</h3>
<p>In summary, there are a number of points of potential divergence between implementations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Whether to require <em>canonical \(s\)</em> or to allow non-canonical encodings.</li>
<li>Whether to require <em>canonical \(A\)</em> or to allow non-canonical encodings.</li>
<li>The <em>choice of verification equation</em>, either <em>batched</em> or <em>unbatched</em>.</li>
<li>The <em>choice of equality check</em>, and the related choice of <em>canonical \(R\)</em>.</li>
<li>Any other <em>ad-hoc checks</em> added by a particular implementation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before comparing the choices made by RFC8032 and actually existing implementations, let’s examine the exact mechanism and implications of each of these points of potential divergence.</p>
<h3 id="canonical-s">Canonical \(s\)</h3>
<p>The values <code>A_bytes</code>, <code>R_bytes</code>, and <code>M</code> are all fed into the hash function, so they cannot be modified without changing the challenge value. However, a third party could replace \(s\) with \(s’ = s + nq\). Because \(s’ \equiv s \pmod q\), the modified signature \((R, s’)\) would still pass verification. Requiring that <code>s_bytes</code> encodes \(s &lt; q\) prevents this.</p>
<p>This check is simple, low-cost, prevents malleability, is required by RFC8032, and is performed by most implementations. The only notable exception is the original reference implementation of Ed25519, which chose to write a paragraph arguing that signature malleability is never a problem instead of performing the check.</p>
<p>Because this check is fairly common, well-known, and unobjectionable, I didn’t focus on it, and didn’t comprehensively test implementation behavior.</p>
<h3 id="canonical-a-r">Canonical \(A\), \(R\)</h3>
<p>While the mechanism for constructing non-canonically encoded scalar values is fairly simple, the mechanism for constructing non-canonically encoded point values is somewhat more complicated, as mentioned <a href="#divergence-in-ed25519-signature-validation-criteria">above</a>. To explain it, we need to describe the “compressed Edwards \(y\)” encoding used by Ed25519.</p>
<p>Curve25519 is defined over the finite field of order \(p = 2^{255} - 19\), so the coördinates of curve points \((x,y)\) are integers \(\mod p\). The curve equation in (twisted) Edwards form is \[ - x^2 + y^2 = 1 + d x^2 y^2, \] where \(d\) is a curve parameter. This means that \[ x^2 = \frac { y^2 - 1} {d y^2 + 1}. \] If the fraction on the right-hand side is nonsquare, then there is no \(x\) so that the right-hand side equals \(x^2\), and the \(y\) value is not the \(y\)-coördinate of a curve point. If it is square, then there is a square root \(x\), and the value of \(y\) is sufficient to recover \(x\) up to a choice of sign.</p>
<p>Because \(p &lt; 2^{255}\), the encodings of field elements fit in 255 bits. The compressed Edwards \(y\) format uses the first 255 bits to store the \(y\) coördinate, and the 256th bit to indicate the sign of the \(x\) …</p></div></div></div></div>

        <p>Static websites are still a hot topic. They are fast, and they’re incredibly secure because there isn’t a CMS to hack. Once you build a static website, however, the question becomes: Where do I host?</p>

<p>In other words: what is the fastest static website hosting provider in 2020? Well, let’s find out!</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I did <a href="https://www.savjee.be/2017/10/Static-website-hosting-who-is-fastest/">a similar test in 2017</a>, so it will be curious to see if the hosting providers have been improving.</p>

<h2 id="test-setup">Test setup</h2>
<p>Just like in 2017, I created a simple webpage that I could host on many services. I opted to use my own homepage, including all the images, CSS, and JS files. I then uploaded these files to the following hosting providers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Pay-as-you-go</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank" data-no-instant="data-no-instant">AWS S3</a> (Region: <code>eu-west-1</code>, Ireland)</li>
      <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/" target="_blank" data-no-instant="data-no-instant">AWS CloudFront</a></li>
      <li>

      <li>

    </ul>
  </li>

      <li><a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" data-no-instant="data-no-instant">GitHub Pages</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Quick note</em>: I did not test Microsoft Azure, because I couldn’t sign up for it with my <a href="https://revolut.com/referral/xavierh5x" target="_blank" data-no-instant="data-no-instant">Revolut Visa card</a>. Thanks, Microsoft!</p>

<p>To check the performance, I used Pingdom and <a href="https://ohdear.app/" target="_blank" data-no-instant="data-no-instant">Oh Dear</a>. Pingdom measures uptime and response times from <a href="https://my.pingdom.com/probes/feed" target="_blank" data-no-instant="data-no-instant">their worldwide network of probe servers</a> while Oh Dear is located in a single location.</p>

<p>Some other things to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I tested the HTTPS endpoints for all services</li>
  <li>I added <code>index.html</code> to all URL’s, meaning no time wasted resolving the index document</li>
  <li>The services were probed <strong>once every minute</strong> for <strong>10 days</strong>
</li>
  <li>Oh Dear did not only track response times, but also DNS lookup time,  TCP connection time, content download time, and more. Pretty cool! All of the raw data is available at the end of this post.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Pingdom or Oh Dear did NOT sponsor this blog post in any way! <a href="https://ohdear.app/" target="_blank" data-no-instant="data-no-instant">Oh Dear</a>, however, gave me a free trial with enough slots for all the test sites. Thanks a lot!</p>

<h2 id="expectations">Expectations</h2>
<p>My expectations are pretty much aligned to when I did this last time around:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I expect paid services to do better than free servers. There must be a reason for the prices they charge, right?</li>
  <li>Firebase and Google Cloud belong to the same company, so I expect them to perform similarly.</li>
  <li>I use CloudFront for my website, so hopefully they don’t come out as a bad option. Otherwise, there’s some additional homework for me ;)</li>
  <li>Netlify performed quite inconsistently last time around. With a few years passing, I hope they were able to address those issues.</li>
  <li>Last time, I didn’t have Cloudflare in the benchmark. I expect them to be a strong contender, given how popular they are and how many edge locations they have.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>Here’s a screenshot from the Pingdom dashboard after 10 days of testing:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.savjee.be/uploads/2020-05-28-benchmaring-static-website-hosting-providers/pingdom-overview.png" alt="Overview of the Pingdom dashboard">
<em>Overview of the Pingdom dashboard</em></p>

<p>At first glance, it seems that all services perform very consistently, with CloudFront, GitHub Pages, and Google Cloud, leading the pack. But let’s not jump to conclusions.</p>

<h3 id="uptime">Uptime</h3>
<p>Let’s start with uptime. All of these services had 100% uptime, except for Firebase. Pingdom detected 1 minute of downtime. One check returned, “Network is unreachable,” and the other returned “Invalid certificate.”</p>

<p><img src="https://www.savjee.be/uploads/2020-05-28-benchmaring-static-website-hosting-providers/pingdom-error-log.png" alt="Firebase downtime as reported by Pingdom">
<em>Firebase downtime as reported by Pingdom</em></p>

<p>This was not detected by Oh Dear, so I’m willing to give Firebase the benefit of the doubt and say that this was an issue on Pingdom’s side.</p>

<h3 id="response-times">Response times</h3>
<p>Let’s start with some basic statistics: the median, and average response time of each service (including standard deviation):</p>

<p><img src="https://www.savjee.be/uploads/2020-05-28-benchmaring-static-website-hosting-providers/chart-response-times.png" alt="Median response times, measured by Pingdom">
<em>Median response times as reported by Pingdom</em></p>

<p>A few things might catch your attention:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CloudFront &amp; GitHub Pages are speedy and consistent. They have the lowest median, average, and deviation. Interesting because one is a paid service, while the other is completely free.</li>
  <li>AWS S3 is the slowest of them all (but performs consistently). It is kind of expected from a hosting provider that is located only in a single region (in this case Ireland, <code>eu-west-1</code>)</li>
  <li>Google Cloud’s regional and multi-regional buckets perform fairly alike. Interestingly, both are much faster than S3, which is a comparable service. Is Google doing some caching behind the scenes?</li>
  <li>I expected Cloudflare to be much more competitive with the top rankings, but somehow both their CDN and Workers aren’t the top performers. Their Workers product does, however, perform slightly better than their CDN.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since I used both Pingdom and Oh Dear, let’s check the difference in median response times:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.savjee.be/uploads/2020-05-28-benchmaring-static-website-hosting-providers/chart-response-times-pingdom-oh-dear.png" alt="Pingdom vs Oh Dear (median response times)">
<em>Pingdom vs Oh Dear (median response times)</em></p>

<p>Interestingly, Oh Dear is reporting much faster response times compared to Pingdom. This is probably related to the fact that they only test from a single (apparently very well connected) location.</p>

<p>Pingdom is testing from various locations around the world, some of which aren’t as well connected, which increases the response times.</p>

<p>Some additional findings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Somehow, AWS S3 is the fastest performer, even though the content is only hosted in a single location. It also outperformed Amazon’s CDN! Wherever Oh Dear is hosted, it must be somewhere in the EU with good connections to the Ireland region of AWS.</li>
  <li>The difference between CloudFront, S3, Firebase, GitHub Pages, and Google Cloud Storage is minimal. Once more, showing that free and paid services compete quite closely with one another.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="time-to-first-byte">Time to first byte</h3>
<p>Oh Dear also kept track of other metrics like how long it took for the first bytes to start being transferred. This can give us an indication of how responsive the webserver is (how long does it need to think before being able to fulfill a request).</p>

<ul>
  <li>The “simple” storage services like S3 and Google Cloud Storage are doing very well.</li>
  <li>Once again, GitHub Pages, Firebase, and CloudFront are great performers, delivering the first byte in under 40ms.</li>
  <li>Surprisingly, Cloudflare is taking quite a while to start delivering the first bytes. Maybe this is due to all of their protection services?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="compared-to-2017">Compared to 2017</h3>
<p>Comparing this new data with the one from 2017 reveals that not much has changed. Note that here I’m comparing the data from Pingdom:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.savjee.be/uploads/2020-05-28-benchmaring-static-website-hosting-providers/chart-response-times-2017-vs-2020.png" alt="Benchmark from 2017 vs 2020: median response times">
<em>Benchmark from 2017 vs 2020: median response times</em></p>

<p>All providers (except GitHub Pages) have become slightly slower. Most noticeably AWS S3 (+13%) and Firebase (+31%). The others are so close to their 2017 performance that I would consider these differences to be in the margin of error.</p>

<p>Netlify has a slower median response time in 2020 compared to 2017. But it did improve massively on its consistency. Last time around, they had weird spikes in performance but not anymore. Nice!</p>

<p>This could be explained by Pingdom having added additional test servers located in areas that are further away from these providers.</p>

<h3 id="trying-to-find-edge-cases">Trying to find edge cases</h3>
<p>A scatter plot reveals that there aren’t many outliers, and no service is suffering from regular spikes in performance. There are some outliers here and there, but I wouldn’t look into them too much:</p>

<p>If we visualize the response times with a box plot, we see something interesting:</p>

<em>Box plot of response times, showing some high spikes</em></p>

<p>All services, except for AWS, GitHub Pages, and Firebase, have weird spikes. Last time around, this was only limited to Netlify. Not sure what to make of these, but I’m guessing it’s more related to Pingdom’s tests than to the services themselves.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Time to draw some conclusions:</p>

<p>The best all-around performer is <strong>AWS CloudFront</strong>, followed closely by <strong>GitHub Pages</strong>. Not only do they have the fastest response times (median), they’re also the most consistent.</p>

<p>They are, however, closely followed by Google Cloud Storage. Interestingly, there is very little difference between a regional and multi-regional bucket. The only reason to pick a multi-regional bucket would be the additional uptime guarantee.</p>

<p><strong>Cloudflare</strong> didn’t perform as well I would’ve expected. It’s certainly faster than a standard S3 bucket but falls away when compared to other CDN’s like CloudFront. Their Workers product is slightly faster than their CDN, but it’s hard to recommend it when it costs $5 a month, and free products like GitHub Pages perform better.</p>

<p>Netlify has improved big time; the spikes in performance are gone and performs in line with Google Cloud and Firebase hosting.</p>

<h2 id="which-should-you-choose">Which should you choose?</h2>
<p>If you want a fast website without breaking the bank, go for GitHub Pages. It’s completely free and super fast. It does, however, require you to open source your site.</p>

<p>If that’s not doable, CloudFront is a good alternative, but its price depends on how much bandwidth you push around. For most personal sites, CloudFront won’t cost more than a couple of dollars per month. The same thing goes for Google Cloud Storage.</p>

<p>Netlify and Firebase Hosting are pretty solid choices as well. While they don’t perform as well as CloudFront or GitHub Pages, they make up for it with excellent development tools. Everything works out-of-the-box with no configuration required on your end. Just push your website live with their easy to use CLI tools.</p>
