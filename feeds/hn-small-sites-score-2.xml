through the direct equivalent of a fine Convolutional network example in Keras.
</p>

<p>
Good News: <a href="https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond">Deep Diamond</a>() preview release is in Clojars, and is already quite useful! And fast!
It is yet to be fully polished, but you can try it now and, I hope, you'll like it.
</p>

<p>
It now covers the functionality that is being explained from scratch in the <a href="http://aiprobook.com/">books that I'm writing</a>.
Convolutions work, too; at the speed of Road Runner!
</p>

<p>
In accordance with my philosophy, "less talk, more walk", I introduce Deep Diamond
through the direct equivalent of this fine <a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py">MNIST CNN example in Keras</a>.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org54ea652">
<h2 id="org54ea652">Specify the network blueprint</h2>
<div id="text-org54ea652">
<p>
We specify the network by plain Clojure vectors and functions, and create the blueprint.
No need for special compilers and whatnot. The structure of internal parts would be
picked up automatically, or we can specify these explicitly.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgb8d8bce">
<h2 id="orgb8d8bce">Create the network</h2>
<div id="text-orgb8d8bce">
<p>
The blueprint is a Clojure function that can instantiate the network
object that holds the parameter tensors that the network should learn by using
one of the built-in optimization algorithms. In this case, I'll use adaptive moments,
<code>:adam</code>. Xavier initialization is, again, a plain function that initializes
the network with appropriate weights.
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>(</span><span>defonce</span> <span>net</span> <span>(</span>init! <span>(</span>net-bp <span>:adam</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
That's it! The network is ready to learn.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgae4dec0">
<h2 id="orgae4dec0">Train the network on MNIST data (CPU)</h2>
<div id="text-orgae4dec0">
<p>
The original MNIST data is distributed through four binary files that
you can download <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">here</a>. To demonstrate how nice Clojure is, I'm not
using any special MNIST-specific code that is magically imported
from the framework's model Zoo. The complete code, from scratch, is at the
end of the article (I'm just pushing it there so it doesn't steal the spotlight :).
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>(</span>time <span>(</span>train net train-images y-train <span>:crossentropy</span> 12 <span>[]</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The network learns in mini-batches of 128 images of the total of 60000,
with adaptive moments, through 12 full epochs. That makes 5625 forward/backward
update cycles.
</p>

<p>
The total time for that on my old 2013. i7-4790k CPU is: <b>368</b> seconds.
<b>6 minutes for 6000 cycles. A thousand cycles per minute.</b>
</p>

<p>
Isn't that a lot? You should try and run this in Keras with TensorFlow, and
see that we got a pretty nice performance! (I'll publish some comparisons soon,
and in the meantime you can try for yourself!).

September 8, 2020 | https://savepandadoc.org/en/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://savepandadoc.org/en/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>Friends,</p>
          <p>On&nbsp;September 2, the Belarus government ordered searches to&nbsp;be&nbsp;conducted at&nbsp;the Minsk office of&nbsp;PandaDoc. During the search, more than 20 employees were prevented from leaving and 7 of&nbsp;them were taken into custody and detained for further interrogation. Some of&nbsp;these employees were subsequently taken into custody from their homes.</p>
          <p>Over the next two days, the Financial Investigation Department (FID) arm of&nbsp;the Belarus government interviewed more than one hundred company employees. During those two days, the employees that had been taken into custody were also denied the rights to&nbsp;legal counsel.</p>
          <p>Today, on&nbsp;September 4, 2020 we&nbsp;were told that a&nbsp;criminal case was retroactively initiated against PandaDoc employees under part 4 of&nbsp;article 210 of&nbsp;the Criminal Code of&nbsp;the Republic of&nbsp;Belarus. Our employees are accused of&nbsp;taking one hundred and seven thousand Belarusian rubles (~40k USD) from the corporate accounts of&nbsp;the company in&nbsp;Minsk abusing their positions, thus causing damage to&nbsp;the&nbsp;State. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, our employees have now been placed into custody for two months.</p>
          <p>We&nbsp;declare that this accusation by&nbsp;the State of&nbsp;Belarus is&nbsp;completely untrue and has no&nbsp;grounds.</p>
          <p>All the company’s activities in&nbsp;Belarus were conducted since its inception in&nbsp;full compliance with the&nbsp;law. Several international audits and inspections by&nbsp;EY&nbsp;and other reputable companies over the last years prove that the company adhered to&nbsp;all regulations and laws prevalent in&nbsp;Belarus.</p>
          <p>As&nbsp;recent events in&nbsp;Belarus have demonstrated, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;common practice of&nbsp;the Belarusian government to&nbsp;oppress political opponents. In&nbsp;this case, the authorities have taken four completely innocent people hostage.</p>
          <p>This action is&nbsp;purely an&nbsp;act of&nbsp;repression against the founders of&nbsp;PandaDoc who have been supporting some of&nbsp;the victims of&nbsp;the Belarussian government in&nbsp;the weeks since the stolen Presidential election. The only purpose of&nbsp;this private initiative by&nbsp;Mikita and Sergey has been intended to&nbsp;help stop the violence and is&nbsp;in&nbsp;no&nbsp;way related to&nbsp;PandaDoc.</p>
          <p>In&nbsp;response the government has imprisoned:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Yulia Shardyko</strong>, Accountant</li>
            <li><strong>Dmitry Rabtsevich</strong>, Director&nbsp;— Minsk office</li>
            <li><strong>Viktor Kuvshinov</strong>, Product director</li>
            <li><strong>Vladislav Mikholap</strong>, HR</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The law in&nbsp;Belarus has ceased to&nbsp;exist. The authorities do&nbsp;not even bother to&nbsp;act according to&nbsp;the prevailing rules and laws of&nbsp;the country. The case and charges are fabricated cases upon political orders ordered from somewhere in&nbsp;the government. This affects everyone in&nbsp;Belarus.</p>
          <h2>We&nbsp;ask of&nbsp;you:</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Record a&nbsp;video in&nbsp;our support with the tag <strong>#SavePandaDoc</strong>.</li>
            <li>To&nbsp;express your disagreement in&nbsp;the press, media and social networks with the <strong>#SavePandaDoc</strong> tag.</li>
            <li>Connect us&nbsp;to&nbsp;journalists and reporters that you&nbsp;know. Our contact is&nbsp;<a href="mailto:savepandadoc@gmail.com">savepandadoc@gmail.com</a>.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>We&nbsp;are hoping that maximum publicity will show solidarity and pressure to&nbsp;have our colleagues released.</p>

<p>When linking to a page for the <strong>purpose of reference</strong>, it seems better to me to <em><strong>link to the <a href="https://archive.org/">archive</a> of a given page</strong></em>, rather than to the original site itself.</p>
<p>This ensures that after some years have gone by, <strong>my article is guaranteed to be consistent</strong>. Due the  changing nature of the web, there is a chance that after some years, the link could lead to a:</p>
<ul>
<li>404 /  Not Found (most common)</li>
<li>Changed or edited content, or entirely replaced content</li>
<li>Content that, due to a rise in popularity, is now shielded, demanding the user to make an account to read the entire article.</li>
</ul>

<p>Take defensive measures. To future-proof your content, rather than reference the general web, its far more reliable to link to an archive.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example:</h2>
<p>The Epoch Times wrote an article on Smartphones data-mining their users. This is the archived article here:</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190214015500/https://www.theepochtimes.com/smartphone-app-users-are-data-mined-even-when-not-using-the-apps_2787202.html">The Archive Version (fully readable)</a></p>
<h3 id="article-content-before">Article Content Before</h3>
<p>You can see its perfectly “normal” readable useful  content.</p>
<p><img src="https://hawaiigentech.com/post/commentary/why-i-link-to-waybackmachine-instead/link-content-before.png" alt="Article Link Content Before"></p>
<h3 id="article-content-after">Article Content After</h3>
<p>Now it’s spam from a site suffering financial need.</p>

<p>So in Feb 14 2019 your users would have seen the content you intended. However in Sep 07 2020, your users are being asked to support independent Journalism instead.</p>
<h2 id="if-an-archive-record-doesnt-exist-make-one">If an Archive Record Doesn't Exist, Make One</h2>
<p>Its worth the extra moment, in referencing a site, to make an archive of the page you wish to reference, if one does not exist. After that, immediately use the link from the archive.org entry, rather than the blog, news, info, or forum site you wish to refer to.</p>
<h2 id="in-unstable-times-take-measures-for-stability">In Unstable Times, Take Measures for Stability</h2>
<p>The web is a fast changing place. Even more during the Covid pandemic and suffering financial markets. Since times are financially harder, websites are disappearing, heaping up advertising, demanding user response, and things like this.</p>
<p>To avoid your content losing quality due to these things, linking to a solid, unchanging static copy of the page is far more reliable.</p>

<p>By now, many people have run across the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/016.pdf">Invisible Salamander</a> paper about the interesting property of AES-GCM, that allows an attacker to construct a ciphertext that will decrypt with a valid tag under two different keys, provided both keys are known to the attacker. On some level, finding properties like this isn’t too surprising: AES-GCM was designed to be an AEAD, and nowhere in the AEAD definition does it state anything about what attackers with access to the keys can do, since the usual assumption is that attackers don’t have that access, since any Alice-Bob-Message model would be meaningless in that scenario.</p>



<p>What is interesting to me is that this property comes up more often than one would think, I ran across it several times now during my work reviewing cryptographic designs, it’s far from an obscure property for real world systems. The general situation these systems have in common is that they involve three parties: Alice, Bob, and Trent. Trent is a trusted third party for Bob, who is allowed to read messages and scan them, with details like when and why depending on the crypto system in question. While Trent and Bob agree on the ciphertext<em>—</em>say because Trent hands Bob the ciphertext or because Alice presents Trent’s signature on it<em>—</em>Alice has the option of giving Trent and Bob different keys. The challenge for Alice is to come up with a ciphertext that has a valid authentication tag and still decrypts to different messages for Trent and Bob.</p>



<h4>Mitigations</h4>



<p>Before I dive deeper into how to construct invisible salamanders for AES-GCM and AES-GCM-SIV, a few words on how to defend against these problems. The easiest option here is to add a hash of the key to the ciphertext. This technically violates indistinguishability, as the identity of the key is leaked, i.e. an attacker now knows which key was used for the message. If indistinguishability is necessary, using the IV as a salt for the hash works well, constructions like <code>HMAC-SHA-2(key=IV, message=key)</code> (i.e. aka HKDF-expand) work well here, as long as attention is paid on whether or not this key hash can be used in any other context. In general, it shouldn’t because the key already should only be used for AES-GCM/AES-GCM-SIV, but real world systems sometimes have weird properties.</p>



<h4>Constructing Salamanders</h4>



<p>With the mitigation out of the way, onto the fun part: Constructing the messages. In order to understand why and how these attacks work, we first have to talk about <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{F}_{2^{128}}</span> and the way AES-GCM and AES-GCM-SIV use this field to construct their respective tags. As a finite field <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{F}_{2^{128}}</span> supports addition, multiplication, and division, following the usual field axioms. The field has characteristic 2, which means addition is just the xor operator, and subtraction is the exact same operation as addition. Multiplication and division is somewhat more complicated and not in scope for this article, it suffices to say that multiplication can be implemented with a very fast algorithm if the hardware supports certain instruction sets (carryless multiplication). The division algorithm uses the Euclidean algorithm and will at most take 256 multiplications in a naive implementation, so while slower than the other operations, it will still be extremely fast. I will use <span data-katex-display="false">+</span> for the addition operation and <span data-katex-display="false">\cdot</span> for the multiplication operation. The most important caveat is to not confuse these operations with integer arithmetic.</p>



<h5>AES-GCM</h5>



<p>Next, on to <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-38d.pdf">AES-GCM</a>. This AEAD is a relatively straightforward implementation of an AEAD that uses a UHF based MAC for authentication. Our IV is 12 byte long, we use a 4 byte counter and CTR mode to encrypt the message. The slightly odd feature is that we start the counter at 2, for reasons we will see later. For authentication, we first derive an authentication key <span data-katex-display="false">H</span> by encrypting the zero block (This is why we don’t start the counter at zero, otherwise the zero IV would be invalid). Now, using the ciphertext blocks, additional data blocks (both padded with zeros as needed for the last block), and adding a special length block containing the size of the additional data and the ciphertext, we get a collection of blocks, all of which I will refer to as <span data-katex-display="false">C_i</span>. To compute the tag, we now compute the polynomial</p>



<p><span data-katex-display="true">GHASH(H, C, T) = C_0\cdot H^{n+1} + C_1\cdot H^{n}+\dots + C_{n-1}\cdot H^2+C_n\cdot H+T</span></p><p>The constant term, <span data-katex-display="false">T</span> is the encrypted counter block associated to the counter variable of 1 (Which is why we started at 2 for the CTR mode). Remember that in characteristic 2 <span data-katex-display="false">+</span> is xor, so we could equivalently say that we compute the polynomial without the constant term and then encrypt it with CTR mode as the first block.</p>



<p>Now, how do we get two different plaintexts to agree on both ciphertext and tag, we first choose two keys and produce the corresponding keystreams, choosing the plaintexts so that the ciphertexts agree (If you want two plaintext that make sense, this part is the hardest step, you first brute force the first few bytes in order to be valid in one format and a comment opening statement in the other, so that you can switch which parts of the ciphertext will appear as valid plaintext and which parts appear as commented out). We leave one ciphertext block open for now, as a sacrificial block that we will modify in order to make the tags turn out to be the same. Next derive the corresponding authentication keys <span data-katex-display="false">H_1</span> and <span data-katex-display="false">H_2</span> and our constant terms <span data-katex-display="false">T_1, T_2</span>. This means, we have <span data-katex-display="false">C_i</span> fixed, except for a specific index, say <span data-katex-display="false">j</span>, and can now solve</p>



<p><span data-katex-display="true">GHASH(H_1, C, T_1) =GHASH(H_2, C, T_2)</span>



<span data-katex-display="true">\sum_{i=0}^n C_i\cdot H_1^{n+1-i}+T_1=\sum_{i=0}^n C_i\cdot H_2^{n+1-i}+T_2</span>



<span data-katex-display="true">C_j\cdot\left(H_1^{n+1-j}+H_2^{n+1-j}\right)=\sum_{\substack{i=0\\i\neq j}}^n C_i\cdot \left(H_1^{n+1-i}+H_2^{n+1-i}\right)+T_1+T_2</span>



<span data-katex-display="true">C_j=\left(H_1^{n+1-j}+H_2^{n+1-j}\right)^{-1}\cdot\left(\sum_{\substack{i=0\\i\neq j}}^n C_i\cdot \left(H_1^{n+1-i}+H_2^{n+1-i}\right)+T_1+T_2\right)</span></p><p>by solving for the sacrificial block <span data-katex-display="false">C_j</span>.</p>



<h5>AES-GCM-SIV</h5>



<p>So far so good, but, what about <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8452">AES-GCM-SIV</a>? GCM is famous for having many weird properties that make it extremely fragile, like leaking the authentication key on a single IV reuse, or allowing for insecure tags smaller than 128 bits. In many ways, AES-GCM-SIV is how AES-GCM should look like for real world applications, much more robust against IV reuse, only revealing the damaging properties of an UHF with a reused IV if both IV and tag are the same. This is accomplished through using the tag as a synthetic IV, meaning the tag is computed over the plaintext, and then used as IV for CTR mode to encrypt. Even though this kind of SIV construction uses MAC-then-Encrypt, they are secure against the usual downsides due to CTR mode always succeeding in constant time, independent of the plaintext. This means the receiver can decrypt the message and validate the tag without revealing information about the plaintext in case of an invalid tag. The library needs to take care that the plaintext is properly discarded and not exposed to the user in case the tag does not validate.</p>



<p>The actual IV for AES-GCM-SIV is used primarily derive a per message key. This means that if the IV of two messages is different, both encryption and authentication keys will be unrelated and can not be used to infer things about each other.</p>



<p>All in all AES-GCM-SIV works like this:</p>



<ul><li><span data-katex-display="false">H, K_E = \operatorname{KDF}(K, IV)</span></li><li><span data-katex-display="false">T=\operatorname{AES}(K_E, P_0\cdot H^{n+1}+\dots+P_n\cdot H)</span></li><li><span data-katex-display="false">C=\operatorname{AES-CTR}(K_E, IV=T)</span></li></ul>



<p>where the plaintext blocks <span data-katex-display="false">P_i</span> again contain additional data and length, and some extra hardening and efficiency tricks having been stripped for clarity.</p>



<p>Our previous approach of first creating the ciphertext and then balancing things out to get the tags to agree clearly cannot work here anymore. The keystream, and therefore the ciphertext, depend on the tag, so if we want to have any chance of finding a salamander, we have to fix the tag before we do any calculation at all. So after having chosen <span data-katex-display="false">T</span>, we decrypt it under each of our keys to get the result of our polynomial <span data-katex-display="false">S_i=\operatorname{AES}^{-1}(K_{E,i}, T)</span>. What we are left with is finding plaintexts <span data-katex-display="false">P_1, P_2</span> such that</p>



<p><span data-katex-display="true">S_i=\sum_{j=0}^n P_{j, i} H_i^{n+1-j}</span></p><p>which gives us a system of two linear equations with <span data-katex-display="false">2n</span> unknowns. But this isn’t all constraints we need to satisfy, since we still need to encrypt these plaintexts once we have the tag balanced. Here, we are lucky that everything is over characteristic 2: The CTR encryption is just an addition of the plaintext and the encrypted counter block <span data-katex-display="false">C_i=\operatorname{AES}(K_E, CB_i)+P_i</span>. To say that two plaintexts result in the same ciphertext under two different keys is just fulfilling the equation</p>



<p><span data-katex-display="true">\operatorname{AES}(K_{E, 1}, CB_{j, 1})+P_{j, 1}=\operatorname{AES}(K_{E, 2}, CB_{j, 2})+P_{j, 2}</span>.</p>



<p>This, like our two equations for the tag, is a linear equation. So in the end, for a plaintext that has a size of <span data-katex-display="false">n</span> blocks, we get <span data-katex-display="false">n+2</span> linear equations with <span data-katex-display="false">2n</span> variables. This means, in almost all cases, we can construct an invisible salamander with only adding two sacrificial blocks, with the same caveat that the two plaintexts need to be partially brute forced.</p>



<h4>Test Code</h4>



<p>I’ve put this to the test and have written code to produce <a href="https://github.com/sophieschmieg/fun-with-gcm/blob/master/FunWithGcm.java">AES-GCM</a> (Java) and <a href="https://github.com/sophieschmieg/fun-with-gcm/blob/master/fun_with_gcm_siv.cc">AES-GCM-SIV</a> (C++) salamanders.</p>

<p>Azure Bicep is an abstraction built on top of Azure ARM Templates and Azure Resource Manager that offers a cleaner code syntax with better support for modularity and code re-use. Azure Bicep moves away from the JSON syntax used by ARM Templates and is much easier to both read and write Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in Azure! This is the latest tool from Microsoft for deploying Azure resources in a DevOps process, and its even open source!</p>



<p>Let’s get started!</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>Warning</strong>: Before you start using Azure Bicep, know that it is in an early Alpha state and is not supported for use in production environments just yet. Also, it doesn’t support all the functionality it eventually will. However, it does support some really great features already that makes Azure<a href="https://build5nines.com/what-is-infrastructure-as-code/"> Infrastructure as Code </a>(IaC) even easier to write and read!</p></blockquote>







<br><h2><span id="what_is_azure_bicep"></span>What is Azure Bicep?<span></span></h2>



<p>Azure Bicep is a new declarative Domain Specific Language (DSL) for deploying Azure resources. The goal of this new language is to make it easier to write Infrastructure as Code (IaC) targeting Azure Resource Manager (ARM) using a syntax that’s more friendly than the JSON syntax of Azure ARM Templates.</p>



<p>Azure Bicep works as an abstraction layer built on top of ARM Templates. Anything that can be done with Azure ARM Templates can be done with Azure Bicep as it provides a “transparent abstraction” over ARM (Azure Resource Manager). With this abstraction, all the <code>types</code>, <code>apiVersions</code>, and <code>properties</code> valid within ARM Templates are also valid with Azure Bicep.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Azure Bicep is a transpiled language. This means that the Azure Bicep code converted into ARM Template code. Then, the resulting ARM Template code is used to deploy the Azure resources. This transpiling enables Azure Bicep to use it’s own syntax and compiler for authoring Azure Bicep files that compile down to Azure Resource Manager (ARM) JSON as a sort of intermediate language (IL).</p>



<p>The way that Azure Bicep is transpiled into ARM JSON is similar to how there are many different languages that can be written in, then transpiled into JavaScript that can be run within the web browser. One popular example of this type of transpiled language is TypeScript. A transpiled language offers benefits of adding an abstraction layer to make it easier and / or more feature full to write code that then gets compiled down to IL code that gets executed. This is also similar to how C# and VB.NET code compile down to MSIL in .NET code.</p>



<p>In the development world, it’s common to encounter the use of transpiled languages. It’s also common in the DevOps world where YAML and JSON are converted between one or the other. Azure Bicep offers some similarity in how it’s transpiled into ARM JSON. This enables you to use an alternative syntax and feature set for writing declarative Infrastructure as Code than the often-cumbersome ARM JSON syntax.</p>



<blockquote><p>Azure Bicep offers some similarity in how it’s transpiled into ARM JSON. This enables you to use an alternative syntax and feature set for writing declarative Infrastructure as Code than the often-cumbersome ARM JSON syntax.</p></blockquote>



<p>Azure Bicep will have limits in its ability to support features that are not natively supported by ARM Templates when deploying Azure resources. However, Azure Bicep will also be able to implement additional code reuse and other features that the Azure Bicep compiler will be able to translate into valid ARM JSON features. Through all this, Azure Bicep has a goal of offering a cleaner syntax along with better support for modularity and code re-use than is offered by ARM JSON.</p>



<h2><span id="why_use_azure_bicep"></span>Why use Azure Bicep?<span></span></h2>



<p>Azure Resource Manager and ARM Templates are written in a JSON syntax that can be cumbersome to work with. Azure Bicep is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that offers a transparent abstraction over Azure Resource Manager and ARM Templates that offers support for a cleaner code syntax with better support for modularity and code re-use. Azure Bicep offers a few improvements for authoring Azure IaC over the use of ARM Template JSON.</p>



<br><h3><span id="azure_bicep_benefits"></span>Azure Bicep Benefits<span></span></h3>



<p>Here are the primary benefits of using Azure Bicep that are integrated as core goals into the Azure Bicep project and are the foundations for why Microsoft is building Azure Bicep:</p>



<ol><li>Create a better language for writing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for describing, validating, and deploying Azure resources.</li><li>The Azure Bicep language is a transparent abstraction that does not require any updates or onboarding to the underlying platform in order to support a new Azure resource <code>type</code> and / or <code>apiVersion</code>.</li><li>Azure Bicep code should be easily understood and straightforward to learn for those both new and experienced with other programming languages.</li><li>Code re-use should be a primary feature allowing users freedom to modularize and re-use code without ‘copy/paste’.</li><li>Azure Bicep tooling should offer a high level of discoverability and validation. The tooling should also be developed alongside the compiler; rather than added afterwards.</li><li>Azure Bicep should enable users to have high confidence that the code is ‘syntactically valid’ before it’s deployed.</li></ol>



<p>Also, Azure Bicep is being specifically designed so that it is not a general-purpose language for meeting any need. It is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) meant for writing declarative IaC. It’s also not meant to provide a model for non-Azure related tasks.</p>



<h2><span id="install_azure_bicep"></span>Install Azure Bicep<span></span></h2>



<p>Azure Bicep is a DevOps tool built for authoring IaC used to deploy Azure resources from any environment. As a result, this means Azure Bicep supports Windows, Linux, and macOS.</p>



<p>The primary component for Azure Bicep is the Bicep CLI. This is the required tool used for compiling Bicep code into ARM JSON; plus, it’s open source and cross-platform.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at installing Azure Bicep in different environments!</p>



<h3><span id="download_bicep_cli_binaries"></span>Download Bicep CLI Binaries<span></span></h3>



<p>When installing Azure Bicep, you will need to first download the Bicep CLI binary built for your operating system. All the binaries for the different supported operating systems can be downloaded from the official <a href="https://github.com/Azure/bicep/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">releases page</a> of the Azure Bicep open source project.</p>



<p>You can either manually download the Bicep CLI binary and install it, or you can use the following helper script examples to install Azure Bicep more easily.</p>



<h3><span id="install_on_windows"></span>Install on Windows<span></span></h3>



<p>On Windows machines, Azure Bicep can be installed using PowerShell with the following script:</p>



<pre><code># Create the install folder
$installPath = "$env:USERPROFILE\.bicep"
$installDir = New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $installPath -Force
$installDir.Attributes += 'Hidden'
# Fetch the latest Bicep CLI binary
(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("https://github.com/Azure/bicep/releases/latest/download/bicep-win-x64.exe", "$installPath\bicep.exe")
# Add bicep to your PATH
$currentPath = (Get-Item -path "HKCU:\Environment" ).GetValue('Path', '', 'DoNotExpandEnvironmentNames')
if (-not $currentPath.Contains("%USERPROFILE%\.bicep")) { setx PATH ($currentPath + ";%USERPROFILE%\.bicep") }
if (-not $env:path.Contains($installPath)) { $env:path += ";$installPath" }
# Verify you can now access the 'bicep' command.
bicep --help
# Done!</code></pre>



<h3><span id="install_on_macos"></span>Install on macOS<span></span></h3>



<p>On macOS machines, Azure Bicep can be installed using the terminal with the following script:</p>



<pre><code># Fetch the latest Bicep CLI binary
curl -Lo bicep https://github.com/Azure/bicep/releases/latest/download/bicep-osx-x64
# Mark it as executable
chmod +x ./bicep
# Add Gatekeeper exception (requires admin)
sudo spctl --add ./bicep
# Add bicep to your PATH (requires admin)
sudo mv ./bicep /usr/local/bin/bicep
# Verify you can now access the 'bicep' command
bicep --help
# Done!</code></pre>



<h3><span id="install_on_linux"></span>Install on Linux<span></span></h3>



<p>On Linux machines, Azure Bicep can be installed using the following script:</p>



<pre><code># Fetch the latest Bicep CLI binary
curl -Lo bicep https://github.com/Azure/bicep/releases/latest/download/bicep-linux-x64
# Mark it as executable
chmod +x ./bicep
# Add bicep to your PATH (requires admin)
sudo mv ./bicep /usr/local/bin/bicep
# Verify you can now access the 'bicep' command
bicep --help
# Done!</code></pre>



<h3><span id="install_in_azure_cloud_shell"></span>Install in Azure Cloud Shell<span></span></h3>



<p>The Azure Cloud Shell runs on Ubuntu server, so to install Azure Bicep, you will need to install the Linux binary for the Bicep CLI. However, you cannot simply use the above script for installing Azure Bicep on Linux due to a limitation of the Azure Cloud Shell that prevents you from modifying the PATH.</p>



<p>Here are some steps you can follow to basically “install” Azure Bicep for use in the Azure Cloud Shell environment:</p>



<ol><li>Connect to the Azure Cloud Shell; either within the Azure Portal or at <code><a href="https://shell.azure.com/" rel="nofollow">https://shell.azure.com</a></code>.</li><li>First, you likely want to create a directory within the Azure Cloud Shell environment to save the Bicep CLI to. For example, creating a <code>~/tools</code> directory:<br><code>mkdir ~/tools</code></li><li>Next, navigate to the directory created and download the Linux binary for the Bicep CLI into the Azure Cloud Shell environment into this directory:</li></ol>



<pre><code># Navigate to "tools" directory
cd ~/tools
# Fetch the latest Bicep CLI binary
curl -Lo bicep https://github.com/Azure/bicep/releases/latest/download/bicep-linux-x64
# Mark it as executable
chmod +x ./bicep</code></pre>



<p>Using the above steps will place the Azure Bicep CLI in the location of <code>~/tools/bicep</code> within you Azure Cloud Shell environments. Once placed here, you can execute the Bicep CLI from anywhere within the Azure Cloud Shell environment by referencing it within the <code>~/tools</code> directory.</p>



<p>For example, when located within the <code>~/bicep</code> directory, you can run the following command to utilize the <code>~/tools/bicep</code> executable to build some Azure Bicep code in the <code>main.bicep</code> file:</p>



<pre><code>chris@Azure:~/bicep$ ~/tools/bicep build main.bicep</code></pre>



<p>With the Azure Bicep CLI installed into the Azure Cloud Shell environment, then you’ll be able to utilize Azure Bicep easily from anywhere without the need to install it on your local machine.</p>

<p>In this blog post we will take a look inside the Wyze Outdoor Base Station and see whats going on. Many people were very excited to hop on board the Wyze train when they announced the outdoor camera – however it has mostly been met with bad reviews and buggy, half baked features. </p>

<p>Lets get this thing out of the plastic case to take a closer look, carefully removing the RF1.13 IPX connectors for the antenna signal wire.</p>

<p>We can see that the board is labeled 9531_HL_CORE_AM7</p>

<p>It seems like this might be a board built by Nova Electronics that Wyze is putting into a nice package. Looks Familiar right?</p>



<p>The 3 pins on the right side of the board look like they could be SPI – so we tried to solder some pins on and get a terminal open</p>



<p>I guessed the TX / RX pins, and the ground was labeled nicely on the board. For Reference: </p>



<ul><li>Ground to GND (Duh!)</li><li>TX is L1</li><li>RX is L2</li></ul>

<p>Well this is interesting, this little guy is running OpenWRT.  I guessed all of the normal user / password combos I could think of and didn’t get anywhere – If anyone has any ideas on how to get into this shoot me a message / comment!</p>



<p>Lets watch it boot up and see if there is anything interesting going on here: </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Rust is increasingly used as a programming language for smart contracts.
Whereas the first generation blockchains used specialized VMs,
newer blockchains are running general purpose VMs,
especially <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WASM</a>.
And of course,
Rust is a modern language that runs just about everywhere,
and is especially good at targetting WASM.
Somewhat serendipitously,
this has made Rust one of the best candidate languages for writing
smart contracts on the new generation of blockchains.</p>

<p>Lately I’ve been learning more about the smart contract programming landscape,
and this post is about my first dive into smart contract programming in
Rust on the <a href="https://github.com/nearprotocol/nearcore">NEAR</a> platform.</p>

<p>NEAR is a sharded, proof-of-stake blockchain that runs WASM.
It not only supports smart contracts written in Rust
(in addition to <a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/">AssemblyScript</a>),
but is also itself written in Rust.
While one the most prominent Rust blockchain projects,
it is perhaps not yet widely known in the broader blockchain development community.</p>

<p>Based on my experiences here though,
I’m quite enthusiastic about the NEAR developer experience,
and I intend to spend more time hacking on NEAR.</p>

<p>These are my first impressions of NEAR,
as someone with moderate knowledge of blockchains,
but limited previous blockchain programing experience.
I have previously written similarly about my first experiences
with other blockchains: <a href="https://talk.nervos.org/t/experience-report-first-time-building-and-running-ckb/4518/">Nervos</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Aimeedeer/bigannouncement/blob/master/doc/hacklog.md">Ethereum</a>.</p>

<h2 id="starting-at-the-start-of-the-docs">Starting at the start of the docs</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.near.org/">NEAR documentation</a> seems refreshingly thorough,
if a bit confusing to navigate.
There are different docs to follow depending on your role in the network,
whether a validator,
smart contract programmer,
etc.
and I find myself jumping between multiple sections,
without quite understanding how the docs are organized overall,
perhaps because there isn’t a single table of contents that covers the entire site.</p>

<p>Anyway, after browsing the docs to get a general idea of their organization,
I go back to the front page and I click “Basics”.
This seems to be leading me down the path of being a smart contract developer,
not running my own local node,
not building NEAR itself.</p>

<p>For sake of understanding,
I generally want to build the entire stack I’m working on,
but for now I’m going to follow the docs exactly and see where that gets me,
and not build NEAR on my own.</p>

<h2 id="account-creation">Account creation</h2>

<p>Setting up an account is done through a web interface at:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://wallet.testnet.near.org/">https://wallet.testnet.near.org/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I create a testnet account,
<code>floopy.testnet</code>,
and a recovery phrase.</p>

<p>The NEAR explorer page for my account is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://explorer.testnet.near.org/accounts/floopy.testnet">https://explorer.testnet.near.org/accounts/floopy.testnet</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead of a hash for an ID,
as in most blockchains,
you get an actual string name.
And the system can optionally do account recovery over email or phone.
While this is convenient, it seems suspiciously centralized for a public blockchain,
and I wonder if it is possible to create accounts without any central authority.
I imagine it is, and this website is mostly a convenience, but don’t know yet.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>Following <a href="https://docs.near.org/docs/development/near-cli">the docs</a>, I install <code>near-cli</code>, a Node app.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ npm install -g near-cli

<p>Semes to work fine.</p>

<p>From previous doc reading I know that running a full node typically involves running <a href="https://github.com/near/nearup">nearup</a>.
It appears though that I don’t need that now,
so probably for the purposes of developing on near,
<code>near-cli</code> will just talk to existing public nodes.</p>

<p>At this point I seem to hit the end of the “basics” documentation flow,
without really accomplishing anything,
but I remember <a href="https://docs.near.org/docs/quick-start/new-to-near#how-do-i-get-started">from the beginning of these docs</a> that “choose a starter project”
is step 2.</p>

<p>I back up and choose the <a href="https://examples.near.org/rust-status-message"><code>rust-status-message</code></a> starter project.</p>

<h2 id="running-a-contract">Running a contract</h2>

<p>The examples say to install <code>near-shell</code>,
but that project has been renamed to <code>near-cli</code>.
I see that there are already PRs submitted to fix this,
but they are about a month old.
There are a number of relatively old PRs in NEAR repos that haven’t been reviewed.</p>

<p>I clone the example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/near-examples/rust-status-message
$ cd rust-status-message
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And build per the instructions:</p>



<p>This is an npm build that wraps a cargo build.
I’m curious if there’s any JavaScript involved,
but I suspect they are just using npm as the primary interface
for the sake of familiarity and for consistency with
the build process for AssemblyScript smart contracts.</p>

<p>Looking at <code>package.json</code> it’s true that npm isn’t doing much here,
but it <em>is</em> adding a post-build step that cargo is incapable of:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>  </span><span>"scripts"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"build"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"postbuild"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"cp target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/status_message.wasm ./res/"</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>There is an error in the build:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>error[E0463]: can't find crate for `core`
  |
  = note: the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target may not be installed

error: aborting due to previous error

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0463`.
error: could not compile `byte-tools`.
warning: build failed, waiting for other jobs to finish...
error: build failed

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is an easy error to understand to somebody familiar with embedded Rust development,
but probably not to other newbies.
The toolchain just doesn’t have the <code>wasm32-unknown-unknown</code> target installed.
I don’t know if I missed the documentation that explained this,
but the user experience here could be better.</p>

<p>I add the wasm target:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
info: downloading component 'rust-std' for 'wasm32-unknown-unknown'
info: installing component 'rust-std' for 'wasm32-unknown-unknown'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After that the build works:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ npm run build

&gt; rust-status-message-builder@1.0.0 build /home/ubuntu/near/rust-status-message
&gt; cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

   Compiling near-sdk v0.11.0
   Compiling status-message v0.1.0 (/home/ubuntu/near/rust-status-message)
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 3.99s

&gt; rust-status-message-builder@1.0.0 postbuild /home/ubuntu/near/rust-status-message
&gt; cp target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/status_message.wasm ./res/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I try to deploy to the testnet using a temporary developer account:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ near dev-deploy --wasmFile res/status_message.wasm --helperUrl https://near-contract-helper.onrender.com
We would like to collect data on near-cli usage to improve developer experience. We will never send private information. We only collect which commands are run via an anonymous identifier. Would you like to opt in (y/n)?
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>NEAR wants me to opt in to telemetry.
I’m sympathetic,
but since this command presumably will have access to private keys,
I’m not confident that the developers have been suitably careful
about avoiding collection of private data.
For now I say “n”, until I can review that code.</p>

<p>The command continues:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ near dev-deploy --wasmFile res/status_message.wasm --helperUrl https://near-contract-helper.onrender.com
We would like to collect data on near-cli usage to improve developer experience. We will never send private information. We only collect which commands are run via an anonymous identifier. Would you like to opt in (y/n)? n

<p><code>near dev-deploy</code> has apparently created a script <code>neardev/dev-account.env</code>

I call it with <code>source neardev/dev-account.env</code>.</p>

<p>I call <code>near call</code> to set the status message in the contract:</p>

	<p><small>September  7, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>One of the ways that <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/dwiki/DWiki">DWiki</a> (the code behind <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/">Wandering Thoughts</a>) is unusual is that it strictly validates the query parameters
it receives on URLs, including on HTTP <code>GET</code> requests for ordinary
pages. If a HTTP request has unexpected and unsupported query
parameters, such a <code>GET</code> request will normally fail. When I made
this decision it seemed the cautious and conservative approach, but
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/CautionIsAMistakeToday">this caution has turned out to be a mistake on the modern web</a>. In practice, all sorts of sites will
generate versions of your URLs with all sorts of extra query
parameters tacked on, give them to people, and expect them to work.
If your website refuses to play along, (some) people won't get to
see your content. <strong>On today's web, you need to accept (and then
ignore) arbitrary query parameters on your URLs</strong>.</p>

<p>(Today's new query parameter is 's=NN', for various values of NN
like '04' and '09'. I'm not sure what's generating these URLs, but
it may be Slack.)</p>

<p>You might wonder how we got here, and that is a story of lax behavior
(or, if you prefer, being liberal in what you accept). In the
beginning, both Apache (for static web pages) and early web
applications often ignored extra query parameters on URLs, at least
on <code>GET</code> requests. I suspect that other early web servers also
imitated Apache here, but I have less exposure to their behavior
than Apache's. My guess is that this behavior wasn't deliberate,
it was just the simplest way to implement both Apache and early
web applications; you paid attention to what you cared about and
didn't bother to explicitly check that nothing else was supplied.</p>

<p>When people noticed that this behavior was commonplace and widespread,
they began using it. I believe that one of the early uses was for
embedding 'where this link was shared' information for your own web
analytics (<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/AnalyticsVsSecurity">cf</a>), either based on your logs
or using JavaScript embedded in the page. In the way of things,
once this was common enough other people began helpfully tagging
the links that were shared through them for you, which is why I
began to see various 'utm_*' query parameters on inbound
requests to <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/">Wandering Thoughts</a> even though I never
published such URLs.
Web developers don't leave attractive nuisances alone for long, so
soon enough people were sticking on extra query parameters to your
URLs that were mostly for them and not so much for you. Facebook
may have been one of the early pioneers here with their 'fbclid'
parameter, but other websites have hopped on this particular train
since then (as I saw recently with these 's=NN' parameters).</p>

<p>At this point, the practice of other websites and services adding
random query parameters to your URLs that pass through them is so
wide spread and common that accepting random query parameters is
pretty much a practical requirement for any web content serving
software that wants to see wide use and not be irritating to the
people operating it. If, like <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/dwiki/DWiki">DWiki</a>, you stick to your guns and
refuse to accept some or all of them, you will drop some amount of
your incoming requests from real people, disappointing would be
readers.</p>

<p>This practical requirement for URL handling is not documented in
any specification, and it's probably not in most 'best practices'
documentation. People writing new web serving systems that are
tempted to be strict and safe and cautious get to learn about it
the hard way.</p>

<p>In general, any laxness in actual implementations of a system can
create a similar spiral of de facto requirements. Something that
is permitted and is useful to people will be used, and then supporting
that becomes a requirement. This is especially the case in a
distributed system like the web, where any attempt to tighten the
rules would only be initially supported by a minority of websites.
These websites would be 'outvoted' by the vast majority of websites
that allow the lax behavior and support it, because that's what
happens when the vast majority work and the minority don't.</p>

September 7, 2020 | https://www.dollartrak.com/negotiate-salary-to-achieve-your-financial-goals/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.dollartrak.com/negotiate-salary-to-achieve-your-financial-goals/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>Many people concentrate on saving and investing as a way to achieve their financial goals.  Both of these are easier to grow with a higher income.  No matter what your <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/set-and-achieve-financial-goals/">financial goals</a> are, negotiating a higher salary will make them easier to achieve.</p>



<p>The time you spend researching your fair market value, preparing requests for raises, and making requests for adjustments might very well be the most valuable use of your time.</p>



<p>Considering the importance of salary you would think that people would constantly be on top of their market value ensuring they are compensated fairly.  In my experience this is often not the case.</p>



<h2>Many People are Underpaid and Don’t Even Know it</h2>



<p>Like most people I knew, I never talked about my salary with my friends or co-workers.  It’s taboo for many Americans.  This lack of transparency makes it easy to be underpaid while being unaware of it.  This benefits your employer, but not you!</p>



<p>Once I took on a senior leadership position I begun to understand the severity of differences in how people are compensated for similar positions.  In some cases employees with the same job title were compensated double what others were.</p>



<p>I am sure that most people are aware these inequities exist and might blame them on <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/study-finds-salary-history-bans-boost-pay-for-african-americans-women-11592472602?mod=e2fb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discrimination</a>, differences in quality of work, education or level of education.  In my experience a lack of salary negotiation and keeping their salary up to date is the main driver. </p>



<p>Negotiating your salary can be uncomfortable, and asking for raises can be even more so.  This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it though!  Many will shy away from it and those that do not will end up making much more money over time to do the same job.</p>



<h2>Increases in Salary Compound Over Your Career</h2>



<p>As people get further along in their careers these differences can grow to nearly overwhelming numbers.  Employees can literally make over double what others make for the same job.  This is because of the compounding nature of raises on your salary over the course of your career.</p>



<p>Raises are generally given on a percentage basis of your current salary.  What this means is every single time you get a raise you are also getting a raise on all of your previous raises.  This adds up the same way compound interest adds up.  Over time the numbers can get large and with a 40 year long career for many there can be a lot of time for this to happen.</p>



<h2>Examples of Compounding Salary</h2>



<p>Lets look at a few simple scenarios over a 20 year job with a company.  The first scenario shows the affect of negotiating a higher starting salary and the second one shows the affect of negotiating occasional large raises.</p>



<h3>Affect of Negotiating a Higher Starting Salary</h3>



<p>Jack and Jill both were offered the same job, but Jill negotiated a very modest 10% higher salary than Jack.  They both did well and received 3% raises over the course of 20 years working for the company.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>Base</td><td>Year 5</td><td>Year 10</td><td>Year 15</td><td>Year 20</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Jack</td><td>$45000</td><td>$52,167</td><td>$60,476</td><td>$70,108</td><td>$81,275</td><td>$1.29M</td></tr><tr><td>Jill</td><td>$50,000</td><td>$57,963</td><td>$67,195</td><td>$77,898</td><td>$90,305</td><td>$1.43M</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>3% annual raises over 20 years</figcaption></figure>



<p>The $5,000 starting difference turns into a little over $9,000 a year difference over 20 years.  This resulted in Jill making an extra $140,000 over the course of her job with this company.</p>



<h3>Affects of Negotiating Larger Raises</h3>



<p>Here we will modify the above table to show Jill negotiating a 10% raise for herself every 5 years while Jack happily accepts the standard 3%.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>Base</td><td>Year 5</td><td>Year 10</td><td>Year 15</td><td>Year 20</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Jack</td><td>$45000</td><td>$52,167</td><td>$60,476</td><td>$70,108</td><td>$81,275</td><td>$1.29M</td></tr><tr><td>Jill</td><td>$50,000</td><td>$61,903</td><td>$76,640</td><td>$94,884</td><td>$117,473</td><td>$1.63M</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>3% annual raises over 20 years, Jill get’s 10% every 5 years</figcaption></figure>



<p>After 20 years with a salary of $81,275 jack would need a whopping 45% raise just to catch up to Jill and still would be behind by $340,000 in lifetime earnings!</p>



<h2>How do I Keep My Salary Up to Date</h2>



<h3>Know Your Fair Market Value</h3>



<p>This always starts with knowing what your fair market value is.  There are several websites that can help here.  I like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.glassdoor.com/" target="_blank">Glassdoor</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.salary.com/" target="_blank">Salary.com</a>.  Do a little research and come up with a range that you feel is reasonable.  </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="548" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image.png?resize=640%2C548&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image.png?resize=640%2C548&amp;ssl=1" alt="salary chart" data-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image.png?w=731&amp;ssl=1 731w, https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image.png?resize=300%2C257&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Taken from salary.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>You should be honest with yourself about your skills and experience, but I recommend starting at the high end of the range and working down from there.  If someone else can make $100,000 a year doing your job, why not you?</p>



<h3>Getting Your Salary Right to Start</h3>



<p>In my experience the majority of people will accept the first salary offer given.  This is generally a mistake.  Why would a hiring manager make you his absolute top dollar offer to start?  He is generally wise to leave a little room for negotiation for the candidates that do counteroffer.  Some candidates will want to counteroffer no matter what you offer them first!</p>



<p>Once you accept a lower salary it is VERY difficult to get it corrected.  You may have some success here at smaller companies but with larger companies and their bureaucracy don’t get your hopes up.  In my experience the best way to fix this is to find a new job.  You can avoid it by knowing your market value and negotiating a proper base to start.</p>



<h3>Constantly Update Skills</h3>



<p>The job market is always changing.  You need to keep up with it and try to stay out in front of it to maximize your earning potential.  Whatever field you are in set annual goals to achieve certifications, complete continuing education, learn a new tool or attend a conference.  </p>



<p>While one of these things by itself may not change your career, the culmination of annual self improvement over 5 to 10 years can make a massive difference in your marketability.  Senior level employees with relevant certifications and experience can be worth many times what an entry level employee is.</p>



<h3>Take Advantage of Your Time at Work</h3>



<p>You are going to be there for 8 hours a day so you might as well make the most of it.  Always seek out new projects that allow you to learn and develop your skills.  Ask about company paid training, certification or tuition.  Look for ways to add value above and beyond normal for your task.</p>



<p>Most employers will provide you with the tools, money or time to improve your skills because it directly benefits them.  If they won’t help you out here, you may want to re-consider if working there is good for your long term success.</p>



<h3>Write Down Accomplishments as They Happen</h3>



<p>Many companies do a once per year salary adjustment.  Isn’t it basically impossible to remember what all you did when walking into this conversation?</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="426" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist.jpg?resize=640%2C426&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist.jpg?resize=640%2C426&amp;ssl=1" alt="checklist" data-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1022&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1363&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist-scaled.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist-scaled.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w" data-sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Keep a running list of your accomplishments</figcaption></figure>



<p>The best way to remember it all is to write it down as it happens.  Keep a running log of your accomplishments. Write them all down and come into the annual review process armed with the information you need.</p>



<h3>Frequently Update Your Fair Market Value</h3>



<p>Your fair market value is likely always changing.  Make sure to check the websites and understand if you are compensated fairly on a regular basis.  Always do this before an annual review.  </p>



<p>If the market has shifted for your skill set, or a new skill you learned is valuable, make sure your employer knows!  This is the time to ask for a larger than standard raise.  That new certification you acquired could be a great reason to go after a 5 or 10% raise this year.</p>



<h2>Asking for an Adjustment When You are Underpaid</h2>



<p>If you want to stick it out with your company, but found that you were underpaid you will need to ask for an adjustment to market value.  I find that the request should have the following basic supporting documentation:</p>



<ol><li>Report’s on salary range for your job from multiple sources.  If you are underpaid, show them multiple sources that validate this.  The more you can find the better.</li><li>Detail any recent skills you have developed or certifications that you have obtained. </li><li>List of recent accomplishments at work that show you have gone above and beyond.  You have been keeping the list like I recommend above right?</li></ol>



<p>I have asked for larger raises(&gt;10%) multiple times in my career and always gotten what I wanted by using the above method.  I have also been asked for raises by quite a few employees over the years.  Those with accompanying documentation like above were taken much more seriously.</p>



<h2>Leave If Your Employer Doesn’t Value You Correctly</h2>



<p>Some employers will never pay you fair market value.  This could be because they don’t value you fairly or because they don’t need the skills you have.  They may also just not have the money in the budget for someone of your skill level.  </p>



<p>Don’t let their decisions hold you back.  If they won’t pay you fairly then be prepared to get up and leave.  If you have been updating your skills regularly as I mentioned above you may find that moving to a better position is surprisingly easy.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I hope this has shed a little light onto the importance of salary negotiations when being hired and frequently during the course of your career.  If you ignore these conversations because they can be uncomfortable you will pay dearly for it over the long term.  </p>



<p>Ultimately, your <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/2020/06/09/net-worth-explained/">net worth</a> can be dramatically reduced and result in you having to work for many extra years in order to meet your <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/set-and-achieve-financial-goals/">financial goals</a>.  You should take charge of this part of your career before you look back and wish you had.</p>

<![CDATA[Git/serve: A Git server for Plan 9]]>
            </title>
            <description>

September 7, 2020 | https://orib.dev/gitserve.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://orib.dev/gitserve.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">


<p>A while ago, I released <a href="https://orib.dev/git9.html">git9</a>, a git client for
Plan 9. However, it always felt like it was missing something: A git server.
over a few weekends of work, I sat down and put one together. This Labor
Day weekend, I took the opportunity to labor on it, and got something working.</p>

<h3>usage</h3>

<p><code>Git/serve</code> is a git server designed to fit into the Plan
9 ecosystem, allowing hosting of, and interacting with, code on a Plan 9
server, while still allowing legacy clients running on Unix to get a copy
of the code.</p>

<p><code>Git/serve</code> only speaks the <code>git://</code> protocol.
But because it runs behind
<a href="http://man.9front.org/8/listen">aux/listen</a>
and 
<a href="http://man.9front.org/8/tlssrv"><code>tlssrv</code></a>, we
effectively get two additional protocols for free: <code>gits://</code>, or
TLS-encrypted <code>git://</code>, and <code>hjgit://</code>, which is
<code>git://</code> but with Plan 9 authentication to support user login
over TLS. Unfortunately, only the unencrypted <code>git://</code> protocol
is supported out of the box by upstream git. There may be ways to solve
this, using <a href="https://rovaughn.github.io/2015-2-9.html">custom
transports</a>, and a unix port of tlsclient</p>

<p>To start a <code>git://</code> server, just run it under aux/listen1.
To enable encryption and user authentication, run it under
<code>tlssrv -a</code>. This doesn't need a certificate, because
the Plan 9 authentication generates the secret used for TLS. And,
finally, if you just want encryption, you can use <code>tlsclient</code>
with a certificate.</p>

<pre># git:// server, serving every repository under the current directory
% aux/listen1 'tcp!*!9418' git/serve -r `{pwd}

# gits:// server, doing the same: But with encryption.
% aux/listen1 'tcp!*!9418' tlsclient -c /path/to/cert.pem git/serve -r `{pwd}

# hjgit:// server doing the same: Requires account on server to connect
% aux/listen1 'tcp!*!9418' tlsclient -a git/serve -r `{pwd}
</pre>

<p>If you want to allow people to write, you can just add the
<code>-w</code> flag to git/serve. While you can do this on
any of the protocols, keep in mind that only <code>hjgit://</code>
authenticates the users. Push to the world, but don't let the
world push to you!</p>



<p>All the protocols git uses are closely related. The <code>ssh://</code>
protocol is just the <code>git://</code> protocol, with the command selected
sightly differently. The smart <code>http://</code> protocols are the same
as the <code>git://</code> protocol, with a different handshake, and split
over multiple post requests.</p>

<p>Git9 implements the git protocol in under 500 lines of C. The
full code is available on github, in
<a href="https://github.com/oridb/git9/blob/1770b8f94bb1d97fdeb6f7db293ed36da9751826/serve.c">serve.c</a>.
</p>

<p>The protocol look something like this for pushing:</p>

<pre>&lt;=w= 0030:	"git-fetch-pack /oridb/git9\0host=github.com\n"
=r=&gt; 0086:	"747e9e80f710c0b8bbd928080745915ad2493322 HEAD\n"
=r=&gt; 009d:	"747e9e80f710c0b8bbd928080745915ad2493322 refs/heads/master\n"
&lt;=w= 0076:	"747e9e80f710c0b8bbd928080745915ad2493322 dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1 refs/heads/master\0report-status\n"
&lt;=w= 0000
&lt;=w= <pack-data>
=r=&gt; 000e:	unpack ok
=r=&gt; 0019:	ok refs/heads/master
</pack-data></pre>

<p>And this for pulling:</p>

<pre>&lt;=w= 0030:	"git-upload-pack /oridb/git9\0host=github.com\n"
=r=&gt; 013b:	"dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1 HEAD\n"
=r=&gt; 003f:	"dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1 refs/heads/master\n"
=r=&gt; 0000
&lt;=w= 0032:	"want 5d761590cfdce23e4b17e94050b0776c8804d4a1\n"
&lt;=w= 0032:	"want 8f0eb1386a2c748cb7bf26917684479ff8c6d5b5\n"
&lt;=w= 0032:	"want dc4a9d467c6a28dab3927c8611a1bfbc571f1568\n"
&lt;=w= 0000
&lt;=w= 0033:	"have dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1\n"
&lt;=w= 0009:	"done\n"
=r=&gt; 0031:	"ACK dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1\n"
<pack-data>
</pack-data></pre>

<p>The git protocol consists of pkt-lines, which are strings with a
hex-formatted length prefix.  The length prefix includes itself.  So,
the string <code>"hi"</code> would be formatted as
<code>0006hi</code>. A zero lenth packet where the length prefix
is not included is special. This is called a 'flush packet', and
is used to terminate a phase of negotiation.</p>

<p> All negotiation is with these packet lines, at
which git flips over to pure binary mode to transfer a pack file
over.</p>

<p>In the <code>git://</code> protocol, the client always starts off
by saying which action it wants to do: Either it wants the server to
fetch a pack from the client, or it wants the server to upload a pack
to the client.  That's this line:</p><pre>&lt;=w= 0030:	"git-fetch-pack /oridb/git9\0host=github.com\n"
</pre>

<p>The upload side of this protocol is simpler on the server side so
we'll go through it first.</p>

<h3>pushing</h3>

<p>In the upload protocol, the server begins by sending a list of
references that the client may update. In <code>git/serve</code>
we grab all the refs in the repository, and filter down to just
the ones beginning with <code>heads/</code>.</p>

<pre>	if((nrefs = listrefs(&amp;refs, &amp;names)) == -1)
		sysfatal("listrefs: %r");
	for(i = 0; i &lt; nrefs; i++){
		if(strncmp(names[i], "heads/", strlen("heads/")) != 0)
			continue;
		if(fmtpkt(c, "%H refs/%s\n", refs[i], names[i]) == -1)
			goto error;
	}
	if(flushpkt(c) == -1)
		goto error;
</pre>

<p>With the first phase of the protocol, the client then
sends the list of references it wants to update. This
takes the form of:</p>

<pre>	OLDHASH NEWHASH heads/refs/updateme\n"
</pre>

<p>Because the client knows what the reference versions are on
the server, it can compute what commits are between the version
on the server and the version that it has. If the new hash
is the zero hash, this signals to the server that the reference
should be deleted. This list of updates is terminated with a
flush packet. The code in git9 that handles this is below:

</p><pre>	while(1){
		/* Did we get a packet? */
		if((n = readpkt(c, pkt, sizeof(pkt))) == -1)
			goto error;
		/* Was it a flush packet? */
		if(n == 0)
			break;
		/* Split it up into the 3 parts: old, new, reference */
		if(getfields(pkt, sp, nelem(sp), 1, " \t\n\r") != 3){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR  protocol garble %s\n", pkt);
			goto error;
		}
		/* verify that these are valid hashes */
		if(hparse(&amp;old, sp[0]) == -1){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR bad old hash %s\n", sp[0]);
			goto error;
		}
		if(hparse(&amp;new, sp[1]) == -1){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR bad new hash %s\n", sp[1]);
			goto error;
		}
		/* and valid refs */
		if(!validref(sp[2])){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR invalid ref %s\n", sp[2]);
			goto error;
		}
		/* and then remember them for when we do the update */
		*cur = erealloc(*cur, (*nupd + 1)*sizeof(Hash));
		*upd = erealloc(*upd, (*nupd + 1)*sizeof(Hash));
		*ref = erealloc(*ref, (*nupd + 1)*sizeof(Hash));
		(*cur)[*nupd] = old;
		(*upd)[*nupd] = new;
		(*ref)[*nupd] = estrdup(sp[2]);
		*nupd += 1;
	}
</pre>

<p>Next, the client uploads the pack. This is a blob containing
the commit data. It goes into <code>.git/objects/packs/recv-$pid.pack</code>,
at least until we can index it and rename it.</p>

<pre>	while(1){
		n = read(c-&gt;rfd, buf, sizeof(buf));
		if(n == 0)
			break;
		if(n == -1 || write(pfd, buf, n) != n)
			return -1;
		packsz += n;
	}
	if(checkhash(pfd, packsz, &amp;h) == -1){
		dprint(1, "hash mismatch\n");
		goto error1;
	}
	if(indexpack(packtmp, idxtmp, h) == -1){
		dprint(1, "indexing failed\n");
		goto error1;
	}
	if(rename(packtmp, idxtmp, h) == -1){
		dprint(1, "rename failed: %r\n");
		goto error2;
	}
</pre>

<p>Finally, we update the references. Note that we haven't
locked the repository yet. This is because none of the data
we have here can conflict: All objects are addressed by hash,
so a race would simply leave us with a duplicate hash in the
packfile. Eventually, a <code>git/repack</code> will clean
that up.</p>

<p>However, updating the references can conflict. So,
for updating the references, we acquire a lock file.
We then read all the references, make sure that they
match the old reference, and then write in the new
reference.</p>

<pre>	for(i = 0; i &lt; nupd; i++){
		if(resolveref(&amp;h, ref[i]) == 0 &amp;&amp; !hasheq(&amp;h, &amp;cur[i])){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR old ref changed: %s", ref[i]);
			goto error;
		}
		if((o = readobject(upd[i])) == nil){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR update to nonexistent hash %H", upd[i]);
			goto error;
		}
		if(o-&gt;type != GCommit){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR not commit: %H", upd[i]);
			goto error;
		}
		unref(o);
		if(snprint(refpath, sizeof(refpath), ".git/%s", ref[i]) == sizeof(refpath)){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR ref path too long: %s", ref[i]);
			goto error;
		}
		if((fd = create(refpath, OWRITE, 0644)) == -1){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR open ref: %r");
			goto error;
		}
		if(fprint(fd, "%H", upd[i]) == -1){
			close(fd);
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR upate ref: %r");
			goto error;
		}
		close(fd);
	}
</pre>

<p>And that's pushing.

</p><h3>pulling</h3>

<p>Pulling takes more work on the server side, because the
server needs to compute a reasonable packfile to send to
the client. The protocol itself is still fairly simple.</p>

<p>It begins the same way as pushing, by sending all the
branches that a client may want to obtain from the git
repository.</p>

<pre>=r=&gt; 013b:	"dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1 HEAD\n"
=r=&gt; 003f:	"dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1 refs/heads/master\n"
=r=&gt; 0000
</pre>

<p>The client then starts telling us what commits they want,
and what commits they have. This lets us find a graph difference
between the server and client graph, and generate a pack file
that contains few, if any, extraneous commits. </p>

<pre>&lt;=w= 0032:	"want 5d761590cfdce23e4b17e94050b0776c8804d4a1\n"
&lt;=w= 0032:	"want 8f0eb1386a2c748cb7bf26917684479ff8c6d5b5\n"
&lt;=w= 0032:	"want dc4a9d467c6a28dab3927c8611a1bfbc571f1568\n"
&lt;=w= 0000
&lt;=w= 0033:	"have dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1\n"
&lt;=w= 0009:	"done\n"
=r=&gt; 0031:	"ACK dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1\n"
</pre>

<p>Computing the commits that go into a pack is not always trivial.
The comits that the client may be on may have "bubbles" in the graph,
so simply walking back from the start of the graph to the commits
that the client has may end up walking around the commit, leading
to nearly the whole history of the repository being sent, instead
of just one or two commits.</p>

<p>Consider a repo where the server is ahead of the client, and
now the client is trying to pull the changes. The client has commits
<code>c</code>, and we're trying to compute a pack with only the
commits <code>o</code>.</p>


<pre>                o---o
               /     \
    --c---c---c---c---o---o &lt;-- server
                  ^
                client
</pre>

<p>The client does a git/pull, and sends that it has the
commit marked <code>[c]</code>. Since the server has
every commit the client does, and more, it can look at
all ancestors of the client commit. If we're smart, we
would, but a naive …</p></div>

              <article>
                  

<p>Each year, I try to set a few personal goals that stretch me in some way.</p>

<p>In 2017, for example, I <a href="https://forrestbrazeal.com/2017/12/03/how-to-read-100-books-in-a-year-and-still-have-a-life/">read one hundred books</a>, which turned out to be more a test of endurance than skill.</p>

<p>This year, I decided to see if I could write a fictional short story and get it published somewhere. Though I do a fair amount of technical writing in the course of my work, I’d never seriously attempted to write and sell a short story before, or even taken a creative writing class.</p>

<p>This meant I had no knowledge of the market, no connections, and generally no idea what I was doing.</p>

<p>So, a challenge!</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<p>I decided to focus on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_fiction">speculative fiction genre</a>, partly because it seemed more accessible and mostly because unlike literary journals, the best speculative fiction magazines still pay their authors.</p>

<p>My goals, in descending order of likelihood, were as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Get something published somewhere, even if unpaid</p></li>

<li><p>Get something published and get paid something for it, even a token amount</p></li>

<li><p>Get something published at <a href="https://www.sfwa.org/about/join-us/sfwa-membership-requirements/#short">Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA) professional rates</a> (currently 6 cents a word)</p></li>

<li><p>Get at least 1000 words published at SFWA-qualifying markets (the standard for <a href="https://www.sfwa.org/about/join-us/sfwa-membership-requirements/#associate">SFWA associate member status</a>)</p></li>

<li><p>Get at least three stories published, totaling more than 10,000 words, at SFWA-qualifying professional markets (<a href="https://www.sfwa.org/about/join-us/sfwa-membership-requirements/#active">SFWA Active Member status</a>, my self-imposed standard for a legit “professional” science fiction writer)</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="results-through-nov-8">Results (through Nov. 8)</h2>

<p>After many form rejections on several terrible stories, I sold my <a href="https://dailysciencefiction.com/science-fiction/biotech/forrest-brazeal/memory-foam">first story</a> on March 23rd, 2018, to Daily Science Fiction (an SWFA pro market). At 1010 words, this sale actually crossed the first four goals off my list at once.</p>

<p>However, I continued to write and improve over the spring and summer of 2018, selling several more stories along the way, eventually totaling more than 16,000 words of fiction. Some publications have long wait times, but by the time “Empathy Bee” <a href="http://www.diabolicalplots.com/the-diabolical-plots-year-five-fiction-lineup/">is published</a> in March 2019, I should have the wordcount needed for active SFWA membership status, my most insane stretch goal.</p>

<h3 id="by-the-numbers">By the numbers</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Stories Written: 22</p></li>

<li><p>Total Wordcount: ~60,000, the length of a medium-sized novel</p></li>

<li><p>Total Submissions: 70</p></li>

<li><p>Stories Sold: 8</p></li>

<li><p>SFWA-qualifying professional sales: 6</p></li>

<li><p>Rejections: 50 (15 personal)</p></li>

<li><p>Withdrawals: 2</p></li>

<li><p>Still Pending: 10</p></li>

<li><p>Other Results: <a href="https://www.writersofthefuture.com/writers-of-the-future-3rd-quarter-standings-for-year-35/">Honorable Mention, Writers of the Future</a></p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h2>

<h3 id="have-no-ego">Have no ego</h3>

<p>It turns out writing short stories that sell is really, really hard. It’s hard to think of good ideas, it’s hard to write them down in a form that anyone would want to read, and it’s even harder when those readers are magazine editors who get literally hundreds of unsolicited submissions every month. Don’t attempt it if you have an easily bruised sense of self-worth, or you will be depressed a lot.</p>

<p>I’m grateful to have sold some stories this year, but my identity is not tied up in “being a writer”. It can’t be, because I have to…</p>

<h3 id="embrace-failure">Embrace failure</h3>

<p>I learned to view rejections as a badge of honor, which is a helpful mental trick to keep from going insane after a few dozen forms. As I told Jason Bougger in an <a href="http://www.themeofabsence.com/2018/11/author-interview-forrest-brazeal/">author interview</a> over at Theme of Absence, rejections are like the good soreness you feel after working out – it means you’re growing.</p>

<h3 id="keep-your-feedback-loop-short">Keep your feedback loop short</h3>

<p>Early on, when I was getting form rejections from big magazines with no accompanying feedback, I got really frustrated because I knew my work was obviously not up to par – I just didn’t know why. A submission to a smaller publication, Abyss and Apex (who I later ended up selling a different story to!) brought back a personalized rejection with a helpful piece of advice: try signing up for the <a href="https://sff.onlinewritingworkshop.com/">Online Writing Workshop</a>.</p>

<p>At the time I had never heard of writers’ workshops and didn’t really understand why they would be helpful. But I paid a few dollars and signed up. The other writers there provided generous feedback on how to improve my work, and I learned just as much from critiquing their pieces. The OWW membership more than paid for itself when several readers pointed out an obvious plot hole in my story “Empathy Bee”, which subsequently sold in revised form to Diabolical Plots.</p>

<p>Later, once I had professional credits, I was able to join the wonderful <a href="http://www.codexwriters.com/">Codex</a> writers’ community, which has hugely expanded my horizons and understanding of the industry. The more I write, the less I trust myself to be a good judge of my work’s quality, and the more I seek out and appreciate feedback from others.</p>

<h3 id="write-smart-not-just-hard">Write smart, not just hard</h3>

<p>Some writers recommend keeping insane writing regimens, cranking out thousands of words a day, saying it’s the only way to improve. And I wrote a fair amount this year. But stepping back and getting feedback on my work was just as important.</p>

<p>I had a music teacher who used to ask: “Did you practice ten hours, or just the same hour ten times?” When I took time to evaluate my work and deliberately build on it, I improved faster than just by vomiting words indiscriminately onto the page.</p>

<h3 id="keep-reading-good-prose">Keep reading good prose</h3>

<p>No, I didn’t read a hundred books again this year. But I did try to keep my ear filled with good prose. For example, this summer I got on a southern realist kick: Flannery O’Connor, Eudora Welty, Carson McCullers. Studying how those writers crafted characters and situations helped me nail down a couple of southern-set stories that ended up selling. My science fiction writing improved more from reading good writers, period, than from reading science fiction.</p>

<h3 id="just-because-you-wrote-something-good-enough-to-get-published-somewhere-that-doesn-t-mean-the-next-thing-you-write-won-t-be-terrible">Just because you wrote something good enough to get published somewhere, that doesn’t mean the next thing you write won’t be terrible</h3>

<p>This sounds stupid in hindsight, but for a long time I had it in my head that once I sold a story, I’d have figured out what it took to get published, and I wouldn’t have any trouble after that. Instead, I still get tons of rejections, and often my writing seems just as lifeless and terrible to me as it did before I sold my first story.</p>

<p>The good news is that with practice, the overall trend appears to be upward. At least, when I look back at my work from the beginning of the year, I can’t believe how bad it is. So I must be improving, right?</p>

<h2 id="what-s-next">What’s next?</h2>

<p>Like many people who start out in the short fiction game, I would love to publish a novel. So I think that might be a 2019 goal. But I’m sure I’ll continue to write short stories, too. There’s real satisfaction in creating something that you can hold in your head all at once, knowing how it will turn out and why it’s effective.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <div>
        <p>When I first started programming, especially when asked for code
samples, my comments lacked purpose and would often duplicate in
English what the code clearly indicated. I knew that "commenting is
good" but as a beginner I had no further insight.</p>
<p>Over time with the help of books like Clean Code, I grew disdainful of
comments. Good code should be self-documenting. Whenever I needed to
write a comment to explain something, I'd realize I could easily
rename some key variable or function. I grew more comfortable with
variables and functions with a few words in the title. Better to spend
time on good code structure and naming.</p>
<p>
  I have always left TODOs though, since TODOs can't so easily be
  expressed in variable names. But even these TODOs concerned me
  because they existed in my issue tracker, or maybe should have.
</p><p>As I watched mature open source projects and mature engineers, I came
to value well-documented pull requests. Solid pull requests include or
link to all necessary background, opportunities failed or ignored, how
to use, links to external bugs requiring workarounds and the results
of performance evaluation.</p>
<p>Beyond pull request descriptions, when I really wanted to grease a
pull request I'd use the pull request UI to add comments calling
reviewer attention to key changes in lines of the diff.</p>
<p>Both kinds of guidance are a massive aid to reviewers, saving a lot of
time.</p>
<p>But when I'd find a bug in code -- and I knew there was good pull
request documentation, even for pull requests as recent as six months
ago -- I've been repeatedly failed by the pull request and <em>pull
request comment</em> search exposed by Github and Gitlab.</p>
<p>I <em>knew</em> there were links to documented oddities or bug reports in
pull request threads. But practically speaking, for historic pull
requests, pull request comments are useless.</p>
<p>This is the single biggest reason I've started to push for more
comments in code. More so than all other tools (issue tracker, code
management system, etc.) comments in code have the greatest chance of
still being around and <em>easily searchable</em> if they haven't been
deleted.</p>
<p>
  Don't get me started on pull request documentation in an external
  medium like Slack. It's so rewarding to get or give instant feedback
  on changes on instant messengers, but good luck finding that
  discussion 3 months later.
</p><p>Every time I have to call out a line of code in a pull request, that's
immediate cause for that code to be modified with comments.</p>
<p>Maybe I wouldn't do this if Github/Gitlab exposed a Google Docs-like
interface for browsing code line by line with links to all pull
request comment threads.</p>
<p>Please reply on Twitter with questions or comments.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The biggest reason to add comments in code (often linking to documented oddities or bug reports) is because it's impossible to search pull request threads historically in every source control management UI I've used.<a href="https://t.co/JlHWfbUH5z">https://t.co/JlHWfbUH5z</a></p>— Phil Eaton (@phil_eaton) <a href="https://twitter.com/phil_eaton/status/1303130504993136642?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 8, 2020</a></blockquote>

I'm your host Lukas Biewald. Jeremy Howard created the Fast.ai course, which is maybe the most popular course to learn machine learning and there are a lot out there. He's also the author of the book Deep Learning for Coders with Fast.ai and PyTorch and in that process, he made the Fast.ai library which lots of people use independently to write deep learning. Before that, he was the CEO and co-founder of Enlitic, an exciting startup that applies deep learning to health care applications. And before that, he was the president of Kaggle, one of the most exciting earliest machine learning companies. I'm super excited to talk to him. So Jeremy, it's nice to talk to you. And in preparing the questions, I realized that every time I've talked to you there have been a few gems that I've remembered that I would never think to ask about. Like one time you told me about how you learned Chinese and another time you gave me Dad parenting advice, very specific advice and it's been actually super helpful. </p><p><strong>Jeremy: </strong>Oh great. Tell me what Dad parenting advice worked out?</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>Well, what you told me was when you change diapers, use a blow dryer to change a really frustrating experience to a really joyful experience and it's like such good advice. I don't know how you.. I guess I can imagine how you thought of it, but it's...</p><p><strong>Jeremy: </strong>Yeah, yeah, I know they love the whooshing sound, they love the warmth. I'm kind of obsessed about Dad things. So I'm always happy to talk about Dad things. That is this podcast.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>Can we start with that? Now that my daughter is eight months old. Do you have any suggestions for her?</p><p><strong>Jeremy: </strong>Oh my goodness! Eight months old. You know, it's like the same with any kind of learning. It's all about consistency. So I think that the main thing we did right with Claire was just, you know, this delightful child now is we were just super consistent. Like if we said you can't have X unless you do Y, we would never give her X if she didn't do Y. If you want to take your scooter down to the bottom of the road, you have to carry it back up again. We read this great book that was saying if you're not consistent, it becomes like this thing, it's like a gambler. It's like sometimes you get the thing you want, so you just have to keep trying so that's my number one piece of advice. It's the same with teaching machine learning. We always tell people that tenacity is the most important thing for students. To stick with it, do it every day.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>I guess just in the spirit of questions, I'm genuinely curious about, you know, you've built this amazing framework and teaching thing that I think is maybe the most popular and most appreciated framework. I was wondering if you could start by telling me the story of what inspired you to do that and what was the journey to making Fast.ai, the curriculum and Fast.ai, the ML framework.</p><p><strong>Jeremy: </strong>So it was something that my wife Rachel and I started together. Rachel has a math PhD, super technical background, early data scientist and engineer, Uber. I don't. I have just scraped by a philosophy undergrad and have no technical background. But from both of our different directions, we both had this frustration that neural networks in 2012 were super important, clearly going to change the world, but super inaccessible and so we would go to meetups and try to figure out like how do we... Like I knew the basic idea, I'd coded neural networks 20 years ago, but how do you make them really good? There wasn't any open source software at the time for running on GPUs. You know, Dan Seresen's thing was available, but you had to pay for it. There was no source code and we just thought, oh, we've got to change this, because the history of technology leaps has been that it generally increases inequality because the people with resources can access the new technology and then that leads to societal upheaval and a lot of unhappiness. So we thought, well, we should just do what we can. So we thought how are we going to fix this? Basically the goal was, and still is, to be able to use deep learning without requiring any code so that, you know, because the vast majority of the world can't code, we kind of thought, well, to get there, we should, first of all, see what exists right now? Learn how to use it as best as we can ourselves, teach people how to best use it as we can and then make it better, which requires doing research and then turning that into software and then changing the course to teach the hopefully slightly easier version and repeat that again and again for a few years. And so we're kind of in that process.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>That's so interesting. Do you worry that the stuff you're teaching, you're sort of trying to make it obsolete, right? Because you're trying to build higher level abstractions? Like I think one of the things that people really appreciate your course is that it's really clear, in-depth explanations of how these things work. Do you think that that's eventually going to be not necessary or how do you think about that?</p><p><strong>Jeremy: </strong>Yeah, to some extent. I mean, so if you look at the new book and the new course, chapter one starts with really, really foundational stuff around what is a machine learning algorithm? What do we mean to learn an algorithm? What's the difference between traditional programming and machine learning to solve the same problem? And those kinds of basic foundations I think will always be useful, even at the point you're not using any code. I feel like even right now, if somebody is using like PlatformAI or some kind of code-free framework, you still need to understand these basics of an algorithm can only learn based on the data you provide. It's generally not going to be able to extrapolate to patterns it's not seen yet, stuff like that. Um, but yeah, I mean, we have so far released two new courses every year, you know, a part one and part two every year because every year, it's totally out of date. And we always say to our students at the start of part one, Look, you know, none of the details you're learning are going to be of any use in a year or two's time. There's a time when we're doing Piano and then TensorFlow and Keras, and then playing PyTorch. We always say, look, don't worry too much about the software we're using because none of it's still any good, you know, it's goal changing rapidly, you know, faster than JavaScript frameworks, but the concepts are important and yeah, you can pick up a new library and I don't know by weekend, I …</p></div></div>

<p>What are Walmart Sponsored Products and where do they come into play? Walmart allows advertisers to easily advertise on their platforms with this feature being a really lucrative option for them. We’ll discuss what it entails, how they work and the different ad formats that can be selected for the different types of campaigns you’re choosing to run.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s begin!&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>What are Walmart Sponsored Products?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Walmart Sponsored Products are also called Performance Ads, and they are also known as <a href="https://jungletopp.com/walmart-ad-costs/">cost-per-click ads</a> that can appear on the Walmart Marketplace. They are able to appear within search results, category pages, and product pages on Walmart’s app, mobile site, and desktop site.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When utilizing these types of ads, they are able to increase your visibility by allowing you to reach and engage shoppers at all stages of their shopping journey. The ads appear on the first page of search results too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If anything, you’re not only advertising your products, but you’re also helping consumers find and purchase products in a much easier and convenient manner. Plus, the advertiser will only have to pay when the shopper clicks on the ad. It’s quite the win-win situation!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>How Do <strong>Walmart Sponsored Products</strong> Work?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>So, how are these sponsored products selected for exposure to your customers? They are actually based on a combination of relevancy and bid. They also rely on the following two factors.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Products being advertised must win the buy box&nbsp;</li><li>Products being advertised must be in stock&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>These cool ads are designed to help you do the following too.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Boost product sales&nbsp;</li><li>Increase share of wallet&nbsp;</li><li>Uncover new customers&nbsp;</li><li>Grow or protect market share&nbsp;</li><li>Maximize profitable SKUs&nbsp;</li><li>Improve brand and product visibility&nbsp;</li><li>Launch new products or brand extensions&nbsp;</li><li>Present your products to a massive audience already ready to purchase&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Which benefit are you to achieve in your <a href="https://jungletopp.com/walmart-search-advertising/">advertising campaign</a>? We’d love to know your thoughts and your mission to execute your own products to potential customers.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Types of Walmart Sponsored Products</strong></h2>



<p>With all of the great <a href="https://jungletopp.com/walmart-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">capabilities</a> this type of advertising has to offer, there are also different formats in the way they can be executed. This is perfect for those who are interested in various campaign ideas and need a mix of how to present their product launches.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These are all of the following ways Walmart Sponsored Products may be used on the online platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Search In-Grid: </em>&nbsp;</strong>Did you know that one in four online Walmart purchases begin with a search? This type of ad allows for your product to get the premium placement on the first page of search results.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Brand Amplifier: </em></strong>This type of ad really helps to provide brand recognition and showcase your product portfolio. The logo, custom headline and up to three of the SKUs appear at the top of relevant search results.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Product Carousel: </em></strong>&nbsp;The product appears on search, category and item pages as relevant alternate purchase options. This is an ad that appears as more of a disguise and it gives the customer options.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Buy Box: </em></strong>&nbsp;This ad will have your products appear at the most relevant alternate purchase option on product detail pages.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Two Different Campaign Types</strong></h2>



<p>When looking at how to set up the overall campaigns, there are two different methods that Walmart offers to advertisers. Look at the following to see what will work best for your current needs in product/brand awareness. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Automatic: </em></strong>This is a method in the way a campaign runs where the advertiser doesn’t have to monitor as heavily as if it were manual. It’s set to serve all customers searching for products like yours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This specific type of campaign is perfect for brands that are new to the advertising field. They hope to widen their existing customer base or are launching a product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These are a few of its features that advertisers look for when running their campaign.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Easy setup&nbsp;</li><li>No keyword management&nbsp;</li><li>High impression volume&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Manual: </em></strong>On the other hand, manual advertising is set to serve to customers based on their select keyword choice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is an ideal situation for brands who have products with a long history on Walmart or brands that already know the successful keywords in their customer use.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>These are a few of its features that advertisers look for when running their campaign.</p>



<ul><li>Access to Walmart’s Keyword Analytics tool</li><li>Select your own keywords&nbsp;</li><li>Full campaign control&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>



<p>Do you think that Walmart Sponsored Products are right for you?&nbsp;Contact a <a href="https://jungletopp.com/walmart-ads-agency/">Walmart ads agency</a> to talk about launching your ad campaigns.</p>



<p>We find that with the combination of different ways to execute the ads as well as having Walmart being a powerhouse for a variety of products, it’s always going to be desirable to a large number of consumers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Plus, with the different bidding keywords and use of CPC, advertisers will have much more financial freedom. They’ll also be able to measure their results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let us know your final thoughts to this method of advertising and if you have or are considering this method for your own campaign.</p>

<p>“If you can’t code, what do you do?” I often get this question when I say I went to a hackathon. The simple answer is twofold: partner with developers to make sure you’re getting the right stuff done; and surround great code with a concise and compelling business story. There are other ways to go about it, but in general you have to be enormously flexible and wear many hats with various levels of comfort.</p>
<p>At the Sudo Hackathon, I had the pleasure of working with a genuinely incredible team. The prompt was: “How can virtual reality be utilised in health and infrastructure?” Our team worked on a healthcare tool for macular dystrophy&nbsp;<strong>–</strong> the number one cause of vision loss in people over 50.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, our team created four key deliverables:</p>
<ul>
<li>A retinal-mapping game using Google Cardboard</li>
<li>An algorithm to quickly and precisely define patient blind spot borders</li>
<li>A real-Time video morphing visualization</li>
<li>A 5-minute pitch presentation including business case</li>
</ul>
<p>We were able to track down an eye surgeon and prepare patient-focused and physician-focused questions. The information informed our MVP (minimum viable product), then we just needed the facts to back up our story. For example, sight loss is a 28 billion GBP market in the UK alone. The NHS also had an upcoming grant our product would be eligible for, an incredibly desirable path for extending our runway without diluting our equity.</p>
<p>Up until the last minute we were building, refining, adding, and editing. Our team had that contagious feeling of great code being stitched together. To quote one of my teammates: “This code is magic.” With only one previous run-through, we went in front of the judges, and we WON!</p>
<p>It was a great feeling for everyone on the team to leave the hackathon in equal parts excited and exhausted. Lots of gratitude to Allia for hosting this Serious Impact Challenge Weekend in partnership with the European Union’s European Regional Development Fund. It was an amazing event, and I highly encourage people to check out their <a href="https://www.sudochallenge.com/">next event</a> in Agritech this April.</p>

    <p>It takes roughly 2 weeks to form a habit; it takes roughly two weeks to get comfortable in a new environment. A common mistake is to treat a new report’s first couple weeks like college orientation - social, light hearted, get-to-know-you stuff. If your report spends the first two weeks reading C# documentation and having lunch out on the town with the team, guess what, they’ve just normalized that behavior as what the role is.</p>

<p>The answer: start your report doing real work as soon as possible. If they’re a software engineer, they should be committing code week one (ideally day 2 or 3); If they’re a product manager, they should be attending meetings and picking up supporting activities on a similar time frame. Then the tone has been set - working here means getting things done.</p>

<p>This means as manager you need to give your report tractable work in the first week. Managers not being ready for a report to start is the number one reason people end up normalizing underperformance, because they had nothing meaningful to do. If a manager describes a report as not having initiative in the first couple weeks it’s a red flag - it’s the manager’s job to provide new hires with clear paths to contribute immediately.</p>

<p>Another main reason people fall into onboarding traps is because your organization has painfully slow onboarding. Endless HR videos, slow security processes, a mountain of fragile technology setup - these all make for a shitty and counterproductive start at a company. Optimize your onboarding to get people doing what you hired them to do. Look to formalize performance indicators of your onboarding. For example, for engineers this could be time-to-first-commit and time-to-joining-sprints.</p>

<p>This approach holds for managers and executives as well. In that cohort it’s also common and a common red flag for people to spend the first couple weeks putzing around under the guise of “getting to know what’s going on”. Managers and executives should be involved in the decisions of the team from day 1 and developing artifacts - plans, TODO lists, strategy documents - in the first couple weeks. With good managers and executives you see them day 1 adding perspective and insight into conversations, and everyone collectively appreciates that the right person has been hired.</p>

<p>Onboarding is one of the most critical periods in a person’s time at a company. It’s one of the highest ROI periods when managing someone. Take that opportunity to set expectations properly and measure success quantiatively.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div href=""><p><em>Quantum</em> <em>entanglement</em> is, as you know, a phrase that's jam-packed with meaning in physics. But what you might not know is that the linear algebra behind it is quite simple.&nbsp;If you're familiar with singular value decomposition (SVD), then you're 99% there. My goal for this post is to close that 1% gap. In particular, I'd like to explain something called the<em> </em><strong>Schmidt rank</strong> in the hopes of helping the math of entanglement feel a little less... tangly. And to do so, I'll ask that you momentarily forget about the previous sentences. Temporarily ignore the title of this article. Forget we're having a discussion about entanglement. Forget I mentioned that word. And let's start over. Let's just chat math. </p><p>Let's talk about SVD. </p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5b527d2844acede360b8e7ae_hline.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>Singular Value Decomposition</h2><p>SVD is arguably one of the most important, well-known tools in linear algebra. You are likely already very familiar with it, but here's a lightning-fast recap. Every matrix $M$ can be factored as $M=UDV^\dagger$ as shown below, called the <strong>singular value decomposition</strong> of $M$. The entries of the diagonal matrix $D$ are nonnegative numbers called <em>singular values</em>, and the number of them is equal to the rank of $M$, say $k$. What's more, $U$ and $V$ have exactly $k$ columns, called the <em>left and right singular vectors</em>, respectively.</p><figure id="w-node-c5cffac943b5-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f5562528e82aa6ab6d78ae1_open.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>There are different ways to think about this, depending on which applications you have in mind. I like to think of singular vectors as encoding meaningful "concepts" inherent to $M$, and of singular values as indicating how important those concepts are. For instance, this perspective arises naturally in a study of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10531">learning dynamics of deep neural networks</a>. As another example, you can imagine a matrix whose rows are indexed by people, and whose columns are indexed by movies.&nbsp;The $ij$th entry could be a 0 or 1, indicating whether or not person $i$ has watched movie $j$. In an applied setting—a recommender system, for instance—one may wish to compute a <em>truncated SVD </em>of this matrix. Here, only the top largest singular values are kept. The rest are viewed as containing little information and are set to zero. In this way, the diagonal matrix $D$&nbsp;operates on a low-dimensional "feature space," which provides a nice way to <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/recommendation/collaborative/basics">compress and glean information about the data</a>.</p><p>Either way, I like to think of $D$ as providing a bridge between two worlds: information about the columns of $U$ (e.g. people) and information about the columns of $V$ (e.g. movies). Below is a very <em>non</em>-mathematical cartoon of this. You can imagine the thickness of the blue bridge relates to the number of singular values. Lots of singular values?&nbsp;The bridge is wide and lots of information passes through. Only a few singular values?&nbsp;The bridge is narrow and not much information gets through.</p><figure id="w-node-fc7a2c3b2624-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f55643d546e4a903f261c30_bridge2.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>An actual mathematical picture is found in a <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/matrices-as-tensor-network-diagrams">tensor network diagram</a> representation of SVD.&nbsp;There, $D$&nbsp;really is a bridge! As a visual cue, we might draw the edges adjacent to the blue node as very thick if the number of singular values is large, and draw them to be thin otherwise. This again represents the idea of information "flowing" between systems described by $U$ and $V$.</p><figure id="w-node-235ea1f864dc-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f5564d7d7916c43e6f8c4ce_TN2.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Alternatively still, if you enjoy thinking of <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/matrices-probability-graphs">matrices as bipartite graphs</a>, then you might have in mind the graphs below. If we have lots of blue nodes—i.e. lots of singular values—then there are lots of pathways between the pink and green nodes (i.e. people and movies). But if we have only a <em>few</em> blue nodes—i.e. a few singular values—then there are fewer pathways between pink and green.</p><figure id="w-node-9ef538caa942-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f577be8bc99498290bfcb81_graph2.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Either way we wish to visualize it, the role of the singular values—that is, the role of the diagonal matrix $D$—is key. Intuitively, they indicate the amount of "interaction" between the information stored by $U$ and $V$, and they mediate how those interactions contribute to the information represented by the original matrix $M$.</p><p><em>And this precisely idea behind the mathematics of entanglement</em>.</p><p>In the context of physics, one simply applies SVD to a particular matrix and then looks at the number of nonzero singular values of that matrix. This is the main idea behind something called the <em>Schmidt rank</em> of a quantum state (explained below), which is an integer that indicates how much entanglement is present. </p><blockquote>Entanglement is measured by the number of nonsingular values of a particular matrix. </blockquote><p>So what makes a physicist's application of SVD different from that of, say, someone building a movie recommender system?&nbsp;Well, in physics, your matrix $M$ presumably encodes information about a physical system and takes spatial considerations into account (ex. particles in a lattice). Its entries may also contain complex numbers, and the sum of their squares should satisfy $\sum_{ij}|M_{ij}|^2=1$. In this case—as I'll explain below—$M$ represents a <strong>quantum state</strong>. But lingo aside, the template is much the same: singular values convey important information about how two things—whether users and movies, or two quantum subsystems—are related.</p><p>I could stop here, but I'd like to dig a little deeper. In the next section, let me restate this punchline using slightly more specialized language.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5b527d2844acede360b8e7ae_hline.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>Singular Values vs. Schmidt&nbsp;Rank</h2><p>To start, let's back up a bit. In a discussion of physics, what exactly is the matrix to which we apply SVD?&nbsp;In the opening example, we applied SVD to a user-by-movie matrix. But what's going on now?</p><p>Rather than starting with a matrix, we instead start with a <em>unit vector</em>. To that end, suppose $\psi$ is any unit vector in a <strong>tensor product</strong> of vector spaces $\mathbb{C}^n\otimes\mathbb{C}^m$. Here, it's important that our discussion takes place in a tensor product. After all, entanglement is defined <em>between two things</em> (So, if someone were to ask you, "How much entanglement is there?" one proper response would be, "Entanglement <em>between</em> <em>what</em>?"), and in quantum mechanics, the tensor product is the mathematical operation used to combine two systems. Now, if the phrase "tensor product" is unfamiliar to you, I recommend the article "<a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/the-tensor-product-demystified">The Tensor Product, Demystified</a>." I&nbsp;think you'll be pleasantly surprised at how easy the concept is!</p><p>Alright, now that we have the vector $\psi$, it's easy to get a linear map $\mathbb{C}^m\to\mathbb{C}^n$ from it. Simply reshape the entries of $\psi$ into an $n\times m$ matrix $M$. (Said more formally, look at $\psi$&nbsp;under the isomorphism $A\otimes B^*\cong\text{hom}(B,A)$ for finite-dimensional vector spaces $A$&nbsp;and $B$.)</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f5517185b36106928a313a9_reshape.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>In the language of physics, $\psi$ is called a <strong>quantum state</strong>, and $M$&nbsp;is simply the matrix associated with it. More generally, the terms&nbsp;"unit vector" and "quantum state" are synonymous. That's because the squares of the entries of any unit vector define a probability distribution, and—in the context of physics—that probability distribution tells you about the <em>state</em> of the system you're studying. (This is the Born rule.)</p><p>But I&nbsp;digress. Let's get back to SVD.</p><p>Suppose the singular value decomposition of our matrix $M$ is given by $UDV^\dagger$. Here I'm using the dagger to denote the conjugate transpose of $V$ since we're allowing $M$ to have complex entries. Now I'd like to use this decomposition&nbsp;to rewrite $M$ in a slightly messier way. Let $\mathbf{u}_i$ and $\mathbf{v}_i$ denote the $i$th columns of $U$ and $V$, respectively, and let $d_i$ denote the $i$th singular value of $M$. Then we can expand the matrix $M$ as the following sum, where $k$&nbsp;is the rank of $M$. </p><figure id="w-node-dc0fefa9bd0b-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f556da578cb1b3bbc952fdd_expand2.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>We're almost at the punchline, but let me first introduce a definition and then make one final cosmetic change.</p><p>For any two vectors $\mathbf{u}$&nbsp;and $\mathbf{v}$, the matrix $\mathbf{uv}^\dagger$ is called their <strong>outer product</strong>. This simple operation is also denoted with a tensor product symbol $\mathbf{u}\otimes \mathbf{v}$ or in physicists' bra-ket notation by $|u\rangle\langle v|$. So for example, if $\mathbf{u}=\begin{bmatrix}1&amp;2&amp;3\end{bmatrix}^\top$ and $\mathbf{v}=\begin{bmatrix}4&amp;5\end{bmatrix}^\top$, then their outer product is the following little matrix.</p><figure id="w-node-c2af2f15f3fb-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f551c63f2d18fc4ccbcb28b_outer.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Why introduce this?&nbsp;Let's think back that expansion of $M$&nbsp;above. Under the correspondence $\mathbf{uv}^\dagger \leftrightarrow \mathbf{u}\otimes \mathbf{v}$, we can write $\psi$&nbsp;explicitly using the columns of $U$ and $V$, weighted by the singular values of $M$ like this:</p><figure id="w-node-3ff996165bf0-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f556f9788b112261c051ef6_decomp0.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>At this point, you might think we haven't done much (and we haven't, really), <em>and yet</em> familiar things are now given <em>new names</em>. In the context of physics, the above decomposition of $\psi$ is called its <strong>Schmidt decomposition</strong>. The integer $k$, which is the rank of the original matrix $M$, is called its <strong>Schmidt rank</strong>. And the singular values $d_1,d_2,\ldots, d_k$ are called its <strong>Schmidt coefficients.</strong></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f556fb589f1f866fb28a990_decomp1.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Although terminology is new, the ingredients aren't. And that's the punchline.</p><blockquote>Punchline: the quantum state $\psi$ is said to be <strong>entangled</strong> if its Schmidt rank&nbsp;(i.e. number of singular values) is strictly greater than 1, and is <strong>not entangled</strong> otherwise.</blockquote><p>So, do you see the connection with our discussion above? As we stressed earlier, singular values can be thought of as providing a "bridge" between two subsystems. They are a measure of how much interaction exists between them. In the context of physics, this interaction is understood as entanglement.</p><p>The upshot is that a large number of singular values—i.e. a high Schmidt rank or a "wide bridge"—corresponds to lots of communication between two subsystems. A small number of singular values—i.e. a low Schmidt rank or a "narrow bridge"—corresponds to little communication. At the lowest extreme, <em>one</em> singular value corresponds to <em>zero</em> entanglement, and we might as well omit the thin bridge in the image below.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f559310bc99491aa62d994a_zero1.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Indeed, notice that if the Schmidt rank of $\psi$ is equal to <em>one</em>—that is, if $M$&nbsp;is a rank one matrix $M=\mathbf{uv}^\dagger$—then we can write $\psi=\mathbf{u\otimes v}$. In the mathematics literature, vectors of this form (i.e. a tensor product of vectors) are sometimes called <strong>simple tensors</strong>.&nbsp;For this reason, some mathematicians associate entanglement with "linear combinations of …</p></div></div>

September 7, 2020 | http://subpixel.space/entries/open-transclude/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://subpixel.space/entries/open-transclude/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>tl;dr: If you follow this blog you’ve seen me experiment with iframe-based citations; this post is about open-sourcing that tooling. <a href="#tutorial-start" target="_self">Skip</a> to demo, implementation tutorial, and GitHub link.</p>

<hr>

<p>Knowledge tooling is happily becoming a hot topic again. With this trend is coming revived interest in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu">Xanadu</a>, bi-directional hyperlinking, knowledge databases, visualizing knowledge graphs, and so on. At this moment, I see most of the emphasis being put on tooling for the research side, with Notion, Workflowy, and the new and hyped Roam Research leading the way.</p>

<p><img src="http://subpixel.space/uploads/xanadu-shot.png" alt="Screenshot of the OpenXanadu prototpye"></p>

<p>Where I see less focus is the <em>writing</em> part of the knowledge production process, where older apps like Scrivener are still the thing to beat. And almost nobody at all is working on the reader’s experience. As a blogger who largely caters to a wide audience, I’m especially interested in these areas.</p>

<p>Written information is largely still presented as a single document, and writing tools are geared toward the production of long pages. But before I say what’s wrong with this, let me sing the praises of documents for a moment.</p>

<p>People often get carried away when they discover the original vision of hypertext, which involves a network of documents, portions of which are “transcluded” (included via hypertext) into one another. The implication is that readers could follow any reference and see the source material—and granted, this would be transformative. However, there’s a limit to the effectiveness of the knowledge network as a reading experience. “Hypertext books,” online books which are made up of an abundance of interlinked HTML pages, are mostly unpopular. The failure of this experiment is, in my opinion, very revealing.</p>

<p><img src="http://subpixel.space/uploads/sprawlingplaces-shot.jpg" alt="Screenshot of tinderbox map of hypertext book Sprawling Places by David Kolb">
<span>Tinderbox map of a portion of David Kolb’s hypertext book Sprawling Places</span></p>

<p>Knowledge is not an accumulation of facts, nor is it even a set of facts and their relations. Facts are only rendered meaningful within narratives, and the single-page document is a format very conducive to narrative structure. The hypertext books that have gained popularity (I’m thinking here of <a href="http://meaningness.com/">Meaningness.com</a>) have largely conformed to this in two ways: 1) there is an intended reading order, and 2) the longer essays within the project do most of the heavy lifting in terms of imparting the author’s perspective to readers.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the notion of the “document” that is intrinsic to web development today is overdetermined by the legacy of print media. The web document is a static, <em>finished</em> artifact that does not bring in dynamic data. This is strange because it lives on a medium that is alive, networked, and dynamic, a medium which we increasingly understand more as a <em>space</em> than a thing.</p>

<p>For example, consider how silly it is to include MLA-style citations at the bottom of a text when we have the vast capabilities of linked documents on the web. Why should the reader have to read every citation or trust that an author is not taking a citation out of context, when hyperlinks are available?</p>

<p>This all suggests that a compromise must be struck between the coherence of a text and the new opportunities for knowledge work afforded by the fundamental capabilities of the medium: the internet’s connectivity, the screen’s frame rate.</p>

<hr>

<p>My own blogging is one context in which I’ve seen this tension play out, and have been working to explore ways of making my texts richer. A lot of the ideas I talk about in various pieces of writing are connected to one another. When I publish an essay, I’m not done with it. The ideas live on and get renewed, reused, and recycled in later works. Some sentences contain definitions that are core to my mental models, and there are whole paragraphs that might be useful out of context. I’m building my knowledge network in mind maps and behind various SaaS APIs, but how can I publicly show my thinking to be part a cohesive worldview?</p>

<p>Normally people solve this by simply block quoting themselves, but this is a waste of an opportunity. The indented block quote is a print medium invention <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_quotation#Origins">almost as old as typesetting</a>. The block quote is <em>plaintext</em>, it is not actually linked to the original text or its context.</p>

<p>I’ve been experimenting with one idea for a solution, and if you’ve read the last couple blog posts you’ll have seen it there. My stab at an answer is an iframe which shows the quote within its original context and gives a hint at its surroundings. Effectively, it’s a transclusion within my own blog. I’m currently satisfied with what I have as a v1, and am interested to see if others find it useful, so I’m open sourcing it here and including a tutorial.</p>



<p>Open Transclude is a UX pattern, a spec for networked writing within your own blog. Here’s how it looks:</p>



<!-- <script src="/portal.js"></script> -->



<p>What you are looking at is an scroll-locked iframe that links to a quote I picked out of my blog post “Notes on Comparative Psychology.” You can use Open Transclude anywhere you can drop an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag on your own site.</p>

<p>Open Transclude:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Works anywhere on your own domain</li>
  <li>Compatible with most static site generators / templating engines</li>
  <li>12 lines of HTML, 80 lines of SCSS, 22 lines of JS (4.5 kb total)</li>
  <li>Has 0 dependencies&nbsp;— this is native web technology</li>
</ul>

<p>Open Transclude is extremely simple, and the heaviest part of the code is the CSS, which you can simplify at your whim. That’s why I am referring to it as a UX pattern. This is not a protocol. The code is really a commodity. What’s interesting about it is the idea and the design, and this is just one viable implementation! Feel free to adapt it however you like.</p>

<p>The principal improvement over a block quotation is <em>sense of context</em>.</p>

<p>Over on GitHub you’ll find the <a href="https://github.com/tobyshorin/Open-Transclude/">reference implementation for Jekyll</a>. Below is a tutorial for implementing it yourself, by way of also explaining some of the technical design decisions.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="implementation-recipe">Implementation Recipe</h2>

<p>Here’s what you need to do to get Open Transclude up and running.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create an anchor tag in the blog post where you want to cite yourself.</li>
  <li>Create the HTML for the reusable transclusion component.</li>
  <li>Call the portal into any document and passing it Jekyll variables.</li>
  <li>A small piece of Javascript which populates your transclusion into the document.</li>
  <li>Create the SCSS file with the component’s styles.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="1-create-the-anchor-tag-where-you-want-to-cite-yourself">1. <strong>Create the anchor tag where you want to cite yourself</strong></h3>

<p>To quote yourself, you’ll need to create an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> anchor tag in the markdown file for the post you want to quote. If you wish to highlight a specific piece of text, instead create a <code>&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code> around the section you want to quote. Note that this can <em>only be on your own website</em>—it doesn’t work cross domain.</p>

<p>Here’s what it looks like for the example iframe above.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="markdown">It will, for one thing, become newly conscious of itself, and, to the degree that it is, <span>**it will tend to undermine its own experiential integrity**</span>" (emphasis mine).

<span>&lt;span</span> <span>name=</span><span>"mainstream-magic"</span><span>&gt;</span>Ironically, psychology remains one of the closest things we have to a mainstream magic or a mystical art today. Not only is it plainly the direct descendent of medieval magic, as I learned when I read Ioan Coulianou's <span>*Eros and Magic in the Renaissance*</span> earlier this year. <span>**It is a theory of the self that is phenomenologically accurate, objectively wrong, and is based on magical thinking even as it deconstructs itself**</span>.<span>&lt;/span&gt;</span> Some magical thinking processes that happen in psychotherapy, such as <span>[</span><span>transference to the psychologist</span><span>](</span><span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transference#Transference_and_countertransference_during_psychotherapy</span><span>)</span>, are even intended to stay unmentioned to the patient in order to be utilized most effectively by the therapist!</code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="2-create-your-iframe-component">2. Create your iframe component</h3>

<p>This is most useful as a standardized component which can be used across the site, so we are going to take advantage of Jekyll’s templating features. Jekyll and other static site generators like Kirby and Zola support HTML “partials” or “includes” so that you can create reusable components.</p>

<p>In your <code>/_scss</code> or <code>/_sass</code> folder make a new file, <code>portal.scss</code>. I called it “portal” because it’s shorter than “transclusion” and less prone to spelling errors.</p>

<p>Here’s our component:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"portal-container"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"portal-head"</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"portal-backlink"</span> <span>&gt;</span>
            <span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"portal-title"</span><span>&gt;</span>From <span>&lt;span</span> <span>class=</span><span>"portal-text-title"</span><span>&gt;</span>{{ include.title }}<span>&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>

        <span>&lt;!-- We'll use Javascript to populate the iframe right here --&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>    
<span>&lt;/div&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You’ll notice immediately that the iframe isn’t there yet. Like I mentioned above, we’re going to be populating it with Javascript.</p>

<p>You’ll also see that in various places we’re using <code>{{ include.___}}</code>. A cool thing about Jekyll includes its that it’s possible to define variables and pass them to our include, so we can create reusable components across our site. Dave Rupert has a <a href="https://daverupert.com/2017/07/jekyll-includes-are-cool/">nice blog post about this</a> called if you want to see more advanced examples!</p>

<h3 id="3-calling-the-component">3. Calling the component</h3>

<p>Anytime you want to pull this component into a blog post, all you have to do is <code>include</code> it in the markdown of another blog post, like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="html">  {% include portal.html title="Notes On Comparative Psychology" link="/entries/notes-on-comparative-psychology/#mainstream-magic" anchor="emotional-deficit" %} </code></pre></figure>

<p>When you include it, you’ll need to pass in those three variables - title, link, and anchor, that fill in the includes above. If you’re following along now and making a build in Jekyll, you’ll see an empty, unstyled component with the link. So good so far!</p>

<h3 id="4-populating-with-javascript">4. Populating with Javascript</h3>

<p>This is a good time to address why we need Javascript. Web developers reading this are probably asking why we don’t simply put the full <code>/link#with-anchor</code> into the iframe src and be done with it. …</p></div></div>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Doom Eternal is the successor of Doom 2016. It’s developed using the 7th iteration of id Tech, id Software’s in-house game engine. Doom 2016 has inspired me greatly on a technologic level due to its simplicity and elegance while still having a high visual quality. For Doom Eternal, this is no different. Doom Eternal has improved in many areas of which a few are worth investigating which I will try to cover in this frame breakdown.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>This frame breakdown is inspired by <a href="http://www.adriancourreges.com/blog/2016/09/09/doom-2016-graphics-study/">Adrian Courreges’s study on Doom 2016</a>. I believe these graphics studies give a lot of insight into how certain rendering problems are solved in a AAA game and are greatly educational. In this breakdown I aim to stay at a high level and not go too in-depth of each rendering technique/pass. Some passes might not be covered here because they are very similar to Doom 2016 and are well covered in Adrian Courreges’s study.</p>

<p>I do want to stress here that these studies are absolutely nothing more than <strong>educational</strong>. I do not in any way support the reverse engineering for malicious purposes and stealing intellectual property. If you haven’t played the game yet, don’t worry about spoilers! The section I used for this study is in the beginning of the game which doesn’t give away any of the details.</p>

<p>Now, let’s get down to business.</p>

<p>With Id Tech 7, the engine has moved away from OpenGL and is entirely built with a <strong>Vulkan</strong> backend allowing them to make better use of current generation GPU features, bindless resources in particular.</p>

<hr>



<p><img src="https://www.simoncoenen.com/images/blog/010_doom_eternal_study/image2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We’re looking at a section in the game close to the start. It’s an interior with a few enemies and a large portion of volumetric lighting. Just like its predecessor, Doom Eternal is using a <strong>forward rendering</strong> pipeline. Doom 2016 was mostly forward rendered with a thin G-Buffer for screen space reflections. However this time, everything is fully forward rendered omitting the G-Buffer.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="step-away-from-mega-texture">Step away from Mega-Texture</h2>

<p>With id Tech 5 used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_(video_game)">Rage</a>, there was a texture streaming concept introduced called ‘Mega-Texture’ which was also used in the previous Doom installment. This system works by rendering a so called ‘feedback texture’ each frame that contains the information of what texture data was visible, that texture is analysed next frame to determine which textures get streamed in from disk. This has an obvious flaw because once a texture is on screen, it’s basically already too late to load it and this causes blurry textures the first few frames it is on screen. In id Tech 7, id Software has stepped away from this approach.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="gpu-skinning">GPU Skinning</h2>

<p>The first thing that happens even before anything gets drawn to a texture, is evaluating skinning. This is commonly done in a vertex shader before shading. An alternative approach used here, is to do skinning beforehand in a compute shader which writes out skinned vertices to a buffer. This has a couple of advantages mainly not having to do skinning in the vertex shader for every geometry pass. This results in having less shader permutations because the vertex shader doesn’t have to know about skinning.</p>

<p>Skinning in a compute shader is not much different from in a vertex shader except that the output gets written to an intermediate buffer which can then be consumed in a vertex shader that can treat it as a regular static mesh. Just like in a vertex shader, for each vertex, a compute shader thread retrieves the transform of each bone affecting the vertex, transforms its position with each bone transform and adds up these positions based on the skin weights stored on the vertex.</p>

<p>János Turánszki wrote a wonderful write-up of how it can be implemented using a compute shader:
<a href="https://wickedengine.net/2017/09/09/skinning-in-compute-shader/">https://wickedengine.net/2017/09/09/skinning-in-compute-shader/</a>.</p>

<p>Another thing that is worth noting here is the use of <strong>Alembic Caches</strong> in Doom Eternal. These caches contain baked animation which get streamed and decompressed at runtime. As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsmqWSZpgJY">Digital Foundry described in their tech breakdown</a>, this is used for a wide range of animations going from large cinematic pieces to small tentacles on the floor. This is especially useful for animations that are hard to achieve using skinned animation like organics and cloth simulation. You can compare an Alembic Cache with a video that can be played back and is highly compressed by looking ahead. I suggest watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlz-7V_XiUA">Axel Gneiting’s talk at Siggraph 2014</a> if you’re interested in learning more.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="shadow-mapping">Shadow Mapping</h2>

<p>Next up is shadow rendering. There doesn’t seem to be any large changes in how shadow maps are approached in id Tech 7 compared to its predecessor.</p>

<p>As seen below, shadows get rendered in a large 4096x8196px 24-bit depth texture which may vary across quality levels. The texture is persistent across frames and as described in “Devil is in the Details” at Siggraph 2016, the static geometry in the shadow map is cached to save having to redraw the shadow maps each frame. The technique is fairly simple: as long as nothing in the view of the light moves, there is no need to update the shadows. If a dynamic object in the frustum moves, a ‘cached’ shadow map is copied into the actual shadow map and the dynamic geometry is re-drawn on top. This cached shadow map is the same shadow map but only with static geometry because you can make the assumption that these will never change. This saves having to draw the entire scene in the frustum every time it needs to update. Of course, when the light moves, the entire scene has to be redrawn from scratch.</p>

<p>When sampling the shadow map during lighting, a 3x3 PCF sampling approach is used to smoothen the shadow edges. For the sun light, <strong>cascaded shadow maps</strong> are used to distribute the quality better as it covers such a large portion of the environment.</p>

<p>Here is a closer look at the shadow atlas. A light with higher importance, larger screen area or that is closer to the camera, will get a larger portion of the atlas assigned for better resolution. These heuristics are evaluated dynamically.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.simoncoenen.com/images/blog/010_doom_eternal_study/image3.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="depth-pre-pass-and-velocity">Depth Pre-pass and Velocity</h2>

<p>Opaque geometry gets rendered to a depth-only target starting with the player’s gun, then static geometry, and finally dynamic geometry. A depth pre-pass is common to avoid unnecessary pixel shader calculations later down the pipeline where geometry overlaps. A depth pre-pass is especially important in a forward renderer where redundant pixel calculations are extremely wasteful due to pixel overdraw. With a depth pre-pass, the actual forward lighting pixel shader can reject pixels by comparing with the depth buffer before execution, saving a lot of performance.</p>

</p></div>

<p>Besides rendering depth, the pre-pass also renders to another color target. For dynamic geometry, the velocity is rendered using motion vectors which is the position of the current position subtracted from the position of the pixel in the previous frame. We only need the motion on the X and Y axis so the motion is stored in the red and green channel of a 16-bit floating point render target. This information is later used in post processing for applying motion blur and reprojection for temporal anti-aliasing. The image below is exaggerated because this snapshot doesn’t have a lot of motion. Static geometry does not need motion vectors as their motion can be derived from the camera motion because they have only “moved” relative to the camera.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="hierarchical-z-depth">Hierarchical-Z Depth</h2>

<p>Next up, a hierarchical mip chain of the depth buffer is generated which is similar to a mip map but instead of averaging 4 neighboring pixels, the maximum is taken. This is commonly done in graphics for various purposes like accelerating screen space reflections and occlusion culling. In this case, this mip chain is used to accelerate the light and decal culling which is covered later. More recently, mip generation is done in a single pass by writing into multiple mips at once. In Doom Eternal, it still traditionally does a dispatch for every mip separately.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.simoncoenen.com/images/blog/010_doom_eternal_study/image7.gif" alt=""></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="mesh-decals">Mesh Decals</h2>

<p>Up until what I’ve covered so far, there haven’t been many noticeable changes compared to Doom 2016. However, “mesh decals” is an addition to the mesh rendering pipeline introduced in Doom Eternal. Unlike the common decal workflow - which are placed freely in the environment - a mesh decal is placed during the mesh authoring pipeline by artists and so belong to the mesh. Before, Doom heavily relied on decals and stepped it up with the addition of so called “mesh decals” in this game for even better detailing and flexibility. “Mesh decals” are small decals like bolts, grills, bumps, stickers, … Just like a traditional decal, it can modify any property of the underlying surface like the normal, roughness, base color, …</p>

<p>To achieve this, the following geometry pass renders each of the decals’s ID into an 8-bit render target. Later during shading, this texture is sampled to retrieve the ID which is used to retrieve a projection matrix bound with each draw call. The matrix projects the pixel’s position from world space into texture space. These coordinates are then used to sample the decal and blend with the underlying material. This is extremely fast and allows artists to go crazy with massive amounts of decals. Because the IDs are rendered to an 8-bit texture, the maximum amount of decals per mesh would theoretically be 255.</p>

<p>One requirement for this, is that all decals are bound to the pipeline when drawing meshes. Doom Eternal uses a fully bindless render pipeline which allows them to bind all decal textures at once and dynamically index them in the shader. More on this bindless pipeline later as this is important to pull off other tricks they’ve done in this game.</p>

<p>Below, the mesh decal texture. The different IDs are coloured to visualize it better.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Doom Eternal is the successor of Doom 2016. It’s developed using the 7th iteration of id Tech, id Software’s in-house game engine. Doom 2016 has inspired me greatly on a technologic level due to its simplicity and elegance while still having a high visual quality. For Doom Eternal, this is no different. Doom Eternal has improved in many areas of which a few are worth investigating which I will try to cover in this frame breakdown.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>This frame breakdown is inspired by <a href="http://www.adriancourreges.com/blog/2016/09/09/doom-2016-graphics-study/">Adrian Courreges’s study on Doom 2016</a>. I believe these graphics studies give a lot of insight into how certain rendering problems are solved in a AAA game and are greatly educational. In this breakdown I aim to stay at a high level and not go too in-depth of each rendering technique/pass. Some passes might not be covered here because they are very similar to Doom 2016 and are well covered in Adrian Courreges’s study.</p>

<p>I do want to stress here that these studies are absolutely nothing more than <strong>educational</strong>. I do not in any way support the reverse engineering for malicious purposes and stealing intellectual property. If you haven’t played the game yet, don’t worry about spoilers! The section I used for this study is in the beginning of the game which doesn’t give away any of the details.</p>

<p>Now, let’s get down to business.</p>

<p>With Id Tech 7, the engine has moved away from OpenGL and is entirely built with a <strong>Vulkan</strong> backend allowing them to make better use of current generation GPU features, bindless resources in particular.</p>

<hr>



<p><img src="https://simoncoenen.com/images/blog/010_doom_eternal_study/image2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We’re looking at a section in the game close to the start. It’s an interior with a few enemies and a large portion of volumetric lighting. Just like its predecessor, Doom Eternal is using a <strong>forward rendering</strong> pipeline. Doom 2016 was mostly forward rendered with a thin G-Buffer for screen space reflections. However this time, everything is fully forward rendered omitting the G-Buffer.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="step-away-from-mega-texture">Step away from Mega-Texture</h2>

<p>With id Tech 5 used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_(video_game)">Rage</a>, there was a texture streaming concept introduced called ‘Mega-Texture’ which was also used in the previous Doom installment. This system works by rendering a so called ‘feedback texture’ each frame that contains the information of what texture data was visible, that texture is analysed next frame to determine which textures get streamed in from disk. This has an obvious flaw because once a texture is on screen, it’s basically already too late to load it and this causes blurry textures the first few frames it is on screen. In id Tech 7, id Software has stepped away from this approach.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="gpu-skinning">GPU Skinning</h2>

<p>The first thing that happens even before anything gets drawn to a texture, is evaluating skinning. This is commonly done in a vertex shader before shading. An alternative approach used here, is to do skinning beforehand in a compute shader which writes out skinned vertices to a buffer. This has a couple of advantages mainly not having to do skinning in the vertex shader for every geometry pass. This results in having less shader permutations because the vertex shader doesn’t have to know about skinning.</p>

<p>Skinning in a compute shader is not much different from in a vertex shader except that the output gets written to an intermediate buffer which can then be consumed in a vertex shader that can treat it as a regular static mesh. Just like in a vertex shader, for each vertex, a compute shader thread retrieves the transform of each bone affecting the vertex, transforms its position with each bone transform and adds up these positions based on the skin weights stored on the vertex.</p>

<p>János Turánszki wrote a wonderful write-up of how it can be implemented using a compute shader:
<a href="https://wickedengine.net/2017/09/09/skinning-in-compute-shader/">https://wickedengine.net/2017/09/09/skinning-in-compute-shader/</a>.</p>

<p>Another thing that is worth noting here is the use of <strong>Alembic Caches</strong> in Doom Eternal. These caches contain baked animation which get streamed and decompressed at runtime. As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsmqWSZpgJY">Digital Foundry described in their tech breakdown</a>, this is used for a wide range of animations going from large cinematic pieces to small tentacles on the floor. This is especially useful for animations that are hard to achieve using skinned animation like organics and cloth simulation. You can compare an Alembic Cache with a video that can be played back and is highly compressed by looking ahead. I suggest watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlz-7V_XiUA">Axel Gneiting’s talk at Siggraph 2014</a> if you’re interested in learning more.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="shadow-mapping">Shadow Mapping</h2>

<p>Next up is shadow rendering. There doesn’t seem to be any large changes in how shadow maps are approached in id Tech 7 compared to its predecessor.</p>

<p>As seen below, shadows get rendered in a large 4096x8196px 24-bit depth texture which may vary across quality levels. The texture is persistent across frames and as described in “Devil is in the Details” at Siggraph 2016, the static geometry in the shadow map is cached to save having to redraw the shadow maps each frame. The technique is fairly simple: as long as nothing in the view of the light moves, there is no need to update the shadows. If a dynamic object in the frustum moves, a ‘cached’ shadow map is copied into the actual shadow map and the dynamic geometry is re-drawn on top. This cached shadow map is the same shadow map but only with static geometry because you can make the assumption that these will never change. This saves having to draw the entire scene in the frustum every time it needs to update. Of course, when the light moves, the entire scene has to be redrawn from scratch.</p>

<p>When sampling the shadow map during lighting, a 3x3 PCF sampling approach is used to smoothen the shadow edges. For the sun light, <strong>cascaded shadow maps</strong> are used to distribute the quality better as it covers such a large portion of the environment.</p>

<p>Here is a closer look at the shadow atlas. A light with higher importance, larger screen area or that is closer to the camera, will get a larger portion of the atlas assigned for better resolution. These heuristics are evaluated dynamically.</p>

<p><img src="https://simoncoenen.com/images/blog/010_doom_eternal_study/image3.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="depth-pre-pass-and-velocity">Depth Pre-pass and Velocity</h2>

<p>Opaque geometry gets rendered to a depth-only target starting with the player’s gun, then static geometry, and finally dynamic geometry. A depth pre-pass is common to avoid unnecessary pixel shader calculations later down the pipeline where geometry overlaps. A depth pre-pass is especially important in a forward renderer where redundant pixel calculations are extremely wasteful due to pixel overdraw. With a depth pre-pass, the actual forward lighting pixel shader can reject pixels by comparing with the depth buffer before execution, saving a lot of performance.</p>

<div id="prepassCarousel" data-ride="carousel">
  <ol>
    <li data-target="#prepassCarousel" data-slide-to="0"></li>
    <li data-target="#prepassCarousel" data-slide-to="1"></li>
    <li data-target="#prepassCarousel" data-slide-to="2"></li>
  </ol>
  <div>
    <div>
      <p><img src="https://simoncoenen.com/images/blog/010_doom_eternal_study/Prepass0.png"></p><p>First person gun</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p><img src="https://simoncoenen.com/images/blog/010_doom_eternal_study/Prepass1.png"></p><p>Static objects</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p><img src="https://simoncoenen.com/images/blog/010_doom_eternal_study/Prepass2.png"></p><p>Dynamic objects</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><a href="#prepassCarousel" role="button" data-slide="prev">
    
    <span>Previous</span>
  </a>
  <a href="#prepassCarousel" role="button" data-slide="next">
    
    <span>Next</span>
  </a>
</p></div>

<p>Besides rendering depth, the pre-pass also renders to another color target. For dynamic geometry, the velocity is rendered using motion vectors which is the position of the current position subtracted from the position of the pixel in the previous frame. We only need the motion on the X and Y axis so the motion is stored in the red and green channel of a 16-bit floating point render target. This information is later used in post processing for applying motion blur and reprojection for temporal anti-aliasing. The image below is exaggerated because this snapshot doesn’t have a lot of motion. Static geometry does not need motion vectors as their motion can be derived from the camera motion because they have only “moved” relative to the camera.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="hierarchical-z-depth">Hierarchical-Z Depth</h2>

<p>Next up, a hierarchical mip chain of the depth buffer is generated which is similar to a mip map but instead of averaging 4 neighboring pixels, the maximum is taken. This is commonly done in graphics for various purposes like accelerating screen space reflections and occlusion culling. In this case, this mip chain is used to accelerate the light and decal culling which is covered later. More recently, mip generation is done in a single pass by writing into multiple mips at once. In Doom Eternal, it still traditionally does a dispatch for every mip separately.</p>

<p><img src="https://simoncoenen.com/images/blog/010_doom_eternal_study/image7.gif" alt=""></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="mesh-decals">Mesh Decals</h2>

<p>Up until what I’ve covered so far, there haven’t been many noticeable changes compared to Doom 2016. However, “mesh decals” is an addition to the mesh rendering pipeline introduced in Doom Eternal. Unlike the common decal workflow - which are placed freely in the environment - a mesh decal is placed during the mesh authoring pipeline by artists and so belong to the mesh. Before, Doom heavily relied on decals and stepped it up with the addition of so called “mesh decals” in this game for even better detailing and flexibility. “Mesh decals” are small decals like bolts, grills, bumps, stickers, … Just like a traditional decal, it can modify any property of the underlying surface like the normal, roughness, base color, …</p>

<p>To achieve this, the following geometry pass renders each of the decals’s ID into an 8-bit render target. Later during shading, this texture is sampled to retrieve the ID which is used to retrieve a projection matrix bound with each draw call. The matrix projects the pixel’s position from world space into texture space. These coordinates are then used to sample the decal and blend with the underlying material. This is extremely fast and allows artists to go crazy with massive amounts of decals. Because the IDs are rendered to an 8-bit texture, the maximum amount of decals per mesh would theoretically be 255.</p>

<p>One requirement for this, is that all decals are bound to the pipeline when drawing meshes. Doom Eternal uses a fully bindless render pipeline which allows them to bind all decal textures at once and dynamically index them in the shader. More on this bindless pipeline later as this is important to pull off other tricks they’ve done in this game.</p>

<p>Below, the mesh decal texture. The different IDs are coloured to visualize it better.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="article" id="scroll" itemprop="articleBody">
                <p>One of the problems most Kubernetes administrators will eventually face is protecting an Ingress from public access. There are a number of ways to do this, including IP whitelisting, TLS authentication, use an internal only service for the ingress controller, and many more.</p>

<p>One of my favorite ways is to use <a href="https://github.com/pusher/oauth2_proxy">oauth2_proxy</a>. I’ve used it a number of times over the years, but there was always a drawback that bothered me - with the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/tree/master/docs/examples/auth/oauth-external-auth">documented setup</a> and other countless examples online, they use a deployment of the oauth2_proxy container per deployment/service/ingress that the user is wanting to protect. Although the resource footprint of oauth2_proxy is small, that is needless waste.</p>

<p>Now, onto some oauth2_proxy details. You can use various different providers, like GitHub, Google, GitLab, LinkedIn, Azure and Facebook. What’s one thing nearly every developer in the world has in common? They almost certainly have a GitHub account, so that’s what I use as a provider normally.  There are some strict rules though around GitHub OAuth2 and redirection:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.callumpember.com/assets/attachments/github-oauth2/github-oauth-redirection-rules.png" alt="GitHub OAuth2 Redirection rules"></p>

<p>What this means is that if you are using oauth2_proxy as-is, you need a separate deployment for each domain you want to secure.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But I want to secure https://prometheus.mydomain.com, https://grafana.mydomain.com and https://alertmanager.mydomain.com. So I need separate deployments of oauth2_proxy for that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Out of the box, sadly yes. But with a slight modification of the deployment, we can use a single oauth2_proxy instance for any domain we want. To do this we do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Attach an nginx sidecar container to the oauth2_proxy deployment. This container will redirect to anything after <code>/redirect/</code> in the request URI.</li>
  <li>Make the oauth2_proxy have it’s own domain</li>
  <li>Add an upstream to oauth2_proxy for the /redirect path</li>
  <li>Set the cookie domain in oauth2_proxy to include all subdomains</li>
  <li>Setup a GitHub OAuth2 app and point it at the oauth2_proxy domain</li>
  <li>In the ingresses that we want to protect, use the following annotations (replace $DNS_ZONE_INTERNAL with your own domain):</li>
</ul>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>---</span>
<span>nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-url</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>https://oauth2.$DNS_ZONE_INTERNAL/oauth2/auth"</span>
<span>nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-signin</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>https://oauth2.$DNS_ZONE_INTERNAL/oauth2/start?rd=/redirect/$http_host$request_uri"</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="oauth2_proxy-deployment">oauth2_proxy deployment:</h3>

<p>Here is a full, working (at least in my cluster) deployment spec for oauth2_proxy with the nginx sidecar.</p>

<p>If you want to use it, you’d need to replace all the variables. I personally use envsubst in my deployment pipelines for this. The variables that need replacing are <code>$DNS_ZONE_INTERNAL</code> <code>$OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID</code> <code>$OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET</code> and you would want to set your GitHub org.</p>

<h3 id="ingress-example">Ingress example</h3>

<p>Once you’ve got the deployment above working, you can protect an ingress like so (key takeaways are the annotations):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>---</span>

<span>apiVersion</span><span>:</span> <span>extensions/v1beta1</span>
<span>kind</span><span>:</span> <span>Ingress</span>

  <span>annotations</span><span>:</span>
    <span>kubernetes.io/ingress.class</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>nginx-public"</span>
    <span>nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-url</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>https://oauth2.$DNS_ZONE_INTERNAL/oauth2/auth"</span>
    <span>nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-signin</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>https://oauth2.$DNS_ZONE_INTERNAL/oauth2/start?rd=/redirect/$http_host$escaped_request_uri"</span>
<span>spec</span><span>:</span>
  <span>rules</span><span>:</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>host</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>prometheus.$DNS_ZONE_INTERNAL"</span>
    <span>http</span><span>:</span>
      <span>paths</span><span>:</span>
      <span>-</span> <span>path</span><span>:</span> <span>/</span>
        <span>backend</span><span>:</span>
          <span>serviceName</span><span>:</span> <span>prometheus</span>
          <span>servicePort</span><span>:</span> <span>http</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Hopefully this saves you some resources in your cluster and some time creating multiple oauth2_proxy deployments!</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.korny.info/2020-09-01-polyglot-explorer/main_ui_sample.png" alt="Main UI"></p>

<p><em>If you want a quick look at the explorer, you can see <a href="http://polyglot-code-explorer.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/">a simple demo here</a> or <a href="http://polyglot-code-explorer-openmrs.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/">a more complex one here</a>.  There is also a documentation site at  <a href="https://polyglot.korny.info/">https://polyglot.korny.info</a> (currently a work-in-progress).</em></p>

<h2 id="welcome-to-the-polyglot-code-explorer">Welcome to the Polyglot Code Explorer</h2>

<p>The Polyglot Code Explorer is an open-source tool for visualising complex codebases written in multiple programming languages.</p>

<p>In this article I am going to explain its purpose, how you can run it yourself, and what it does.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-it-for">What is it for?</h2>

<p>Fundamentally, I wanted to answer the question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can we visualise large codebases without needing complex language-specific parsers and logic?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Partly I wanted to easily spot toxic code - my colleague <a href="https://erik.doernenburg.com/2013/06/toxicity-reloaded/">Erik Dörnenberg wrote some great articles on Toxic code visualisation</a> and I wanted a way to spot some of these problem areas myself.</p>

<p>But also, I just wanted to be able to explore the code quickly.  I'm a visual thinker, so my main focus is on visualisation - especially when trying to spot patterns in millions of lines of code.</p>

<p>It is far quicker for me to look at a diagram and see some unusual colouring in one area, than to see the same information in a table of numbers.</p>

<h3 id="why-polyglot">Why polyglot?</h3>

<p>Polyglot means "speaking multiple languages" - in this case, it means these tools should work, to some degree, for any text-based programming language.</p>

<p>I've worked in many programming languages over the years, and a lot of them don't have good or easy code quality tools - either they are too new for a community to have built them, or they are from ancient projects where even if such tools exist, getting them up and running is a headache.  And each tool probably produces different metrics in different formats - it's hard to get any sort of big-picture view.</p>

<p>Also many real world systems don't use a single language - often it is better to use specialist languages for different tasks, rather than one general-purpose one.  For example one project might have a UI built in JavaScript and HTML, a microservice built in Kotlin and a platform automation tool build in Rust.</p>

<p>Also I was inspired by reading Adam Tornhill's book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23627482-your-code-as-a-crime-scene">"Your code as a crime scene"</a> - he talks about all the things you can learn from really simple metrics like lines of code, and indentation, and change history.  None of these need a complex language parser - and complex language parsers tend to be touchy and flaky.  Most of my code uses no language parser at all, or just a very simple which can distinguish code from comments.</p>

<p>And finally - supporting all the various languages out there is a lot of work!  Quite a few of the other tools I found linked from Erik's articles, and elsewhere, seem to have parsers for a number of languages - but progress is slow, and often they don't keep up with new languages or language changes.  Staying largely language-agnostic makes it much easier for me to maintain my code, and not have to worry about it stagnating.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-run-the-explorer">How to run the Explorer</h2>

<p>The explorer is actually the front end component of three tightly coupled applications:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.korny.info/2020-09-01-polyglot-explorer/flowchart.png" alt="Tools flowchart"></p>

<ul>
  <li>The Polyglot Code Scanner is a rust application, which scans the source code and produces a JSON data file</li>
  <li>The Polyglot Code Offline Layout tool is a node.js script which adds layout information to the JSON data file</li>
  <li>The Polyglot Code Explorer is a react/D3 web app which provides the user interface for exploring the code</li>
</ul>

<p>The code is open source, you can find it on GitHub:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-scanner">https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-scanner</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-offline-layout">https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-offline-layout</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-explorer">https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-explorer</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>I should add a disclaimer - I am not a rust guru, and I am definitely not a react guru!  This is side project code, not commercial-quality - it may well have bugs, mistakes, ugliness, and it has far less testing than I'd usually expect :)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You may prefer to run these tools from source code - not all the executables have been tested on all platforms! There are some <a href="https://polyglot.korny.info/tools/explorer/howto">more detailed how-to guides on the docs site</a> if you want to build them yourself, or need more details than the brief instructions below.</p>

<h3 id="getting-the-executable-files">Getting the executable files</h3>

<p>Each of the tools is packaged up as an executable file - the Scanner is written in rust, so it's easy to just compile a binary.  The Layout app is a node.js script, I've used <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/pkg">pkg</a> to build a bundled executable.  And the Explorer can be run as a static website, so the packages are a zipped up bundle of all files needed to build the website, which you can run yourself.</p>

<p>If you are on a Mac you will need to strip Apple's quarantine attributes from the binary files to avoid the "app is from an unknown developer" error:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>tar </span>zxf polyglot-code-scanner-vwhatever-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz

<p>The Explorer is not an executable file - it's a zip file containing the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files needed to run the site.  You can run them locally by running a tiny web server yourself using Python - <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server">there are more detailed instructions here</a> or there's a big list of similar servers in other languages <a href="https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255">here</a> - I'll use Python 3 below.</p>

<h3 id="running-them">Running them</h3>

<p>A short sample of running these together might help:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>cd</span> ~/work
<span>$ </span>polyglot_code_scanner <span>--coupling</span> <span>--years</span> 3 <span>-o</span> my_project_1.json ~/src/my_project
<span># this can be slow for big projects, or if you scan back through many years of history</span>
<span># coupling is optional, remove --coupling to speed it up if you don't want it</span>
<span># Check there are no errors and the my_project_1.json file is there</span>

<span>$ </span>polyglot-code-offline-layout <span>-i</span> my_project_1.json <span>-o</span> my_project_2.json
<span># this can be slow for big files</span>

<h2 id="using-the-ui">Using the UI</h2>

<p>The Explorer front end looks somewhat like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.korny.info/2020-09-01-polyglot-explorer/Main_UI.png" alt="Main UI"></p>

<p>There is more about how to use the UI <a href="http://localhost:2222/tools/explorer/ui">on the docs site</a></p>

<p>The centre of the display shows the files in your project - I'm using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_Voronoi_diagram">Weighted Voronoi Diagram</a> which has the big advantage of showing files roughly in proportional to their size.  And by size I'm using lines of code, which is generally much more useful than bytes - especially as research tends to show that high lines of code is correlated with complexity and defects - so just looking for large lines of code is a good starting point for finding problems.</p>

<h3 id="viewing-by-programming-language">Viewing by programming language</h3>

<p><img src="https://blog.korny.info/2020-09-01-polyglot-explorer/vis_language.png" alt="language visualisation"></p>

<p>This view is very simple - it just colours each file by programming language, showing the 10 most common languages.  Mostly useful for getting an overview of what goes where - it's usually easy to spot the front-end vs back-end code by the colours used.  (only 10 languages are shown because beyond that, it's hard to visually see different colours)</p>

<h3 id="lines-of-code">Lines of code</h3>

<p><img src="https://blog.korny.info/2020-09-01-polyglot-explorer/vis_loc.png" alt="lines of code"></p>

<p>This view is simple enough - it uses a scale from blue for tiny files, through to yellow for giant files.</p>

<p>Note that this is not a linear scale - a lot of these use what I call a "Good/Bad/Ugly" scale - blue (0) is good, red (1000) is bad, and yellow (10000 and above) is just ugly.  If I used a linear scale, it'd be harder to distinguish the good/bad files from each other.  (yes, I could use a log scale, but that has it's own problems)</p>

<h3 id="indentation">Indentation</h3>

<p><img src="https://blog.korny.info/2020-09-01-polyglot-explorer/vis_indentation.png" alt="indentation"></p>

<p>This metric is an interesting one. In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPC.2008.13">Hindle, Abram, Michael W. Godfrey, and Richard C. Holt. 2008. ‘Reading Beside the Lines: Indentation as a Proxy for Complexity Metric’</a> they found that indentation is often useful as a way of looking for complexity - which makes common sense; files with a lot of indentation are often files with deeply nested "if" and "case" statements.  You can choose a few sub-visualisations using the drop-down near the top-left - the default shows the standard deviation of indentation, which is often the most useful metric; you can also see the worst indentation in each file, and the "total area" which is useful for showing files which are both large and deeply indented.</p>

<p>Of course this metric can have false positives - heavy indentation might be due to a particular formatting style for long lines, or an actually valid data structure, or other valid reasons.  But it is often surprisingly useful.</p>

<h3 id="age-since-last-change">Age since last change</h3>

<p><img src="https://blog.korny.info/2020-09-01-polyglot-explorer/vis_age.png" alt="age since last change"></p>

<p>This view shows how long it is since each file was changed (from git history) - blue files are recently changed, red files haven't changed in a year, yellow files haven't changed in 4 years.  Note that this is affected by the date selector down the bottom of the page:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.korny.info/2020-09-01-polyglot-explorer/date_selector.png" alt="date selector"></p>

<p>Files that haven't changed at all in the selected date range will show in grey.  You need to select the whole project (drag the left side of the selector to the left of the screen) to see change information across the whole scanned date range.</p>

<p>This is a good/bad/ugly scale again, largely because generally files that haven't changed for a long time are, in my experience, parts of the system that nobody understands or feels safe to touch.</p>

<p>However this is a bit contentious - it depends a lot on the culture of the organisation, and the kind of code - a lot of research in this field shows the flip-side of this, that files that haven't changed for ages are stable. If they had bugs, people would have touched them …</p></article></div></div>

<p>I got this while trying to add my wife (who is not from the USA) to my Google One storage plan. Apparently Google never counted on family members living in different countries.</p>

<p>I see this as a rather embarassing example of Conway’s Law. Our family structure isn’t compatible with the structure of Google’s business, so no family plan for us.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Many of the hard technical skills that make a great manager are testable. You can easily evaluate technical expertise – for example, an engineering manager should demonstrate their ability to produce or at least understand code. Similarly, in-depth discussions will quickly reveal whether someone can clearly and concisely communicate nuanced concepts.</p>

<p>The softer skills of management are more difficult to assess but just as important. Below are a few of the soft skills that I value most highly in managers, some ideas on how to assess them, and common traps.</p>

<h2 id="soft-skill-1-initiative">Soft Skill #1: Initiative</h2>

<p>Managers set the tempo for their teams – if they aren’t actively looking for ways to help the business, they will set an example that being proactive is optional. The sad truth is that once you’re a manager you can survive a long time by simply maintaining existing processes, reacting to personnel issues, or (worse) creating busywork and taking credit. Many managers collect fine paychecks drifting like an inert gas within a broader bureaucratic cloud. To scale a company effectively, managers need to be proactive rather than existing simply to push virtual papers across their desks.</p>

<p>Initiative tends to be pretty obvious when evaluating internal management candidates. For external candidates, I usually ask deep-dive questions about a meaty project from their past. The goal: learn about what they did, their role, and most importantly the “why” behind their decisions, diving into the details of what really went down. A sample prompt: “Tell me about a significant project that you led, and I’ll ask a bunch of questions to dive deeper.” This is usually fun to ask and I expect to learn something new from strong candidates – after all, they know much more than I do about the project they worked on, so if they can’t teach me something that’s a red flag.</p>

<p>Searching for the “why” behind their decisions is a good test for initiative – being able to explain why certain decisions were made indicates that a candidate can think critically about what a project actually needs, rather than just executing on someone else’s plan.</p>

<h2 id="soft-skill-2-emotional-control">Soft Skill #2: Emotional Control</h2>

<p>Management can be stressful, <a href="https://staysaasy.com/scaling/2020/05/07/startup-is-this-normal.html">especially at a high growth startup company</a>. You’re the first point of escalation for all manner of problems: inter- or intra-team conflict, critical last-minute blockers, HR issues, and other corporate delights. You don’t have a safety net to fall back on if a situation gets too heated – you are the safety net.</p>

<p>Managers can’t be emotionally reactive. They need to remain rational even in the face of severe stressors, allowing them to remain unflappable when shit goes down (more calm also comes with experience). Sometimes, the downsides of reacting are minor: if someone says something dumb during a presentation and you visibly scowl, you can cause them to get flustered. Others are much more important: for example, if someone comes into a 1:1 very upset over their compensation, you need to remain calm as it can be disastrous to make promises or comments that could be misconstrued.</p>

<p>This skill is challenging to assess when hiring managers. Unlike in, say, the Marine Corps, it’s frowned upon in the tech industry to throw someone into a stressful situation and assess their emotional control. References are imperfect but can help, and this skillset is one of the reasons that internal manager candidates can be such tempting known quantities.</p>

<p>The very best managers take this a step further and demonstrate durability – the ability to not only exercise control, but to do so repeatedly over months and emerge on the other side energized and positive. High growth companies are challenging, and more significantly, they’re challenging <a href="https://staysaasy.com/scaling/2020/07/29/the-rogue-wave-of-enterprise-saas.html">over a very long time</a> – typically years. People who are a consistent force for optimistic calm are the pillars around which you should build your team.</p>

<h2 id="soft-skill-3-dispassionate-empathy">Soft Skill #3: Dispassionate Empathy</h2>

<p>Managers need dispassionate empathy: the ability to logically breakdown how their teams will react to new situations by viewing things from multiple perspectives – without allowing viewpoints that they’re sympathetic to cloud their judgment. If someone on your team is passed over for a promotion that goes to their teammate, how will they react? If someone gets really tough feedback, how will they handle it? Managers need to be able to assess factors such as incentives and egos as they chart a course for their entire team.</p>

<p>Promotions provide a common example: when you promote someone you’re affirming the behaviors that you will reward (as well as other behaviors that you tolerate…), and everyone else on the team will observe, calculate, and react differently according to their own interpretation. If you promote Alice, will her peer Bob freak out that it was unfair, become apathetic, or work harder? What message will it send to their more junior team member Charlie?</p>

<p>Empathizing with others’ viewpoints dispassionately is surprisingly difficult as there’s little in day-to-day life that prepares you for it. When a friend or family member is in a difficult situation, they’re typically looking for empathy without reservations, and we’re trained as primates to deliver it. Mirroring the emotions of people we’re close to is often a feature, not a bug. Many managers need to fight the urge to over-empathize.</p>

<p>I assess this trait in interviews by asking about challenging situations that occurred on a prior team. Examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tell me about a time that someone asked for something (eg a raise or promotion), and you didn’t give it to them.</li>
  <li>Tell me about a time when a member of your team was in conflict with a member of another team, and you needed to help out.</li>
  <li>Tell me about a time that someone on your team was underperforming.</li>
</ul>

<p>In asking about these scenarios, I’m first looking for the candidate’s ability to articulate the different motivations or incentives involved: do they understand the situation? Did they view it through others’ eyes rather than just their own? I also assess their ability to discuss the situation in a calm way: are they getting emotionally biased?</p>

<p>While emotional life isn’t as cut and dried as a Python script, I find that most great managers can break down situations like an algorithm: look at all of the different incentives and personalities on the team, add a new decision or situation, and guess at what will happen next.</p>

<h2 id="the-soft-skill-trap">The Soft Skill Trap</h2>

<p>Especially for internal candidates for management positions, beware the most common soft skill trap: mistaking a likeable personality for leadership or management aptitude.</p>

<p>It’s easy to misinterpret a gregarious, likeable personality for innate management skill. “Timmy is a ‘people person’ – of course he’ll be able to manage a team!” This is simply not how life works. Timmy might be great as a manager, or he might suck, but in my experience his likeability is unlikely to correlate strongly with the soft skills that matter.</p>

<p>I blame this phenomenon on Hollywood’s stereotypical portrayal of what it means to be a “leader.” Many great managers are gregarious, sociable, and charismatic, but many others are introverted, quiet in group settings, or somewhat socially awkward. I’ve met managers whom I actually somewhat disliked in a social capacity but who were extremely effective at their jobs. However, I have yet to meet a great manager who didn’t take initiative, couldn’t regulate their own emotions, and didn’t understand the incentives that would motivate their team.</p>

<p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/soft_skills/gladiator.jpg" alt="Gladiator">
Good leader overall, but perhaps too much shouting for your average tech company</p>

<p>There’s also a potential element of bias here: does someone seem like they should be in a leadership position just because they’re really confident? Do they feel like they should be in charge because they’re often the loudest voice in the room? These sorts of subjective judgements are also minefields for bias. For a random example, some of the behaviors that say “leader” in American culture scream “jerk” in East Asian culture. I highly recommend assessing management potential according to the dimensions listed above and trying to remove likeability or sociability from your decision calculus.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Great management requires both hard and soft skills. Soft skills are often harder to assess.</li>
  <li>When assessing a manager’s soft skills, look for the following traits: initiative, emotional control, and an ability to understand how others will perceive and react to situations.</li>
  <li>Promoting from within is a great way to remove manager hiring risk.</li>
  <li>Don’t mistake sociability for management skill.</li>
</ul>

<p>Software Engineering (SWE) is among the most desired jobs nowadays. It is a vibrant and dynamic domain that changed the way we do things, and that improved our lifestyle. It has its own peculiarities, though, with holy wars between groups of people who argue which programming language is better, with haters of JavaScript, scripting languages, and dynamically typed languages, with complete assholes as well as some very nice and considerate people (although this is not related only to SWE).</p>
<p>Even with a global pandemic, software engineers’ workstyle changed only a little. There are many benefits to working as a software engineer, as well as there are downsides. But this article is not about the perks and drawbacks—you can find a myriad of posts on that subject.</p>
<p>There are lots of questions and answers online about how to get into one of the FAANG (facebook, amazon, apple, netflix, google) companies. This article is my experience and some recommendations.</p>
<h2 id="briefly-about-me">Briefly About Me</h2>
<p>I am a Full Stack Software Engineer with 10+ years of experience and a keen interest (and 8+ years of experience) in Data Visualization. I am a freelancer on <a href="https://toptal.com/">Toptal</a>, and currently, I work for PepsiCo.</p>
<p>My main stack is Python/Django [REST] on the backend, JavaScript/TypeScript, and all major JS frameworks on the frontend. There are many more things. If you are interested, this is my <a href="https://www.toptal.com/resume/iulian-gulea">online</a> resume.</p>
<h2 id="the-beginning-of-search">The Beginning Of Search</h2>
<p>Generally speaking, switching jobs requires effort. You must not only prepare for the interviews but also spend time on operational stuff like searching for companies to apply, adjusting your CV, etc.</p>
<p>In Jun 2019, while I had a nice job at a NY-based startup, but I planned to move with my family to the United States. And the easiest way to do that was to apply to some companies that provide an H1B visa. Due to some circumstances, we had to stay for at least one year at home, so I decided to slowly, but steadily plan my preparation for interviews at the big tech companies.</p>
<h2 id="the-preparation-phase">The Preparation Phase</h2>
<p>After doing some research, I found out the most common stages of the recruitment process:</p>
<ul>
<li>technical</li>
<li>behavioral</li>
<li>management</li>
<li>analytical</li>
<li>system design</li>
<li>object-oriented design</li>
</ul>
<p>You might not go through all of them. It depends on the job position you apply and on the company. What you will for sure have are the <em>behavioral</em> and <em>technical</em> interviews. <em>System design</em> is often present, especially if you apply to a position that requires experienced candidates.</p>
<p>Let’s briefly describe each type of the interview before moving further.</p>
<h3 id="technicalcoding-interview">Technical/Coding Interview</h3>
<p>This type of interview aims at understanding your algorithms skills. Usually, you are given 1, 2, or 3 problems, and you have to solve them in the allocated time (usually somewhere between 15 to 60 mins, depending on the complexity of the problem), considering edge cases and time and space complexity.</p>
<p>There are many platforms online where you can practice solving such problems. Here are just a few to name:</p>
<ul>
<li>LeetCode</li>
<li>HackerRank</li>
<li>Codility</li>
<li>GeeksForGeeks</li>
</ul>
<p>I created a habit of solving at least one problem per day, and in almost ten months, I had solved 299 problems.</p>
<p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/leetcode-submissions.png#c" alt="Image of submissions on leetcode"></p>
<p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/leetcode-solved-problem-types.png#c" alt="Image with amount and types of problems solved on leetcode"></p>
<p>Another thing to note is that a candidate usually has several technical interviews: over the phone and onsite.</p>
<h3 id="behavioral-interview">Behavioral Interview</h3>
<p>This type of interview aims at understanding the competency and soft-skills part of your professional profile. How good can you get along with people, how do you perform and behave in different situations with your coworkers, etc. Some developers see this interview as a useless step (or one with minimal importance). That is a delusional thought. Developers have to work in teams the same way as people in many other professions, and understanding “the human” side of a potential employee is essential.</p>
<p>To prepare for this step, there are lots of resources online about behavioral interviews. _ “Cracking the Coding Interview”_ by Gayle Laakmann McDowell is a book that might help you as well. Actually, it is an exhaustive resource to prepare for interviews, so check it out.</p>
<h3 id="management-interview">Management Interview</h3>
<p>I had this type of interview only at one company. It is about looking for examples of how you deal with different scenarios, usually around being a team player, helpful and engaging. I didn’t really see a difference from a behavioral interview, but it was explicitly labeled a “Management Interview,” so there it is.</p>
<h3 id="analytical-interview">Analytical Interview</h3>
<p>This type of interview aims to understand how you work with data, how you make sense of it, and if you have made any data-driven decisions in your previous work. It has minor aspects of a behavioral interview as well, but more focused on your analytical skills.</p>
<h3 id="system-design-interview">System Design Interview</h3>
<p>This type of interview is about designing scalable, distributed systems. It might be tough to prepare for because sometimes you might not have the experience of working on a distributed system. Therefore, you must learn the theory only, without having practical experience.</p>
<p>This step is also more challenging because there are a lot of concepts, use cases, and tools that solve various problems, and you need to know what those are to be able to design a viable solution.</p>
<p>To prepare for this interview, I took the long route (since I had plenty of time). There are many great (and free!) resources on GitHub, and here are the ones that I used:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/binhnguyennus/awesome-scalability">Awesome Scalability</a> - a reading list on scalability, availability, principles of distributed systems, best case practices at different companies, and many more. I was reading five articles a day and was almost done with the relevant concepts in 7 months. It gave me a broad perspective on what tools exist out there, what problems other teams and companies face, and how to approach solving those problems.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer">The System Design Primer</a> - a similar resource, but much more concise, and focused on the theoretical aspects of the concepts more (rather than providing real-life examples from companies, as in the previous link). But the main advantage of it is that it has examples of system design questions and answers.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/yangshun/tech-interview-handbook">Tech Interview Handbook</a> offers full support in preparation for the interviews, but I used it for some hints only.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="object-oriented-design-interview">Object-Oriented Design Interview</h3>
<p>In OOD, you have to design the interface of some API or class. It aims at understanding how you think in terms of code and how you structure it. There should be some resources online on the topic, but I haven’t prepared for this one additionally since that is what I do as part of my job.</p>
<h2 id="quitting-and-searching">Quitting And Searching</h2>
<p>In March 2020, I decided to quit my job at the NY startup and enjoy some time while I was going to search for a job. I was okay financially and was quite confident I would get a job at some company. But then the pandemic hit, and I got a bit nervous.</p>
<p>Anyway, I needed companies that can sponsor a visa. That’s pretty much all big tech firms. Here is the list of companies and openings I have applied to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full Stack Developer @ Google in Zurich</li>
<li>Software Engineer, Core Languages @ Google in Munich</li>
<li>Software Engineer, Engineering Productivity @ Google in Munich</li>
<li>Senior Backend Engineer @ Airbnb in Dublin</li>
<li>Software Developer - Frontend Tools for AWS @ Amazon in Berlin</li>
<li>Software Developer Engineer - Backend @ Amazon in Berlin</li>
<li>Developer Support Engineer @ Facebook in Dublin</li>
<li>Enterprise Engineer @ Facebook in Dublin</li>
<li>Full Stack Software Engineer - Python/JS @ Apple in Zurich</li>
</ul>
<p>Out of these, I had referrals at all companies except Airbnb. So I got a reply from Google for the Full Stack role, both Amazon jobs, the Airbnb one, and Facebook’s Developer Support Engineer. The only email I received from Apple was the one in which they asked me about feedback on the recruitment process. That was weird.</p>
<p>So, it was exciting, and I was looking forward to it!</p>
<h2 id="interviewing">Interviewing</h2>
<p>If you have worked for a corporation, you probably know that things there take time to progress. The most responsible and fast were Google and Facebook, followed by Airbnb, and Amazon being the least responsive and considerate.</p>
<p>The first step at all companies except Amazon was a phone call to discuss about my application. I perceived this step as an ice-breaker where the recruiter gets to know you, that you are a real person, and that you have intelligible English.</p>
<p>After that, there were coding rounds, but things started to diverge, so I’ll describe the experience with each company separately:</p>
<h3 id="google">Google</h3>
<p>Google was among my favorites. The experience with the recruiter was among the best I had. Initially, we had a call to introduce myself, and the recruiter told me about the process.</p>
<p>The next step was a coding round with an interviewer. I was delighted about how it went. The code was well commented and organized in testable functions. I walked the interviewer throughout the whole thinking process by telling how and why I’m writing that code. I did introduce a small bug (incorrect upper bound in python’s <code>range()</code> function) that the interviewer showed me immediately, which I fixed. Also, while I was close to finalizing the problem, I figured out some use cases that wouldn’t pass, so I clarified the expected outcome and did the corresponding changes. I even answered a follow-up question, but I didn’t get to code it because of a lack of time.</p>
<p>After waiting for one week, it turned out that I didn’t pass. And the feedback was a bit suspicious to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>the pace was a bit on the slow side</li>
<li>I didn’t account for a bug (the one that he told me about the moment I did it)</li>
<li>I didn’t think about the design of the algorithm and data structures at the abstract level before coding (this one is subjective since I did think and explain my choices)</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, it seemed very unfair. The only thing I could do is to tell about this to the recruiter, so hopefully, other candidates will be evaluated more fairly.</p>
<h3 id="amazon">Amazon</h3>
<p>With Amazon, I had the least pleasant experience as a candidate. It took ages until they were responding to emails and moving with the recruitment process. So, after the intro call, I had two rounds of coding exercises for two …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What comes in your mind when you hear the term Passive Income? Well, if you think it is easy money that can be earned while sitting on a beach without doing anything, you are wrong. Yes, it can be an excellent supplementary source of funds for a lot of people, but it requires lots of work as well. Passive income demands an upfront investment and a lot of nourishing in the start. However, after some time, these income streams can sustain themselves and bring you a significant amount of money. We will show the 10 best ways to generate passive income in this article.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What is Passive Income?&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">People love to hear about this earning method, yet it is the most misunderstood concept. In simple words, Passive income is when you keep getting paid for work, even after it is completed. It involves royalties from movies, books, songs, etc. It also includes the wealth that comes from investments in the real state or business investments where your physical presence is not necessary.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Why is it important?&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The reason why everyone must start working on Passive Income ideas is its unmatchable significance. Let's suppose you wake up one day, and out of nowhere, you find out that you are fired from your job. That's where Passive Income proves its worth. The most recent example is the recent lockdown that was imposed by the government due to the Coronavirus outbreak. A lot of people have gone through a financial crisis during this pandemic, except the individuals who had secondary earning sources. So, whenever you lose your job or face any kind of financial hardship, passive income will ensure the cash flow does not stop.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How to generate Passive Income?&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This is the most common question asked by the people who are willing to earn through different sources. There are a lot of Passive Income ideas and strategies that can help everyone. Some of them may require a lot of investment, but you can start making money even with as little as $5! Sounds unbelievable, right? We have discussed more of such strategies below.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Rental Income:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A cash flowing rental property is an excellent way to earn passive income, but it requires a lot of work. Before investing in a real state, you must learn how to make it a profitable investment, otherwise, there are a lot of risks involved. Also, if you want to make it truly passive, outsourcing your property to a management company is the best option. However, this is not something you can start with a little extra cash.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dividend Stocks:&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This is an authentic and tested way to earn passive income. Your job will be to do extensive research and find good stocks where you can invest money and receive a significant number of dividends. If you keep investing in dividend stocks, you can accumulate a good residual revenue with time. Choosing the right company to invest in is the tricky part. If you succeed in selecting the right company, you will receive payment at regular intervals.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Peer-to-peer Lending:&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Peer to peer, commonly known as P2P is the method of lending money to borrowers who do not qualify for conventional loans. This kind of lending is usually facilitated by a third-party agent, such as LendingClub. As a lender, your income source will be the interest payments made on the loans. However, there is some risk factor as the loan is unsecured.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Affiliate Marketing:&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you are a social media influencer, a blogger, or a website owner, this method can be the best option for you to earn some extra cash. It is a commission-based job, where you promote a third party's product on your website, and on every purchase, you will get your share. The most popular affiliate partner is Amazon, but there are other platforms like Awin, ShareASale, and eBay as well. Please remember that you will need to invest a lot of time in the start to attract traffic on your website.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Investing in CDs:&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you are a risk-averse person, investing in Certificates of Deposits (CD) can be a pretty good option for you. It is often more profitable to go with an online bank than your local bank. This way, you will be able to select the best rate of return available in your country.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Selling Information Product:&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you are good at something, you can always record an audio or a video course and sell it to interested people. Also, writing an E-book can be a pretty good source for earning passive income. The only problem with this method is that you must put a lot of effort into creating such a product. Some popular examples in this regard are Udemy, Coursera, Skillshare, etc.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">REIT:&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Real Estate Investment Trusts are specially made for people who are not comfortable investing directly in the real state. REITs have a kind of legal structure that enables them to pay little to no corporate income tax if they pass along most of their revenue to shareholders. You can easily purchase the shares of REITs from the Stock Market just like other companies.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Invest in a Business:&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This is another great way to make passive income. You can invest in a business and be a silent partner. This is the riskiest method we have discussed until now, but if you are a risk-taker, you will understand the high returns that are associated with high risk. For example, did you know that Uber and Lyft were looking for private investors once? Well, both of these companies are worth billions now!&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Car Advertisement:&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Earning money while driving your car around town - doesn't it sound fascinating? Well, it surely does, and a lot of people are doing it. You can contact any experienced advertising agency, and after making some inquiries, they will link you to one of their advertisers.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Renting out a room in your house:&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This is a straightforward method of earning passive income. In simple words, you are taking advantage of the space that you were probably not using anyway.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The ideas discussed above are only a few out of hundreds through which you can make passive income easily. It is about time we start looking for additional income sources that can improve our living. However, there is no such thing as easy money. If you are looking for high returns, make sure to put the significant effort.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>At 16:09 EDT on 04 Sep 2020 (about 26 hours ago), SalesForce (the owner of web hosting company Heroku) notified us that they had suspended the Ruqqus live and test server environments, with account termination to follow twenty-four hours later.</p>
<p>At the time of this writing, we have not been given a reason as to why we were being kicked. I do not believe we violated Heroku ToS (though Heroku may think otherwise) and we did not exceed Heroku usage limits. Our account manager was friendly but was unfortunately unable to provide us with any information. It is my opinion that by not warning us first (ex. "please remove X which violates Heroku's acceptable use policy") that Heroku actually violated their own terms of service.</p>
<p>We immediately downloaded all of the Ruqqus data, and began working on setting up shop at another host.</p>
<p>I'd like to give a massive shoutout to <a href="https://ruqqus.com/@p2hang"><img src="https://ruqqus.com/@p2hang/pic/profile">@p2hang</a> for lending his considerable expertise in support of getting Ruqqus operational as quickly as possible. He is the third recipient of the super-rare Fire Extinguisher badge.</p>
<p>All (or at least, almost all) functionality is restored. There are a few things which aren't quite yet back to normal, which I hope to fix over the course of tonight and tomorrow.</p>
<p>Known issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><del>hCaptcha verification issues on attempted signups</del></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><del>Custom guild colors are currently disabled. This was an intentional decision by me, as there were issues loading the style files needed for custom coloring, so it was easier to just disable that for the sake of getting up and running.</del></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><del>Notification bell stuck on.</del></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><del>Lastly, and most importantly, we have no idea how well the current server will be able to handle user load. For that reason, I will be continuing to monitor and make adjustments as needed. Performance may be spotty and unreliable as load resumes.~~ ~~Doesn't seem to be an issue, but we'll have to see how it goes with everyone trying to get on.</del> There are some load/efficiency problems that I'm trying to sort out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><del>hCaptcha on signup is malfunctioning.</del></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><del><a href="http://i.ruqqus.com/">i.ruqqus.com</a> image uploads don't save.</del></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most recent 30k or so comments didn't make it into the new host. Also possibly some post votes. I <em>think</em> all the comment votes made it in. The missing data is something I'm still working on, but you will probably see rep fluctuating unpredictably as vanished stuff is no longer counted.</p>

<p>A common trope in hiring is the lack of experienced candidates. This is certainly thought to be true for the entire tech industry, but it’s especially compounded for minority candidates: “it’s a pipeline problem”. On the flip side, the question inexperienced developers face is how they can gain experience without having prior experience.</p>

<p>No matter what type of experienced candidate you’re trying to hire, <strong>your company needs to invest in its junior employees</strong>. That means provide them with mentorship, formal training, and the opportunity to work on meaningful projects. But, there are some common objections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Building up experienced candidates takes time, when you need them <em>now</em>!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Employees will take the investment you put into them and go to another company. Now, the other company will get an experienced candidate without paying the upfront cost.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It sounds like you’re better off asking developers to level up on their own time.</p>

<p>However, <strong>like many hard problems, the root cause is systemic</strong>. If every company invested in their industries, there would be a large pool of experienced candidates moving from employer to employer. This is, fundamentally, the <em>only</em> way to end up with experienced candidates in the system.</p>

<h2 id="the-prisoners-dilemma">The prisoner’s dilemma</h2>

<p>The problem is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma">a prisoner’s dilemma</a>: it’s best for all the employers to work together, training their employees. In return, they all get access to the trained candidates who move around in the future. But, like in the prisoner’s dilemma, one company doesn’t know what the other companies will do, so the best strategy seems to not reward other companies with trained candidates.</p>

<p>Luckily, there’s a silver lining here. It still makes sense to invest in your employees for two reasons.</p>

<p>Most importantly, your employees will be happier! You’ll still have to compete on pay, of course, but if someone is being treated well, wouldn’t they want to stay around for at least a little longer?</p>

<p>Besides, you’re not alone, even today. The big tech companies, like Google and Facebook, are absolutely investing in their employees. These companies have extensive formal training programs, structured mentorship and a wide variety of interesting problems for engineers to solve. In fact, investing in your employees may be another plus for those looking to jump out of the big tech companies.</p>

<p>Basically, if you’re not investing in your employees, you’re already falling behind.</p>

<h2 id="effective-investment">Effective investment</h2>

<p>Finally, there’s the question of <em>how</em>: how do you build up your employees into experienced engineers. I’ve already talked about a few ways, but let’s get into some more detail.</p>

<p>First, provide <em>formal</em> training programs, including mentorship. This means giving developers access to the experienced engineers in your company, and giving the experience engineers guidance on how to mentor others. But, it also means classes and educational material employees can take advantage of. Think paid classes to learn a new skill, the way I learned mobile development.</p>

<p>Next, send engineers to conferences, or better yet, coach them to speak at conferences and other industry events. Engineers need access to resources outside your company too. As a side effect, the company ends up with representation within these industry events, which can help with recruitment down the line.</p>

<p>Finally, let developers stretch themselves on harder projects. With the right guardrails and mentorship, this is exactly how engineers gain experience.</p>

<hr>

<p>Investing in your employees is key to creating an industry with a healthy level of experienced engineers to draw from. Along the way, the investment results in happier employees and more recruitment opportunities. And despite the fact it seems less than ideal to do this investment alone, you’re not actually alone: the most coveted companies are already ahead of the game here.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>URL query parameters and how laxness creates de facto requirements on the web</h2>

	<p><small>September  7, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>One of the ways that <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/dwiki/DWiki">DWiki</a> (the code behind <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/">Wandering Thoughts</a>) is unusual is that it strictly validates the query parameters
it receives on URLs, including on HTTP <code>GET</code> requests for ordinary
pages. If a HTTP request has unexpected and unsupported query
parameters, such a <code>GET</code> request will normally fail. When I made
this decision it seemed the cautious and conservative approach, but
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/CautionIsAMistakeToday">this caution has turned out to be a mistake on the modern web</a>. In practice, all sorts of sites will
generate versions of your URLs with all sorts of extra query
parameters tacked on, give them to people, and expect them to work.
If your website refuses to play along, (some) people won't get to
see your content. <strong>On today's web, you need to accept (and then
ignore) arbitrary query parameters on your URLs</strong>.</p>

<p>(Today's new query parameter is 's=NN', for various values of NN
like '04' and '09'. I'm not sure what's generating these URLs, but
it may be Slack.)</p>

<p>You might wonder how we got here, and that is a story of lax behavior
(or, if you prefer, being liberal in what you accept). In the
beginning, both Apache (for static web pages) and early web
applications often ignored extra query parameters on URLs, at least
on <code>GET</code> requests. I suspect that other early web servers also
imitated Apache here, but I have less exposure to their behavior
than Apache's. My guess is that this behavior wasn't deliberate,
it was just the simplest way to implement both Apache and early
web applications; you paid attention to what you cared about and
didn't bother to explicitly check that nothing else was supplied.</p>

<p>When people noticed that this behavior was commonplace and widespread,
they began using it. I believe that one of the early uses was for
embedding 'where this link was shared' information for your own web
analytics (<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/AnalyticsVsSecurity">cf</a>), either based on your logs
or using JavaScript embedded in the page. In the way of things,
once this was common enough other people began helpfully tagging
the links that were shared through them for you, which is why I
began to see various 'utm_*' query parameters on inbound
requests to <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/">Wandering Thoughts</a> even though I never
published such URLs.
Web developers don't leave attractive nuisances alone for long, so
soon enough people were sticking on extra query parameters to your
URLs that were mostly for them and not so much for you. Facebook
may have been one of the early pioneers here with their 'fbclid'
parameter, but other websites have hopped on this particular train
since then (as I saw recently with these 's=NN' parameters).</p>

<p>At this point, the practice of other websites and services adding
random query parameters to your URLs that pass through them is so
wide spread and common that accepting random query parameters is
pretty much a practical requirement for any web content serving
software that wants to see wide use and not be irritating to the
people operating it. If, like <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/dwiki/DWiki">DWiki</a>, you stick to your guns and
refuse to accept some or all of them, you will drop some amount of
your incoming requests from real people, disappointing would be
readers.</p>

<p>This practical requirement for URL handling is not documented in
any specification, and it's probably not in most 'best practices'
documentation. People writing new web serving systems that are
tempted to be strict and safe and cautious get to learn about it
the hard way.</p>

<p>In general, any laxness in actual implementations of a system can
create a similar spiral of de facto requirements. Something that
is permitted and is useful to people will be used, and then supporting
that becomes a requirement. This is especially the case in a
distributed system like the web, where any attempt to tighten the
rules would only be initially supported by a minority of websites.
These websites would be 'outvoted' by the vast majority of websites
that allow the lax behavior and support it, because that's what
happens when the vast majority work and the minority don't.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p><a href="https://app.qvault.io/">My team</a> has been spending less of our “free” time working on bugs and features from the backlog, and more time refactoring our codebases and test suites. As a result, and perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, we’ve noticed a significant increase in our throughput of features and bug fixes.</p>



<p>As it turns out, its easy to find bugs and add features to a well-written codebase that the entire team is familiar with. Go figure.</p>



<p>My team started a loose goal to spend 25% of our time refactoring, revisiting, and restyling existing code and tests. Let’s go over some of the benefits we’ve seen since making the change.</p>



<h2>Context and Caveats</h2>



<p>I’ve found that in articles like this it’s important to give as much context to the situation as possible, as certain development methodologies may work better or worse in teams with a different size, tech stack, or development process. Here are some notable things about our situation:</p>



<ul><li>3 engineers on my team, ~16 in the company</li><li>Tech stack – Go, Postgres, ElasticSearch and RabbitMQ</li><li>Microservices architecture on Kubernetes</li><li>Kanban-style development process – <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/05/18/leave-scrum-to-rugby-i-like-getting-stuff-done/">no scrum</a></li><li>Our team is responsible for ~14 repositories</li><li>Each repo represents a small service in a data pipeline process that handles sorting and NLP of social media posts</li></ul>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-1024x592.png" alt="Go Kubernetes" width="512" height="296" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-1024x592.png 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-300x173.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-768x444.png 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-150x87.png 150w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes.png 1245w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" title="go kubernetes"></figure></div>



<h2>Code Familiarity</h2>



<p>With only 3 engineers on the pipeline team and ~14 repositories (Mostly REST APIs and ETL processes), it was hard for all three of us to be super familiar with all the code. When we needed a new microservice, one team member typically wrote the first iteration, and one other team member did a quick code review. The engineer who did the first iteration would then be primarily responsible for bug fixes and new features relating to that project.</p>



<p>By focusing more of our time on reviewing and refactoring existing code, it gave us a chance to hop into projects that we never would have had a reason to become familiar with. Not only does getting more eyes on a project mean the overall code quality will likely go up, but it also means we aren’t hosed when the original maintainer has gone.</p>



<h2>Slow to Fix Bugs</h2>



<p>When you get deep into spaghetti code, it can be really hard to find bugs. Not only that but in a messy codebase, sometimes fixing a bug can actually <em>add</em> to the “uncleanliness” of the code. You may have to exacerbate or extend an already bad architectural pattern in order to get a bug fix in.</p>



<p>Ideally, you would do the refactoring first and then fix the bug (assuming the bug still exists after a good refactoring). Unfortunately, oftentimes there isn’t enough time to refactor a project before fixing a critical bug. For this reason, we should always be refactoring so that bug fixes can happen quickly and won’t make the code quality worse than it is.</p>



<h2>Slow to Add Features</h2>



<p>I don’t want to beat a dead horse, the reasoning here is largely the same as with bug fixes. Adding features to a messy codebase just makes it messier. It’s like frosting a cake that’s been thrown on the ground – it might taste marginally better but now it’s even harder to clean up.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="261" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/happy_birthday_to_ground.gif" alt="Happy Birthday to the Ground" title="happy birthday to ground"></figure></div>



<h2>Try It Yourself</h2>



<p>Since adding a consistent refactoring process to our team’s routine, we’ve been able to put <em>more</em> features through to production while spending <em>less</em> time working on them. Let me know what you think and if you have a different experience.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  

  <div>
    <p>For the past few months, I’ve been running a handful of SSH Honeypots on some
cloud providers, including <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud</a>,
<a href="https://m.do.co/c/b2cffefc9c81">DigitalOcean</a>, and
<a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1380239&amp;u=2497236&amp;m=46483&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=">NameCheap</a>.
As opposed to more complicated honeypots looking at attacker behavior, I decided
to do something simple and was only interested in where they were coming from,
what tools might be in use, and what credentials they are attempting to use to
authenticate.  My dataset includes 929,554 attempted logins over a period of a
little more than 3 months.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a big surprise, I’ll go ahead and let you down easy: my
analysis hasn’t located any new botnets or clusters of attackers.  But it’s been
a fascinating project nonetheless.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="honeypot-design">Honeypot Design</h2>

<p>With a mere 200ish lines of Go, I implemented a honeypot server using the
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh?tab=doc"><code>golang.org/x/crypto/ssh</code></a>
library as the underlying implementation.  I advertised a portable OpenSSH
version as the server version string (sent to clients on connection).  I then
logged each connection to a SQLite database, including the timestamp, IP
address, client version, and credentials used to (attempt to) authenticate.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-credentials">Analysis of Credentials</h2>

<p>In a surprise to absolutely nobody, <code>root</code> is by far the most commonly tried
username for login sessions.  I suspect there must be many attackers trying
lists of passwords with just <code>root</code> as the username, as 78% of attempted logins
were with username <code>root</code>.  None of the remainder of the top 10 are particularly
surprising, although <code>usuario</code> was not one I expected to see.  (It is Spanish
for <code>user</code>.)</p>

<p>Blank passwords are the most common attempted passwords, followed by other
obvious choices, like <code>123456</code> and <code>password</code>.  Just off the top 10 list was a
surprising choice of password: <code>J5cmmu=Kyf0-br8CsW</code>.  Interestingly, a Google
search for this password only finds other people with experience running
credential honeypots.  It doesn’t appear in any of the password wordlists I
have, including <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists">SecLists</a> and
others.  If anyone knows what this is a password for, I’d love to know.</p>

<p>There were a number of other interesting passwords such as <code>7ujMko0admin</code>, used
for a bunch of networked DVRs, and also known to be used by malware attacking
IoT devices.  There are other passwords that don’t look obvious to a US-centric
view of the world, like:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>baikal</code> – a lake in Siberia</li>
  <li><code>prueba</code> – Spanish for test</li>
  <li><code>caonima</code> – a Mandarin profanity written in Pinyin</li>
  <li><code>meiyoumima</code> – Mandarin for “no password”</li>
  <li><code>woaini</code> – Mandarin for “I love you”</li>
  <li><code>poiuyt</code> – <strike>The name for an optical illusion also known as the "devil's tuning
fork"</strike> <strong>Edit:</strong> multiple redditors pointed out this is the begginning
of the top row of the keyboard from right to left.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also dozens and dozens of keyboard walks, like <code>1q2w3e</code>, <code>1qaz@WSX</code>,
and <code>!QAZ2wsx</code>.  There are many more that took me much longer to realize they
were keyboard walks, such as <code>4rfv$RFV</code> and <code>qpwoei</code>.</p>

<p>It has actually fascinated me to look at some of the less obvious passwords and
discern their background.  Many are inexplicable, but I assume they are from
hardcoded passwords in devices or something along those lines.  Or perhaps
someone let their cat walk across the keyboard to generate it.  I’ve certainly
had that experience.</p>

<p>Overall, the top 10 usernames and top 10 passwords (not necessarily together)
are:</p>

attempted, though only 38,112 were attempted 5 or more times.  You can

<p>Again, no real surprises here.  <code>ubnt</code> is a little bit higher than I would have
thought (for Ubiquiti networking gear) but I suppose there’s a fair bit of their
gear on the internet.  It’s interesting to see the mix of “lazy admin” and
“default credentials” here.  It’s <em>mildly</em> interesting to me that all substrings
of the first 10 digits (3 or longer) are included, <em>except</em> for 7 digits.  I
guess 7 digit passwords are less common?</p>

<h2 id="timing-information">Timing Information</h2>

<p>Though I imagine these kind of untargeted scans are long-term processes
continually running, I decided to check and see what the timing looked like
anyway.  Neither the day of week analysis nor the hour of day analysis look
like there’s any significant variance.</p>

<p><img src="https://systemoverlord.com/img/gopot/days_of_week.png" alt="Day of Week">
<img src="https://systemoverlord.com/img/gopot/hours.png" alt="Hour of Day"></p>

<p>Looking at the number of login requests over the time period where I’ve been
running the honeypots shows the traffic to be intermittent.  While I didn’t
expect the number to be constant, the variance is much higher than I expected.
I imagine a larger sample size and more nodes would probably make the results
more even.</p>

<p><img src="https://systemoverlord.com/img/gopot/dates.png" alt="Day of Study"></p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-sources">Analysis of Sources</h2>

<p>So where are all of these requests coming from?  I want to start by noting that
<em>none</em> of my analysis is an attempt to attribute the actors making the requests
– that’s just not possible with this kind of data.  There’s two ways to look at
the source of requests – in terms of the network, and in terms of the (assumed)
geography.  My analysis relied on the IP to ASN and IP to Country data provided
by <a href="https://iptoasn.com/">iptoasn.com</a>.</p>

<p>Looking at the country-level data, networks from China lead the pack by a long
shot (62% of all login attempts), followed by the US.</p>

<p>Again, I’m not claiming that these countries mean anything other than location
of the autonomous system (AS) that originates the requests.  I also did not do
individual IP geolocation, so the results should be taken with a small grain of
salt.</p>

<p>So what networks are sourcing this traffic?  I have the <a href="https://systemoverlord.com/static/attachments/gopot/asns.csv">full AS counts and

<p>Chinanet is no surprise given the high ratio of China in general.  OVH is a
low-cost host known to have liberal AUP, so is popular for both malicious and
research purposes.  DigitalOcean and Microsoft, of course, are popular cloud
providers.  Surprisingly, AWS only sourced about 600 connections, unless they
have a large number of IPs on a non-Amazon ASN.</p>

<p>Overall, traffic came from 27,448 unique IPv4 addresses.  Of those, more than 11
thousand sent only a single request.  At the other end of the spectrum, the top
IP source sent 64,969 login requests.</p>

<p>Most hosts sent relatively few requests, the large numbers are outliers:</p>

<p><img src="https://systemoverlord.com/img/gopot/ipcnts.png" alt="IP Count Graph"></p>

<p>Surely, by now a thought has crossed your mind: how many of these requests are
coming from Tor?  Surely the Tor network is a wretched hive of scum and villany,
and the source of much malicious traffic, right?</p>

<p><img src="https://systemoverlord.com/img/gopot/tor.png" alt="Tor Graph"></p>

<p>Not at all.  Only 219 of the unique source IPs were identified as Tor exit
nodes, representing only 0.8% of the sources.  On a per-request basis, even a
smaller percentage of requests is seen from Tor exit nodes.</p>

<h2 id="client-software">Client Software</h2>

<p>Remember – this is self-reported by the client application, and just like I can
spoof the server version string, so can clients.  But I still thought it would
be interesting to take a brief look at those.</p>

<p>You know, I didn’t expect that.  <a href="https://www.putty.org/">PuTTY</a> as the top
client strings.  (Also not sure what to make of the case difference.)  I wonder
if people are building the PuTTY SSH library into a tool for scanning or
wrapping the binary in some kind of script.</p>

<p>Go, paramiko, and libssh are less surprising, as they’re libraries designed for
integration.  It’s hard to know if the OpenSSH requests are linked into a
scanning tool or just wrapped versions of the SSH client.  At some point in the
future, I might dive more into this and trying to figure out which software uses
which libraries (at least for the publicly-known tools).</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>I was hoping to find something earth-shattering in this research.  Instead, I
found things that were much as expected – common usernames and passwords,
widespread scanning, large numbers of requests.  One thing’s for sure though:
connect it to the internet and someone’s going to pwn it.</p>

			<p><span>Note: This post is adapted from my&nbsp;conference</span> <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343658815_Designing_Trajectories_Resilient_to_Missed_Thrust_Events_Using_Expected_Thrust_Fraction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paper</a>, <span>which was presented at the Astrodynamics Specialists Conference in Summer 2020.

<h3><span>Abstract – Designing Trajectories Resilient to Missed Thrust Events Using Expected Thrust Fraction</span></h3>
<p><span>With the adoption of efficient low-thrust propulsion methods, the probability of a</span> <a href="https://gereshes.com/2019/09/02/missed-thrust-events-in-deep-space-trajectories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">missed thrust event</a>&nbsp;<span>occurring has become a significant concern for short and long-duration missions. If the missed thrust events take place during a critical portion of the trajectory, the mission can be compromised. Therefore, it is essential to develop trajectories that are resilient to missed thrust events. This paper investigates the use of expected thrust fraction, which embeds the stochastic nature of missed thrust events into a deterministic optimal control problem. The performance of trajectories designed using expected thrust fraction is compared with traditionally designed trajectories to measure changes in resiliency to missed thrust events. In this investigation, trajectories designed using expected thrust fraction arrive with a median lateness half that of traditionally designed trajectories. Using expected thrust fraction can help astrodynamicists mitigate risks posed by the use of low-thrust propulsion.</span></p>

            <p>With the recent release of <a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/">Crusader Kings 3</a> by Paradox Interactive, a new UI paradigm in the game stopped me in my tracks. There are a lot of lessons that web designers can learn from video game user interface design and while they aren’t always transferrable, they are worth exploring. In this case it’s the idea of having <i>tooltips within tooltips.</i></p>

            <p>Tooltips have become a standard component in user interface design. The majority of web UI frameworks include some form of tooltip, with Bootstrap having <i>two</i> types (Tooltips and Popovers). Wikipedia uses tooltips when hovering over links:</p>

People may also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face. The transmission may also occur through aerosols that can stay suspended in the air for longer periods of time in enclosed spaces. It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread is possible before symptoms appear, and from people who are asymptomatic.

            <p>Did you find it intuitive? Could you easily traverse up and down the tooltip chain? Note: this is a HTML/CSS example that I quickly put together so it’s rough around the edges.</p>

            <p>I found it suprisingly intuitive and easy to use. When you hover to reveal the first tooltip, you keep your cursor nice and still. After that, you locate a piece of information you want to learn more about and you hover over that. It might overlap the first tooltip, but that’s fine. You’ve chosen to seek more information.</p>

            <p>Another reason I like this idea, is that it matches how I think. When learning something new, there might be a supporting concept or idea I don't fully grasp. A nested tooltip is a great solution.</p>

            <p>In the context of a complex grand strategy game like CK3, having explanatory text is necessary. The designers and developers at Paradox elegantly solved this by implementing tooltips within tooltips. Kudos to them.</p>

            <h3>Potential issues</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Accessibility.</b> Well anything is possible with Javascript right? You could tab through the tooltips to get them working.</li>
                <li><b>User experience.</b> It can be frustrating to move your cursor 1 pixel outside of the bounds of the element which removes the tooltip.</li>
                <li><b>How deep do you go?</b> The designer should use discretion. An infinitely deep tooltip chain doesn't make sense. There might be some sweet number here like, 2 or 3 nested tooltips.</li>
                <li><b>Touch?</b> I'm not sure how mobile works. You could just treat them as tappable elements.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I guess the question is: could the web embrace nested tooltips?</p>

        <div>
  
  <p><span>07 Sep 2020</span></p><p>A programming language supports <em>named parameters</em> when one
can call a function supplying the parameters by name, as in
the following hypothetical example (using C++ syntax):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>void f( int x, int y );

int main()
{
    f( x = 1, y = 2 );
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>C++ is obviously not such a language and there have been
numerous proposals to rectify this omission, unfortunately none
of them successful. The latest attempt is Axel Naumann’s paper
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0671r2.html">Self-explanatory Function Arguments</a>,
which tries to attack the problem from another angle by just
allowing normal function calls to be tagged with the parameter
name, as in</p>



<p>enabling compilers to issue helpful warnings when a name doesn’t
match, but not allowing one to omit, or reorder, arguments.</p>

<p>Even in this limited form, named parameters would still be immensely
useful, but this is not what this post is about. What this post is
about is that we can already achieve something very close to named
parameters in C++20, by using a C99 feature called <em>designated
initializers</em>.</p>

<p>Designated initializers allow one to initialize structures by
member name, as in the following example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>struct A
{
    int x;
    int y;
};

A a1 = { .x = 1, .y = 2 };
A a2 = { .x = 3 }; // a2.y == 0
A a3 = { .y = 4 }; // a3.x == 0
A a4 = { .y = 5, .x = 6 }; // valid C, invalid C++ (reorder)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>C++ introduces a restriction C doesn’t have: the initializers
must follow the declaration order, similarly to how class member
initalizers are executed in member declaration order. But in
exchange, it allows us to supply default values:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>struct A
{
    int x = 0;
    int y = 0;
};

A a3 = { .y = 4 }; // a3.x == 0, no warning
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can already see where this is going. Instead of</p>



<p>we declare</p>



<p>and then call it like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>int main()
{
    f({ .x = 1, .y = 2 });
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This works under <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/YfWj3W">GCC</a> and
<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/vbnz4T">Clang</a> even without <code>-std=c++20</code> because
they support designated initializers in earlier language modes as
an extension, and it works under <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/bKozaW">MSVC</a>
with <code>-std:c++latest</code>.</p>

<p>For a more realistic example, consider this snippet, taken from real
code, that sets a 10 second
<a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_74_0/libs/beast/doc/html/beast/using_websocket/timeouts.html">timeout</a>
on a <a href="https://boost.org/libs/beast">Boost.Beast</a> websocket:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#include &lt;boost/beast/websocket/stream.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;boost/beast/core/tcp_stream.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;chrono&gt;

void f1(boost::beast::websocket::stream&lt;boost::beast::tcp_stream&gt;&amp; ws)
{
    auto opt = boost::beast::websocket::stream_base::timeout();

    opt.keep_alive_pings = true;
    opt.idle_timeout = std::chrono::seconds(10);

    ws.set_option(opt);
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s how we can reformulate it by using the above idiom and <code>&lt;chrono&gt;</code>
literals:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#include &lt;boost/beast/websocket/stream.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;boost/beast/core/tcp_stream.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;chrono&gt;

using namespace std::chrono_literals;

void f2(boost::beast::websocket::stream&lt;boost::beast::tcp_stream&gt;&amp; ws)
{
    ws.set_option({ .idle_timeout = 10s, .keep_alive_pings = true });
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Apart from the slightly awkward <code>({ ... })</code> syntax and the need to observe
the right parameter order, that’s not that far from the ideal; and it’s
considerably better than <code>f1</code>.</p>

<p>This also works for constructors. Consider this hypothetical <code>vector</code> class
that is like <code>std::vector</code>, except with its various constructor overloads
replaced with one taking named parameters:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>template&lt;class T, class A = std::allocator&lt;T&gt;&gt; class vector
{
private:

    struct params
    {
        std::size_t size = 0;
        T element{};
        std::size_t capacity = 0;
        A allocator{};
    };

public:

    explicit vector( params p );
};
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/x17fdY">how it’s used</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>auto f()
{
    vector&lt;int&gt; v{{ .size = 4, .element = 11, .capacity = 64 }};
    return v;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Again, apart from the odd <code>{{ ... }}</code> syntax, not that bad.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
    <div>
      
      <div id="ifu-css-colorizable-svgs-examples">
  <div>
    <div>
      <h2>Coloring Individual Icons</h2>
      <p>When displaying the same colorizable SVG multiple times, each time a different set of colors can be applied with CSS. Below, the same "hipster" SVG is displayed four times, with different colors for skin, hair, glasses and shirt. The shading is done automatically by the SVG.</p>
      <p>Each of the icons has a unique id, so a CSS id selector can be used to apply the specific colors for each icon.</p>
    </div>
    


  </div>

  <div>
    <div>
      <h2>Coloring Groups of Icons</h2>
      <p>Groups of icons can share the same color scheme, and a group of icons can be displayed multiple times with different color schemes. Below, both company info cards show the same set of colorizable SVGs. A CSS color scheme to match the
        corporate identity is applied on each side.</p>
      <p>For coloring groups of icons a CSS class selector is used. This way each icon with class <code>green-company</code> has a different color scheme than
        an icon with class <code>blue-company</code></p>
    </div>
    


  </div>

  <div>
    <div>
      <h2>Dynamic Color Changing</h2>
      <p>Colors can be changed dynamically while the icons are displayed. Click on the toggle button below to switch between light and dark mode. The color scheme of the icons will change depending on the selected mode.</p>
      <p>The gradient on the icons is defined by three color values. If the switch is toggled, the class <code>dark-mode</code> is set to the documents's body.
        This will activate a "dark-mode" CSS rule which overrides the default color with a dark mode color.</p>
    </div>
    


  </div>

  <div>
    <div>
      <h2>Mouse Interaction and Dynamic Color Changing</h2>
      <p>In this example we use a button state for changing icon colors. Move the mouse over the icons and press and click on them to trigger the color changes.</p>
      <p>The SVG is placed on a button, so we can use the buttons's pseudo class selectors (<code>:hover</code>, <code>:active</code>, and <code>:disabled</code>) to specify different colors.</p>
    </div>
    


  </div>

  <div>
    <div>
      <h2>Text Color as Icon Color</h2>
      <p>When exporting icons as CSS styleable SVGs, you can optionally set the icons' main color as the "free color". For this color the value of current CSS text color will be used.</p>
      <p>Clicking on a color swatch below will set the <code>color</code> attribute of the icons array to the background color of the color swatch. The icons will inherit the color and change accordingly.</p>
    </div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Famous physicist Murray Gell-Mann is supposed to have <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?FeynmanAlgorithm" target="_blank">suggested</a> that Richard Feynman solved problems with the following cutting edge technique:</p><blockquote><ol><li>Write down the problem.</li><li>Think real hard.</li><li>Write down the solution.</li></ol></blockquote><p>Usually when people quote this, it’s to make a joke about how smart Feynman was. (If I tried this, I wouldn’t come up with quantum electrodynamics! I must not be able to think hard enough.) That’s one reading, but I prefer a different one.</p><p>When I started programming professionally, I was really excited about figuring out how to become a better programmer. (I still am!) So I asked a lot of people, “how can I become a better programmer?” But nobody gave me very satisfactory answers. They would tell me to play around with obscure programming languages, or study algorithms, or read papers, or do a bunch of other stuff that felt tangential and didn’t really move the needle.</p><p>In retrospect, I wish those people had just told me “think real hard.” I was looking for an easy way out—One Weird Trick to Programming Better—but programming is too hard for that.</p><p>That’s my preferred reading of the Feynman Algorithm: there is no one weird trick.</p><p>On the other hand, I <em>have</em> gotten a ton better at programming in the last four years. Not through any specific piece of advice, or any weird trick. Rather, it’s come by constantly trying to learn small new things, make small tool improvements, make my models a little deeper, work a little faster, come up with slightly better ideas. By, literally, thinking real hard, for a long, long time. The Feynman Algorithm works!</p><p>(That’s not to say good advice is impossible. I’m sure if <a href="http://www.informatika.bg/jeffdean" target="_blank">Jeff Dean</a> watched me go through my programming day, he would have tons of great tactical tips that would help me a lot. But even that depends on Jeff Dean being able to know which of his 10,000 tactical tips would be most useful to me. And the real difference between us isn’t the tactical tips, it’s the underlying models that generate the tips in the first place. Those seem to be nearly impossible to communicate.)</p><p>A lot of the things people ask for advice on fall into this category. “How can I be happier?” “How can I be more productive?” “How can I have a bigger impact on the world?” Sure, there are basic life hacks like sleeping well or getting exercise. But 99% of the “secret”—the thing that separates me from Gell-Mann, or Jeff Dean—is tacit knowledge. It often can’t be articulated any better than “think real hard.” But, believe it or not, thinking real hard, for real long, <em>does</em> work.</p></article></div>]]>

    </span></p><p>From July 14 to August 17, 2020 (at time of publish), I experienced targeted harassment on GitHub—the company I'm employed at—via coordination happening on several "technology" 4chan threads about me. I wanted to share this story publicly to reiterate the bullshit marginalized folks in tech have to go through in order to be successful, visible, and just <em>exist</em>.</p><p>So as the dude in the screenshot says, I have plenty of material to write a post on <em>all that fuckery</em>.</p><p><span role="img" aria-label="wavy dash">〰️</span></p><p>The first round of trolling occurred in issues and PRs on <a href="https://github.com/katmeister/tokyo-2019">one of my repositories</a> that documents the food I ate with my friends on our spring Tokyo 2019 trip. It was only slightly concerning at first, until I realized that 40+ people were posting, commenting, and emoji reacting.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p><undefined>Here are a few examples. The most irritating ones used tech jargon ("fixing bloat") to mask their pathetic actions. As a bystander, you might not realize until viewing the proposed changes... and seeing all content deleted. This is also the most irritating because there is no obviously hateful or violent content, and can be written off as "just a joke." <span role="img" aria-label="face with rolling eyes">🙄</span></undefined></p><p>This is a specific type of trolling I was experiencing, called "dogpiling":</p><blockquote><p>Dogpiling: When a group of trolls works together to overwhelm a target through a barrage of disingenuous questions, threats, slurs, insults, and other tactics meant to shame, silence, discredit, or drive a target offline. — <a href="https://onlineharassmentfieldmanual.pen.org/defining-online-harassment-a-glossary-of-terms/">PEN America</a></p></blockquote><p>This is not a new tactic used to silence, but it was the first time I've personally experienced it. Good thing I designed a lot of our moderation tools and have talked about the <a href="https://youtu.be/5CSQYMOWOtQ?t=580">taxonomy of online abuse</a> before, and recognized this type of harassment quickly. I was able to get help from amazing coworkers, <a href="https://twitter.com/cheshire137">Sarah Vessels</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/deniseyu21">Denise Yu</a>, to query my repo's referral data. The traffic was coming from 4chan... two 4chan threads totaling nearly 500 disturbing comments.</p><p>Seeing this shit was absolutely surreal. The GitHub content was annoying, but this made me feel sick. I still remember the feeling of being so overwhelmed and just sobbing at my desk. Reading disgusting, racist, sexist comments about me. Seeing screenshots of my face plastered across the threads. Understanding the exact moment where the dogpiling was coordinated. Realizing this was likely to keep happening (and it did).</p><p>And what still really creeps me out is that these people felt so emboldened to troll an EMPLOYEE using their actual GitHub accounts with legitimate work and contributions. <u>These harassers are everyday software engineers.</u></p><p>I'm not famous and I don't have a very large platform, so why me?</p><p>Upon reading the threads, there were some pretty clear reasons why this happened to me. I'll dig deeply into each one. <em>HUGE shoutout to my kat-ops counterpart <a href="https://twitter.com/pifafu">Kathy Zheng</a> for helping me compile screenshots!</em></p><h2>I'm a woman.</h2><p><undefined>Well, this was the most obvious reason. Women disproportionately experience online harassment, and very much so for sexual harassment. I included a few snippets but won't spend too much time on this one because it was some boring, basic bitch shit that we've all seen before <span role="img" aria-label="">🤷🏻‍♀️</span></undefined></p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>This one in particular stood out to me because it's a very specific type of harassment I've received my whole life, usually from East Asians.

The amount of transphobic and anti-Black racist comments because of this was sickening. Attacking allyship is yet another tactic to silence and isolate us.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><h2>I'm not a "real developer"</h2><p>Yikes, there were a <em>lot</em><undefined> of comments about this.

    </span></p><p>I'd like to point out that the idea of avoiding "diversity hires" as to not lower the bar of quality is still a prevalent sentiment within tech. Again, these are not just nameless 4chan trolls—they're people in our industry.</p><h2>... and should be punished.</h2><p>Yeah, these are gross. Apparently I should get fired and deserve the harassment because I'm an attention seeking whore on a programming platform!

    </span></p><p>That wasn't every screenshot from the threads, but is a good summary. The sheer volume of comments was definitely one of the more overwhelming aspects of this fuckery. Thanks for reading along this far.</p><h2>So if it wasn't clear:</h2><p><undefined>I was targeted by racist techies because of my background and visibility in order to be silenced and driven out of this industry. <span role="img" aria-label="middle finger">🖕</span></undefined></p><p>It was particularly cruel to harass me on the platform I work on everyday, where I design for open source communities. I couldn't focus at work and ended up taking two weeks off. This experience has really impacted the way I view tech and my place in it—but I'll save that for another post. </p><p>I've already accepted that this won't be my last brush with online harassment, so long as I'm still a visible Asian woman in tech. And this is going to continue happening to me and less privileged tech workers for just existing and being successful. All we can do is protect and support each other, because it's not our job to fix this problem.</p><p>It's your move next, tech. Here are my suggestions, you can have them for free:  </p><h2>To the most privileged tech leaders:</h2><p>When these events happen to your employees, are you investing actual money to support them? Are you monitoring content, encouraging time off, creating company policies, and covering their therapy? In lucky cases like mine, where the bulk of harassment may happen on the platform the victim works on, are you actively fixing pain points your employee experienced? Make sure you have a policy and detailed playbook, and definitely don't expect your marginalized employees to fix these problems for you. Don't wait until an incident arises—<strong>it's always an "edge case" until someone's personal safety is threatened.</strong></p><p>By not having intentional protections for the most vulnerable in place, you're preventing employees from being productive at work (because they're dealing with bullshit!). And you're absolutely driving away diverse talent from joining your company. It's actually fucking up your business. Access and representation in tech isn't a pipeline or qualification problem. <strong>It's a white supremacy problem.</strong></p><blockquote><p>And what still really creeps me out is that these people felt so emboldened to troll an EMPLOYEE using their actual GitHub accounts with legitimate work and contributions. <u>These harassers are everyday software engineers.</u></p></blockquote><p>Lastly, I want to circle back to this point about users with legitimate coding work harassing me. It's easy to dismiss these trolls as incel 4channers that we shun and don't associate with. Lol no. These are your people. They work at your companies and write your code. They are harassing or doxxing your other employees. This toxic behavior is still very much a part of your tech culture, and you keep rewarding it.</p><p>Fix. This. Shit.</p></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Developing with React hooks is fun for me. I have been developing several libraries. The very first library was a library for global state. It’s naively called “react-hooks-global-state” which turns out to be too long to read.</p><p>The initial version of the library was published in Oct 2018. Time has passed since then, I learned a lot, and now v1.0.0 of the library is published (<a href="https://github.com/dai-shi/react-hooks-global-state" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">react-hooks-global-state</a>).</p><p>This post shows simplified versions of the code step by step. It would help understand what this library is aiming at, while the real code is a bit complex in TypeScript.</p><h2 id="step-1-global-variable">Step 1: Global variable</h2><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>let</span><span> globalState </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  count</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>  text</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'hello'</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><p>Let’s have a global variable like the above. We assume this structure throughout this post. One would create a React hook to read this global variable.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>useGlobalState</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> globalState</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><p>This is not actually a React hook because it doesn’t depend on any React primitive hooks.</p><p>Now, this is not what we usually want, because it doesn’t re-render when the global variable changes.</p><h2 id="step-2-re-render-on-updates">Step 2: Re-render on updates</h2><p>We need to use React <code>useState</code> hook to make it reactive.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>const</span><span> listeners </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>Set</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>useGlobalState</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>state</span><span>,</span><span> setState</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>globalState</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>  </span><span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>    </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>listener</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>      </span><span>setState</span><span>(</span><span>globalState</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span>    listeners</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>listener</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span>    </span><span>listener</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> listeners</span><span>.</span><span>delete</span><span>(</span><span>listener</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> state</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>14</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><p>This allows to update React state from outside.

<p>This project was based on a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24187794">Hacker News discussion</a>, thank you for all your input!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've been recently paying attention to the <a href="https://clothingthegap.com.au/pages/free-the-flag">#freetheflag</a> debate, in short;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Aboriginal flag <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2008L00209">of Australia</a> is widely used by indigenous Australians as a symbol of their heritage. Though, the flag is actually copyrighted by an <a href="https://aiatsis.gov.au/explore/articles/aboriginal-flag#:~:text=Flag%20copyright,the%20author%20of%20the%20flag.&amp;text=The%20copyright%20license%20for%20the,to%20Carroll%20and%20Richardson%20Flags.">indigenous individual</a> who has exclusive control of the licensing rightfully. This has become a debate because a lot of Aboriginals believe they should have a right to print or copy the Aboriginal flag as they would like.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Just a quick shout out to my mob, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuku_Yalanji">Kuku Yalanji</a> people of Far North Queensland)</p>
<p>Over the years I've been trying to learn machine learning but never got anywhere because I couldn't think of a use case. I recently read a cool post from <a href="https://clothingthegap.com.au/pages/aboriginal-flag-timeline">Clothing The Gap</a> which gives an overview of the current copyright debate. They had an image that contains the "Aboriginal flag" done by a European artist several years earlier and how this could maybe be used to invalidate copyright as the design was perhaps already in existence. This gave me the idea to think about if there were perhaps other artworks throughout history that may have contained the flag design.</p>
<p>My main idea was that if I could use machine learning to train a computer vision model to find Aboriginal flags. I could then run it over historical archives of images/paintings to see if I can find any other places the Aboriginal flag seemingly appeared throughout history. Such that in a court case one might overturn the copyright by simply saying they were printing an "Indonesian symbol from the 14th century" (just a potential example)</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nJwFE7K.jpg" alt="asdas"></p>
<p>If you look at the top left of the image, you will see an Aboriginal flag in this painting. I considered my model training a success once it could find the flag in this sample</p>
<p>It does actually work and as you can see in the above image, the model is able to draw a bounding box around the "flag".</p>
<p>I've only scanned 100,000 historical images so far and yet to find any pre-existing artworks that contain the flag. I still have a couple of million images to get through and hope to add a couple million more.</p>
<p>But here is a gallery of false positives, images that the model thought were aboriginal flags but not quite... (if you look at the images for long enough you can see why maybe the model thought it was an aboriginal flag)</p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/Q22VnGK">Results</a></p>
<p>I've also saved some of the resulting data in a <a href="https://airtable.com/shrHq7PG7CF7axGB4">table</a> for anyone who wants to take a closer look.</p>
<p>I will keep working on the project to improve the results, and all of the code is open-source and free to use.</p>
<p>The rest of this post is for people who would like to run the code themselves and learn how to train an object recognition model from scratch. It is less than 20 lines of code in total and I've made everything as simple as possible with all resources available in the repo.</p>
<p>If anyone would like to help me train a better model then please <a href="https://ajaxdavis.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4b3f2324262a382a273c32252f2a3d22380b2c262a222765282426">reach out</a>!</p>
<h2>Technical</h2>
<p>I had no prior experience in computer vision, so I had no idea how I might train a model to do this. I managed to do it in a week, it is super easy for anyone with a bit of programming knowledge. The CV community is big and beautiful and I managed to get my idea working with PyTorch in a night. (I spent a few nights on Tensorflow and didn't get very far)</p>
<p>This tutorial is self-contained and can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/australia/aboriginal-flag-cv-model">repo</a>.</p>
<p>Again, the tutorial contains very little code thanks to a few open-source projects it depends on.</p>
<p>I also had a problem with the complexity of the language in the CV community so I'm going to purposely oversimplify things here.</p>
<p>This is super easy and you could likely have it working in under an hour. (Then add ML to your <a href="https://jsonresume.org/">resume</a>)</p>
<p>We are going to split the tutorial into three steps;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Classification</strong> - We need to manually draw boxes around the objects we are looking for in some sample images. The machine learning will use this human-curated data to train itself.</li>
<li><strong>Training</strong> - Once we have a classified data-set of images, we can use <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> to train a reusable model.</li>
<li><strong>Identification</strong> - Now that we have a model, we want to see if it can correctly find the desired object in a given sample image</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's do it!</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<pre><code>

git <span>clone</span> https://github.com/australia/aboriginal-flag-cv-model
<span>cd</span> aboriginal-flag-cv-model
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
</code></pre>
<h3>Classification</h3>
<p>For the purposes of this tutorial, we are just going to train a model to find Aboriginal flags. But after you've finished this, you should be able to train a model to detect any object you would like. (Simple things, not hard things like if a person is <em>sad</em>).</p>
<p>So the initial classification is a human step, but it's kinda fun to do and will help you understand what the model can detect.</p>
<p>We start with an <code>images</code> folder which is in the <a href="https://github.com/australia/aboriginal-flag-cv-model">repo</a>.</p>
<pre><code>/images
  1.jpg
  2.jpg
</code></pre>
<p>Essentially we have to use our monkey minds to draw bounding boxes around images that contain the desired object we are looking for.</p>
<p>And generate an associated XML file for each file that describes those bounding boxes.</p>
<p>After we are finished our directory should look like</p>
<pre><code>/images
  1.jpg
  1.xml
  2.jpg
  2.xml
</code></pre>
<p>The easiest program to do this in (and a kind of nostalgic UI) is called <code>labelImg</code></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg">https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg</a></p>
<p>You will have to figure out how to install and run it yourself.</p>
<p>Once open, point it at the <code>images</code> folder from the <a href="https://github.com/australia/aboriginal-flag-cv-model">repo</a>, once you figure out how to use the program, you will start drawing boxes and saving the XML to the <code>images</code> directory. And by the end of it, it should look like the directory structure above.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yWL5vcb.jpg" alt="labelImg screenshot"></p>
<p>The XML contains a label that you will be able to define when drawing bounding boxes. The model will require you later to use the same label in the training, for this example you should just use the label <code>aboriginal_flag</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xc7RMDR.jpg" alt="labelImg screenshot"></p>
<p>The way you draw your boxes does change the outcome of the model, for the Aboriginal flag I tended to;</p>
<ul>
<li>Leave a bit of outer space around the shape of the flag</li>
<li>Choose images at all angles and depths</li>
<li>Didn't worry if a limb or object was in front of the flag</li>
<li>Chose real flags, paintings of flags, full-scale images of the flag</li>
<li>A mixture of single or multiple instances of the object</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have your images and associated XML files generated, you are ready to start training.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you get too lazy to classify the 40 images in the <a href="https://github.com/australia/aboriginal-flag-cv-model">repo</a>, just copy the files in <code>images_classified</code> into <code>images</code>. I do recommend classifying them manually your self to see how small nuances might influence the learning model. Choosing images of different shapes, colors, angles, sizes, depth and so on will make your model more robust.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Training</h3>
<p>So next we want to generate a model, and PyTorch/Detecto makes this easy by letting us generate one file to store all of our learned data  in e.g. <code>model.pth</code></p>
<p>We point PyTorch/Detecto at our classified data set and it should spit out a <code>model.pth</code> which we will use later to find our object (flag) in samples.</p>
<p>What really makes this whole tutorial so easy is the fact we will be using a python library called <a href="https://github.com/alankbi/detecto">Detecto</a> written by <a href="https://github.com/alankbi/">Alan Bi</a> (thanks man, beautiful job)</p>
<p>The entire code to go from the <code>dataset</code>(folder of images and XML) to a<code>reusable object recognition model</code> is below.</p>
<p>WARNING: You might need a decent computer to even run 3 epochs let alone 6 so if you just want to get a copy of a decently trained model, just download my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WrL1lV85njUwLR_pYaDD7fh1TV0lFKEN/view?usp=sharing">pre-trained model.pth</a></p>
<pre><code>



<span>from</span> detecto <span>import</span> core
<span>from</span> detecto.core <span>import</span> Model



dataset = core.Dataset(<span>'images_classified/'</span>)


model = Model([<span>'aboriginal_flag'</span>])








model.fit(dataset, epochs=<span>3</span>, verbose=<span>True</span>)





model.save(<span>'model.pth'</span>)





</code></pre>
<p>To run it from within the <a href="https://github.com/australia/aboriginal-flag-cv-model">repo</a>;</p>
<pre><code>python3 train.py // Should output a file called model.pth
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>The PTH file type is primarily associated with PyTorch. PTH is a data file for Machine Learning with PyTorch. PyTorch is an open source machine learning library based on the Torch library. It is primarily developed by Facebooks artificial intelligence research group.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(If the above code didn't run for you, please make an <a href="https://github.com/australia/aboriginal-flag-cv-model/issues">issue</a>.</p>
<p>Now onto the fun part, let's see if our generated model can find what we are looking for!</p>
<h3>Identification</h3>
<p>So now we should have a <code>model.pth</code> and a <code>samples/sample.jpg</code> in the <a href="https://github.com/australia/aboriginal-flag-cv-model">repo</a>, let's run it to see if our model is smart enough to find the object.</p>
<p>Finding the objects coordinates in the picture is easy, but we also want to draw a box around the coordinates which requires just a bit more code.</p>
<p>To run it from the repo</p>
<pre><code>python3 findFlag.py
</code></pre>
<p>The code for that file is below, I've commented in how it works.</p>
<pre><code>

<span>from</span> detecto.core <span>import</span> Model
<span>import</span> cv2 



model = Model.load(<span>'model.pth'</span>, [<span>'aboriginal_flag'</span>])



image = cv2.imread(<span>"samples/sample.jpg"</span>)






labels, boxes, scores = model.predict(image)







print(labels, boxes, scores)




<span>for</span> idx, s <span>in</span> enumerate(scores):
    <span>if</span> s &gt; <span>0.3</span>: 
        rect = boxes[idx]
        start_point = (rect[<span>0</span>].int(), rect[<span>1</span>].int())
        end_point = (rect[<span>2</span>].int(), rect[<span>3</span>].int())
        cv2.rectangle(image, start_point, end_point, (<span>0</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>255</span>), <span>2</span>)

cv2.imshow(<span>"Image"</span> + str(idx), image)

cv2.waitKey(<span>0</span>)

</code></pre>
<p>If you are having a good day, an image should have appeared on your screen. And if you are having a lucky day, then the Python script should have also drawn a rectangle over the image.</p>
<p>That is all there is really, you obviously can just take the outputted prediction data (boxes and scores) and save it to where ever you would like e.g. a database.</p>
<p>If something didn't work feel free to complain in the tutorial repo <a href="https://github.com/australia/aboriginal-flag-cv-model/issues">issues</a>.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I do hope it worked, those steps above worked for me. I drew an Aboriginal flag on paper and took selfies at many angles and the model picked it up. (I manually classified 150 images instead of 40 though) (and if I call recall correctly, around 10 epochs)</p>

<p>This tutorial is meant to be a complete noob guide (written by a noob), how I've described things, and the way they are in computer vision - are two different things.</p>
<p>This task has allowed me to introduce myself to the computer vision sector and I'm sure I will learn more over …</p></div></div>

                    <div>
                        <p>YARH.IO is a fully hackable and custamizable Raspberry Pi based handheld, running Raspberry Pi OS and supporting all other Operating Systems available for Raspberry Pi.</p>
                        <p>The dream of a hackable&nbsp;Linux powered handheld has been around for many years, and many attempts have been made to create a working device. While some of the devices have reached the market, none of them withstood the test
                            of real world user experience.<br></p>
                        <p>YARH.IO project has taken on the challenge of building a fully functioning device by combining the best of Raspberry Pi design and 3D printing technology.&nbsp;<br></p>
                        <p>This project takes hackability to the next level by ensuring that every single component needed to build YARH.IO can be easily sourced, with no custom PCBs and just a bit of wire soldering required.&nbsp;</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div>
                        <p>YARH.IO handheld and its unique modular design with exposed interfaces offers unprecedented connectivity with unlimited platforms and devices.<br></p>
                        <p>This model is powered by&nbsp;Raspberry Pi 3B+ and&nbsp;has the best ratio of functionality and computing power requirements for a mobile device. When it comes to the battery powered devices, the overall power consumption and longer
                            battery are more important then the extra processing power or memory.</p>
                        <p>For this model, the width of the main module is based on the keyboard dimensions for improved handling. The 5" Resistive Touch Screen 800x480 HDMI TFT LCD Display&nbsp;is a good option for YARH.IO as it&nbsp;will allow you to perform
                            all of the usual tasks with ease.&nbsp;<br></p>

                    <div>
                        <p>Fosmon Portable Lightweight Mini Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard Controller has been selected as the best option for YARH.IO's multifunctional design. If you are using Vim, tmux, and Emacs everyday, the available modifier keys will
                            help you get the most out of the device.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the keyboard, YARH.IO's pointing device will allow you to effortlessly browse the internet and engage with other applications with graphical interface.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>
                        <p>A single removable rechargeable battery will allow you to quickly replace an empty battery with a fully charged one. A high capacity Fenix ARB-L21-5000 5000mAh Li-ion Rechargeable Battery was chosen as the best option as it fits
                            the main module perfectly. For the charger/5v power supply the internals of a Fenix ARE-D1 Smart Charger were used.</p>

                        <p>YARH.IO features modular design, where the main module includes Raspberry Pi board, screen, power supply, battery, and RTC and GPIO connector with cables.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>The main module can be used as a fully functioning handheld computer&nbsp;with the touch screen and onscreen keyboard available for the performance of your basic tasks.</p>
                        <p>One shared USB connector is available on the bottom of the main module, allows connecting USB devices like&nbsp;hard drives or Cellular/WiFi adaptors and mounted inside the extension module.</p>
                        <p>Raspberry Pi GPIO connector is also available on the bottom of the main module, allowing for different add-on modules,&nbsp;<br>including Lora radios, RFID readers/writers, and IR transivers, to&nbsp;be mounted inside the extension
                            module. This configuration works extremely well with Pi-DAC+, creating a great handheld audio player.</p>

<p>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 17 Jul 2020</p>
<h2 id="optimal-lecture-time"><a href="#optimal-lecture-time">Optimal Lecture Time</a></h2>

<p>
I recently found this interesting paragraph from an article titled <a href="https://www.ams.org/notices/199701/comm-rota.pdf">Ten Lessons I
Wish I Had Been Taught</a> that is based on a talk presented by
Gian-Carlo Rota in Apr 1996:
</p>

<blockquote>
Running overtime is the one unforgivable error a lecturer can make.
After fifty minutes (one microcentury as von Neumann used to say)
everybody's attention will turn elsewhere even if we are trying to prove
the Riemann hypothesis. One minute overtime can destroy the best of
lectures.
</blockquote>

<p>
That's fine advice. In fact, the whole article is full of good advice
like this. Although it was written primarily for mathematicians, a lot
of what is said in the article applies quite well to professionals in
other fields too.
</p>

<p>
The excerpt I have quoted above got me thinking about exactly how long a
microcentury is. It couldn't be exactly 50 minutes, could it?
</p>


<h2 id="wiktionary-on-microcentury"><a href="#wiktionary-on-microcentury">Wiktionary on Microcentury</a></h2>
<p>
The English Wiktionary entry for <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/microcentury">microcentury</a>
(as of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=microcentury&amp;oldid=59316064">revision
59316064</a> on 7 May 2020) mentions:
</p>

<blockquote>
A time period of a millionth of a century, equal to 52 minutes and 34 seconds.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Not a standard unit of measurement, and used mostly humorously to denote
the maximum length of a lecture.
</blockquote>

<p>
This looks incorrect to me. This is based on the oversimplified
assumption that a century contains 36500 days, that is, it assumes that
a century is a span of 100 years where each year has exactly 365 days.
If a century were to have exactly 36500 days, then indeed it would have
3 153 600 000 seconds and one millionth of it would be
3153.6 seconds which is equivalent to 52 minutes 33.6 seconds. This
looks consistent with the Wiktionary entry. However, an actual century
on the calendar does not have exactly 36500 days. Some years are leap
years, so the actual number of days in a century is more than that.
</p>


<h2 id="assumptions"><a href="#assumptions">Assumptions</a></h2>
<p>
Let us find out how long a microcentury is as accurately as possible. We
will count the leap years. We will ignore leap seconds because they are
irregularly spaced and unpredictable. We will also ignore the following
gap between 2 Sep 1752 and 14 Sep 1752 when the British Empire switched
from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar:
</p><pre><samp>$ <kbd>cal 9 1752</kbd>
   September 1752
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa
       1  2 14 15 16
17 18 19 20 21 22 23
24 25 26 27 28 29 30</samp>
</pre>

<p>
The above output can be obtained by running the <code>cal</code> command
as shown above on a Unix or Linux system. Ignoring this gap is
equivalent to assuming that we are working with the Gregorian calender
since the year 1 AD.
</p>

<p>
We will call a year that is a multiple of 100 to be a <em>centurial
year</em>. Further, we will not debate whether a centurial year begins a
new century or ends one, that is, we don't care whether the current
century runs from 2001 to 2100 or if it runs from 2000 to 2099. The
computation presented in the next section works equally well for any
span of 100 years.
</p>


<h2 id="computation"><a href="#computation">Computation</a></h2>
<p>
Any span of 100 years contains exactly one centurial year, that is, a
year that is a multiple of 100. A centurial year is a leap year <em>if
and only if</em> it is also a multiple of 400. Apart from the centurial
year, a century contains 24 occurrences of years that are multiples of 4
and these are all leap years. From these facts, we can conclude that a
span of 100 years contains:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Exactly 25 leap years if the centurial year within the span is a
    multiple of 400.
  </li>
  <li>
    Exactly 24 leap years, otherwise.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Therefore a century has either 36524 days or 36525 days. In other words,
a century has either 3 155 673 600 seconds or
3 155 760 000 seconds. Here is a
quick demonstration of this with a simple Python program:
</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3

import datetime

for year in range(1, 2400, 100):
    delta = datetime.date(year + 100, 1, 1) - datetime.date(year, 1, 1)
    print('{:04}-{:04}: {} d = {} s'
          .format(year, year + 100, delta.days, delta.total_seconds()))</code>
</pre>

<p>
Here is the output of this program:
</p>

<pre><samp>0001-0101: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0101-0201: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0201-0301: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0301-0401: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
0401-0501: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0501-0601: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0601-0701: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0701-0801: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
0801-0901: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0901-1001: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1001-1101: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1101-1201: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
1201-1301: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1301-1401: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1401-1501: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1501-1601: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
1601-1701: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1701-1801: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1801-1901: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1901-2001: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
2001-2101: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
2101-2201: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
2201-2301: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
2301-2401: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s</samp>
</pre>

<p>
Thus one millionth of a century has 3155.6736 or 3155.7600 seconds, that
is 52 minutes 35.6736 seconds or 52 minutes 35.7600 seconds.
</p>


<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>

<p>
If we round off the number of seconds in a microcentury to one decimal
place, we can say that a microcentury has 52 minutes 35.7 seconds.

September 7, 2020 | http://subpixel.space/entries/open-transclude/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://subpixel.space/entries/open-transclude/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>tl;dr: If you follow this blog you’ve seen me experiment with iframe-based citations; this post is about open-sourcing that tooling. <a href="#tutorial-start" target="_self">Skip</a> to demo, implementation tutorial, and GitHub link.</p>

<hr>

<p>Knowledge tooling is happily becoming a hot topic again. With this trend is coming revived interest in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu">Xanadu</a>, bi-directional hyperlinking, knowledge databases, visualizing knowledge graphs, and so on. At this moment, I see most of the emphasis being put on tooling for the research side, with Notion, Workflowy, and the new and hyped Roam Research leading the way.</p>

<p><img src="http://subpixel.space/uploads/xanadu-shot.png" alt="Screenshot of the OpenXanadu prototpye"></p>

<p>Where I see less focus is the <em>writing</em> part of the knowledge production process, where older apps like Scrivener are still the thing to beat. And almost nobody at all is working on the reader’s experience. As a blogger who largely caters to a wide audience, I’m especially interested in these areas.</p>

<p>Written information is largely still presented as a single document, and writing tools are geared toward the production of long pages. But before I say what’s wrong with this, let me sing the praises of documents for a moment.</p>

<p>People often get carried away when they discover the original vision of hypertext, which involves a network of documents, portions of which are “transcluded” (included via hypertext) into one another. The implication is that readers could follow any reference and see the source material—and granted, this would be transformative. However, there’s a limit to the effectiveness of the knowledge network as a reading experience. “Hypertext books,” online books which are made up of an abundance of interlinked HTML pages, are mostly unpopular. The failure of this experiment is, in my opinion, very revealing.</p>

<p><img src="http://subpixel.space/uploads/sprawlingplaces-shot.jpg" alt="Screenshot of tinderbox map of hypertext book Sprawling Places by David Kolb">
<span>Tinderbox map of a portion of David Kolb’s hypertext book Sprawling Places</span></p>

<p>Knowledge is not an accumulation of facts, nor is it even a set of facts and their relations. Facts are only rendered meaningful within narratives, and the single-page document is a format very conducive to narrative structure. The hypertext books that have gained popularity (I’m thinking here of <a href="http://meaningness.com/">Meaningness.com</a>) have largely conformed to this in two ways: 1) there is an intended reading order, and 2) the longer essays within the project do most of the heavy lifting in terms of imparting the author’s perspective to readers.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the notion of the “document” that is intrinsic to web development today is overdetermined by the legacy of print media. The web document is a static, <em>finished</em> artifact that does not bring in dynamic data. This is strange because it lives on a medium that is alive, networked, and dynamic, a medium which we increasingly understand more as a <em>space</em> than a thing.</p>

<p>For example, consider how silly it is to include MLA-style citations at the bottom of a text when we have the vast capabilities of linked documents on the web. Why should the reader have to read every citation or trust that an author is not taking a citation out of context, when hyperlinks are available?</p>

<p>This all suggests that a compromise must be struck between the coherence of a text and the new opportunities for knowledge work afforded by the fundamental capabilities of the medium: the internet’s connectivity, the screen’s frame rate.</p>

<hr>

<p>My own blogging is one context in which I’ve seen this tension play out, and have been working to explore ways of making my texts richer. A lot of the ideas I talk about in various pieces of writing are connected to one another. When I publish an essay, I’m not done with it. The ideas live on and get renewed, reused, and recycled in later works. Some sentences contain definitions that are core to my mental models, and there are whole paragraphs that might be useful out of context. I’m building my knowledge network in mind maps and behind various SaaS APIs, but how can I publicly show my thinking to be part a cohesive worldview?</p>

<p>Normally people solve this by simply block quoting themselves, but this is a waste of an opportunity. The indented block quote is a print medium invention <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_quotation#Origins">almost as old as typesetting</a>. The block quote is <em>plaintext</em>, it is not actually linked to the original text or its context.</p>

<p>I’ve been experimenting with one idea for a solution, and if you’ve read the last couple blog posts you’ll have seen it there. My stab at an answer is an iframe which shows the quote within its original context and gives a hint at its surroundings. Effectively, it’s a transclusion within my own blog. I’m currently satisfied with what I have as a v1, and am interested to see if others find it useful, so I’m open sourcing it here and including a tutorial.</p>



<p>Open Transclude is a UX pattern, a spec for networked writing within your own blog. Here’s how it looks:</p>



<!-- <script src="/portal.js"></script> -->



<p>What you are looking at is an scroll-locked iframe that links to a quote I picked out of my blog post “Notes on Comparative Psychology.” You can use Open Transclude anywhere you can drop an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag on your own site.</p>

<p>Open Transclude:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Works anywhere on your own domain</li>
  <li>Compatible with most static site generators / templating engines</li>
  <li>12 lines of HTML, 80 lines of SCSS, 22 lines of JS (4.5 kb total)</li>
  <li>Has 0 dependencies&nbsp;— this is native web technology</li>
</ul>

<p>Open Transclude is extremely simple, and the heaviest part of the code is the CSS, which you can simplify at your whim. That’s why I am referring to it as a UX pattern. This is not a protocol. The code is really a commodity. What’s interesting about it is the idea and the design, and this is just one viable implementation! Feel free to adapt it however you like.</p>

<p>The principal improvement over a block quotation is <em>sense of context</em>.</p>

<p>Over on GitHub you’ll find the <a href="https://github.com/tobyshorin/Open-Transclude/">reference implementation for Jekyll</a>. Below is a tutorial for implementing it yourself, by way of also explaining some of the technical design decisions.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="implementation-recipe">Implementation Recipe</h2>

<p>Here’s what you need to do to get Open Transclude up and running.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create an anchor tag in the blog post where you want to cite yourself.</li>
  <li>Create the HTML for the reusable transclusion component.</li>
  <li>Call the portal into any document and passing it Jekyll variables.</li>
  <li>A small piece of Javascript which populates your transclusion into the document.</li>
  <li>Create the SCSS file with the component’s styles.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="1-create-the-anchor-tag-where-you-want-to-cite-yourself">1. <strong>Create the anchor tag where you want to cite yourself</strong></h3>

<p>To quote yourself, you’ll need to create an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> anchor tag in the markdown file for the post you want to quote. If you wish to highlight a specific piece of text, instead create a <code>&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code> around the section you want to quote. Note that this can <em>only be on your own website</em>—it doesn’t work cross domain.</p>

<p>Here’s what it looks like for the example iframe above.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="markdown">It will, for one thing, become newly conscious of itself, and, to the degree that it is, <span>**it will tend to undermine its own experiential integrity**</span>" (emphasis mine).

<span>&lt;span</span> <span>name=</span><span>"mainstream-magic"</span><span>&gt;</span>Ironically, psychology remains one of the closest things we have to a mainstream magic or a mystical art today. Not only is it plainly the direct descendent of medieval magic, as I learned when I read Ioan Coulianou's <span>*Eros and Magic in the Renaissance*</span> earlier this year. <span>**It is a theory of the self that is phenomenologically accurate, objectively wrong, and is based on magical thinking even as it deconstructs itself**</span>.<span>&lt;/span&gt;</span> Some magical thinking processes that happen in psychotherapy, such as <span>[</span><span>transference to the psychologist</span><span>](</span><span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transference#Transference_and_countertransference_during_psychotherapy</span><span>)</span>, are even intended to stay unmentioned to the patient in order to be utilized most effectively by the therapist!</code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="2-create-your-iframe-component">2. Create your iframe component</h3>

<p>This is most useful as a standardized component which can be used across the site, so we are going to take advantage of Jekyll’s templating features. Jekyll and other static site generators like Kirby and Zola support HTML “partials” or “includes” so that you can create reusable components.</p>

<p>In your <code>/_scss</code> or <code>/_sass</code> folder make a new file, <code>portal.scss</code>. I called it “portal” because it’s shorter than “transclusion” and less prone to spelling errors.</p>

<p>Here’s our component:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"portal-container"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"portal-head"</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"portal-backlink"</span> <span>&gt;</span>
            <span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"portal-title"</span><span>&gt;</span>From <span>&lt;span</span> <span>class=</span><span>"portal-text-title"</span><span>&gt;</span>{{ include.title }}<span>&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
            <span>&lt;a</span> <span>href=</span><span>"{{ include.link }}"</span> <span>class=</span><span>"portal-arrow"</span><span>&gt;</span>Go to text <span>&lt;span</span> <span>class=</span><span>"right-arrow"</span><span>&gt;</span>→<span>&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;div</span> <span>id=</span><span>"portal-parent-{{include.anchor}}"</span> <span>class=</span><span>"portal-parent"</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"portal-parent-fader-top"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"portal-parent-fader-bottom"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>        
        <span>&lt;!-- We'll use Javascript to populate the iframe right here --&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>    
<span>&lt;/div&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You’ll notice immediately that the iframe isn’t there yet. Like I mentioned above, we’re going to be populating it with Javascript.</p>

<p>You’ll also see that in various places we’re using <code>{{ include.___}}</code>. A cool thing about Jekyll includes its that it’s possible to define variables and pass them to our include, so we can create reusable components across our site. Dave Rupert has a <a href="https://daverupert.com/2017/07/jekyll-includes-are-cool/">nice blog post about this</a> called if you want to see more advanced examples!</p>

<h3 id="3-calling-the-component">3. Calling the component</h3>

<p>Anytime you want to pull this component into a blog post, all you have to do is <code>include</code> it in the markdown of another blog post, like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="html">  {% include portal.html title="Notes On Comparative Psychology" link="/entries/notes-on-comparative-psychology/#mainstream-magic" anchor="emotional-deficit" %} </code></pre></figure>

<p>When you include it, you’ll need to pass in those three variables - title, link, and anchor, that fill in the includes above. If you’re following along now and making a build in Jekyll, you’ll see an empty, unstyled component with the link. So good so far!</p>

<h3 id="4-populating-with-javascript">4. Populating with Javascript</h3>

<p>This is a good time to address why we need Javascript. Web developers reading this are probably asking why we don’t simply put the full <code>/link#with-anchor</code> into the iframe src and be done with it. …</p></div></div>

        <p id="article-description">How to avoid buying your bike again every 6-12
        months and tips for how to apply the same reasoning to other things, like
        computers</p>
        <hr>
        <figure>
            <img src="http://calpaterson.com/assets/solitary-wheel.jpeg" alt="a solitary wheel left behind after the rest of the bike was nicked">
            <figcaption>
                Rucksack Rupert strikes again
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Some very commonly repeated advice on preventing someone from nicking your
        bike:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Buy a good [~10% of bicycle value] lock, ideally one with a high
            "SoldSecure" rating and lock your bicycle somewhere inside the rear
            triangle and the rear wheel.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I've seen this advice repeated in cycling magazines, in quality newspapers,
        sometimes even by the police and of course on internet forums.</p>
        <p>The above would imply that if you own a £400 bicycle (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/395884/bicycle-average-prices-in-the-european-union-eu-by-country/">a
        typical price in the UK</a>) you'd buy a £40 lock and put it in the right
        place.</p>
        <p>However, it is a cold fact that a cordless angle grinder can defeat any
        bicycle lock, no matter how expensive (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pywN558dJaU&amp;t=198">see this video for a
        demonstration</a>). You can buy a used cordless angle grinder on eBay for less
        than £100. Even U-locks - traditionally thought to be the strongest type of
        lock - are opened in seconds with a sub-£100 angle grinder.</p>
        <p>There is other advice floating around of doubtful value, for example:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Add your bicycle to a national register</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>But cases where BikeRadar manage to reunite bicycles with their owners seem
        to be the exception rather than the rule. Probably this is because, as with
        cars, the first thing you do with a stolen bicycle is take it across a border
        to somewhere different.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Lock your bicycle inside a secure building or place, away from sight</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This prevents opportunistic theft but if this space is shared with others
        (apartment blocks and offices) it in fact serves to increase the economies of
        scale for prepared thieves who break into your storage area late at night with
        a van. It's not uncommon for office bicycle stores (with many fancy, expensive
        bikes inside) to be emptied out completely overnight by professional
        thieves.</p>
        <h2>A threat model, by user persona</h2>
        <p>I think the advice above is poor because it doesn't come from a systematic
        consideration of the problem <em>from the point of view of thieves</em>.</p>
        <p>To come up with better advice requires a threat model, which is a piece of
        jargon for taking a holistic view of the danger posed by attackers. I think one
        of the simplest and most straightforward ways to do threat modelling is by
        <em>user persona</em>, whereby you consider each kind of attacker in turn,
        making some reasonable assumptions about their level of motivation and
        methods.</p>
        <p>As far as bicycle theft is concerned there are three basic types of
        thief.</p>
        <h3>"No-tools Nigel", the rank opportunist</h3>
        <p>Nigel has just his two hands and is simply looking for a ride home or maybe
        something he can sell to a friend for some quick cash.</p>
        <p>Nigel will steal any unlocked bicycle.</p>
        <p>Nigel is also able to take any bicycle parts that can be removed without
        tools. That means any quick-release wheels or thumbscrew saddles. In an urban
        area your parked bicycle may be passed by a Nigel as often as a few times an
        hour so anything that is not bolted down won't last very long.</p>
        <h3>"Rucksack Rupert", the thief with a few hand tools</h3>
        <p>Rupert has a small pair of shears; 4, 5 and 6mm Allen keys and a 15mm
        spanner for wheel nuts.</p>
        <p>Rupert will make his way through cable locks with his shears. If there is a
        valuable part that can be removed with hand tools he will take it. He is
        particularly keen on premium saddles and name brand wheels.</p>
        <h3>"Powertool Percy", the professional with a complete set of tools</h3>
        <p>Percy has a small collection of electric and air tools including an angle
        grinder as well as bolt-cutters and an air-jack. He has access to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fence_(criminal)">criminal fences</a> which he
        can use to sell stolen bicycles quickly. Percy often arrives in his van and
        this allows him to steal multiple bikes at once.</p>
        <p>No bicycle is safe from Percy. No lock can hold against his angle grinder.
        Often he finds if he's wearing a hi-vis jacket he can even get away with using
        his power tools in broad daylight. He's willing to chance that if the bicycle
        seems valuable enough.</p>
        <h2>Coming up with better advice based on Nigel, Rupert and Percy</h2>
        <p>In order to keep your bicycle safe you need to take steps against all three
        levels of imaginary thieves.</p>
        <p>"No-tools Nigel" will be warded off simply by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Locking your bicycle whenever you leave it - even if just for a
            minute</li>
            <li>Ensuring you leave nothing on your bicycle that can be removed without
            tools
                <ul>
                    <li>replace quick-release wheel skewers with bolts</li>
                    <li>take your lights with you when you park in public</li>
                    <li>make sure your saddle is not on a thumbscrew</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>"Rucksack Rupert" will be deterred by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Not using a cable lock!</li>
            <li>Making sure that nothing good can be removed from your bicycle with
            hand tools
                <ul>
                    <li>Lock both wheels <em>and the frame</em> to the bike stand -
                    don't rely on bolts</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>"Powertool Percy" will be kept at bay by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Nothing, save ensuring that your bicycle doesn't look valuable enough
            to be worth his time
                <ul>
                    <li>this probably means keeping its value down below a few hundred
                    pounds</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The virtue of the "bicycle shaped object"</h2>
        <p>Valuable bicycles (&gt;£1000) have an extremely short half-life in urban
        areas. The sad truth is that the Percys of the world are common enough and
        resourceful enough that a bicycle worth over a thousand pounds isn't really
        safe anywhere in a large town. <strong>This includes most e-bikes.</strong> You
        might notice that cycle couriers who have e-bikes tend to eat lunch while
        looking directly at their locked e-bike, so that it never goes out of their
        sight. Few people in other lines of work can do the same.</p>
        <p>If the tyres are inflated, my own commuter bicycle is probably worth £30 to
        the right buyer. My bicycle is so low-end that cycling snobs refer to it as a
        mere "bicycle shaped object". Rather selfishly I am glad that such snobs exist
        as having a lot of more valuable bicycles around provides me with good ambient
        security. No thief is going to bother cutting my locks when there is a
        Campagnolo on the next rack.</p>
        <p>One father I know had his primary-school-age daughter "decorate" his
        commuting bicycle with girly stickers and pink glitter. If anyone examines his
        bicycle closely he looks like a complete loon but I think his motivation is
        right: it's going to be much less appealing to steal when it's covered in Miffy
        stickers.</p>
        <h3>Insurance - not usually worth it</h3>
        <p>What about bicycle insurance? It's fairly expensive here in the UK, usually
        10-15% of the bicycle's value annually and insurers typically only pay out when
        the whole bicycle is taken (so if if your front wheel is nicked, you're on your
        own) and when you can demonstrate that it was locked to their standards. Often
        these standards require that it is locked up indoors which means you're
        chancing it whenever you park away from your home or office.</p>
        <h2>Lists of "best practices" vs having your own threat model</h2>
        <p>The same thing goes for securing your bicycle as for securing other things:
        pat, concrete pieces of security advice are something to treat with a bit of
        doubt.</p>
        <p>In bicycles the common mantra is "spend 10% on a lock" but in computing the
        mantras are slogans such as "use a strong password", "back up your important
        data" or "use encryption" but these can all be just as vapid.</p>
        <p>"Strong passwords!" as a slogan fails to address the fact that the average
        internet user has hundreds of logins for various sites (my own password manager
        has over 700 sites recorded). The majority of internet users decide on a single
        "strong password" and then use it everywhere. They are only a single bad
        sysadmin or javascript injection away from losing access to every account on
        every website they have.</p>
        <p>Backing up your important data is only an aid to your security if the backup
        is stored as securely as the original. Much user data is stolen or exposed
        through poorly secured backups on shared fileservers. A huge number of people
        have passport and utility bill scans in their Dropbox - again, behind the same
        email and password they use everywhere. Companies can be surprisingly sloppy
        with backups too: often dumped into cloud storage somewhere once before the Big
        Migration and never removed.</p>
        <p>Encryption is troublesome as it can give undue confidence that can backfire
        spectacularly: a quarter of a million American diplomatic cables were
        inadvertantly published in unredacted form when a Guardian journalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiLeaks:_Inside_Julian_Assange%27s_War_on_Secrecy">
        included the password for an widely-distributed encrypted file in his book</a>.
        Apparently he thought the file's password was somehow temporary. It wasn't.</p>
        <p>Instead of following such "best practices" it's much more intellectually
        robust to <strong>come up with your own threat model</strong> - then you can
        decide your own concrete steps instead of just following the security steps of
        others which might be inapplicable or even wrong.</p>

<p>A ready-to-install jupyter extension which converts english queries into relevant code. Built as a proof of concept for the problem we personally face of <strong>forgetting less-used syntaxes of pandas and plotly libraries</strong> which is often used in Exploratory Data Analysis. This tool allows us to query in a generic language without having to remember the syntax.</p>

<p>Inspired by cool GPT-3 demos and not having the access to the API, here is an attempt by us to build a Text2Code extension using publicly available libraries. The approach isn't generative, but relies on identifying &amp; matching from a set of predefined <em>intents</em> and generating the relevant code by extracting relevant entities and inserting them in a template. Adding new intents and extending the functionality is easy once the pipeline is in place. </p>

<h2 id="seo-search-engine-optimization-is-the-art-of-enticing-machines-so-as-to-entice-people">SEO (Search Engine Optimization): is the art of enticing machines so as to entice people.</h2>
<p><em>But it’s no longer needed.</em></p>
<p>Granted, the usual stuff applies: Fast page load, responsiveness for mobile devices, spelling and grammer…still apply.</p>
<p><em><strong>But gone are the days</strong></em> of the subtler forms of SEO, where you cared about keyword density, backlinks, and similar things.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-algorithms-and-ai-are-more-advanced-now">The Algorithms and AI Are More Advanced Now</h2>
<p>The algorithms are practically sentient…</p>
<p><img src="https://hawaiigentech.com/post/no-more-seo/webcrawler.jpg" alt="The Algorithms Are Practically Sentient"></p>
<p>At this time, it is now better for you to write content like a human, with personality, and natural.</p>
<p>If you know a subject well, Google especially can sense that. If you are faking, google can sense that too.</p>
<p>Bing search engine likely has comparable talents. Other <em>search engines don’t even matter anymore</em>, as they (such as Duckduckgo and Yahoo) actually source their results from Bing.</p>
<p>Whereas domain authority was previously calculated by backlinks and social network cues, the algos can now sense from your writing alone, along with a multitude of other cues…if you are who you say you are.</p>
<p>On this subject, here is some light reading for you… <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200831214216/https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/guidelines.raterhub.com/en//searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf">https://web.archive.org/web/20200831214216/https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/guidelines.raterhub.com/en//searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf</a> (E-A-T)</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="backlinks-hardly-matter">Backlinks… Hardly Matter</h3>
<p>Before, in SEO, you had the burden of building backlinks. Backlinks helped search engines understand the context of your site and it’s possible popularity and authority.</p>
<p>This, too, could be farmed artificially.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter now.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="keyword-density-dont-need-it">Keyword Density? Don't Need It</h3>
<p>If I were to speak, talk, express myself to you in a awkward, silly, repetitive, redundant manner, you might not like, appreciate, understand me very well.</p>
<p>If I spoke to you with no less than 1000 words, you might be annoyed. You would, most likely, be very, annoyed, angered, frustrated, sad.</p>
<p>You get it? The Algorithms practically have emotions now. They don’t want to hear you talk like that either.</p>
<p>They don’t like SEO tricks.</p>
<p>Don’t use them.</p>
<hr>

<p>Unless you really are a popular person, don’t bother. Sure, social network traffic is great. But artificial popularity on a social network (ie, an army of admiring sock puppets talking about you… doesn’t help anymore). Search engines know who’s real and who’s not (mostly).</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="finally-you-can-be-you">Finally, You Can Be You</h2>
<p>Now that search engines are smarter, you are officially relieved of the burden of SEO. You can be your best you, and you will now thrive for it.</p>
<p>The fakers…they will sink in results. Why? Because nobody likes a cheat, fraud, fake, keyword stuffer, SEO “Expert”.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="ohjust-one-more-thing">Oh…Just One More Thing</h3>
<p>Don’t ever pay an “SEO Expert” again. He’s not applicable anymore.</p>

        <article>
    
    <p>With the introduction of hooks, React got some compelling new instruments – including useReducer, which can be used to implement Model-View-Update within a React component.</p>
    
    <p>While probably intended to "hook up" developers experienced in working with Redux, <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer">useReducer</a> at the same time opens the door for implementing The Elm Architecture, aka Model-View-Update (MVU) quickly and pragmatically.</p>
<h2>The Core Idea</h2>
<p>If you don't know what MVU is and want to learn more first, check out my article on <a href="https://thomasbandt.com/model-view-update">how it works</a>. If you are impatient, I can offer you a shortcut:</p>
<p><img src="https://thomasbandt.com/upload/mvu.png" alt="MVU"></p>
<p>From my perspective, the whole thing's essential idea is to make changes to the state explicit and easy to reason about. That is achieved through:</p>
<ol>
<li>Data is flowing uni-directionally.</li>
<li>Having a view that is a function of the state (model).</li>
<li>Having an update function that is the only place where state changes.</li>
<li>Communicating through messages.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is fair to argue that 1. and 2. are already core principles of React itself. However, <code>useReducer</code> adds 3. and 4. to the game.</p>
<h2>A Practical Example</h2>
<p>Without further ado, let's go through it based on a little example, a login form.</p>
<h3>What Are The Requirements?</h3>
<ol>
<li>There are a user name and a password field, and a submit button.</li>
<li>The button must only be enabled when the user name and password are provided.</li>
<li>When the button is clicked, some work shall be done (e.g., validation/network request).</li>
</ol>
<h3>The State</h3>
<pre><code>interface State {
  userName: string;
  password: string;
  isValid: boolean;
}

const initialState: State = {
  userName: "",
  password: "",
  isValid: false,
};
</code></pre>
<p>That's as unspectacular as necessary, as the core information we are working with is defined at a central place. So whenever you want to access the user name or password, you don't need to go to the form itself.</p>
<h3>The Messages</h3>
<pre><code>type UserNameChangedMsg = {
  type: "UserNameChangedMsg";
  userName: string;
};

type PasswordChangedMsg = {
  type: "PasswordChangedMsg";
  password: string;
};

type Msg = UserNameChangedMsg | PasswordChangedMsg;
</code></pre>
<p>While the definition of messages is not as lean as in other languages (in F#, this would have been a three-liner), TypeScript, fortunately, supports <a href="https://mariusschulz.com/articles/tagged-union-types-in-typescript">Tagged Union Types</a>, which do the job.</p>
<h3>The View</h3>
<pre><code>export default function () {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(update, initialState);

  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;input
        type="text"
        placeholder="User name"
        defaultValue={state.userName}
        onChange={(e) =&gt;
          dispatch({ type: "UserNameChangedMsg", userName: e.target.value })
        }
      /&gt;
      &lt;input
        type="password"
        placeholder="Password"
        defaultValue={state.password}
        onChange={(e) =&gt;
          dispatch({ type: "PasswordChangedMsg", password: e.target.value })
        }
      /&gt;
      &lt;button disabled={!state.isValid} onClick={() =&gt; signIn(state)}&gt;
        Sign in
      &lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now things are getting more interesting. Let's go through it:</p>
<pre><code>const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(update, initialState);
</code></pre>
<p>There it is, our <code>useReducer</code> hook. Calling it returns two things: The current <code>state</code> and a <code>dispatch</code> function.</p>
<p>The <code>state</code> can be used to render the view depending on its properties. For example, as required, the sign-in button is only enabled when <code>state.isValid</code> is set to <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>dispatch</code> function is used to "fire" messages: Whenever the user changes the user name or the password, the corresponding message is being dispatched. Note that it contains the element's value as its payload, for example, in the case of the password:</p>
<pre><code>onChange={(e) =&gt;
  dispatch({ type: "PasswordChangedMsg", password: e.target.value })
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, two questions come up: What happens when a message is being dispatched? And how does <code>state.isValid</code> ever become true?</p>
<h3>The Update Function</h3>
<pre><code>function validate(state: State): boolean {
  return state.userName.length &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; state.password.length &gt; 0;
}

function update(state: State, msg: Msg) {
  switch (msg.type) {
    case "UserNameChangedMsg": {
      const newState = { ...state, userName: msg.userName };
      return { ...newState, isValid: validate(newState) };
    }
    case "PasswordChangedMsg": {
      const newState = { ...state, password: msg.password };
      return { ...newState, isValid: validate(newState) };
    }
  }
  return assertUnreachable(msg);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here it is, the U of MVU, our <code>update</code> function. Its signature is defined by the <code>useReducer</code> hook: It accepts the latest known state and a message it is supposed to process.</p>
<p>Based on some magic of the TypeScript compiler, it is possible to switch through the messages based on the discriminant property type, which all of them provide.</p>
<p>Depending on the message type, we now know what should be changed, <code>userName</code> or <code>password</code>, and so we do. We also set the <code>isValid</code> property, which becomes only true when both the user name and the password contain at least one character.</p>
<p>Side note: The whole thing is exhaustive, which is achieved by the little helper function <code>assertUnreachable()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>function assertUnreachable(x: never): never {
  throw new Error("Didn't expect to get here");
}
</code></pre>
<p>Whenever our tagged union <code>Msg</code> gets a new case, the compiler will notice, and the build will fail â€“ until we add that case to the switch.</p>
<h3>Commands?</h3>
<p>If you already know about MVU, you might have noticed that there are no commands yet. And there won't be any â€“ the <code>useReducer</code> hook doesn't know about the concept of commands. That's why I call it a pragmatic approach.</p>
<p>But that's not the end of the world as it is possible to work around it for most cases. For example, when our sign-in button is enabled and gets clicked, we call another function and pass the current state:</p>
<pre><code>function signIn(state: State) {
  // Do something here ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>We could validate the credentials, make network requests, or do whatever we like. And if the result would be a change of our state, we could pass the dispatch function and dispatch a message from within here.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The example may seem relatively trivial, even too insignificant to use that MVU approach. But if you chose to go down that route, it will come with all the benefits listed above â€“ even for such a relatively simple component.</p>
<p>And once you follow the pattern in more and more components of your application, you will notice that behavior reasoning will become much more straightforward.</p>
<p>PS: See <a href="https://gist.github.com/aspnetde/93bf9cbbac76b7c36b59015ec47cabdf">here</a> for the complete code of the component.</p>

    <p>In 2018, I started working at Bloomberg. Things have changed a lot since. I’m not the most junior member in the company anymore and I’ve mentored quite a few new engineers, which has been amazing. It helped me observe how others differ from me, absorb their best practices, and figure out things I’ve unconsciously been doing pretty well.</p>

<p>Yearly work reviews are a good way to condense these lessons I’ve learned.  They’re valuable for pattern matching, too. Only when I zoom out do certain patterns become visible. I can then <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/the-human-log.html">start tracking these patterns consciously</a>.</p>

<p>The broad theme for this year is zooming out and challenging the boundaries. It’s also about zooming in, and adding nuance to the sections from last year. It’s more fun if you’ve <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/year-in-review-2019.html">read last year’s review first</a>: You can then diff my growth.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup></p>

<p>It all began with a question: How do I grow further?</p>

<h2 id="growing-using-different-ladders-of-abstraction">Growing using different ladders of abstraction</h2>

<p>Entering my second year, I had all the basics in place. I had picked all the low hanging fruit, and my rate of growth slowed down. Not good. The big question in my mind was “How do I grow further?”</p>

<p>There was only so much I could do to improve my coding skills. Most blogs epousing techniques to write cleaner code, repeating yourself, not repeating yourself, etc. are micro-optimisations. Almost none of them would make me instantly impactful.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">2</a></sup></p>

<p>However, I did figure out something insightful. I’m working inside the software development lifecycle, but this lifecycle is part of a bigger lifecycle: the product and infrastructure development lifecycle. I decided to go broader instead of deeper. Surprisingly, the breadth provided more depth to what I knew.</p>

<p>I zoomed out in 3 broad directions: learning what people around me are doing, learning good habits of mind, and acquiring new tools for thought.</p>

<h2 id="learning-what-people-around-me-are-doing">Learning what people around me are doing</h2>

<p>Since we’re not in a closed system, it makes sense to better understand the job of the product managers, the sales people, and the analysts. In the end it’s a business making money through products. The goal isn’t to write code, it’s to be a profitable business.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Most big companies aren’t doing just one thing, which means there are different paths to making money in the same company. Everyone is on at least one path - if they weren’t, they wouldn’t be here.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">4</a></sup> Tracking these paths, and the path I’m on was pretty valuable. It helped me see how I matter, and what levers I can pull to become more effective. Sometimes, it’s about making the sales jobs easier, so they can make more sales. Other times, it’s about building a new feature for clients. And some other times, it’s about improving a feature that keeps breaking.</p>

<p>Product managers are the best source for this. They know how the business makes money, who are the clients, and what do clients need.</p>

<p>Over the year, I setup quite a few meetings with everyone on my path. A second benefit this gave me was the context of other’s jobs. It helped me communicate better. Framing things in the right way is powerful.</p>

<p>For example, one conversation helped me appreciate why Sarah in Sales wants a bulk update tool. Some companies have lots of employees, and  updating them one by one is a pain. The code I write would literally ease Sarah’s pain.</p>

<!-- More recently, I got a chance to sit in on a few product scoping meetings between teams. This gave me a lot more appreciation for the job my PM and TLs do. Communication is surprisingly hard, and aligning different teams takes skill. -->

<!-- Force multiplier in team vs force multiplier in the entire chain. -->

<h2 id="learning-good-habits-of-mind">Learning good habits of mind</h2>

<p>Software engineering entails thinking well and making the right decisions. Programming is implementing those decisions.</p>

<p>A habit of mind is something your brain does regularly. This could be thinking of X whenever you see Y happen, or applying thinking tool X to problem Y. In short, habits of mind facilitate better thinking.</p>

<p>I suspected if I learn the general skill, I should be able to apply it better to software engineering.</p>

<h3 id="thinking-well">Thinking Well</h3>

<p>Software engineering is an excellent field to practice thinking well in. The feedback loops are shorter, and gauging correctness doesn’t take too long.</p>

<p>I dived into cognitive science studies. It’s a permanent skill that’s worth exploring - a force multiplier for whatever I end up doing, and pays dividends throughout my life. One output was <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/Bayes-Theorem-Framework-for-Critical-Thinking.html">a framework for critical thinking</a>. It’s compounding, <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/year-in-review-2019.html#compounding-is-powerful-building-intuition-for-compounding-even-more-so">and compounding is powerful</a>.</p>

<p>There’s lots of good things that came out of this, which I’ll talk about in a bit. They deserve their own section.</p>

<h3 id="strategies-for-making-day-to-day-more-effective">Strategies for making day-to-day more effective</h3>

<p>The other side of the coin is habits that allow you to think well. It starts with noticing little irritations during the day, inefficiencies in meetings, and then figuring out strategies to avoid them. These strategic improvements are underrated.</p>

<p>You decide what to do, and then let it run on automatic, freeing up the brain to think of more fun stuff. Of course, that’s what a habit is, too.</p>

<p>Some good habits I’ve noticed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Never leave a meeting without making the decision / having a next action</li>
  <li>Decide who is going to get it done. Things without an owner rarely get done.</li>
  <li>Document design decisions made during a project</li>
</ul>

<p>This pattern became visible during the review, so I’m keen to pay attention and collect more strategies next year. Having an excellent scrum master who holds me accountable has helped me get better at following these strategies.</p>



<p>New tools for thought are related to thinking well, but more specific to software engineering. Tools for thought help me think better about specific engineering problems.</p>

<p>I’ve adopted a just-in-time approach to this. I look for new tools only when I get stuck on something, or when I find out my abstractions and design decisions aren’t working well.</p>

<p>For example, I was recently struggling with a domain with lots of complex business logic. Edge cases were the norm, and we wanted to design a system that handles this cleanly. That’s when I read about <a href="https://amzn.to/2FdCYUQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Domain Driven Design</a><sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25">5</a></sup>. I could instantly put it to practice and make a big difference. Subsequently, I grasped these concepts better. I acquired a new mental model of how to create enterprise software.</p>

<p>The second way I keep learning and acquiring new mental models is via reading what surfaces on Hacker News. They are interesting ideas, some of which I’ve put to practice, but this is a lot less effective than the technique above. The only reason I still do this is to <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/rationality.html#map-and-the-territory">map the territory</a> - it keeps me aware of techniques that exist, so when I face a problem, I know there’s a method that might help.</p>

<p>The final way I acquire better mental models is by learning new diverse languages. The diversity bit is important. Learning yet another dialect of lisp has a lot less benefit than say, learning C++03, a functional programming language, a dynamic typed language, and a lisp. Today, <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/j-notation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">J seems interesting</a>, and one I might consider learning. It’s a thinking model I haven’t used before.</p>

<p>I’ve gotten lots of value from doing this. Each language has its own vocabulary and grammar, and <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/vocabulary-mental-model.html">vocabulary is a meta-mental model</a>. It’s a new lens to look at how to do things.</p>

<p>When memory management is in your control, you understand how pointers and allocators work. When Python then abstracts this away, you appreciate the complexity reduction. When maps and filters in a functional language show up, you appreciate how Python’s for loops can be improved. Indeed, that’s what list comprehensions are. And then you notice how some things are easier with object oriented programming. There’s no one magic tool that fits everything well. And then you understand that despite this, you don’t have to switch tools. You can adapt best practices from one into another to solve your problems: like writing functional javascript. It’s the principles that matter more than their expression.</p>

<p>Broadly, that’s all I did this year. What follow are insights that sprang forth thanks to zooming out.</p>

<h2 id="protect-your-slack">Protect your slack</h2>

<p>When I say slack, I don’t mean the company, but the adjective.</p>

<p>One thing that gives me high output and productivity gains is to “slow down”. Want to get more done? Slow down.</p>

<p>Caveats apply, but here’s what I mean:</p>

<p>I’ve noticed people rush to solve problems. It can be something they’ve done before, or something we have a template for. It feels pretty good to smash through things. I’ve done that before, too! However, there’s very specific cases where this makes sense.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Whenever I’m working on something new, I take the time to learn things about the system I’m working on, and things closely related to it. If it’s too massive, I optimise for learning as much as I can. Every time I revisit the system, I aim to learn more.</p>

<p>When <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yLLkWMDbC9ZNKbjDG/slack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there is slack</a>, you get a chance to experiment, learn, and think things through. This means you get enough time to get things done.</p>

<p>When there is no slack, deadlines are tight, and all your focus goes into getting shit done.</p>

<p>Protecting your slack means not letting deadlines wrap tight around you. Usually, this is as simple (or hard) as communicating.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16">7</a></sup></p>

<p>Slack might have a negative connotation with “slackers”, but protecting slack is a super power. It’s a long term investment into building yourself up at the cost of short term efficiency.</p>

<p>When I’m quickly dishing out stories, I also have a much harder time fixing bugs. I don’t take the time to create proper mental models of the system, which means my assumptions don’t match the code, and this mismatch is where most bugs lie.</p>

<p>I protect my slack, so I can take the time out to prioritise …</p></div></div>

Mainly because:</p><ol><li>there's no code w/o technical debt - TD is <strong>a "local" maintainability factor</strong> (a multiplier - that can span from very low to extremely high values) for a particular piece of a system; hence it's not separable from good (/healthy) code; consider it an inevitable "property" of any code</li><li>mentally dividing work between "fixing/fighting TD" and "developing features" usually leads to: never doing anything about TD and just going short-cuts all the time (<em>"I'll just do it the quick'n'dirty style, we'll need to refactor all that anyway ... some day"</em>)</li><li>we tend to brand as TD <strong>everything "we don't like at the moment"</strong> (a code written by someone else, a code that uses a library we find passé atm, etc.) - which leads to several types of immature &amp; unprofessional practices and massive wastes ("lava flow" effect, stacking unnecessary abstractions, etc.)</li><li>for the reasons stated above, TD is highly subjective and prone to individual judgment, hence nearly impossible to reliably quantify &amp; measure (regardless of whether you estimate the cost of its reduction or its actual impact on the development process); but it looks like <strong>a great candidate for a universal excuse</strong> (and it's frequently used that way)</li><li>it conveniently puts engineers in "we VS the debt" mode by giving the common enemy (that won't speak up) - some ephemeral "entity" you can stand in opposition to; this detail is important: no-one ever openly admits to the ownership over the TD, it just pops up out of the thin air and hinders the work of poor engineers ...</li></ol><p>Nevertheless, peeling TD out of its name won't make all its negative consequences disappear, right? Naming it explicitly at least makes discussing it (among engineers) easier &amp; (hopefully) more conclusive.</p><p>But maybe there's a better way to tame it? E.g. by ...</p><ul><li>... treating it as something inevitable (as there's no and there'll never be perfect, debt-less code)</li><li>... containing it within component/element/unit boundaries</li><li>... and coming up with a way to "reset" it (once in a while) within those local boundaries?</li></ul><p>I've already written (over four years ago) about some particular concept that can help with that - <a href="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/wiping-the-tech-debt-out-with-immutable-code/"><strong>the immutable code</strong></a>. It may sound weird at first glance, but apparently many companies adopt a similar standpoint:</p><ul><li>they create software with the EXPIRY date (on the level of module/component/piece) and re-create it every few years (because business/scale conditions do change anyway) - as a normal business-as-usual activity</li><li>they optimize not for "perfect architectures" but for future re-writes on the level of module/component/piece (e.g. by enforcing explicit contracts - so after a single component replacement, the whole system doesn't collapse like a house of cards)</li></ul><p>That's (creating with a re-write in mind) actually something I've already covered in <a href="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/are-the-software-product-companies-doomed-to-collapse/"><strong>the different post in the past</strong></a>, so feel free to reach there for more details.</p><p>Great! But what if my system wasn't written in a re-write-friendly way? What if there are no explicit contracts, dependencies are out of control, the only units of abstractions are the language's syntactic constructs (a flat list, w/o hierarchy or varying perspectives) and it's not possible to map certain capabilities/duties?</p><p>HA! And now we've reached a conclusion I was looking for - the main pre-requisite to build a future-proof solution with a TAMEABLE technical debt is ... <strong>by doing a deliberate design</strong>. It can be done up-front or in an evolutionary way - the mode doesn't matter that much. The truly crucial elements are:</p><ul><li>capability-driven composition (driven by purpose, function) with explicit boundaries and dependencies</li><li>the ubiquitous language used everywhere</li><li>wide (expressive) but shallow (w/o internal details) contracts treated as a binding promise to all the consumers</li></ul><p>That's also why so many attempts to reduce technical debt by purely technical refactoring (e.g. splitting big classes, harmonizing conventions, simplifying the flow in complicated procedures) are a pure waste w/o any noticeable positive long-term effect.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>After writing &amp; publishing articles for about two years (consistently), Iâ€™ve sort of created a system when it comes to publishing an article. From ideation to hitting the publish button.</p>

<p>Of course, this system is ever-evolving and over the years, Iâ€™ve tried to tweak it to suit my needs. And today, I think it has reached to a point where I can share it with you and allow you to peek into this very â€œsystemâ€�.</p>

<h2 id="ideation">Ideation</h2>

<p>A couple of years ago, when I started this blog, I was used to writing casually and back then i.e. I was only used to post articles whenever I feel like. But from the previous two years, things have changed. Iâ€™ve started to take it more seriously and started publishing articles quite frequently. Almost daily (of course, with a few exceptions).</p>

<p>You might be asking how Iâ€™ve started writing so much? And where do I get ideas from?</p>

<p>The answer to all these questions is <strong><em>â€œFrom teaching things to myselfâ€�</em></strong>. In a nutshell, whenever Iâ€™m in a situation where I donâ€™t get certain concepts correctly, I would first try to understand the topic thoroughly. And when things get clear for me, I would try to depict the concept in my words. In a way that can make me understand whenever I look upon it next time.</p>

<p>That means I primarily write articles for myself only. And if anyone gets benefitted from my articles, it would be an added bonus!</p>

<h2 id="writing-the-article">Writing the Article</h2>

<p>Next, for writing articles, Iâ€™m using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> because articles are written in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> and nothing is better than the VS Codeâ€™s built-in support for Markdown in my opinion. To get started with a brand new article, all I need to do is whip up a blank Markdown file and pour my heart out in it. Itâ€™s as simple as that.</p>

<p>To make this even better, I use a VS Code extension called <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one">Markdown All in One</a> which add some essential things such as keyboard shortcuts, table of contents, auto preview, and more when it comes to Markdown. It saves tonnes of time fiddling around some Markdown quirks.</p>

<h2 id="fixing-the-article">Fixing the Article</h2>

<p>Once the article has been written, I head to <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/">grammarly.com</a> and paste in my entire article to check for spelling and grammatical mistakes. And once it detects those errors, it can fix those in a cinch.</p>

<p>On top of this, it also suggests alternative words and removal of unnecessary words which can make the entire reading experience a pleasant one.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Back then, I was not very concerned regarding making my articles grammar-correct. But over time, I realised itâ€™s important from the perspective of a reader because Iâ€™m also an avid reader myself. And so the grammar correction step entered into my workflow.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Now is the time to create a nice social banner for the article. It looks something like so on Twitter.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.amitmerchant.com/images/social-banner-demo.png" alt=""></p>

<p>A lot of content creators ignore this but in my opinion, it is a really important thing if youâ€™re posting your articles across different social media platforms. It can make your article stand out because images can grab usersâ€™ attention more quickly than the text.</p>

<p>I use a service called <a href="https://crello.com/">Crello</a> where I create social banners every time I write a new article. The banner contains nothing but the title of the article but alas! in big and attention-grabbing fonts. Itâ€™s all handmade.</p>

<h2 id="publishing-the-article">Publishing the Article</h2>

<p>At this moment, everything is in the place and the article is ready to be published. For publishing the article, all it takes is a simple <code>git push</code> in my case as Iâ€™ve hosted my blog on GitHub Pages and it triggers the new build on every Git push.</p>

<p>Once the code is pushed, it would take 30-45 seconds to make the article live on the holy internet!</p>

<p>And that completes my entire workflow from <em>ideation</em> to <em>publishing an article</em>. Iâ€™ve been following this workflow from the past two years and it has suited me very well and Iâ€™m hoping the continue it for some more time!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><p><span>The creator of </span><a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/The-Ultimate-Component-Storage-System/" rel="nofollow">this project</a><span>, APTechnologies, came up with the idea for the storage cabinet by observing that he would run into trouble when organizing his component library. Rather than having to go across the workshop to get each part, he wanted a way to consolidate everything into one place for easy finding. The system works by first having the user search for a part on an adjacent screen, and then the associated bin will light up if the component is found in the system.</span></p><h3 id="toc-designing-the-cabinet-0"><a href="#toc-designing-the-cabinet-0"><i></i></a><span>Designing the Cabinet</span></h3><p>The storage solution is comprised of a 35 x 12 grid of drawers, which gives ample space for parts. The drawers are laid out according to the spacing between the LEDs in the strip (30 LEDs/meter). They are meant to be printed individually and then slotted in, plus they come in several different sizes.</p><h3 id="toc-fabrication-1"><a href="#toc-fabrication-1"><i></i></a><span>Fabrication</span></h3><p>Each drawer was 3D-printed on a Prusa Mk2S with PLA filament at a .2mm layer height. In order to minimize filament consumption, wall thicknesses are kept very thin, but even with this savings, 5kg of filament was required to fabricate the parts. There is also a small articulating arm that juts out from the side for the HDMI display.</p><h3 id="toc-software-2"><a href="#toc-software-2"><i></i></a><span>Software</span></h3><p>The primary way to interact with the system is through the terminal, which runs a Python 3 script. It begins by checking the text file for data integrity, where it then gets parsed and loaded into an object. Data is stored in CSV-style fashion, with the ID being the first column, the associated LEDs in the second, and finally the quantity in the third column. All subsequent values are optional and simply loaded by the user when the parts is located. A regex is used to parse the user's request, including searching for a component, changing its quantity, adding a new part, and removing a component.</p><h3 id="toc-electronics-3"><a href="#toc-electronics-3"><i></i></a><span>Electronics</span></h3><p>According to the project's creator, the choice for hardware components was quite straightforward. He used a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B in conjunction with a generic HDMI monitor to show the command line interface. For power delivery, he opted for a simple 5V adapter to power both the Raspberry Pi 4 and NeoPixel strip. Since the Pi outputs 3.3v signals from its GPIO pins, a level-shifter is needed, in this case a 74AHCT125. There is an option to use an Arduino Uno via UART if the NeoPixel strip is too unreliable, since the Arduino Uno can supply stricter timings.</p><h3 id="toc-usage-4"><a href="#toc-usage-4"><i></i></a><span>Usage</span></h3><p><span>To add a new part, the command </span><code>PI&lt;ledn&gt;:PI&lt;ledn+k&gt;, &lt;quantity&gt;[, optional parameters]:add</code><span> is sent, which adds a new component to the library. Other commands such as ID&lt;id number&gt; (search for part by ID) and ID&lt;id number&gt;:rm (remove part with that ID) exist to manage added components in the library.</span></p><h3 id="toc-possible-additions-5"><a href="#toc-possible-additions-5"><i></i></a><span>Possible Additions</span></h3><p>Although the system works well for one place and a small collection of components, it tends to scale poorly when there's a large library or multiple users want to interact with it. One way to solve this issue is to replace the single text file with a relational database such as MySQL, where parts can be stored and indexed in a single table, and other data can be referenced. This gives a very powerful interface for the software to easily search, add, and modify parts without having to read and rewrite the text file constantly.</p></div></section><section></section><div><div><a href="https://www.hackster.io/gatoninja236"></a><div><p><span><a href="https://www.hackster.io/gatoninja236">Arduino “having11” Guy</a><span></span></span></p><p>18 year-old IoT and embedded systems enthusiast.

<p>There is a huge gap between the benefits of Artificial Intelligence the public is being sold, the benefits of AI which are being marketed to corporate adopters, and the actual motivations of AI researchers.</p>



<ul><li>Tech providers pitch AI as a driver of innovation (self-driving cars) and global good (mitigating global warming).&nbsp; But the B2B case-studies pitched to corporate clients more often pitch AI solutions as <em>better automation, </em>mostly enabling cost-reduction (specifically, reducing human-in-the-loop labor).</li><li>While many AI researchers are motivated by genuine interest in improving the human condition, other motivations diverge — a desire to push the bounds of what we <em>can </em>do, a genuine belief in transhumanism (the desire for AI to replace, or transform into something entirely unrecognizable, humanity), or simply because AI pays bigly.</li></ul>



<p>These drivers — replacing human employment, and perhaps humans themselves — are, to put it mildly — not visions the public has bought into.</p>



<p>But these internal motivations are drowned out by the marketing AI pitch by which AI is sold to the public: “AI will solve [hunger/the environment/war/global warming]”.&nbsp; This leaves the people not “in the know” about AI progress — 99% of the population — not even <em>thinking </em>to use democracy to direct AI research towards a world the (average) person actually wants to live in.</p>



<p>This is not particularly fair.</p>



<p><strong>Marketed AI vs Profitable AI</strong></p>



<p>To the public, the tech giants selling AI solutions (Google, Microsoft, and Apple) pitch visions of AI <em>for good</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The public face of these advertising campaigns is usually brand advertising, perhaps pitching consumers on a software ecosystem (Android, iOS), but rarely selling any specific product.&nbsp; This makes it easy to sell the public a <em>vision </em>of the future in HDR, backed by inspirational hipster soundtracks.</p>



<p>You all know what I’m talking about — you’ve seen them on TV and in movie theaters — but the imagery is so<em> honed, </em>so <em>heroic, </em>that we should look at the pictures anyway.</p>



<p>Google’s AI will do revolutionary things, like fix farming, improve birthday parties, and help us not walk off cliffs:&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/jId-kNaiaBP0HNR6FjXXaS3HPKHoVr_tLUjEjjGS5sZ23IF1718IWzLeD719RSqO2Aj6vx3oDgeedE_Yjg5xcdNzl2IC71KP79uS0gUjyHSMEkLI1VALL8iqmwdhWXxTdGN7Qm2j" alt=""></figure>



<p>Microsoft’s AI is safe.&nbsp; You can tell because this man is looking <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai?activetab=pivot1%3aprimaryr5">very thoughtfully</a> into the distance:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/JKMsdtPMVmd5PHVOAgCleWpG4WctVm-3rGxiM70Tg0HsmDgdxYysjqjGR_zn0I8SEs-lLQxpOyKqxFI_RioIuGDGUFMillFX4T7IxZPI6jHpNiQ10YWpCoodiWli-Z8IxlRVFxq4" alt=""></figure>



<p>But if that is not enough to convince you, here is a bird:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_NtL_Yy86NCoL4J_2kOpzAObYf9KTQ2D0i98JV4PnuAAE-yCqqAOXv7NGB_BSL8KJ-zBLGuiuqI5-fqmFkXLDVIONHPvvUWY6XWzjKC6D0LRaIVXjixdCWaidceDERUBRz-OyjP0" alt=""></figure>



<p>Microsoft goes into detail on their “AI for Good” page.&nbsp; The testimonials highlight the power of AI as applied to:</p>



<ul><li>Environmental sustainability (image recognition of land use, wildlife tracking, maximizing farm yields)</li><li>Healthcare (dredging through data to find diseases)</li><li>Accessibility (machine translation, text to speech)</li><li>Humanitarian action and Cultural Heritage preservation</li></ul>



<p>Even the Chinese search engine Baidu, not exactly known for their humanitarian work, <a href="https://internetofbusiness.com/baidu-becomes-first-chinese-firm-to-join-us-safe-a-i-consortium/">has joined</a> the OpenAI “safe AI” consortium, which is nominally dedicated to developing and selling only <em>safe </em>AI.</p>



<p>The theme among all these public “good AI” initiatives — the sales pitch to the public — is:</p>



<blockquote><p>“We’re developing advanced AI, but we’re partnering with NGOs, hospitals, and more, to make this AI work <em>for </em>people, not against them.&nbsp; Look at all the good we can do!”</p></blockquote>



<p>This isn’t fake.&nbsp; Microsoft <em>is </em>working with nonprofits, NGOs, and more, to deploy for-the-people AI.&nbsp; But these applications don’t get us closer to the <em>real </em>question:</p>



<p>“What solutions are <em>normal</em> companies <em>actually deploying </em>with AI-as-a-service cloud technology?”</p>



<p>We can peek behind the curtain at Amazon.&nbsp; Amazon’s AWS has been for the last decade synonymous with “the cloud”, and still has a full 50% market share.&nbsp; The bleeding edge of AWS are plug-and-play machine learning and AI tools: Amazon Forecast (machine learning), Amazon Polly (text to speech), Amazon Rekognition (video object recognition), Amazon Comprehend (natural language processing), and more.</p>



<p>And Amazon, alone and refreshingly among tech giants, <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3463071/aws-is-ethical-about-ai-but-we-just-don-t-talk-about-it-say-apac-execs.html">doesn’t even pretend</a> to care why their customers use AI:</p>



<blockquote><p>“We certainly don’t want to do evil; everything we’ve released to customers to innovate [helps] to lift the bar on what’s actually happening in the industry. It’s really up to the individual organisation how they use that tech”</p></blockquote>



<p>Amazon sells AI to C-suites, and we know what the hooks are, because the marketing pitches are online.&nbsp; AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/customers/?customer-references-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.publishedDate&amp;customer-references-cards.sort-order=desc&amp;awsf.customer-references-category=category%23ai-ml&amp;awsm.page-customer-references-cards=2">publishes case studies</a> about how their plug-and-play AI and ML solutions are used by customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We can look at a typical example <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/dxc/?did=cr_card&amp;trk=cr_card">here</a>, outlining how DXC used AWS’s ML and AI toolkits to improve customer service call center interactions.&nbsp; Fair warning:&nbsp; the full read is catastrophically boring — which is to be expected when AI used not to expand the horizon of what is possible… but instead used to excise human labor from work which is already being done:</p>



<blockquote><p>“DXC has also reduced the lead time to edit and change call flow messaging on its IVR system. With its previous technology, it took two months to make changes to IVR scripts because DXC had to retain a professional voice-over actor and employ a specialized engineer to upload any change. With Amazon Polly, it only takes hours”</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Using Amazon Connect, DXC has been able to automate password resets, so the number of calls that get transferred to an agent has dropped by 30–60 percent.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>DXC anticipates an internal cost reduction of 30–40 percent as a result of implementing Amazon Connect, thanks to increased automation and improved productivity on each call.</p></blockquote>



<p>In total, what did DXC do with its deployed AI solution?&nbsp; AI is being used to:</p>



<ul><li>Replace a voice-over actor</li><li>Eliminate an operations engineer</li><li>Eliminate customer service agents</li></ul>



<p>There’s nothing evil in streamlining operations.&nbsp; But because of the split messaging being used to <em>sell </em>AI research to the public vs to industry — on one hand, visions of environmental sustainability and medical breakthroughs, and on the other hand, the mundane breakthrough of applying a scalpel to a call center’s staffing — the public has little insight (other than nagging discomfort) into automation end-game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The complete lack of (organized) public anger or federal AI policy — or even an <em>attempt </em>at a policy — speaks to the success of this doublespeak.</p>



<p><strong>Research motivations</strong></p>



<p>So why are actual engineers and researchers <em>building </em>AI solutions?</p>



<p>I could dredge forums and form theories, but I decided to just <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/gz5so7/why_are_you_personally_working_on_ai/">ask on reddit</a>, in a quick and completely unscientific test.&nbsp; Feel free to read all the responses — I’ve tried to aggregate them here and distill them into the four main themes.&nbsp; Weighted by upvotes, here’s the summary:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/DvF1XOwrQOuSnpwX0z5y1YLq3keBLTdqSQqyOKj1FrdmNANo2gVWZXWjHnp282aio1EzBBfWMYNPfof4MKZDdeJoQKe18Znbw0jI-iI2QxmmeVkF-MTWGGOsnF1xAaSlMUCtiilV" alt=""></figure>



<p>Preface: none of these are radical new revelations.&nbsp; They match, in degrees, what you’d find with a more exhaustive dragnet of public statements, blogs, or after liquoring up the academic research mainstream.</p>



<p>Walking down the list:</p>



<p><strong>1. Improving the human condition</strong></p>



<p>A plurality goal is to better the human condition, which is promising.&nbsp; An archetypal response is a vision of a future without work (or at least, without universal work):</p>



<blockquote><p>“I believe the fundamental problem of the human race is that pretty much everyone has to work for us to survive.</p><p>So I want to work on fixing that.”</p></blockquote>



<p>It’s not a vision without controversy — it’s an open question whether people can really live fulfilled lives in a world where they <em>aren’t</em> <em>really needed —</em> but at minimum it’s a vision many could get behind, and is at root predicated in a goal of human dignity.</p>



<p><strong>2. It pays</strong></p>



<p>Close behind are crude economics.&nbsp; Top comment:</p>



<blockquote><p> “Dat money”</p></blockquote>



<p>I don’t intend to sound negative — capitalism is the lever which moves the world, and in capitalism, money follows value.&nbsp; But as shown by AWS, value can come from either revolutionary invention (delivering novel value), or cost excision (delivering <em>cheaper </em>value).</p>



<p>Either direction pays the bills (and engineers), and few megacorp engineers care to peek behind the curtain at which specific aspect of the AI product delivered to clients pays the bills.</p>



<p><strong>3. Transhumanism</strong></p>



<p>Here’s where the interests of true believers in AI diverge from the mainstream.&nbsp; Top comment:</p>



<blockquote><p>“I don’t really care about modern ML solutions, I am only concerned with AGI. Once we understand the mechanisms behind our own intelligence, we move to the next phase in our species’ evolution. It’s the next paradigm shift. Working on anything else wouldn’t be worth it since the amount of value it brings is so vast.”</p></blockquote>



<p>“I’m in it for the money” is just realism.&nbsp; “A world without work” and “making cheddar” are motivations which appeal to the mainstream, and is at least comprehensible (if frustrating) to those whose jobs are on the line.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism">Transhumanism</a> is different.&nbsp; There’s a prevalent (although possibly not majority) philosophy among many AI researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts, that the goal of developing strong (human-level) AI is not a tool <em>for </em>humans, but an end unto itself.&nbsp; The goal is the creation of a grander intelligence beyond our own:</p>



<blockquote><p>“Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an ‘intelligence explosion,’ and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Or, step-by-step:</p>



<ul><li>Humans create AI 1.0 with IQ human + 1</li><li>AI 1.0 creates AI 2.0, which is slightly smarter</li><li>AI 2.0 creates AI 3.0, which is WAY smarter</li><li>AI 3.0 creates AI 4.0, which is incomprehensibly smarter</li></ul>



<p>And whatever comes next… we can’t predict.</p>



<p>This is not a complete summary of transhumanism.&nbsp; There’s a spectrum of goals, and widespread desire for AI which can integrate <em>with</em> humans — think, nanobots in the brain, neural augmentation, or wholesale digital brain uploads.&nbsp; But either way — whether the goal is to retrofit or replace …</p></div></div>

<p>It was a warm spring evening in London and David Graeber, an anthropology professor at the LSE, was sitting on a rooftop. Our conversation was transmitted through the Internet because of the global travel ban due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, we did not only talk about the new virus and its consequences for society, politics, and the economy. We took the rare opportunity to discuss most of his published works – from the <em>Fragments of Anarchist Anthropology</em> and <em>Debt</em> to <em>Utopia of Rule</em>s, and his most recent book <em>The Bullshit Jobs</em>. All of which have become even more relevant during the corona-crisis.</p>



<p>Professor Graeber presents himself as an anthropologist and anarchist. However, he will not be happy if you refer to him as an “anarchist anthropologist” because there is no such discipline, which he explained during the conversation. The professor is also an activist. He joined many social movements and protests in the last few decades and is often credited as the author of the unofficial slogan from the Occupy Wall Street movement: We are the 99 percent. But he insists that the slogan – as well as everything else in the movement – was a collective effort.</p>



<p>How can democratic governments use this health crisis to enforce authoritarian measures on their citizens? Why don’t the health and care workers strike, during the pandemic, for higher wages? What would happen if we closed Wall Street for a few months? Why do we only see flying cars as special effects in science fiction movies? How can anarchistic principles bring order into chaos during the crisis? Why do we not want to depend on the Chinese and US armies to save our planet?</p>



<p>And finally – how can a drunken rant become a best-selling book?</p>

<p><strong>Everybody seems to be speaking the same language during the coronavirus pandemic – from progressive and conservative governments to ISIS and the anarchists: stay at home, wash your hands, avoid other people … And people have been listening to the officials without much protest. They stayed at home and accepted the new rules. We have not seen anything like this for a long while. What has happened?</strong></p>



<p>Well, there are just not all that many people who are quite crazy enough to ignore medical advice during a pandemic.</p>



<p>It brings to mind the 19<sup>th</sup> century French political thinker Henry Saint-Simon—who might have been the first person to come up with the notion of withering away of the state. He argued that if the state was refounded on scientific basis, eventually it would not need to rely on coercion, and therefore, it wouldn’t even be a state in the contemporary sense of having a monopoly of violence.</p>



<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>



<p>For the same reason, he said, that doctor doesn’t have to threaten to beat you up to convince you to the medicine they prescribe. You know the doctor knows something you don’t know, and you assume the doctor is acting in your best interest. Saint-Simon argued once the state was rationally founded on scientific principles, citizens would act in the same way, and coercive enforcement would become unnecessary. Maybe they’d be a few nutty people who refuse to take their medicine but not enough to make much difference.</p>



<p>Obviously this was all very optimistic and naive—that’s why Marx dismissed people like Saint Simon as “utopian socialists”. But there are certain branches of the government that still claim to operate on such basis. And one could make the argument that they’re not by their nature part of government at all.</p>



<p>During the student movement in the UK in 2010 we talked about this a lot, we were mostly anarchists, but we believed in a public health system, and a public university system. Was this hypocritical? None of us felt it was, but we talked a lot about why. Perhaps the problem is that states don’t allow the existence of public institutions – that is, ones which are both universal and non-profit-oriented – that they don’t control. That doesn’t mean those institutions are somehow of the same nature as the army, or prison system, which are entirely creatures of the state.</p>



<blockquote><p>The idea that knowledge is always a form of power is very flattering to academics, who have a great deal of one and very little of the other, so it’s hardly surprising they like it so much.</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>Yes and of course Foucault would say the authority that does not need a violent force to enforce itself is the scariest kind of all.</strong></p>



<p>He would. Though I think Foucault is often misinterpreted in this regard, to assume that any truth discourse is a form of power, and every form of power is violent and objectionable in itself. True, he sometimes sounds as if that’s what he’s saying. But if specifically challenged, he’d always say, no, no, obviously not.</p>



<p>The idea that knowledge is always a form of power is very flattering to academics, who have a great deal of one and very little of the other, so it’s hardly surprising they like it so much. Foucault himself had his own immediate concerns – he was diagnosed as a homosexual in his youth, and wanted to understand how it came about that his most intimate desires could be considered a disease.</p>



<p>He effectively dedicated his life to trying to understand that. But many on the academic left forget that, such diagnoses were not just abstractions, they ultimately relied on force of law, on the threat of physical violence, even if the doctor isn’t personally carrying a gun. A kind of vulgar Foucauldianismn has encouraged us to overlook how much the threat of force really does still lurk behind most of the institutions he describes.</p>



<p>The Panopticon was a prison after all. Normally if you think someone might be staring at you at any moment, you just go someplace else. Actually things have gotten rather worse in that respect since Foucault’s time. There didn’t used to be actual armed guards in schools and hospitals; now in many places there are.</p>



<p><strong>Many governments all over the world are using public health to enforce measures that could not have been imaginable in democratic societies only a few months ago. In Slovenia, for example, individuals are fined when they try to protest against the government actions. Not for protesting, of course. That would be undemocratic. But for violating the law on infectious diseases. So the only groups of people that are allowed move freely are the police, the army, and the politicians.</strong></p>



<p>That does not surprise me. You can learn a lot of things about your state by comparing how they treat a political assembly, and any other kind.</p>



<p><strong>In what way?</strong></p>



<p>In liberal democracies, the entire justification for a country’s legal structure is, typically, some kind of ideal of human freedom and liberty. The American bill of rights begins with the freedom of speech, freedom of press, and freedom of assembly. In practice, the assembly of people that gather in order to protest – which is the very essence of what is supposed to be American – is considered <em>less</em> legitimate than an assembly of people who want to sell you something.</p>



<p>You point this out to most middle-class Americans, they seem incredulous. Poor ones not so much, they don’t assume the rules are fair. Anyway: they’ll say “but of course you have the right to assemble, you just need a permit, what’s wrong with that?” So you have to say “all right, if you have to ask police permission to print something, that’s called not having freedom of the press. If you have to ask police permission to say something..” And they’ll say, “but that’s different! There are traffic issues. You can’t just gather. It gets in the way of people walking down the street” Which is funny, because I don’t remember anywhere in the constitution it says anything about the right to unimpeded traffic flow.</p>



<p>We learned that lesson during the Occupy movement. It was startling, after they evicted our camp, how many middle class Americans just shrugged their shoulders when they went on to rip up the Bill of Rights, the very thing they teach their children to be so proud of…</p>



<blockquote><p>The Anonymous movement has shown that you can have meaningful and impactful protests online. And people all across the world are inventing new ways to protest from their home.</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>You were trying to occupy a public space?</strong></p>



<p>Any space. After they evicted us from Zuccotti Park, we tried to reestablish a new camp because… well, it was crucial that everyone knew where we were. That was what was so effective about the original occupation: anyone in the city who felt they wanted to get involved knew where they could go and plug in instantly.</p>



<p>At first we thought we could relocate to a huge lot near Wall Street that belong to the Episcopalian Church, they agreed, but huge pressure was place on the Church hierarchy and eventually they reversed themselves. We had a march led by several bishops trying to occupy anyway; the cops beat us up, and the media refused to show any footage of the priests but only anyone in masks to make us look violent and scary.</p>



<p>Then we occupied a park that was open all night and they changed the rules of the park. We then got a legal ruling from a judge that we could sleep on the sidewalk as long as we do not take more than half of it. So the city just passed an order that Lower Manhattan was an emergency zone where legal decisions do not apply. So we decided to occupy the stairs of the building where the Bill of Rights was actually signed, which is right near Wall Street incidentally, but wasn’t under city jurisdiction. We were immediately were surrounded by SWAT teams and after two days they found a way to force us from there.</p>



<p>We tried everything to set up a legal alternative. But the state completely simply shredded the very legal principles that they teach children are what makes them proud to be Americans, and the media didn’t even cover it.</p>



<p><strong>But what can you occupy when you are not allowed to even leave your own apartment?</strong></p>



<p>There are always things you can do. The Anonymous movement has shown that you …</p></div></div>

When I say “trying”, I really meant I spent some time configuring and using those editors. The ones I spent time using are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://neovim.io/">neovim</a>, my main, daily editor I use for pretty much almost all projects I work on.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea">IntelliJ IDEA</a>, that I currently use at work to hack on Java codebases.</li>
<li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>, that I have been trying mainly in Rust, TOML and Markdown.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs">emacs</a>, that I highly hacked around to play on my Haskell and Rust codebases (and YAML / Markdown / TOML too).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs">DOOM Emacs</a>, that I tried when I saw a colleague in a previous company I worked in (I was impressed by the “united” feeling of the UI and by how everything looked so slick). So I gave it a try.</li>
<li><a href="https://atom.io/">atom</a>, <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>’s take on editors. Same thing, mostly Rust, Haskell, etc.</li>
<li>A bunch of others that I won’t talk about because I quickly stopped using.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of this article is to create a temporal “snapshot” of my views on editors and what I think about the current situation. I have been using vim and especially neovim for more than a decade. I need to explain about my current workflow and what I cherish in editing before talking about each editors. Expect a point of view from a neovimer which is looking around at lots of editors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is only a personal workflow / point of view that works well <em>for me right now</em>. It doesn’t mean it will for you and it doesn’t mean a different workflow would be worse.</p>

<h2 id="keyboard-layout">Keyboard layout</h2>
<p>I am French and I’m using a keyboard layout that is made to type very quickly in French and to code. With hindsight, since I type more often in English than in French, maybe I should have picked another keyboard layout, but the coding experience in my keyboard layout is really great, so I stick around.</p>
<p>The keyboard layout is <strong>bépo</strong>. I learned bépo the “recommended” way — i.e.&nbsp;you have to practice <em>typing</em> (« dactylographie » in French). It means that I use all my fingers to type on a keyboard, and that each key on the keyboard is assigned <em>a single finger</em> that will press it. That helps a lot with muscle memory and to reduce wrist pain (my wrists barely move when I type on a keyboard), among other things. The typing speed is a side-effect of being accurate and having good comfort (if you are curious, I’m pretty fast but there are faster people — I type at around 120 to 130 words per minute). Because I think the speed doesn’t matter when programming, I think the most important part to remember here is the comfort: the wrists don’t move and my fingers fly around the keyboard, whatever the speed.</p>
<h2 id="modal-editors">Modal editors</h2>
<p>I think a modal editor is superior, for various reasons. The first one is that I truly <strong>hate</strong> having to use a <em>mouse</em> for something that can be done without having to move around hundred of pixels with your cursor and clicking on buttons. For instance, running an application, on my current machines, is simply typing <code>alt d</code>, the name of the program (I typically use completion, so I never type fully the name of the program) and hit enter. All this without moving my hands from the keyboard. And I do that for programs like <code>firefox</code>, <code>kdenlive</code>, etc. but for terminal applications, I simply type and complete them in my terminal, which I open simply with <code>alt return</code>.</p>
<p>So, using a mouse to move around a cursor in an editor feels like completely suboptimal to me, especially because we write code (i.e.&nbsp;we type on a keyboard) most of the time, so moving around with the mouse implies several back and forth movements between the keyboard and the mouse. Maybe you don’t care and it’s cool to you, but to me, this is truly <em>horror land</em>. I feel <em>very</em> uncomfortable when doing this.</p>
<p>Also, <em>modern editors</em> that are not modal typically make people move by using the arrows keys, which are either far on your keyboard, or — like my keyboard, a 60% home made one — not in direct access and then require a function key to enable them.</p>
<p>So that’s the first reason why I like modal editors. They make a smarter use of your keyboard for simple yet recurrent features, like moving around — e.g.&nbsp;<code>h j k l</code>. The second reason why I like them is because of the facts they have a completely new mode for non-modal editor (i.e.&nbsp;the <em>normal</em> mode), you have a whole keyboard / lots of keys to bind actions to and do lots of things people usually do with the mouse. Being able to split an editor into several buffers, move around the buffers, go at the beginning of the paragraph, search and replace, register actions into macros and replay them, etc. All this without even moving the wrists. The learning curve is steep if you’re used to the mouse, but once you’ve passed the mental barrier, really, and this is a personal opinion, but I truly think that using the mouse again after that feels like handicap to me.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-like-to-move-around">How I like to move around</h2>
<p>When I look at people coding, I see several kind of programmers:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ones who move with the arrows or with <code>h j k l</code> in modal editors. You can spot them very easily at how the cursor moves in a document. It typically implies keeping a key pressed until the cursor reach a given row, then pressing another key until the cursor reach a given column and then adjust if they went passed the location they had in mind.</li>
<li>People using the mouse, by clicking at the place they want to put the cursor at.</li>
<li>People using <em>relative numbers</em>. That’s an enhancement of the first group: they typically use relative numbers to know which lines they want to jump to very quickly, so that they don’t have to press the up / down keys for ages until reaching the line they want to. Instead, they look at the number on the lines, press that number, and the direction, and bam, they are on the lines. They then use typical motions from vim like <code>$</code> (go to end of line), <code>f</code> (go to the first occurrence of the next character typed after <code>f</code>, like <code>f(</code> will make your cursor go to the next <code>(</code>), <code>%</code> (go to the matching delimiter) or <code>w</code> (go to the beginning of the next word) / <code>b</code> (go to the beginning of the previous word), etc. to move faster on the same line (it works across lines too).</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that represents 99,9% of what I see people do. Obviously, you will get that I don’t belong to the second set of people… but I don’t really belong to any, actually. How I move is, I guess, convoluted for most people and I know some people won’t understand how it can feel. I use <code>h j k l</code> and all the motions from vim described in the third group (and even more; I full lecture of four hours would be required to explain all of them :D), but it all depends on the <em>distance</em> I need to travel. If my cursor is on a word and I want to move to the beginning of a word located very closely to my cursor on the same line, I’ll simply type <code>www</code> if it’s three words apart (or <code>3w</code> if I’m feeling funny). If the distance is higher, I use a tool called [EasyMotion].</p>
<p>Easymotion really is a wonderful tool. The idea is that it has several modes, depending on the kind of move you want to perform:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>By lines</em>: this mode allows you to jump to any line in the current (or all open) buffers.</li>
<li><em>By words</em>: tihs mode allows you to jump to any “word” in the current (or all open) buffers.</li>
<li><em>By characters</em>: when the <em>word</em> mode doesn’t help with jumping to a special operator or character (because it’s not recognized as a word), this mode allows you to jump to any character in the current or (or all open) buffers.</li>
<li>It has other modes but I have never really found useful cases for them.</li>
</ul>
<p>The way I typically do it is by mapping the three modes to <code>&lt;leader&gt;l</code>, <code>&lt;leader&gt;w&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;leader&gt;c</code> (in my case, <code>&lt;leader&gt;</code> is the <em>space</em> key).</p>
<p>Typing <code>SPC l</code> in my current buffer results in this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://phaazon.net/media/uploads/easymotion_lines.png" alt=""><figcaption>EasyMotion lines</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Typing any highlighted character will make my cursor jump to it. The same applies for words, with <code>SPC w</code>:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://phaazon.net/media/uploads/easymotion_words.png" alt=""><figcaption>EasyMotion words</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For the <em>character</em> mode, after pressing <code>SPC c</code>, I have to press another character (the one I want to jump to). Let’s say we want to jump to a <code>#</code> (which is not part of words): <code>SPC c #</code>:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://phaazon.net/media/uploads/easymotion_chars.png" alt=""><figcaption>EasyMotion characters</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This way of moving is not intuitive at first, but once you get used to it… it’s a <em>must have</em>.</p>
<h2 id="all-the-other-modal-candies">All the other modal candies</h2>
<p>Among all the things that I like about modal editing, here is a non-exhaustive list of features I expect to have around my fingers:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>C-i</code> and <code>C-o</code>: those allows me to jump to something / a file / a place in a buffer and then go back to where I was right before with <code>C-o</code> (read it like <em>out</em>) or go back again with <code>C-i</code> (read it like <em>in</em>).</li>
<li>Macros and registers: those allow me to yank content into different registers (like clipboards) by assigning a single key to paste their content. For instance, I can put a few lines in my <code>t</code> register with <code>"tyi(</code> (“put in the <code>t</code> register the <code>y</code>ank <code>i</code>nside matching <code>(</code>), and paste that content later with <code>"tp</code>. Macros allow more powerful editing control by assigning a key to set of actions with the <code>q</code> keyword (<code>qa</code> will register all the next keystrokes and actions into the <code>a</code> macro). Then simply replay the macro with <code>@a</code>, for instance.</li>
<li>Obviously, all the basic vim motions, like <code>d</code> to delete, <code>y</code> to yank, <code>c</code> to change, <code>t</code> to go to the character right before the one you search, <code>%</code> to go to the other delimiter, etc. And more complex text manipulation, such as “Let’s change what’s inside this function parameter list, delimited by <code>(</code>”: <code>ci(</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It would take too much time to list everything, but the main idea is: I need the modal features when editing code.</p>

                    <p>By Ryan Lambert -- Published September 06, 2020</p><p>PostgreSQL 13 development is coming along nicely, Postgres 13 Beta3 was
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/2060/">released on 8/13/2020</a>.
The Postgres Beta 1 and 2 releases were released in May and June 2020.
One of the features that has my interest in Postgres 13 is the B-Tree deduplication effort.  B-Tree indexes are the default indexing method
in Postgres, and are likely the most-used indexes in production 
environments.
Any improvements to this part of the database are likely to have wide-reaching benefits.
Removing duplication from indexes keeps their physical size smaller,
reduces I/O overhead, and should help keep <code>SELECT</code> queries fast!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>There is a good summary of the what and how of this improvement
in <a href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/b-tree-index-deduplication/">Laurenz Albe's post</a> from early in June 2020, presumably using
Pg13 Beta1.  <a href="https://www.highgo.ca/2020/07/06/features-in-pg13-deduplication-in-b-tree-indexes/">Hamid Akhtar's post in July</a>
covered this feature using Pg13 Beta2 and a different approach including
a look at the performance using <code>EXPLAIN</code>.
This post takes yet another look at this improvement using Pg13 Beta3.
I intend to see how well this improvement pans out on a data set I use in production.  For that task my go-to is
<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> data loaded to Postgres/PostGIS <a href="https://blog.rustprooflabs.com/2020/01/postgis-osm-load-2020">using osm2pgsql</a>.</p>
<h2>Install Postgres 13 Beta 3</h2>
<p>The first step is to install the two versions of Postgres (12 and 13beta3) 
on a single Ubuntu 18 host.  In the past when I have tested pre-production
releases I have built Postgres from source instead of using <code>apt</code>.
This time around I decided to use <code>apt install</code>, so am including the
basic process for that.</p>
<p>The advised way to install PostgreSQL is from the pgdg (PostgreSQL Global Development Group) repositories,
see <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt">the Postgres wiki</a> for more.
To enable the beta versions, the line needed in <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list</code> is:</p>
<pre><code>deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/bionic-pgdg main 13
</code></pre>
<p>With that in place, update the sources and install Postgres and PostGIS.</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt update
# Postgres 12
sudo apt install postgresql-12 postgresql-12-postgis-3
# Postgres 13 (Currently Beta)
sudo apt install postgresql-13 postgresql-13-postgis-3
</code></pre>
<p>On Ubuntu, installing multiple versions will create multiple instances running on different ports. The test server I'm using to write this post
currently has three versions of Postgres installed, only two are currently running. Postgres 12 was installed first so "won" the default port of 5432.  Postgres 11 was installed second and was assigned 5433, and Pg13 beta 3 was installed last and was assigned port 5434.  The <code>pg_lsclusters</code> is avaiable on Debian/Ubuntu hosts as part of the wrapper around <code>pg_ctl</code>.</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u postgres pg_lsclusters
Ver Cluster Port Status Owner    Data directory              Log file
11  main    5433 down   postgres /var/lib/postgresql/11/main /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-11-main.log
12  main    5432 online postgres /var/lib/postgresql/12/main /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-12-main.log
13  main    5434 online postgres /var/lib/postgresql/13/main /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-13-main.log
</code></pre>

<p>This post does not use Postgres 11 beyond this example.</p>

<p>When working with multiple versions installed it is helpful to verify
versions match what you expect them to be.
First, the port 5432 for Postgres 12 version.</p>
<pre><code>psql -d pgosm -p 5432 -c "select version();"

<h2>Create Indexes</h2>
<p>Both versions of Postgres were loaded with the same Colorado OpenStreetMap
data loaded <a href="https://blog.rustprooflabs.com/2020/01/postgis-osm-load-2020">using osm2pgsql</a>.
The osm2pgsql does not create any B-Tree indexes on its own, only the GIST
indexes on geometries.
For this post, we examine B-Tree index sizes created on four columns:
<code>osm_id</code>, <code>highway</code>, <code>waterway</code>, and <code>natural</code>.
Looking at the stats on the <code>public.planet_osm_line</code> table I can make 
a couple guesses where we will and will not see gains based on <code>n_distinct</code>.
I can guess we will not see major gains in the
<code>osm_id</code>, there is only a small amount of duplication in those values.
The other three columns (<code>highway</code>, <code>natural</code> and <code>waterway</code>) have a small number of distinct values
and varying amounts of <code>NULL</code> values.  These three columns would all
be candidates for partial indexes to avoid indexing the <code>NULL</code> values,
thus reducing the size of the created index.
I have hopes to see the benefits in Postgres 13 on these columns, possibly
making the use of partial indexes less frequent.</p>
<pre><code> SELECT attname, n_distinct, null_frac
    FROM pg_catalog.pg_stats
    WHERE tablename = 'planet_osm_line'
        AND attname IN ('osm_id', 'highway', 'waterway', 'natural')
;

â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”�

</code></pre>
<h3>Index on <code>osm_id</code></h3>
<p>First up is the <code>osm_id</code> column, a nearly unique set of positive and 
negative values.  The index to create in both versions:</p>
<pre><code>CREATE INDEX ix_osm_line_osm_id ON public.planet_osm_line (osm_id);
</code></pre>
<p>The following query is used throughout to report out index sizes.
The query itself will not be repeated, as only the filter would change.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT ai.schemaname AS s_name, ai.relname AS t_name,
        ai.indexrelname AS index_name,
        pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(quote_ident(ai.schemaname)::text || '.' || quote_ident(ai.indexrelname)::text)) AS index_size,
        pg_relation_size(quote_ident(ai.schemaname)::text || '.' || quote_ident(ai.indexrelname)::text) AS index_size_bytes
    FROM pg_catalog.pg_stat_all_indexes ai
    WHERE ai.indexrelname LIKE 'ix_osm_line%'
    ORDER BY index_name
;
</code></pre>
<p>Due to the low number of duplicates, it is no surprise that the
show only a tiny reduction in the size.  The reduction
would not be detectable from only the <code>index_size</code> column (in MB), the
<code>index_size_bytes</code> shows the slight reduction in size (29,515,776 bytes vs. 29,384,704 bytes).</p>
<p>Pg 12.</p>
<pre><code>â”Œâ”€[ RECORD 1 ]â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”�

<h3>Index on <code>highway</code></h3>
<p>The <code>highway</code> data in the <code>planet_osm_line</code> data is a good example of when
a
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-partial.html">partial index</a>
might typically be a good idea to minimize index size.  My hunch (and hope)
is that the de-duplication will make a partial index here a moot point by reducing the size required to index a large number of <code>NULL</code> values.</p>
<p>Create two indexes, one partial covering the non-<code>NULL</code> values and one full
index on the entire table.</p>
<pre><code>CREATE INDEX ix_osm_line_highway_partial 
    ON public.planet_osm_line (highway)
    WHERE highway IS NOT NULL;
CREATE INDEX ix_osm_line_highway_full
    ON public.planet_osm_line (highway);
</code></pre>
<p>The two indexes in Postgres 12, notice the partial index cuts out about 1/3 of the size from the full index.</p>
<pre><code>â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”…</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Try to remember the first time you heard about this fascinating language called <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a>. Chances are, you had by the time been developing software using Ruby. If that's the case, Elixir seems to have appeared out of nowhere until suddenly, it became the solution for all your previous problems. It is fast, clean, scales extremely well. It was <strong>almost</strong> like the Ruby you've always wanted to have, but never got.</p><p>I say <strong>almost</strong>, because as much as you want it to be, <strong>Elixir is not Ruby</strong>. The familiar syntax has definitely helped the language win the hearts of the broader developer community. Yet, under the hood, <strong>Elixir is all about Erlang.</strong> The <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Erlang</a> that everyone tells stories about, as if it were some mythical creature, but no one dares to touch.</p><figure><img src="https://preslav.me/content/images/2020/09/book-cover.png" alt="" width="500" height="700"><figcaption>Elixir for Non-Ruby Programmers</figcaption></figure><p>Why am I saying all of this? First, because I would love to see greater adoption of Elixir outside Ruby/Rails community. It was among that group of people where the idea first sparked, and I fully respect the fact. Nevertheless, I would love to see it growing out. As someone who discovered Elixir after years of doing Java, &nbsp;.NET and more recently, Go, I can say that there is enough goodness in it for everyone. Moreover, bringing people with different backgrounds (both technical and non-technical) will lead to an explosion of new ideas. Having more diverse minds will help us better understand and make use of the elephant in the room-Erlang.</p><p>This brings me to my second point. Erlang is not obscure at all, once you give it enough attention. It is actually oddly satisfying, once you start reading code written in it. I have had my few a-ha moments, when I figured the original inspiration for most constructs in Elixir. The point is, we shouldn't fear Erlang, but try to understand it. This applies both to when things go well, as well as when they go south.</p><p>My biggest hope of all is that by understanding Erlang well enough, the Elixir community will start looking for new uses for it. Uses that go beyond being a scalable replacement for Rails apps. More daring and more ambitious uses, where Erlang's resilience model can prove to be critical for the success of the mission. I'd love to see it used in transportation, space, as well as the domain that started it all- telecommunications.</p><blockquote>“Shoot for the moon.

<p>In our <a href="https://blog.stevenchun.me/2020/04/linear-regression-I/" data-popup-title="Under the Hood: Linear Regression" data-popup-image="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Linear_regression.svg" data-popup-abstract="It's not your Grandfather's Econometrics!">last post,
</a> we derived the least squares normal equations.</p>

<p>So, from a theoretical standpoint you’d be 100% correct if you said,
“Scikit-learn solves the least squares normal equations”. Good job. And to go
further, you could talk about using different matrix factorizations to
efficiently solve the normal equations, like SVD or QR or LU. But there’s a
story we miss by ignoring the actual code and hardware that will solve least
squares.</p>
<p>Like pretty much all modern software, Scikit-learn and its contemporaries stand
on the shoulders of giants: NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Oak Ridge National
Laboratory, and work done in the 70s to revolutionize scientific computing.</p>
<p>Understanding this work and its modern forms is critical to an end-to-end
understanding of why your 2015 Macbook is burning the tops of your thighs as you
run an ill advised regression for a term paper. This is not a particularly
technical post, as I don’t think I could do justice to the hardware
optimizations involved. Instead, we’ll dig into modern linear regression as a
way to develop a mental picture of the structures involved.</p>

Scipy doing?</p>

it…doesn’t do anything? It checks for any mismatch in the shapes of the

<h2 id="LAPACK-and-BLAS"><a href="#LAPACK-and-BLAS" title="LAPACK and BLAS"></a>LAPACK and BLAS</h2><p>Rather than performing the calculations itself, SciPy actually calls a LAPACK
subroutine to do all the matrix factoring work. Which subroutine depends on
which option you pass to it: “gelsd” for divide-and-conquer SVD, “gelsy” for
complete orthogonal factorization, or “gels” for QR/LQ factorization. LAPACK in
turn calls a BLAS subroutine to do all the scalar, vector, and matrix work.
These programs are very particular. Different architectures will have different
implementations.
Some of the really-fast implementations were hand-written by a guy on sabbatical
from the Japanese Patent Office.</p>
<h3 id="LAPACK"><a href="#LAPACK" title="LAPACK"></a>LAPACK</h3><p>LAPACK was a project out of Tennessee and Rice Universities, the Numerical
Algorithms Group, a private non-profit, and Oak Ridge and Argonne National
Laboratories in the early 90s. This assemblage of researchers all saw the need
for a standardized, fast package that provided “<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christian_Bischof/publication/220781801_LAPACK_A_Portable_Linear_Algebra_Library_for_High-Performance_Computers/links/00b7d519e119d012bc000000/LAPACK-A-Portable-Linear-Algebra-Library-for-High-Performance-Computers.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-popup-title="www.researchgate.net/profile/Christian_Bischof/publication/220781801_LAPACK_A_Portable_Linear_Algebra_Library_for_High-Performance_Computers/links/00b7d519e119d012bc000000/LAPACK-A-Portable-Linear-Algebra-Library-for-High-Performance-Computers.pdf" data-popup-image="" data-popup-abstract="">routines for solving systems of
simultaneous linear equations, least-squares solutions of overdetermined
systems of equations, and eigenvalue problems.
</a>”</p>
<p>These sorts of things had been tried before in LINPACK and EISPACK, but those
packages weren’t written with modern computer architectures in mind. The
original Intel Pentium chip had come out in 1993 and brought a split L1 cache<label for="ad0dd30cc0a2320fb30580b38d61955c0ad19c9df743e3b0bf43dfeb0b6e53c4"></label><span> If you have a rough idea of what an L1 cache is, here’s an insanely thorough

was also releasing some very nice x86 chips. But then, Quake was released by id
Software, which targeted the Pentium processor’s ability to interleave floating
point and integer operations, something Cyrix’s chips couldn’t do. “Quake was
extremely popular, and everyone used it in their performance tests – and thus
hammered the Cyrix chips, even though the Cyrix was faster in ordinary use, in
business/work/Windows operation, indeed in every other game except Quake. And
ultimately that killed Cyrix off.”  From <a href="https://liam-on-linux.livejournal.com/49259.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-popup-title="The rise &amp; fall of the first real x86 rival to Intel: the Cyrix 6x86" data-popup-image="https://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/sign.png" data-popup-abstract="I was surprised to read someone castigating and condemning the Cyrix line of PC CPUs today.

set first used on the Intel 8086 chip, the precursor to the Pentium? I didn’t.
Well, now I do. Such is the epistemic problem of writing a blog post in order to
learn about what you’re writing about.
</span>. The basic problem here is that CPUs got quite fast at
multiplying numbers, but accessing those numbers from memory hadn’t kept up. So,
programs that didn’t pay attention to the cost of moving data started being
bottlenecked by the speed of memory access rather than the speed of their
processors.</p>
<p>LAPACK was written in FORTRAN 77 for modern memory hierarchies with multiple
parallel, processors; and that made it stupid fast. Of course, you can’t write a
library that’ll be optimal for all architectures. You have different cache
sizes; you might have an L3 or L4 cache. But LAPACK didn’t need to, because it
wasn’t actually doing the low-level calculations. For that, it relied on
whatever Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines—BLAS<label for="e6cd2e246ce0576c0ea8487b43e72e470d101ecc87c677ed98fd670616ef5b6e"></label><span> Obviously. Honestly, I’m way more in on the all-cap, pronounceable acronym,
compared to like, the current state of open source naming. I mean look at the
<a href="https://www.apache.org/index.html#projects-list" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-popup-title="Welcome to The Apache Software Foundation!" data-popup-image="" data-popup-abstract="Home page of The Apache Software Foundation">list of projects

Oh God, there’s a project called <a href="http://chemistry.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chemistry</a>, please let it have something to do

Chemistry project has nothing to do with chemistry or chemicals!” It’s a CMS
interoperability standard. And Steve? Steve is the Foundation’s python-based
voting system.
</span>— the user had installed.</p>
<h3 id="BLAS"><a href="#BLAS" title="BLAS"></a>BLAS</h3><p>In the late 70s, the nerds at JPL came out with a FORTRAN library of
thirty-eight basic linear algebra subroutines. Stuff like a dot-product,
implemented in a way that was fast and correct. This way an aeronautical
engineer didn’t have to worry that his code for, like, a 2-norm<label for="221c330c1fb37958b3a7aeba1299318f19846fae4c652d177db65ff3cd1cd4aa"></label><span> A 2-norm is just the Euclidean distance of the vector. I have no idea how it
should interact with complex numbers. This way, I don’t have to!
</span> handled a
complex vector correctly. And that might mean fewer rocket crashes.</p>
<p>While it started out as an actual library, BLAS persisted more as a
specification. Anyone could write a BLAS implementation that was fast on their
hardware, and any program designed to use BLAS could use any of these
implementations.</p>
<p>If you’re reading this on a Mac, you’re running <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/blas" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-popup-title="Apple Developer Documentation" data-popup-image="" data-popup-abstract="">Apple’s implementation
</a> of BLAS
and LAPACK, specially optimized, like much of Apple software, for its own
hardware.</p>
<p>There’s a useful idea here that some constructs are so widely used that it’s
worth a lot of effort to eek out small performance gains which then aggregate to
huge performance gains.</p>
<p>One example from a 2017 talk on Google’s<label for="04aa2b4d1a716f77545c559a01ac048a92f2ad4dd1c31988ec4cf32af492f5a3"></label><span>Disclaimer: I work at Google. I was not involved in this work.
</span> efforts to develop faster, more
efficient hash tables:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Hash tables are incredibly performance sensitive. At Google, right now, as I am
speaking, in our fleet, one percent of the CPU’s are computing something in a
hash table. As I am speaking, more than four percent of Google’s RAM is owned by
a hash table. And that’s just C++”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same idea applies to a dot product. If your supercomputer weather simulation
does a lot of dot products, you might save days of compute time by having a good
BLAS implementation for your hardware.</p>
<p>This is where Mr. Kazushige Goto comes in.</p>
<h2 id="The-Man-from-the-Patent-Office"><a href="#The-Man-from-the-Patent-Office" title="The Man from the Patent Office"></a>The Man from the Patent Office</h2><p><img src="https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2005/11/28/business/28super.1841.jpg" alt="Kazushige Goto standing next to a research
poster"></p>
<p>Prior to 2002, Kazushige Goto worked in the Japanese Patent Office. While he was
there, he developed a knack for tinkering with the subroutines on computers to
improve bottlenecks. I say this, of course, in the same sense that Babe Ruth
developed a knack for hitting home runs. From a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/28/technology/writing-the-fastest-code-by-hand-for-fun-a-human-computer-keeps.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-popup-title="Writing the Fastest Code, by Hand, for Fun: A Human Computer Keeps Speeding Up Chips" data-popup-image="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png" data-popup-abstract="Kazushige Goto, research associate at Texas Advanced Computing Center at University of Texas in Austin, has become legend in world of supercomputing by single-handedly producing at his keyboard programs that run world's fastest computers and doing it faster than powerful automated systems and entire teams of software developers; value of his work goes far beyond setting speed records because Goto's programs can more efficiently solve complex linear equations, thus offering better solutions in virtually every computational science and engineering problem; photo (M)">2005 New York Times profile
</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“To help in his work, Mr. Goto purchased a Digital Equipment workstation based
on the Alpha microprocessor in 1994 to perform a simulation.  But when it
arrived he could not understand why it was performing so slowly. So he explored
the Alpha’s design to see where the performance bottlenecks were.</p>
<p>He later purchased a second Alpha-based computer and by rewriting the crucial
subroutines was able to improve its performance to 78 percent of its theoretical
peak calculating speed, up from 44 percent.</p>
<p>Although he was not formally trained in computer or software design, he
perfected his craft by learning from programmers on an Internet mailing list
focusing on the Linux operating system for the Alpha chip. His curiosity quickly
became a passion that he pursued in his free time and during his twice daily
two-hour train commute between his job in Tokyo and his home in Kanagawa
Prefecture.</p>
<p>‘I would frequently work on these problems until midnight,’ he said. ‘I did it
to relax.’”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Naturally, this sort of hardware whispering doesn’t go unnoticed,
and eventually Mr. Goto got the call up to the Texas Advanced Computer Center at
UT Austin to apply his gifts to supercomputing while on sabbatical from the
patent office. At the time of this profile, 4 out of the 11 fastest
supercomputers were running GotoBLAS, Goto’s optimized implementation for
Intel’s Nehalem processor.</p>
<p>The narrative of Goto-the-Auteur’s is painted in sharp relief to contemporary
efforts to automate the process of optimizing BLAS for different processors. The
Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software or ATLAS is a BLAS implementation
that can perform a sort of hyperparameter sweep on any processor to identify a
reasonably good BLAS implementation. This sort of approach means that ATLAS is

<p><span>T</span>he only person David Kiragu lied to about the texts was his mom. To those close to him, like his partner, friends, former schoolmates, and work colleagues, he explained what was going on. To more distant contacts, including annoying relatives, he said nothing.</p>



<p>His mother probably knew he was lying — mothers often do — but she let it slide.</p>



<p>“I couldn’t tell her the truth,” Kiragu said to me last December. “So I told her it was one of those prison scams and she should ignore it.”</p>



<p>He owed money. Not a lot of it, but that didn’t matter. His fintech creditor was still telling everyone in Kiragu’s inner circle that he was a deadbeat.</p>



<p>It happened like this: Toward the end of March 2018, Kiragu found himself in a bind. At 32, he earned a solid income as a manager at an iNGO in Nairobi. But for the first time in his life, he couldn’t make rent.</p>



<p>His choices were limited. He could always borrow the remainder from friends, family, or somebody else in his network. The problem was that if he did, people would know he was living beyond his means.</p>



<p>But then one morning Kiragu logged into his Facebook account and saw an ad for a fintech app called OKash that promised to be the discreet friend who would spot him some cash and never mention it again. Offering the ability to “process loans in seconds,” OKash is one of many fintech apps that have sprung up in Kenya since 2012. All he needed to do was download the app, enter his financial details, and let the algorithm generate a credit rating. He would get the money he needed and could pay it back once he was liquid.</p>



<p>He doesn’t remember that day too well now, but Kiragu thinks it took just minutes to apply for his loan. His money arrived right away, so he paid his bills and moved on. “I started with about $15, which I repaid [on time], and my loan limit expanded. Then I borrowed about $35, which I also repaid,” he told me as we sat on the balcony of a chic restaurant in a mall outside Nairobi.</p>



<p>It was the third loan that upended his life. He needed it to top up his rent, because by then a vicious cycle had begun, wherein he would pay off his loan then borrow again to fill the hole that the last payment had left in his finances.</p>



<p>Kiragu started getting calls even before that deadline passed.</p>



<p>“Will you repay your OKash loan?” Kiragu remembers a caller asking him, before warning that if he missed a payment, the company would notify everyone on his contact list. In texts he showed me on his phone, an OKash representative had written an hour before the deadline lapsed, “Despite several polite reminders on your OKash loan . . . No PAYMENT received yet . . . Note that we are going to invade your privacy according to Terms of Service clause 8, IF NOT CLEARED BY 4PM.” The clause in question reads as follows: “In the event we cannot get in contact with you or your emergency contact, you also expressly authorise us to contact any and all persons in your contact list.”</p>



<p>In the days after the deadline, debt collectors hounded Kiragu, calling three to four times every hour. They also cast a wide net. “They texted just about everyone I know,” Kiragu says. His parents and many friends got messages. One of his colleagues even shared a screenshot of a text from OKash in an office-wide WhatsApp Group.</p>



<p>“Some [people] sympathized with me,” Kiragu wrote in a Facebook post about the experience. “Some were laughing at me and some were actually very annoyed that OKash is exposing and shaming me . . . Even my boss called me to ask if everything is okay.”</p>



<p>But his colleagues weren’t his main concern. What worried him more was what his parents would think. After an estranged aunt shared the message within his village, Kiragu’s father accused him of bringing shame on the family.</p>



<p>This was nearly two years ago, but the memory is still raw, so much so that Kiragu asked to use a pseudonym for this article. “If you pay on time, they are angels,” Kiragu said as he sipped his tea and stared at a potted plant behind me. “They keep texting you to take out another loan with them. If you do and won’t or can’t pay, then it’s pretty simple: Pay or we damage what you value most.”</p>

Naomi Wanjiku, a M-Pesa agent, arranges a customer's transaction at a M-Pesa kiosk in South B, a residential area of the city. M-Pesa, (M for mobile, pesa is Swahili for money), is a Kenyan cellphone-based money transfer service. The majority of its customers have no bank accounts, but they withdraw cash and make payments or send money using their cell phones. A network of appointed agents, scattered all over the country, provide the cashing handling services.

<p><strong>In 2007, Safaricom</strong>, Kenya’s biggest telecoms provider, launched M-Pesa, a mobile wallet that allowed users to send and receive money and buy airtime. Smartphones were just becoming popular, so Safaricom tailored its fintech product to the basic cell phones most Kenyans already owned. It was immediately hailed as a revolutionary way to bring millions of “unbanked” customers into the formal financial sector. The Clinton Global Initiative and other major philanthropic organizations were vocal supporters, and it was soon being taught as a case study in business schools around the world. It was also a success on the ground: Safaricom aimed to sign up 350,000 M-Pesa users by the end of 2007, but by November it had already attracted over 1 million. From there, it only continued to grow. As of last September, 23.6 million Kenyans — nearly half of the country’s population — were using it regularly.</p>



<p>M-Pesa was initially meant to be a microfinance project; its first sales pitch to users was “Send Money Home.” It was banking on the fact that while working-class Kenyans who lived away from home wanted to support their families, cash is expensive. This was not a new concept; among Somalis, the Hawala system exists to address this same problem. If you want to send money to someone, you give it to a local agent, who then contacts a second agent located in the same area as the intended recipient, and that agent then disburses the money. Both agents earn a small commission, and they sort each other out.</p>



<p>In Kenya, there were several factors behind M-Pesa’s rapid ascent. One was that 2007 was an election year, and when violence erupted over the results, having a way to transfer money without leaving the house felt to Kenyans like a godsend. Another, more structural, reason was that before M-Pesa, the country’s banking sector served only a portion of the population. Kenya’s economy collapsed four times between the mid-1980s and the early 2000s, by which point the banks were heavily regulated. It was nearly impossible for low-income Kenyans, including millennials, to get loans. No such legal barriers applied to fintech.</p>



<p>When fintech took off, banks, Silicon Valley–backed products, private-equity products, and Kenyan companies all began competing for the same clients. One of the first savings-and-lending apps, called M-Shwari, was launched in 2012 through a partnership between a local bank and Safaricom. Some of its earliest users were Kenyans in the informal economy. In a 2017 social media post, for example, a business journalist noted that “up to a third of loans are taken between the hours of 3am and 5am. Most are repaid within twenty-four hours.” When the Central Bank looked into what was going on, they discovered that a typical user was a market seller who would wake up early and borrow enough money to pay everybody in her supply chain that day. She would then work until evening, pay back the loan, and repeat the cycle again the next morning.</p>



<p>Within a few years, credit-app use had started to spread throughout Kenyan society. Over a 13-year period, financial inclusion<a href="https://fsdkenya.org/publication/finaccess2019/"> jumped</a> from nearly 27 percent, in 2006, to almost 83 percent. And the product side grew as well. As of September 2018, according to a report from Financial Sector Deepening Kenya (FSD), the two main app stores offered 110 credit apps.</p>



<p>Almost all of these companies make their money by providing short-term loans with high interest rates. But that’s often where transparency around the business model ends. Since there is no regulatory framework governing fintech, it is hard to know who exactly owns an app or even where the money is coming from. The absence of regulation has many perks for the sector and one major liability: As companies soon discovered, if a user does not pay back what they have borrowed, plus interest, there is little a digital lender can do. Users can simply delete the app and move on. One solution to this problem has been to flag defaulters to one of Kenya’s three credit reference bureaus (CRBs), effectively locking them out of the credit market. It’s unclear how effective this strategy is, but it’s frequently used. Between 2014 and 2017, about 2.7 million Kenyans were negatively listed with a CRB, 15 percent of them for defaulting on loans of less than about $2. Last year, “how to check CRB status” was among the most-Googled questions in Kenya, between “how to be successful in life” and “how to get pregnant.”</p>



<p>Before long, digital lenders started looking into other methods of recouping their investments. Skip tracing, the ancient art of finding someone who owes you money and making them pay, was virtually nonexistent among fintech companies until early 2018. Coincidentally, that was the same year that Opay, a fintech company partially owned by the software-maker Opera, launched OKash in Kenya. The majority of Opera’s operations had been bought by a consortium of Chinese investors two years earlier, and shortly afterward, the company went on an expansion spree, announcing plans to invest $100 million in East Africa. While Opera’s then managing director, a former banker&nbsp; named Edward Ndichu, said at the time that the app would protect users’ personal information, he never explained how the company planned to safeguard its financial investment. But the answer was buried in OKash’s terms and conditions: When users download the app, they give it permission to access their contacts.</p>

<article>
    <p>I recently became curious about what information flow looks like in a p2p distributed system.</p>
<p>As peers produce new data, they send messages to the other peers. It is impossible to know the exact order in which messages were produced, so the best we can do is to <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-can-you-explain-partial-order-and-total-order-in-simple-terms/answer/Tikhon-Jelvis?ch=10&amp;share=6e9d9f02&amp;srid=dDQH">partially order</a> them. I wanted to use this partial ordering property to create a graph visualization from an array of messages that looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://vivekseth.com/transitive-reduction/graph.png" alt="Graph of partially ordered messages"></p>
<p>Notice how this graph uses the minimum number of edges to represent relationships between nodes. The messages have these relationships, 0 -&gt; 1, 1 -&gt; 2, and 0 -&gt; 2 (transitively), but we don’t draw 0 -&gt; 2 because it is redundant.</p>
<p>Creating an algorithm that can produce a graph like this is not hard. The challenge is making the algorithm fast. My first solution was very slow and took over 60 seconds to build a graph for 400 nodes. After finding a paper from 1972, and optimizing my code with <code>Accelerate</code> (a vector processing framework), I managed to speed up my solution to complete in &lt; 1 second.</p>
<h2 id="attempt-1-algorithm-built-from-scratch">Attempt 1: Algorithm Built From Scratch</h2>
<p>From my undergrad data structures class, I remembered that I could do a topological sort on partially ordered elements. This sort guarantees that for any 2 elements A[i], and A[j] it is not possible for A[i] &gt; A[j] if i &lt; j. In other words, if an element is at index 5, all elements less than it must be located at indices 0 through 4.</p>
<p>Once the elements are sorted, we iterate over each element and try to find its minimal set of neighbors. To find an elements neighbors, we create a prefix array from elements 0 … i-1 and iterate over this list backwards. For each neighbor candidate, we add it to A[i]’s neighbors only if it is not already reachable via graph traversal by another one of its neighbors.</p>
<p>In Swift-like psuedo code, the algorithm looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="swift"><span>protocol</span> <span>PartialOrder</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This algorithm has a run time of O(n * n * (n + e)). Roughly speaking it is O(n^3). On my computer it takes 60 seconds to complete for 400 nodes.</p>
<p>This felt extremely slow, and I wondered if we could do better than this.</p>
<h2 id="attempt-2-naive-transitive-reduction">Attempt 2: Naive Transitive Reduction</h2>
<p>Maybe there were existing algorithms that could help. I have seen graphs similar to the one I was trying to build, so I felt that there might be an existing algorithm I could use.</p>
<p>I searched for “how to graph partially ordered set algorithm”, and came across this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11409929/algorithm-for-constructing-hasse-diagram">Stack Overflow post</a> which was exactly what I was looking for. According to the post, the type of graph I am trying to make is a <em>Hasse diagram</em>. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/11413022">One answer</a> pointed out that the algorithm used to construct a Hasse diagram is called a <em>transitive reduction</em> . I learned from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_reduction">Wikipedia</a> that the transitive reduction of a graph produces a graph that maintains transitive relationships with as few nodes as possible. If A-&gt;B, B-&gt;C, and A-&gt;C, the transitive reduction would remove A-&gt;C.</p>
<p>This sounded like exactly what I was looking for.</p>
<p>I looked around for some sample code that implemented this algorithm, but didn’t find anything so I went to the <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d0be/1e20643e7e15bd4669f1c3ef0c2287852566.pdf">original paper</a> published in 1972. Sidenote: The first author, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Aho">Alfred Aho</a> is also the author of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK">AWK</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools">“dragon” book for compilers</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aho%E2%80%93Corasick_algorithm">Aho-Corasick algorithm</a>!</p>
<p>The algorithm is fairly straight-forward. Here’s some psuedo code that implements the algorithm as written:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Unfortunately, this algorithm was actually <em>slower</em> than my initial solution! On average it took about 5 extra seconds.</p>
<p>Since the matrix multiplication has a runtime complexity of O(n^3), I felt that is where the bulk of the time was being spent. If I could find a way to speed up the matrix multiplication, I might be able to speed up the overall algorithm significantly.</p>
<p>I considered trying to read up on research on matrix multiplication math. I wondered if there were optimizations for Boolean matrices, or for the case where you try to square a matrix. I was just about to start researching those topics, when I was struck with an idea: What if the matrix multiplication was slow because I was just using a poor implementation?</p>
<p>I remembered that there is a framework available on macOS called <code>Accelerate</code> that provides fast implementations for vector math. In that past, I have used it to compute the FFT of audio/image data. Maybe it had functions for matrix multiplication too.</p>
<h2 id="approach-3-accelerated-transitive-reduction">Approach 3: “Accelerated” Transitive Reduction</h2>
<p>I searched through the API of <code>Accelerate</code> and found a matrix multiplication function: <code>vDSP_mmul</code>. It only works for <code>Float</code>s, but I thought I could make it work.</p>
<p>Instead of refactoring my code to use <code>Float</code> matrices, I decided to try replacing the implementation of <code>multiply(m1:, m2:)</code> with <code>vDSP_mmul</code> by converting my <code>Bool</code> matrices to/from <code>Float</code> matrices as needed. If using <code>vDSP_mmul</code> didn’t significantly speed up the matrix multiplication, there was no point optimizing other parts of the code.</p>
<p>Here is the rough approach I took:</p>
<ol>
<li>Convert each <code>Bool</code> matrix into a linear <code>Float</code> array. True = 1.0, and False = 0.0</li>
<li>Use <code>Accelerate</code> to do matrix multiplication on these <code>Float</code> arrays.</li>
<li>Convert the output <code>Float</code> array back into a <code>Bool</code> matrix</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is some pseudo code:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>This time, the algorithm ran <strong>much</strong> faster. For 400 elements, it took &lt;1 second to complete!</p>
<p>I was so surprised by this result, that I assumed I must have a bug somewhere. I spent a bunch of time validating that there were no bugs, and that the result of this approach were equivalent to the result of approach 1. Fortunately there were no bugs I could find. <code>Accelerate</code> is just insanely fast!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I started out on this project just trying to draw some cool graphs in Graphviz. I ended up learning some graph theory, and using a vector processing framework called Accelerate to make my algorithm fast.</p>
<p>The graphs I was trying to make are called <em>Hasse Diagrams</em> and creating them requires computing the <em>transitive reduction</em> over a list of <em>partially ordered</em> elements. The standard algorithm for the transitive reduction has a runtime complexity of O(n^3). This produces a very slow run time with a naive implementation, but can be sped up significantly using a vector processing framework like <code>Accelerate</code>.</p>

September 6, 2020 | https://qvault.io/2020/09/01/slow-is-smooth-smooth-is-fast-25-of-our-time-refactoring/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://qvault.io/2020/09/01/slow-is-smooth-smooth-is-fast-25-of-our-time-refactoring/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p><a href="https://app.qvault.io/">My team</a> has been spending less of our “free” time working on bugs and features from the backlog, and more time refactoring our codebases and test suites. As a result, and perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, we’ve noticed a significant increase in our throughput of features and bug fixes.</p>



<p>As it turns out, its easy to find bugs and add features to a well-written codebase that the entire team is familiar with. Go figure.</p>



<p>My team started a loose goal to spend 25% of our time refactoring, revisiting, and restyling existing code and tests. Let’s go over some of the benefits we’ve seen since making the change.</p>



<h2>Context and Caveats</h2>



<p>I’ve found that in articles like this it’s important to give as much context to the situation as possible, as certain development methodologies may work better or worse in teams with a different size, tech stack, or development process. Here are some notable things about our situation:</p>



<ul><li>3 engineers on my team, ~16 in the company</li><li>Tech stack – Go, Postgres, ElasticSearch and RabbitMQ</li><li>Microservices architecture on Kubernetes</li><li>Kanban-style development process – <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/05/18/leave-scrum-to-rugby-i-like-getting-stuff-done/">no scrum</a></li><li>Our team is responsible for ~14 repositories</li><li>Each repo represents a small service in a data pipeline process that handles sorting and NLP of social media posts</li></ul>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-1024x592.png" alt="Go Kubernetes" width="512" height="296" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-1024x592.png 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-300x173.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-768x444.png 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-150x87.png 150w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes.png 1245w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" title="go kubernetes"></figure></div>



<h2>Code Familiarity</h2>



<p>With only 3 engineers on the pipeline team and ~14 repositories (Mostly REST APIs and ETL processes), it was hard for all three of us to be super familiar with all the code. When we needed a new microservice, one team member typically wrote the first iteration, and one other team member did a quick code review. The engineer who did the first iteration would then be primarily responsible for bug fixes and new features relating to that project.</p>



<p>By focusing more of our time on reviewing and refactoring existing code, it gave us a chance to hop into projects that we never would have had a reason to become familiar with. Not only does getting more eyes on a project mean the overall code quality will likely go up, but it also means we aren’t hosed when the original maintainer has gone.</p>



<h2>Slow to Fix Bugs</h2>



<p>When you get deep into spaghetti code, it can be really hard to find bugs. Not only that but in a messy codebase, sometimes fixing a bug can actually <em>add</em> to the “uncleanliness” of the code. You may have to exacerbate or extend an already bad architectural pattern in order to get a bug fix in.</p>



<p>Ideally, you would do the refactoring first and then fix the bug (assuming the bug still exists after a good refactoring). Unfortunately, oftentimes there isn’t enough time to refactor a project before fixing a critical bug. For this reason, we should always be refactoring so that bug fixes can happen quickly and won’t make the code quality worse than it is.</p>



<h2>Slow to Add Features</h2>



<p>I don’t want to beat a dead horse, the reasoning here is largely the same as with bug fixes. Adding features to a messy codebase just makes it messier. It’s like frosting a cake that’s been thrown on the ground – it might taste marginally better but now it’s even harder to clean up.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="261" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/happy_birthday_to_ground.gif" alt="Happy Birthday to the Ground" title="happy birthday to ground"></figure></div>



<h2>Try It Yourself</h2>



<p>Since adding a consistent refactoring process to our team’s routine, we’ve been able to put <em>more</em> features through to production while spending <em>less</em> time working on them. Let me know what you think and if you have a different experience.</p>

                                Tuesday September 01, 2020 by <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/author/tuukka-turunen">Tuukka Turunen</a> | <a href="#commento">Comments</a>
                            </p>
                            
                            <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p><strong><em><span>We are super-excited that a significant milestone, the feature freeze of the next major version of Qt, has been reached! We now have the functionality in place, and the following months will be spent in polishing and tuning the release. Target is to complete the maturation phase in the coming months to be able to release Qt 6.0.0 in December.</span></em></strong></p>
<!--more--><p><span>Over the past few years, we have been working to research, plan, and create the next Qt version. Qt 5 has been a great success, and it is a solid foundation for the development of applications and devices still for many years to come. But the world is changing, so we are introducing a version that takes Qt users into the new decade. <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/2019/08/07/technical-vision-qt-6" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Qt 6 technical vision blog post by Lars</a> offers a great overview of Qt 6.0 future strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Qt 6.0 Timeline</span></strong></p>
<p><span>There are already multiple separate blog posts regarding the features and functionality of Qt 6, and there are also many more to come. Therefore, in this post, I am focusing on the structure, and timeline of Qt 6.0. </span></p>
<p><span>First, let’s review the major milestones of the Qt 6.0 development schedule:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>January 2020: Qt 5.15 branched, development branch becomes Qt 6.0, merge of the feature branches</span></li>
<li><span>June 2020: Structural freeze, supported modules and platforms defined, first binary snapshot released</span></li>
<li><span>August 2020: Feature freeze, all functionality completed </span></li>
<li><span>September 2020: Alpha release</span></li>
<li><span>October 2020: Beta phase starts, multiple beta snapshot releases</span></li>
<li><span>November 2020: Release Candidate</span></li>
<li><span>December 2020: Qt 6.0.0 Release</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>With the feature freeze milestone now reached, next milestone is the Alpha release. This is still quite a lot geared for those participating development of Qt itself as well those who want to closely follow how Qt 6.0 is shaping up. The Beta releases are what we hope all Qt users take a look and provide feedback. During the Beta phase they key goal is to address as much as possible the issues hindering using Qt 6.0 – so the feedback from all Qt users is very important. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Qt 6.0 Supported Platforms and Modules</span></strong></p>
<p><span>For Qt 6.0, our focus is on the essential modules as well as a few selected add-ons. As always, with a new major release, we also do not have all the upcoming target configurations yet supported. After Qt 6.0, our goal is to release Qt 6.1, Qt 6.2 LTS, as well as multiple patch releases during 2021. These releases will provide support for additional add-on modules and target configurations. </span></p>
<p><span>Qt 6.0 supports the following modules:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Qt Core</span></li>
<li><span>Qt GUI</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Widgets</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Network</span></li>
<li><span>Qt QML</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Quick</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Quick Controls</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Quick 3D</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Shader Tools</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Quick Timeline</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Wayland</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Wayland Compositor</span></li>
<li><span>Qt SVG</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Concurrent</span></li>
<li><span>Qt D-Bus</span></li>
<li><span>Qt OpenGL and Qt OpenGL Widgets (note different than in Qt 5)</span></li>
<li><span>Qt 3D</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Network Authorization</span></li>
<li><span>Qt SQL</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Printing Support</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Test</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Help</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>…and a few other ones.</span></p>
<p><span>Within the modules, some old APIs have been removed, and new APIs have been introduced. &nbsp;In case where the functionality is removed on purpose (deprecated in Qt 5.15), the application may need to be modified accordingly and we will prepare a migration guide to assist you. </span></p>
<p><span>Some modules that are present in Qt 5 are not listed above because:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>They are purposely removed (like Qt Script and Qt XML Patterns)</span></li>
<li><span>The functionality is part of other modules, so it is no longer needed as a separate module (like platform specific extras) </span></li>
<li><span>We plan to add those in later Qt 6.x feature releases (like Qt Multimedia, Qt Bluetooth and Qt Virtual Keyboard).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>If your application depends upon functionality missing from Qt 6.0, it may be need to wait until a Qt 6.x release provides it. As an long term support release, Qt 5.15 LTS serves this use-case specifically, keeping your project maintained with new patch releases. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Qt 6.0 supports the majority of all desktop, mobile and embedded platforms. Due to our C++17 requirement, a up-to-date compiler is essential. Support for real-time operating systems, is planned to be on a ‘technology preview’ level, i.e. development and testing is possible. We’ll provide a more detailed roadmap for supported hosts and targets with the upcoming alpha and beta releases. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>How can I try Qt 6.0?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>We are developing Qt 6.0 together with the whole Qt community. The source code repositories are available, and everyone can join the development via the Qt Project. We have released regular snapshots of Qt 6.0 since June and continue towards the final. With the feature freeze now in place and Alpha approaching, the snapshots improve the usability for trying Qt 6.0. During the Beta phase, we hope that most of you will try out the snapshots, and provide us with feedback. </span></p>
<p><span>The Qt 6.0 snapshots are available via the Qt online installer. All you have to do is to enable the ‘Preview’ category. To gain access to the source code, simply clone from the Qt Project repositories – or use the source code packages that are available as part of the Qt 6.0 snapshot releases.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<p>I was recently reading through an appendix on Jacques Lacan’s <em>Seminar on “The Purloined Letter”</em> and was surpised to find a discussion of a problem that seemed to fundamentally be a programming exercise. These notes are the result of some exploration I did implementing Lacan’s discussion in the <a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket Programming language</a> (a modern dialect of the Scheme programming language for those unfamiliar). This seemed to be quite a perfect fit since Lacan’s primary interest is in the role that “signifiers” play in our understanding of the world and Racket is a <em>symbolic</em> programming language that focuses on the manipulation of symbols to perform computation. The full code and original markdown for these notes can be found in <a href="https://github.com/willkurt/lacan-racket">this github repo</a>.</p>
<h2 id="a-quick-intro-to-lacan">A quick intro to Lacan</h2>
<p>Jacques Lacan’s <a href="https://www.lacan.com/purloined.htm"><em>Seminar on “The Purloined Letter”</em></a> * is a lecture that covers many of Lacan’s essential themes and is a great introduction to understanding the basics of Lacanian psychology. When abstracted out, many of Lacan’s ideas can be reasonably straightforward, however in the original context Lacan takes the audiences on a splendid journey through his thinking that, for the uninitiated, can be a bit confusing. There is an appendix to this Seminar a surprisingly quantitative and technical section in this lecture as printed in <em>Écrits</em> under the subsection titled <em>Introduction</em> which in fact follows after the transcript of the seminar.</p>
<p>* <em>note</em>: that link does not contain the full appendix that is discussed in these notes.</p>
<p>This Seminar focuses on a classic Edgar Allen Poe text, <a href="https://poestories.com/read/purloined">“The Purloined Letter”</a> which is a mystery centering on a stolen letter. Lacan uses this letter as classic example of the ‘primacy of the signified’. “What in the world does that mean!?” you might reasonably ask. Lacan was particularly interested in the different roles that the “signifier” and the “signified” play in our understanding of the world. In general we can think of the <em>signifier</em> as the “thing which points to something else” and the <em>signified</em> as the “thing pointed at”. Take for example this image:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://willkurt.github.io/lacan-racket/images/cat_ecrits.png" width="300" alt=""><figcaption>“A cat reading Lacan’s Écrits”</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We would say that there is a “cat” in this image. The word “cat” would be the signifier and the cat itself would be the signified. Typically we tend to think of the <em>signfied</em> at the real thing, but Lacan was interested in how incredibly important the signfier itself is in our understanding of the world. He proclaims in the Seminar:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I teach that the unconscious is the fact that man is inhabited by the signifier”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the original Poe story is about a stolen letter and a detectives quest to return the letter. Lacan uses this stolen letter an example of the power of the signifier. Even though the entire story is driven by this letter the reader never knows what the actual contents of the letter are. Lacan points out that not only do we not know, we don’t need to. The letter itself as a signifier is able to create all the drama and complexity this mystery needs.</p>
<h3 id="the-primacy-of-the-signifier">The primacy of the signifier</h3>
<p>For Lacan it is these signifiers, these symbols of things, that are in fact the reality of our unconcious life. That is we operate primarily in terms of symbols, not the least of which is language itself. As an example of the role these signifigers play, consider a statement such as “I am a male technologist”. It turns out there in a emoji specifically for this very idea:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://willkurt.github.io/lacan-racket/images/man_technologist.png" width="300" alt=""><figcaption>“Emoji are a great representation of the signifier”</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now when I say “male technologist” you likely have a pretty good idea what I mean, but if we pick apart what these words mean we quickly find it is very tricky to point to what exactly I am signifying. For starters what does it mean to say that I am “male”? We can see this as expression of biological sex, but it also entrails notions of gender. What does it mean to be a “man”? You might be tempted to quickly make some statement about the number of X choromosomes, but even if that works for one technical definition of “male” it clearly doesn’t do enough to explain it in all or even most social occasions. The more we explore “maleness” the more we realize that being “male” is more a signifier that a signified, it is like an emoji that we can’t quite pin down exactly what it points to.</p>
<p>This is of course just one tiny example of how often times the signifier is what plays a primal role in our way of interacting with the world. Lacan also points out that there is one very important signifier in our contemporary existence, which is always something with points to something else, and yet nonetheless plays an essential role in our psychology:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“the signifier that most thoroughly annihilates every signifcation–namely, money”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a bit more exposition on Lacan take a look at my talk on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_dqEgtpgBg">“The Limits of Probability”</a>.</p>
<h2 id="lacan-and-racket">Lacan and Racket</h2>
<p>To demonstrate just how powerful pure symobls can be Lacan give an example of a very simple symbol language which nonetheless has some very interesting properities. Given that Racket is a programming language focused specifically on symbol manipulation I thought it would be a really fun exercise to implement this specific example fo Lacan’s reasoning in Racket!</p>
<p>Racket is in the family of Lisp programming languages. One dominant feature of most Lisp dialects is that they focus on the programmer performing computation strictly through symbol manipulation. The allows the programmer to treat even programs themselves as inputs to other programs, which leads to some very powerful programming abstractions.</p>
<p>Given that Racket is one of the best examples of a contemporary symbolic programming language this is a great tool to explore in more detail the problem that Lacan is discussion. Implementing Lacan in Racket also makes is arguments much more clear and can help make some logic easier to reason about.</p>
<h3 id="freud-the-death-drive-and-the-repetition-compulsion">Freud, the death drive and the repetition compulsion</h3>
<p>Lacan starts what is essential an appendix to the Seminar by discussing Freud’s controversial writing <em>Beyond the Pleasure Principle</em>. In this text Freud struggles with the question of the <em>repetition compulsion</em> (or automatism) in which patients repeatedly return to thinking about tramautic events in their lifes. Freud typically explains most of our behavior in terms libidinal desires, that is pleasure seeking, sexual urges. For Freud most of the complexity of human psychology is the way we resist these desires as part of our everyday lifes. The trouble is that if our behavior is driven exclusively by a pleasure instinct why would anyone be compelled to revisit painful experiences over and over again? Freud’s theoretical solution to this problem is the establishment of the idea of the ‘death drive’. Freud argues that human behavior is in fact driven by the conflict between our libido and this death drive (Eros and Thanatos). Understandably even Freud’s most ardent followers found this explaination a little difficult to digest.</p>
<h3 id="repition-compulsion-explained-through-the-symbolic-chain">Repition compulsion explained through the symbolic chain</h3>
<p>Lacan’s response is that while Freud’s solution is easily dismissed, the problem he describes does need some exploration. Lacan argues that the <em>autonomy of the symbolic</em> is enough to explain the repetition compulsion. What in the world is the “autonomy of the symbolic?” Lacan wants to show us that mere symbols and rules for creating those symbols can contain their own logic which can cause repitition without needing to refer to any more complicated system. From a standpoint of modern programming this is not at all surprising. Anyone who has writen a program has basically used symbols that have no intrinsic meaning and used the logic of these symobls create predictable behavior. This is why this is a particularly fun part of Lacan to implement in code!</p>
<p>To demonstrate this Lacan develops a very simple grammar from symobic manipulation to demonstrate the emergent rules that come from this. For Lacan this shows that we don’t need complex ideas like the death drive to explain the compulsion to repeat: symbols themselves can cause this. Lacan starts with two symbols + and - representing, abstractly, presents or absence respectively. In Racket we can represent a list of these symbosl likes this:</p>
<pre><code>'( + + - + + - - - +)</code></pre>
<p>He then creates some simple rules that can can be used to transform a sequence of three of these symbols into three new symbols <code>'(1 2 3)</code>.</p>
<p>To demonstrate Lacan’s rules we’ll implement series of racket functions that check whether or not a given string of <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> maps to the target symbol. Lacan, being Lacan, expresses these symbols in a more indirect way, but the following definitions will suffice to show Lacan’s larger point.</p>
<p>The symbol 1 is defined as either <code>+++</code> or <code>---</code></p>
<pre><code>(define (is-one? xs)
  (or (equal? xs '(+ + +))
      (equal? xs '(- - -))))
</code></pre>
<p>The symbol 2 can be <code>+--</code>, <code>-++</code>, <code>++-</code>, <code>--+</code></p>
<pre><code>(define (is-two? xs)
  (or (equal? xs '(+ - -))
      (equal? xs '(- + +))
      (equal? xs '(+ + -))
      (equal? xs '(- - +))))</code></pre>
<p>And the symbol 3 is <code>+-+</code> or <code>-+-</code></p>
<pre><code>(define (is-three? xs)
   (or (equal? xs '(+ - +))
       (equal? xs '(- + -))))</code></pre>
<p>The next step is to imagine a string of these <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> base representations and how they would be translated. To be clear, if we have 3 {<code>+</code>,<code>-</code>} symbols we can generate a single <code>1</code>,<code>2</code>, or <code>3</code> symbol, and if we have four {<code>+</code>,<code>-</code>} we can generate two symbols. To make this more clear (and allow you to play with this process) we will demonstrate this in Racket. Our encoder takes the list in 3 at a time and then generates new symbols from the set {<code>1</code>,<code>2</code>, <code>3</code>} based on the rules we have. In racket we have implemented a function named <code>encode-1-3</code> which takes a {<code>+</code>,<code>-</code>} representation and encodes it as a 1-3 symbol representation.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; (encode-1-3 '(+ + +))
'(1)
&gt; (encode-1-3 '(+ + + -))
'(1 2)
&gt; (encode-1-3 '(+ + + - -))
'(1 2 2)
&gt; (encode-1-3 '(+ + + - - -))
'(1 2 2 1)
&gt; </code></pre>
<p>At this point it’s worth noting that every string of {<code>+</code>,<code>-</code>} symbols can be encoded in exactly one sequence of {<code>1</code>,<code>2</code>,<code>3</code>} symbols. Something interesting happens when we try to go the other way. Just looking at our original symbol definitions we know …</p></div>

TypeScript’s purpose <em>is </em>to be compiled into JavaScript. There is more, perhaps to add to the confusion: JavaScript itself is valid TypeScript because <strong>TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. </strong>You can simply change your <code>js</code> or <code>jsx</code> file to <code>ts</code> or <code>tsx</code> and congratulations! You’re writing in TypeScript.</p><p>If you understand the relationship between CSS and Sass, for example, you have a sense for what this means.</p><p>TypeScript was developed by Microsoft as an open source project in 2012. It offers a wealth of features that JavaScript does not offer. One of the most powerful features TypeScript has is robust ways of working with object types. TypeScript throws specific errors to help you debug. TypeScript also compiles into older versions of JavaScript, which allows your applications to be accessible by many browsers.</p><p>If you are not comfortable with JavaScript itself, I recommend learning JavaScript before diving into TypeScript.

The authors are practitioners, writing for practitioners — so the book outlines the process of building multiple apps using TypeScript and other popular libraries and frameworks. The book assumes knowledge in HTML, CSS, and modern JavaScript already.</p><p>A challenge of teaching TypeScript is that TypeScript often doesn’t function alone.

ULA kicked the weekend off with a Delta IV Heavy launch of an NRO spy satellite. The aging heavy lifter, which will be phased out and replaced by <a href="https://www.ulalaunch.com/rockets/vulcan-centaur" target="_blank">Vulcan</a> over the next few years, had a <a href="https://twitter.com/torybruno/status/1299623698090135552" target="_blank">T-3 sec hotfire abort</a> complete with a dramatic fireball (<a href="https://youtu.be/1jkjgo0Cs_8" target="_blank">video</a>). The rocket and payload are undamaged, but launch is delayed a week or more while expendable ground systems are replaced. Next up was SpaceX, launching <a href="https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/saocom-1.htm" target="_blank">SAOCOM-1B</a> into a polar orbit, the <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2020/08/spacex-polar-cape-50-years/" target="_blank">first such southward flight path from Florida since 1969</a> when <a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/tech-and-science/science/herd-shot-around-the-world-the-last-east-coast-polar-launch/article/567614" target="_blank">booster debris landed on Cuba</a> and <a href="https://www.mapfreglobalrisks.com/risks/images/Seguros_de_satelites_ENU_tcm1366-435032.pdf" target="_blank">killed a cow named Rufina</a> 🐮. Returning to this flight path was only possible due to the Falcon 9’s automated self-destruct systems—rocket exhaust in this flight path can block manually radioed abort messages. This launch was also temporarily halted due to its overflight of ULA’s aborted NROL-44 payload (expensive!) and required last minute approval from the NRO. To cap the weekend off,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/completed-missions/i-cant-believe-its-not-optical/" target="_blank">Rocket Lab returned to flight with their 14th mission</a> (and announced that they will be conducting a first soft ocean splashdown of the booster for their 17th mission). Their&nbsp;<em>I Can’t Believe It’s Not Optical</em> mission was a dedicated launch for <a href="https://www.capellaspace.com/technology" target="_blank">Capella Space</a>, a startup focused on capturing 0.5 m resolution <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic-aperture_radar" target="_blank">synthetic aperture radar</a> (SAR) data as a service, the first of an eight satellite constellation.

September 6, 2020 | https://danielrapp.github.io/doppler/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://danielrapp.github.io/doppler/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
      
      <p>
        Recently I stumbled upon <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/groups/cue/publications/guptasoundwavechi2012.pdf">an interesting paper</a> for
        implementing motion sensing requiring no special hardware, <i>only a speaker and mic</i>! Unfortunately the paper didn't include
        code to test it, so I decided to reproduce it here on the web!
      </p>
      <video muted="" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" controls="" width="700" height="300">
        <source src="https://danielrapp.github.io/doppler/example.ogv" type="video/ogg">
      </video>

      <h2>What is the doppler effect?</h2>
      <p>
        First of all, what is the doppler effect?
        The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect">doppler effect</a> is a physical phenomenom which affects waves in motion.
        The standard example is the effect on a fire engine siren as it quickly drives
        past. When it moves <i>towards</i> you the sound waves are compressed, and so the
        frequency becomes <i>higher</i>, and
        when it moves <i>away</i> from you the frequency becomes <i>lower</i>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This phenomenon actually has really wonderful applications in astronomy for figuring the speed
        at which galaxies are moving towards or away from us by looking at the frequency shift of light,
        but I digress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, it's important to realize that the doppler effect would also occur
        if you were to run towards the siren, rather than the siren moving towards you.
        We'll use this principle in the next section.
      </p>

      <h2>Measuring the doppler effect</h2>
      <p>
        In order to measure the doppler effect for motion detection on a conventional computer,
        what you can do is send out a sinusoid at some known (inaudible) frequency, say, 20 kHz.
        If something is moving in the room, then, after the sinusoid has bounced around on the walls and into the microphone, the
        sound will shift in frequency. This can be measured by looking at the frequency spectrum
        in the nearby region of the 20 kHz tone.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Note that you'll need to run Chrome with a fairly high speaker-volume for this to work optimally.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        The frequency spectrum of the microphone input is plotted above. The peak towards the right
        is due to the 20 kHz tone we're sending out. Try <span data-note="440">whistling</span> to see the spectrum change.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Here's a closer look, zooming in on the 20 kHz region.
        Try moving your hand <i>towards</i>
        the mic/computer to see the bulge shift to <i>higher</i> frequencies, and
        <i>away</i> from the computer to see it shift to <i>lower</i> frequencies.
      </p>

      <h2>Applications</h2>
      <p>
        Now for the fun applications!
      </p>

      <h3>Motion sensing</h3>
      <p>
        The most obvious application for this is motion sensing.
        Below I've calculated the left and right bandwidth of the 20 kHz
        region (defined as the number of frequencies to the left and right
        that are within 99.9% in amplitude of the 20 kHz tone).
        I've then attached their difference to the size of the box.
      </p>
      <canvas id="ball" width="700" height="100"></canvas>
      <p>
        The effect this produces is that when you move your hand <i>towards</i>
        the microphone, the box becomes smaller (you're <i>pushing</i>
        it inwards), and if you move your hand <i>away</i> from the microphone,
        the box becomes larger (you're <i>pulling</i> it outwards).
      </p>

      <h3>Scrolling</h3>
      
      <p>
        A cool application to motion sensing, as suggested by the
        <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/groups/cue/publications/guptasoundwavechi2012.pdf">SoundWave paper</a>,
        is scrolling (see the video above). Click below to try it out.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This implementation doesn't have the double-tap feature for reversing
        the scrolling-direction, instead it's just using the left and right bandwidth-difference.
        Thus if you want to scroll down you have to move your hand
        <i>quickly towards</i> the computer, and <i>slowly away</i> from the computer.
      </p>

      <h3>Theremin</h3>
      
      <p>
        We can also create an instrument with this by simply modulating
        the frequency of some base-tone, say at 440 Hz, based on the
        difference between the left and right bandwidth!
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This is reminiscent of a Theremin, in that you can contol
        sound by moving your hands in free space, yet different
        in that the Theremin is able to measure absolute distance from the base,
        whereas we can only measure relative motion.
      </p>

      <h2>Library</h2>
      <p>
        Did this give you any ideas? I also created <a href="https://github.com/DanielRapp/doppler">a small library</a> to play around with this.
        Just run
      </p>
        <pre><code>
  doppler.init(function(bandwidth) {
    var diff = bandwidth.left - bandwidth.right;
  });
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        to start experimenting.
      </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><span>Estimated reading time:</span> <span>3</span> <span>Minutes</span></p><p>I’ll start this blog post with a funny story: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://dev.bitolog.com/kubernetes-audits-introduction/" target="_blank">my last blog post</a> was an introduction to Kubernetes audits (which I recommend reading before diving into this post). As a continuing post, I wrote about what I thought to be the future of Kubernetes audits – <strong>the dynamic backend</strong>. Only to find out, a couple of days before publishing my post, that the dynamic backend (also known as the <code>AuditSink</code> API object)  was entirely removed.</p><div><figure><img width="453" height="108" src="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/auditsink-draft-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/auditsink-draft-1.png 453w, https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/auditsink-draft-1-300x72.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/auditsink-draft-1.png" data-srcset="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/auditsink-draft-1.png 453w, https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/auditsink-draft-1-300x72.png 300w"></figure></div><h2>What was it?</h2><p>The dynamic backend, first introduced in Kubernetes v1.13, was a third audit backend option. The first two being logging to a file and sending logs to a webhook – both defined via API server flags.</p><p>On the other hand, the dynamic backend introduced the ability to define a webhook endpoint dynamically. All you had to do is post the <code>AuditSink</code> object to the API server and you’re done. You could have also modify it at any point in time which was really cool!</p><p>The dynamic backend was a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/#feature-stages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kubernetes <em>alpha</em> feature</a>. The statistics regarding how many Kubernetes features eventually get discarded are unknown to me, but I can guess that this doesn’t happen often. This feature didn’t make it to GA (General Availability), and for me, at a very funny timing.</p><h2>Why was it removed?</h2><p>A few days ago, I got a notification from GitHub which stated that the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/600" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dynamic backend feature</a> has been closed, and will be removed in Kubernetes V1.19.</p><div><figure><img width="291" height="104" src="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/auditsink-removed.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/auditsink-removed.png"></figure></div><p>I asked around the Kubernetes slack channel to understand what happened, and <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-sig-auth/c/aV_nXpa5uWU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this is the explanation I got</a>:</p><p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: the feature did not progress for the last 1.5 years since the group responsible for it couldn’t agree on it’s future.</p><div><figure><img src="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dynamic-audit-sig.png" alt="" width="580" height="217" srcset="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dynamic-audit-sig.png 840w, https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dynamic-audit-sig-300x113.png 300w, https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dynamic-audit-sig-768x288.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dynamic-audit-sig.png" data-srcset="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dynamic-audit-sig.png 840w, https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dynamic-audit-sig-300x113.png 300w, https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dynamic-audit-sig-768x288.png 768w"></figure></div><p>As you can see the removal of this feature happened for two main reasons:</p><ol><li>The logging and webhook backends both use a static policy file. It is supplied, as mentioned above, via an API server flag. As opposed to them, the dynamic backend policy was dynamic. The team leaders tried to understand what was the right approach to implement this but couldn’t reach an agreement. At the time, <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/600#issuecomment-447636134" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I also struggled to understand how will that feature work exactly</a>.</li><li>Performance and scalability issues were very common when using this feature. I noted it several times when writing my original post. Part of the issue here was that the policy wasn’t fine grained as it is for the other backends. This caused a lot of performance issue. I guess that behind the scenes this was a lot more complex.</li></ol><p>And that was that.</p><p>I guess that’s the price you pay when trying to cover the most recent developments in the cloud world.</p></div></div>]]>

A deep baritone voice with a haunting background score can take a scene to a different level.</p><p>An example of this is my favorite scene from the movie “Shawshank Redemption.” In this scene, Andy Dufresne plays “Canzonetta sull’ aria” from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s “Le Nozze di Figaro” over the loudspeakers and enthralls his fellow inmates.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Hfe_1Fny-Q" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe></p><p>You can “watch” this scene repeatedly with your eyes closed, ears open, max volume, and Morgan Freeman’s narration will do the rest.</p><h2 id="importance-of-audio-in-sports">Importance of Audio in Sports</h2><p>Anyone who has ever watched South American football/soccer will recognize the quintessential “gooooooaaaaaaal” from the commentators every time a goal is scored. Here is a clip of South American football -</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UioCvLN-370" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe></p><p>But, what you <strong>also might have noticed is the noise of the crowd</strong> - all those fans screaming, cheering, hooting for their teams, and booing at the opposing teams.</p><p>This is what constitutes a home-ground advantage, right? Having a boisterous crowd yelling at the top of their voices and intimidating the opposition! It’s an integral part of large sporting events and is one reason people pay a lot of money to watch sports.</p><p>The right atmosphere counts!</p><h2 id="crowds-during-a-pandemic">Crowds during a pandemic?</h2><p>But, where are the crowds in a pandemic-stricken world? Leagues across Europe are making their way back with strict rules and regulations to prevent players and support staff from contracting and spreading the contagious COVID-19 virus.</p><p>Players apparently don’t shake hands, their change rooms are sanitized before and after matches, and the most significant change of them all - there are no crowds! Games will be played behind “closed doors” without any crowds and with minimal support and ground staff.</p><p>An inadvertent consequence of this decision is <strong>the absence of crowd noises</strong>. Imagine this for a minute -</p><blockquote><p>You have two teams battling it out on the field, the camera crew is capturing the event, and your audience is watching the live stream …. but without the crowd’s noise.</p></blockquote><p><strong>In other words, a terrible experience.</strong></p><h2 id="augmented-audio--fake-noise">Augmented Audio / Fake Noise</h2><p>DAZN is trying to add “augmented audio” for the Bundesliga matches and has created a Crowd-DJ position in their office!!</p><p>DAZN <a href="https://media.dazn.com/en/blog/2020/07/meet-the-bundesliga-crowd-dj/">said</a>, and I quote -</p><p><em>When the Bundesliga announced its return in early May, we immediately began exploring ways to create the most immersive experience for fans at home.</em></p><p><strong>When I read this, it sounded similar to</strong> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/1/20676854/electric-cars-artificial-safety-noise-low-speeds-european-union-rules-2019-2021"><strong>car manufacturers trying to add some artificial noise to their electric vehicles because they were too silent</strong></a><strong>!</strong></p><p>So, what DAZN did was break down the problem of augmented audio into small pieces and tackle them one at a time. A brilliant move!</p><ul><li>DAZN first <strong>recorded an empty stadium’s ambient noise</strong>, which forms the absolute baseline upon which you would layer other noises.</li><li>They then extracted the noises made by t<strong>he crowds, the players and coaches</strong>, and instances of goals, fouls, yellow, and red cards from their digital archives of the past years.</li><li>DAZN mentions that they also created a <strong>5-min clip of the crowd devoid of chanting</strong> <strong>and sudden noises</strong> and looped that clip throughout the match. They discovered that anything less than 5 minutes would probably be discovered as fake noise! Very interesting indeed.</li></ul><p>After gathering these clips, they had to enlist the services of an engineer who played the role of a <strong>“Crowd DJ."</strong> The crowd DJ’s job was to mix the noises at the right times to recreate the feeling that the game is being played in front of an actual crowd.</p><h2 id="is-augmented-audio-the-way-forward">Is Augmented Audio the way forward?</h2><p>I think it is if this pandemic continues without any vaccines coming out soon. <strong>Apart from this, the learnings that will come out of such experiments are invaluable.</strong></p><h3 id="audio-latency-problems">Audio Latency Problems?</h3><p>There are issues that anyone venturing into fake-noise/augmented audio has to consider, and the prime among them (in my opinion) is <strong>“audio latency."</strong> I would say this is similar to lip-sync issues that are SO annoying, but, in the case of fake noise for sporting events, audio latency would kill the viewing experience.</p><p>For example, imagine the following just happened.</p><blockquote><p>1 min for the game to end, and Ronaldo has the ball. He is tearing down the field and kicks the ball, which curves prodigiously and misses the goal by mere inches.</p></blockquote><p>In a real match, the <strong>sighs</strong> and the “oooh” s from the crowd would occur almost immediately after the goal was missed. This would be followed by loud cheering from the opposition.</p><p>But, in augmented audio, <strong>either the crowd-DJ gets the timing right or misses it completely</strong>. If the crowd-DJ adds the <em>“ooohs” and the “boos”</em> 3 seconds after the ball went past the goal, the experience is probably going to be worse than Ronaldo missing the goal in the first place!</p><p><strong>Only time and experience will tell if augmented audio / fake-noise will be a mainstay in the sports broadcasting industry.</strong></p></div></div>]]>

                    <p>If you’ve been following me over the last few months, you would most certainly know how many internet related issues I’ve been having since the start of 2020.</p>

<h2 id="if-not-lets-quickly-recap-from-the-very-beginning-of-our-internet-situation-at-home-in-south-africa">If not, let’s quickly recap from the very beginning of our internet situation at home in South Africa…</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>1999</strong>: Get Dial Up for the first time. I think it was an <a href="https://www.mweb.co.za/">Mweb</a> Big Black Box or something like that. I was only allowed to use the internet between 7pm and 7am and weekends. I think calls were unlimited for R7 during those hours.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>2007</strong>: Our area finally got ADSL. 384kbps, capped at 2gb per month. Considering now our daily usage is about 5-10gb, clearly streaming wasn’t big then.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>2010</strong>: Upgrade to 4mbps ADSL.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>2013</strong>: Upgrade to 10mbps ADSL.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>2018</strong>: Copper cable theft started becoming extremely common. During one month, it got stolen about 6 times, leaving us offline almost the whole month. We had no choice but to switch over to a Fixed LTE network called Rain, via an ISP called Afrihost. It was a great switch (at the time). Wireless cannot get stolen. Fast too - constantly 20-30mbps, rarely experiencing any downtime. Capped at 220gb, but more than enough for our family.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>2020</strong>:  And then 2020 came along, where I would notice at certain times of the day it would drop to less than 1mbps at certain times of the day.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://www.speedtest.net/result/9064720593.png" alt="0.15Mbps speedtest result"></p>

<p>Contacted Afrihost customer support a few times, but they always blame it on the wifi even though we know for a fact it’s most certainly not the issue, as it only happens at certain times of the day and are always fine in the evenings.</p>

<p>Turns out the reason is the network highly congested - I was on a fixed capped LTE product, paying R1350 per month and then Rain secretly launched a new product, unlimited LTE between 11pm to 6pm (19 hours), at R250 per month. Instead of migrating me as a Fixed LTE user onto another network, perhaps with higher QoS, I suddenly shared this network with the hundreds on the cheap R250 network, which is why my speeds dropped so dramatically outside of 6pm and 11pm. The R250 guys get cut off after 6pm and 11pm and then I have the network all to myself basically - but still, I’m paying for a 24/7 service, it shouldn’t only be usable for 4 hours a day.</p>

<p>I eventually setup my little Linux server at home to perform a speed test every hour and save the results onto a DB. I then graphed out the results on a little React App that I called <a href="https://www.rainspeedtest.co.za/"><strong>Rain Speedtest</strong></a> - I even registered a domain for it.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.ronaldlangeveld.com/assets/images/rain_speedtest.png" alt="Rain Speedtest"></p>

<p>I ended up sharing this with some friends, customer support and on a few forums. To this day it still get a lot of traffic.</p>

<p>After sending the speedtest data to Rain and Afrihost, they eventually admitted the local LTE tower is extremely congested and there is nothing they can/will do about it. Afrihost eventually helped me out and sent me a new router + sim card for the MTN Network, the caveat is that it’s capped at 150gb, so now I have to be even more careful with data.</p>

<p>Although not a permanent solution as its capped, at least it gives me a stable connection, that doesn’t go as slow as Rain. It does sometime, become slow, but usually quite solid.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.speedtest.net/result/9296185363.png" alt="90Mbps"></p>

<p>My permanent solution would be to get Fibre… After about 8 months and 100+ emails with multiple Fibre Network Operators, I finally got a company to install Fibre in our area. That will be my next blog post and how you can get that to happen if you don’t have FTTH in your neighbourhood yet.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Like many people, I have most of my best ideas in the shower.</p><p>This is sometimes annoying: I could use more than one shower’s worth of good ideas a day, but I’d rather not end up as a shrivelled yet insightful prune. Mostly, though, shower ideas are the incentive that keeps me smelling okay, so I grudgingly accept the constraint.</p><p>The time when it was most constraining was the first time I became a manager. I only had a few reports, so managing them wasn’t a full-time job. But I was very bad at it, and so it <em>should have</em> been what I spent all my shower insights on.</p><p>Unfortunately, I was spending my non-management time on programming. And even if I tried to use my showers to think about my thorny and awkward people issues, my mind somehow always wandered off to tackle those nice, juicy software design problems instead.</p><p>Management Attempt #1 didn’t go very well; being distracted by programming, I made lots of embarrassing mistakes that made my reports’ lives harder, which in turn made me feel stressed and guilty. I ended up bouncing back to being an individual contributor after a few months.</p><p>That experience of mine resonates strongly with Byrne Hobart’s <a href="https://diff.substack.com/p/the-future-of-remote-work-is-not" target="_blank">observation about focus in knowledge work</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The output of knowledge workers is extremely skewed based on focus. The productivity tiers seem to be:</p><ol><li><p>&lt;10% focused on the job at hand: meaningful risk of getting fired.</p></li><li><p>10-50% focus: “meets expectations,” gets regular raises.</p></li><li><p>50%+ focus: superstar, 10x engineer, destined for greatness.</p></li></ol></blockquote><p>“50%+ focus” is roughly when something becomes <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/top.html" target="_blank">the top idea in your mind</a>. It’s when you start caring enough to think about it in the shower. It’s when you start habitually asking “how could this go faster?” It’s when you get <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/relres.html" target="_blank">relentlessly resourceful</a>. It’s around when you start <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/impatient/">annoying your coworkers and/or significant other</a>, although that part is avoidable with practice.</p><p>Most importantly, you can only be 50%+-focused on one thing at a time—or zero, in bad cases. That makes it critical to conserve your attention, so that you can spend it on what matters.</p><p>I’ve found a few different strategies that help me with this:</p><h3 id="care-viscerally">Care viscerally</h3><p>It’s hard to recruit 50%+ of your brain to work on something just because you feel like you “should” do it. Your superego might listen to this newfangled “logic” and “reason” stuff, but the monkey-era parts of your brain can’t be fooled so easily. To be reliably able to focus on something, you need to be intuitively, emotionally invested in the outcome.</p><p>For me, that’s not automatic—for instance, even though <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/work/">I’m incredibly excited about what Wave is doing</a>, my day-to-day motivation gets worse if I work remotely for too long without visiting our operations in Senegal. Unless I can periodically see for myself that people are using the things we’re building, it starts feeling a little bit fake, like the so-called “real world” is a simulation that I can only communicate with via Slack channels and <code>git push</code>.</p><h3 id="monotask">Monotask</h3><p>As a programmer, I tried to make sure that I was only ever working on one thing at a time. Even if I got stuck on that one thing—say I was blocked on waiting for a tech partner to give me API documentation—I’d let myself stay stuck instead of sliding off to work on something else.</p><p>In the short term, this made me less efficient, because I’d spend less time programming and more time staring vacantly at the ceiling. But if I stared vacantly for long enough, I’d eventually get mad enough to, e.g., reverse-engineer the partner’s API in a fit of rage. This resulted in me shipping my most important projects faster, hence getting <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/impatient/#startups">faster compounding growth</a>.</p><h3 id="evade-obligations">Evade obligations</h3><p>As a manager, it became impossible to “only work on one thing:” there were too many small tasks and too many projects going on in parallel. But I have a similar principle: I can only have one <em>obligation to other people</em>. “Give advice on this project?” Whenever you want! “Review my 1,000-line change?” Only if review isn’t blocking you from shipping it. “Check in every so often to make sure this doesn’t go off the rails?” Sorry, I have to, uh, powder my nose. “Figure out what the process should be?” I’ll get back to you in a couple years. (The best process is no process, right?)</p><p>During Management Attempt #1, my programming project distracted me so much because other people cared a lot that I finished it—if I ever had to de-prioritize it, I would make those people sad. This made it take up my attention (by worrying about letting people down) even when I wasn’t working on it. Unfortunately, since management work comes in urgent bursts, I’d often end up in a situation where I had to delay either the programming or the management—i.e., choose between making two different sets of people sad—and in those cases it was very hard for me to control my focus.</p><p>Now that I’ve noticed this, I allow myself to contribute to multiple things in parallel, as long as they don’t tax my object permanence skills—if I totally forgot about this project today, would anything bad happen? As long as the answer is no (usually because someone else is the one taking initiative to move things forward), I can be pretty sure that project won’t try to colonize my brain in the shower.</p><h3 id="timebox-bullshit">Timebox bullshit</h3><p>Even if I have only one major project that other people depend on, I somehow always end up with a bunch of minor chores to do—responding to emails, deflecting secondary obligations, buying household necessities, powdering my nose, filing expense reports, etc.</p><p>For these, I employ a “bullshit timebox”—a one-hour period a few times a week when I do <a href="http://paulgraham.com/vb.html" target="_blank">all the things life is too short for</a>. During the remaining 165 hours per week, I do my resolute best not to think about any of the bullshit, no matter how much people bug me about whether a <a href="https://thume.ca/2019/03/03/my-tungsten-cube/" target="_blank">1.5” tungsten cube</a> is really a legitimate work expense.</p><p>In order for bullshit not to distract me for the rest of the week, I try to minimize my number of “open loops”—projects or processes that I’ve started but not completed. Much like how I single-task on programming until it’s done, I’ll make phone calls instead of email threads, or, God forbid, texts or instant messaging. It took a while for me to train my friends not to instant message me, but by now they remember my rants about how distracting it is, practically word-for-word.</p><hr><p>Management Attempt #2 didn’t go great for me either. But I finally did an okay job at Management Attempt #3. Part of this was because I avoided repeating the particular mistakes of Attempts #1 and #2. But part of it was that on Attempt #3, our engineering team grew quickly enough that I went from “no managing” straight to “full-time managing” with no transitional period in which to be distracted, screw up and be miserable.</p><p>Once I was full-time managing, I had no shiny distractions and was able to spend my showers focusing on how to be a better manager. And once I was 50%+ focused, well, I haven’t become a “superstar 10x manager” yet, but I quickly stopped being 0.1x.</p></article></div>]]>

Good News: <a href="https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond">Deep Diamond</a>() preview release is in Clojars, and is already quite useful! And fast!
It is yet to be fully polished, but you can try it now and, I hope, you'll like it.

It now covers the functionality that is being explained from scratch in the <a href="http://aiprobook.com/">books that I'm writing</a>.
Convolutions work, too; at the speed of Road Runner!

through the direct equivalent of this fine <a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py">MNIST CNN example in Keras</a>.

<p>
We specify the network by plain Clojure vectors and functions, and create the blueprint.
No need for special compilers and whatnot. The structure of internal parts would be
picked up automatically, or we can specify these explicitly.

<p>
The blueprint is a Clojure function that can instantiate the network
object that holds the parameter tensors that the network should learn by using
one of the built-in optimization algorithms. In this case, I'll use adaptive moments,
<code>:adam</code>. Xavier initialization is, again, a plain function that initializes
the network with appropriate weights.

<div id="text-orgae4dec0">
<p>
The original MNIST data is distributed through four binary files that
you can download <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">here</a>. To demonstrate how nice Clojure is, I'm not
using any special MNIST-specific code that is magically imported
from the framework's model Zoo. The complete code, from scratch, is at the
end of the article (I'm just pushing it there so it doesn't steal the spotlight :).

</pre>
</div>

<p>
The network learns in mini-batches of 128 images of the total of 60000,
with adaptive moments, through 12 full epochs. That makes 5625 forward/backward
update cycles.
</p>

<p>
The total time for that on my old 2013. i7-4790k CPU is: <b>368</b> seconds.
<b>6 minutes for 6000 cycles. A thousand cycles per minute.</b>
</p>

<p>
Isn't that a lot? You should try and run this in Keras with TensorFlow, and
see that we got a pretty nice performance! (I'll publish some comparisons soon,
and in the meantime you can try for yourself!).

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p><a href="https://app.qvault.io/">My team</a> has been spending less of our “free” time working on bugs and features from the backlog, and more time refactoring our codebases and test suites. As a result, and perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, we’ve noticed a significant increase in our throughput of features and bug fixes.</p>



<p>As it turns out, its easy to find bugs and add features to a well-written codebase that the entire team is familiar with. Go figure.</p>



<p>My team started a loose goal to spend 25% of our time refactoring, revisiting, and restyling existing code and tests. Let’s go over some of the benefits we’ve seen since making the change.</p>



<h2>Context and Caveats</h2>



<p>I’ve found that in articles like this it’s important to give as much context to the situation as possible, as certain development methodologies may work better or worse in teams with a different size, tech stack, or development process. Here are some notable things about our situation:</p>



<ul><li>3 engineers on my team, ~16 in the company</li><li>Tech stack – Go, Postgres, ElasticSearch and RabbitMQ</li><li>Microservices architecture on Kubernetes</li><li>Kanban-style development process – <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/05/18/leave-scrum-to-rugby-i-like-getting-stuff-done/">no scrum</a></li><li>Our team is responsible for ~14 repositories</li><li>Each repo represents a small service in a data pipeline process that handles sorting and NLP of social media posts</li></ul>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-1024x592.png" alt="Go Kubernetes" width="512" height="296" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-1024x592.png 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-300x173.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-768x444.png 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-150x87.png 150w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes.png 1245w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" title="go kubernetes"></figure></div>



<h2>Code Familiarity</h2>



<p>With only 3 engineers on the pipeline team and ~14 repositories (Mostly REST APIs and ETL processes), it was hard for all three of us to be super familiar with all the code. When we needed a new microservice, one team member typically wrote the first iteration, and one other team member did a quick code review. The engineer who did the first iteration would then be primarily responsible for bug fixes and new features relating to that project.</p>



<p>By focusing more of our time on reviewing and refactoring existing code, it gave us a chance to hop into projects that we never would have had a reason to become familiar with. Not only does getting more eyes on a project mean the overall code quality will likely go up, but it also means we aren’t hosed when the original maintainer has gone.</p>



<h2>Slow to Fix Bugs</h2>



<p>When you get deep into spaghetti code, it can be really hard to find bugs. Not only that but in a messy codebase, sometimes fixing a bug can actually <em>add</em> to the “uncleanliness” of the code. You may have to exacerbate or extend an already bad architectural pattern in order to get a bug fix in.</p>



<p>Ideally, you would do the refactoring first and then fix the bug (assuming the bug still exists after a good refactoring). Unfortunately, oftentimes there isn’t enough time to refactor a project before fixing a critical bug. For this reason, we should always be refactoring so that bug fixes can happen quickly and won’t make the code quality worse than it is.</p>



<h2>Slow to Add Features</h2>



<p>I don’t want to beat a dead horse, the reasoning here is largely the same as with bug fixes. Adding features to a messy codebase just makes it messier. It’s like frosting a cake that’s been thrown on the ground – it might taste marginally better but now it’s even harder to clean up.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="261" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/happy_birthday_to_ground.gif" alt="Happy Birthday to the Ground" title="happy birthday to ground"></figure></div>



<h2>Try It Yourself</h2>



<p>Since adding a consistent refactoring process to our team’s routine, we’ve been able to put <em>more</em> features through to production while spending <em>less</em> time working on them. Let me know what you think and if you have a different experience.</p>

    <p>With everything that we have added to our library so far we are almost capable of generated small
tunes. One thing that’s missing to make it sound more ‘natural’ is a way for the notes to start and
stop.</p>
<p>In this post we will implement a type of envelope called “ADSR”, for “Attack, Decay, Sustain,
Release”. Which will make the notes sound more natural as they are played in sequence.</p>
<p>To see why we need this, listen to this sound generated without an ADSR envelope around the
generated frames.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/audio/part10/no_adsr.wav">Without ADSR</a></li>
<li><a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/audio/part10/adsr.wav">With ADSR</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to read the (not pretty) code that generated this, check out this <a href="https://gist.github.com/DylanMeeus/83f3ae5d628d11533b8fbd47298d8434">github
gist</a>.</p>

<p>The Attack, Decay, Sustain and Release envelope is a common type of envelope. Schematically this can
be represented as below (from wikipedia):</p>
<p><img src="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/audio/part10/adsrschema.png" alt="Wikipedia schematic of ADSR envelope"></p>
<p>As we apply this envelope to a signal, the signal will change in amplitude depending on which phase
we are in of the ADSR envelope. In the image it is visible that the amplitude rises during the
attack step, reaches a peak amplitude before decreasing a bit. After decreasing it reached the
sustain amplitude, where it will stay until the note is released, and after release it decays until
the ampltide is zero.</p>
<p>For our parameters, three will relate to time:</p>
<ul>
<li>attack (time to rise)</li>
<li>decay (time to fall to sustain level)</li>
<li>release (time to decay from sutan to zero)</li>
</ul>
<p>So the Sustain parameter does not refer to time, but rather to the amplitude we will maintain.</p>
<p>Turning this schematic into code, we get :</p>

</div><p>One parameter in this function that you don’t find in the schematic is the need for a control rate.
The control rate will be used to turn a duration in seconds into an amount of frames. The control
rate could just be sample rate but this does not necessarily have to be the case. One such use-case
us sub-audio modulation, whereby the modulating oscillator is running below 20Hz. You can check
<a href="https://cmtext.indiana.edu/synthesis/chapter4_modulation.php">this chapter</a> for a bit more on that.</p>

<p>To apply the ADSR envelope to a signal, for example to one that was generating using the <a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/posts/audio-from-scratch-pt8.md">oscillator
we created</a> we have to iterate over
each frame, pass the current frame to the ADSR function, and modify the amplitude of the frame with
the result. For example, this is the complete example program included in
<a href="https://github.com/DylanMeeus/GoAudio/blob/master/examples/adsr/main.go">GoAudio</a>.</p>

<p><a name="cut"></a>
Imagine you're developing a service... For certainty, let's call it <em>A</em>. It's going to provide some public HTTP API to its clients. However, to serve requests it needs to call another service. Let's call this upstream service - <em>B</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/service-proxy-pod-sidecar-oh-my/10-service-a-service-b.png" width="100%">
</p>

<p>Obviously, neither network nor service <em>B</em> is ideal. If service <em>A</em> wants to decrease the impact of the failing upstream requests on its public API success rate, it has to do something about errors. For instance, it could start retrying failed requests.
<a name="eofcut"></a></p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/service-proxy-pod-sidecar-oh-my/20-service-a-service-b-with-retries.png" width="100%">
</p>

<p>Implementation of the retry mechanism requires some code changes in the service <em>A</em>, but the codebase is fresh, there are tons of advanced HTTP libraries, so you just need to grab one... Easy-peasy, right?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this simplicity is not always the case. Replace service <em>A</em> with service <em>Z</em> that was written 10 years ago in some esoteric language by a developer that already retired. Or add to the equitation services <em>Q</em>, <em>U</em>, and <em>X</em> written by different teams in three different languages. As a result, the cumulative cost of the company-wide retry mechanism implementation in the code gets really high...</p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/service-proxy-pod-sidecar-oh-my/30-service-qux-service-b.png" width="100%">
</p>

<p>But what if retries are not the only thing you need? Proper <em>request timeouts</em> have to be ensured as well. And how about <em>distributed tracing</em>? It'd be nice to correlate the whole request tree with the original customer transaction by propagating some additional HTTP headers. However, every such capability would make the HTTP libraries even more bloated...</p>
<h2 id="a-namemeet-the-solutionameet-the-solution"><a name="meet-the-solution"></a>Meet the solution</h2>
<p>Let's try to go one level higher... or lower? 🤔</p>
<p>In our original setup, service <em>A</em> has been communicating with service <em>B</em> directly. But what if we put an intermediary infrastructure component in between those services? Thanks to containerization, orchestration, devops, <del>add a buzz word of your choice here</del>, nowadays, it became so simple to configure infrastructure, that the cost of adding another infra component is often lower than the cost of writing application code...</p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/service-proxy-pod-sidecar-oh-my/40-service-a-sidecar-service-b.png" width="100%">
</p>

<p>For the sake of simplicity, let's call the box enclosing the service <em>A</em> and the secret intermediary component <em>a server</em> (bare metal or virtual, doesn't really matter). And now it's about time to introduce one of the fancy words from the article's title. Any piece of software running on the server <em>alongside</em> the primary service and helping it do its job is called <em>a sidecar</em>. I hope, the idea behind the name is more or less straightforward here.</p>
<p>But getting back to the service-to-service communication problem, what sidecar should we use to keep the service code free of the low-level details such as retries or request tracing? Well, the needed piece of software is called a <em>service proxy</em>. Probably, the most widely used implementation of the service proxy in the real world is <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/">envoy</a>.</p>
<p>The idea of the service proxy is the following: instead of accessing the service <em>B</em> directly, code in the service <em>A</em> now will be sending requests to the service proxy sidecar. Since both of the processes run on the same server, the loopback network interface (i.e. <code>127.0.0.1</code> <em>aka</em> <code>localhost</code>) is perfectly suitable for this part of the communication. On every received HTTP request, the service proxy sidecar will make a request to the upstream service using the external network interface of the server. The response from the upstream will be eventually forwarded back by the sidecar to the service <em>A</em>.</p>
<p>I think, at this time, it's already obvious where the retry, timeouts, tracing, etc. logic should reside. Having this kind of functionality provided by a separate sidecar process makes enhancing any service written in any language with such capabilities rather trivial.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, that service proxy could be used not only for outgoing traffic (egress) but also for the incoming traffic (ingress) of the service <em>A</em>. Usually, there is plenty of cross-cutting things that can be tackled on the ingress stage. For instance, proxy sidecars can do <em>SSL</em> termination, request authentication, and more. A detailed diagram of a single server setup could look something like that:</p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/service-proxy-pod-sidecar-oh-my/50-single-host-sidecar.png" width="100%">
</p>

<p>Probably, the last fancy term we are going to cover here is <em>a pod</em>. People have been deploying code using virtual machines or bare metal servers for a long time... A server itself is already a good abstraction and a unit of encapsulation. For instance, every server has at least one external network interface, a network loopback interface for the internal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication">IPC</a> needs, and it can run a bunch of processes sharing access to these communication means. Servers are usually addressable within the private network of the company by their IPs. Last but not least, it's pretty common to use a whole server for a single purpose (otherwise, maintenance quickly becomes a nightmare). I.e. you may have a group of identical servers running instances of service <em>A</em>, another group of servers each running an instance of service <em>B</em>, etc. So, why on earth would anybody want something better than a server?</p>
<p>Despite being a good abstraction, the orchestration overhead servers introduce is often too high. So people started thinking about how to package applications more efficiently and that's how we got containers. Well, probably you know that <em>Docker</em> and <em>container</em> had been kind of a synonym for a long time and folks from Docker have been actively advocating for <em>"a one process per container"</em> model. Obviously, this model is pretty different from the widely used <em>server</em> abstraction where multiple processes are allowed to work side by side. And that's how we got the concept of <em>pods</em>. A pod is just a group of containers sharing a bunch of namespaces. If we now run a single process per container all of the processes in the pod will still share the common execution environment. In particular, the network namespace. Thus, all the containers in the pod will have a shared loopback interface and a shared external interface with an IP address assigned to it. Then it's up to the orchestration layer (say hi to Kubernetes) how to make all the pods reachable within the network by their IPs. And that's how people reinvented servers...</p>
<p>So, getting back to all those blue boxes enclosing the service process and the sidecar on the diagrams above - we can think of them as being either a virtual machine, a bare metal server, or a pod. All three of them are more or less interchangeable abstractions.</p>
<p>To summarize, let's try to visualize how the service to service communication could look like with the proxy sidecars:</p>

<p>Since the only way to really understand something is to <del>write a blog post about it</del> implement it yourself, let's quickly hack a <a href="https://github.com/iximiuz/envoy-playground">demo environment</a>.</p>
<h4 id="a-nameservice-a-talks-to-service-b-directlyaservice-a-talks-to-service-b-directly"><a name="service-a-talks-to-service-b-directly"></a>Service A talks to service B directly</h4>
<p>We will start from the simple setup where service <em>A</em> will be accessing service <em>B</em> directly:</p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/service-proxy-pod-sidecar-oh-my/70-demo-direct.png" width="100%">
</p>

<p>The code of the <a href="https://github.com/iximiuz/envoy-playground/tree/master/basics/service-a">service <em>A</em></a> is relatively straightforward. It's just a simple HTTP server that makes a call to its upstream service <em>B</em> on every client request. Depending on the response from the upstream, <em>A</em> returns either an HTTP 200 or HTTP 500 to the client.</p>
<pre><code>package main

// ...

var requestCounter = prometheus.NewCounterVec(
    prometheus.CounterOpts{
        Name: "service_a_requests_total",
        Help: "The total number of requests received by Service A.",
    },
    []string{"status"},
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    resp, err := httpGet(os.Getenv("UPSTREAM_SERVICE"))
    if err == nil {
        fmt.Fprintln(w, "Service A: upstream responded with:", resp)
        requestCounter.WithLabelValues("2xx").Inc()
    } else {
        http.Error(w, fmt.Sprintf("Service A: upstream failed with: %v", err.Error()),
            http.StatusInternalServerError)
        requestCounter.WithLabelValues("5xx").Inc()
    }
}

func main() {
    // init prometheus /metrics endpoint

    http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(
        os.Getenv("SERVICE_HOST")+":"+os.Getenv("SERVICE_PORT"), nil))
}</code></pre>
<p><i>(see full version on <a href="https://github.com/iximiuz/envoy-playground/tree/master/basics/service-a/main.go">GitHub</a>)</i></p>

<p>Notice that instead of hard-coding, we use <code>SERVICE_HOST</code> and <code>SERVICE_PORT</code> env variables to specify the host and port of the HTTP API endpoint. It'll come in handy soon. Additionally, the code of the service relies on the <code>UPSTREAM_SERVICE</code> env variable when accessing the upstream service <em>B</em>.</p>
<p>To get some visibility, the code is instrumented with the primitive counter metric <code>service_a_requests_total</code> that gets incremented on every incoming request. We will use an instance of <a href="https://github.com/iximiuz/envoy-playground/tree/master/basics/prometheus">prometheus</a> service to scrape the metrics exposed by the service <em>A</em>.</p>
<p>The implementation of the upstream <a href="https://github.com/iximiuz/envoy-playground/tree/master/basics/service-b">service <em>B</em></a> is trivial as well. It's yet another HTTP server. However its behavior is rather close to a static endpoint.</p>
<pre><code>package main

// ...

var ERROR_RATE int

var (
    requestCounter = prometheus.NewCounterVec(
        prometheus.CounterOpts{
            Name: "service_b_requests_total",
            Help: "The total number of requests received by Service B.",
        },
        []string{"status"},
    )
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    if rand.Intn(100) &gt;= ERROR_RATE {
        fmt.Fprintln(w, "Service B: Yay! nounce", rand.Uint32())
        requestCounter.WithLabelValues("2xx").Inc()
    } else {
        http.Error(w, fmt.Sprintf("Service B: Ooops... nounce %v", rand.Uint32()),
            http.StatusInternalServerError)
        requestCounter.WithLabelValues("5xx").Inc()
    }
}

func main() {
    // set ERROR_RATE
    // init prometheus /metrics endpoint

    http.HandleFunc("/", handler)

    // Listen on all interfaces
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":"+os.Getenv("SERVICE_PORT"), nil))
}</code></pre>
<p><i>(see full version on <a href="https://github.com/iximiuz/envoy-playground/tree/master/basics/service-b/main.go">GitHub</a>)</i></p>

<p>Probably the only interesting part here is <code>ERROR_RATE</code>. The service is designed to fail requests with some constant rate, i.e. if <code>ERROR_RATE</code> is <em>20</em>, approximately 20% of requests will fail with HTTP 500 status code. As with the service <em>A</em>, we will use prometheus to scrape basic usage statistics, see the counter <code>service_b_requests_tot…</code></p></div></div>

  <p>Containers need to communicate with each other and outside world.<br>
Docker has wide network capabilities.</p>
<p>What we can do with docker network? How to use it?</p>
<h2 id="docker-network-theory">Docker Network Theory</h2>
<p>What elements we have in docker network?</p>
<ul>
<li>CNM</li>
<li>libnetwork</li>
<li>drivers</li>
</ul>
<p>Docker network concept is based on open-source design specification called Container Network Model(CNM). CNM assume that network drivers should be pluggable.<br>
Docker CNM implementation is in <code>libnetwork</code> library.</p>
<p>What we can do with docker CNM?</p>
<ul>
<li>single-host bridges</li>
<li>multi-host overlay networks</li>
<li>networks plugged into VLAN’s</li>
<li>ingress networks with load balancing
Also we get auto service discovery for our containers.</li>
</ul>
<p>What elements we have in docker CNM implementation?</p>
<ul>
<li>sandboxes - container network stack - isolated - ethernet interfaces, ports, routing tables and DNS config</li>
<li>endpoint - virtual interfaces in containers - veth</li>
<li>networks - virtual switches(bridges) - connect endpoints</li>
</ul>
<p>What drivers are built-in by default into docker(Linux)?</p>
<ul>
<li>bridge</li>
<li>overlay</li>
<li>macvlan</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="single-host-network-bridge">Single-host network bridge</h2>
<p>By default docker creates one brigde after instalation.</p>
<p>All containers are by default connected to it unless we override it.<br>
To set another non-default network we use <code>--network</code> flag for <code>docker run</code>.</p>
<p>What is the diference between default bridge and user created one:</p>
<ul>
<li>Default brigde is less secure - provide less isolation - by default all containers will be connected to it</li>
<li>We can connect/disconnect containers from user defined bridges without restarting containers</li>
<li>Defualt bridge does not have DNS included - we must use IP in such network - on user defined bridge we get DNS(all containers added to bridge network automatically will be added also to DNS) - just connect container to bridge and you can talk with other containers in network by their names(works for named containers with <code>--name</code> at creation time)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can see that all default networks are local - what means that we can’t connect with them containers on multiple docker hosts.</p>

<h3>What’s the digital equivalent of sticky notes?</h3>



<p><span>01</span> Hey</p>



<p>This was originally supposed to be a blog post about <a href="https://www.hey.com/">Hey</a>. I wanted to write a longer essay about Basecamp’s new email tool and test if the app actually lives up to its hype.</p>



<p>After playing around with it for a few weeks, my conclusion is this: <strong>Hey’s most interesting aspect is not its radical approach to email – but its fresh approach to note taking!</strong></p>



<p>We have long treated notes as a distinct silo in our productivity stack, when we should have integrated them right into our workflows instead. While email might need an overhaul, I see a way bigger opportunity in rethinking digital note taking.</p>



<p>So instead of my Hey review, let’s talk about notes and my idea for a radically new kind of note taking app.</p>



<p><span>02</span> A Closer Look at Notes in Hey</p>



<p>Hey has two interesting notes features.</p>



<p>The first are so-called <a href="https://hey.com/features/thread-notes/">Thread Notes</a>. These are basically emails to yourself within an email thread that only you can see. You might have seen similar internal notes features in shared inbox tools like Zendesk or Front. Thread Notes in Hey are effectively the single player version of those.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/threadnotes.png"></p><p>I’d find Thread Notes super useful in combination with snoozed emails: <em>“Show me this email again in [insert time] and remind me of [insert note]”</em></p>



<p>This feels like a way better workflow than adding a note in a separate reminder, to-do, CRM, or note taking app.</p>



<p>a) Because there’s no need for context/app switching.<br>b) You might not even remember that you took a note related to an email when it resurfaces in your inbox a few weeks later.</p>



<p>To-do and reminder apps (and calendars!) work great for tasks that are tied to a specific day or time. But many tasks – and especially notes – are not dependent on time. Their relevance is based on other trigger points. Only when certain conditions are met, should these notes resurface: <em>“If [insert event] is true, then show [note]”</em></p>



<p>In the case of our email, the note becomes relevant in <em>[insert snooze time]</em> or whenever the recipient replies to the email thread. The fact that many tasks have external dependencies (which are usually linked to an email thread)  is one of the reasons I believe that your email inbox should also be the place where you manage your to-dos. <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/01/17/superhuman-the-productivity-meta-layer/">You shouldn’t need a separate to-do app</a>.</p>



<center>—</center>



<p>The second note feature in Hey are <a href="https://hey.com/features/inbox-notes/">Inbox Notes</a>.</p>



<p>As the name suggests, these notes are added to individual emails in your inbox. Similar to Thread Notes, you can use them to quickly jot down things you need to remember, but they also help you to highlight specific emails.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/inboxnotesimp.png"></p><p>Thread Notes and Inbox Notes feel similar, but they serve two slightly different use cases. Thread Notes work more like reminders (<em>“Don’t forget X when you reply”</em>), whereas Inbox Notes feel more like bookmarks that highlight the most important messages in a long list of emails. </p>



<p>Together, they remind me of one of my all-time favorite note taking tools: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-it_Note">Post-it Notes</a>.</p>



<p><span>03</span> Post-it Notes</p>



<p>I’m a huge fan of physical note taking and there are two writing tools that I use every single day: A physical notebook (for longer thoughts, including first drafts of my blog posts) and post-it notes (for all kinds of quick notes).</p>



<p>(Disclaimer: When I say “post-it notes” I’m referring to all types of sticky notes, not just those sold by 3M.)</p>



<p>Post-it notes serve two of the same functions that Hey’s note features offer: highlights and reminders.</p>



<p>One of the reasons I still read a lot of non-fiction in physical book form is because it’s easier to bookmark and annotate passages that I quickly want to find again later. Similar to Thread Notes, sticky note bookmarks help me <strong>highlight</strong> the most important items in a long list.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/postithighlight-1.png"></p><p>Apart from helping you find important passages in a book later on, sticky note bookmarks also allow you to add additional context to the section you highlighted (e.g. *why* you bookmarked a particular section or thoughts you had about it). </p>



<p>You could write down notes like this in a separate notebook, but then you’d lose the connection to the source they are based on. <strong>What makes post-it notes so interesting is the spatial relationship between the notes and their respective context.</strong></p>



<p>It’s this spatial relationship that also make post-it notes great <strong>reminders</strong>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/postitreminders.png"></p><p>Post-it note reminders are similar to Hey’s Thread Notes in that they are triggered not based on time but on events that don’t have a (forecastable) deadline. They are essentially like notifications that appear when you look at specific objects.</p>



<p>A post-it note on your front door, for example, is like a notification that pops up when you’re about to leave the house: <em>“Before you go, don’t forget to [insert note]”</em>. A shopping list on your fridge is a data request notification that surfaces when you are most likely to have new items to add to your list.</p>



<p>Together, post-its essentially become a notes layer that augments the real world. Instead of a physical notebook that lists all your notes and tasks in chronological order, post-it notes are scattered around your house but tied to specific places or objects where they are most relevant.</p>



<p>The question is: <strong>Why isn’t there a digital note taking tool that works like this?</strong></p>



<p><span>04</span> A Spatial Note Taking Layer</p>



<p>There are dozens of great note taking apps out there: Evernote, Google Keep, Apple Notes, Workflowy, Notion, Roam … the list goes on and on. Every one of these tools has its own unique angle on note taking, but they all have one thing in common: They are stand-alone apps.</p>



<p>This strikes me as suboptimal. Neither the creation nor the consumption of notes should be treated as separate workflows.</p>



<p>As John Palmer points out in his brilliant posts on <a href="https://darkblueheaven.com/spatialinterfaces/">Spatial Interfaces</a> and <a href="https://darkblueheaven.com/spatialsoftware">Spatial Software</a>, “Humans are spatial creatures [who] experience most of life in relation to space”. Post-it notes are so powerful because they have a spatial relationship to their context.</p>



<p>Many notes shouldn’t live in a dedicated note taking app that you explicitly have to open and search. Notes should emerge automatically whenever and *wherever* they are most relevant.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/statusquonotes-1.png"></p><p>As long as note taking remains separated, users constantly have to switch back and forth between different applications, which is not ideal. It reminds me of <a href="https://kwokchain.com/2019/08/16/the-arc-of-collaboration/">the recent discussion around productivity and collaboration</a> – which have historically also been treated as two separate, isolated workflows:</p>



<p><i>The platonic flow of productivity should minimize time spent not productive, with collaboration as aligned and unblocking with that flow as possible. By definition, any app that requires you to switch out of your productivity app to collaborate is blocking and cannot be maximally aligned. It’s fine to leave your productivity app for exceptions and breaks. But not ideal when working.</i></p>



<p>The same applies to notes. You shouldn’t have to switch apps and context to take or consume notes. It should stay within the same workflow!</p>



<p>(Side Note: You could argue that note taking is essentially single-player collaboration where you communicate with your future self – but that’s a whole new discussion I’ll save for another blog post.)</p>



<p>Natively built in note taking features like email notes in Hey feel like a good step in the right direction – but email is just one distinct silo in your productivity stack. Imagine you had to buy different sets of post-it notes for every single room or object in your house.</p>



<p>What we need instead is a spatial meta layer for notes on the OS-level that lives across all apps and workflows. This would allow you to instantly take notes without having to switch context. Even better yet, the notes would automatically resurface whenever you revisit the digital location you left them at.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/noteslayer-1.png"></p><p>Let’s look at a few examples.</p>



<p><span>05</span> Examples</p>



<p>One use case that immediately came to mind when I thought about spatial notes is bookmarking.</p>



<p>Most of us don’t use just one bookmarking app for everything. We use different bookmarking apps or bookmarking features depending on the type of object we want to save for later: Podcasts are usually saved in a dedicated podcast app, for example. Articles are bookmarked in Pocket, books on Goodreads, songs on Spotify, places on Foursquare, products on Amazon … you get my point.</p>



<p>Bookmarks are great to remember *what* you want to revisit later – but not *why* you saved something in the first place. I would love to be able to add notes to my bookmarks directly in each app so that I have some context on why these objects are important when I return to them later.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/podcastnote.png"></p><p>Ideally, these notes wouldn’t just show up in the one place I originally left them, but across all apps and websites that reference the (semantic) object I bookmarked. A note attached to a book I want to read in Goodreads, for example, should also emerge when I see that book in my Amazon search results – or when someone mentions it in my Twitter timeline.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/goodamznnotes.png"></p><p>People are a similar type of semantic object you could tie notes to. Instead of a stand-alone CRM tool, you would leave a note attached to a person straight from your current workflow (e.g. your email client). That note would then automatically re-surface whenever the person it references becomes relevant again:</p>



<ul><li>When you’re in an email thread with them</li><li>When you add them to a calendar event</li><li>When you’re visiting their LinkedIn page</li><li>When you look them up in your phone book</li><li>etc</li></ul>



<center>—</center>



<p>Another use case for spatial notes are instructions on how to use specific software features or improve workflows.

Teens should be teens. Teens should hang out and be teens. Adults should be adults. Adults should work and be adults.&nbsp;</p><p>Or should they?</p><p>That’s how most people behave and go through life. We are not being us but behaving according to societal expectations and norms. We are what society expects us to be at that age.</p><p>I refuse to believe this.&nbsp;</p><p>I was already a kid and I had an interesting childhood. And I can’t tell you much about adulthood because, well, I’m not there yet. In this essay, I will focus on the teenage years and why some teens you should not chill out and <em>just be a teenager.</em></p><p>When you are a teenager, you go to high school and study to get ready for college. If you’re mildly ambitious, you play sports. If you’re somewhat ambitious, you enroll in extracurricular activities in school. If you’re ambitious, you’d play sports and take part in extracurricular activities.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re <a href="http://juandavidcampolargo.com/blog/highschool" target="_blank">crazy ambitious,</a> you do all the above and go beyond like starting companies, nonprofits, public speaking, etc. You are on a different wavelength of life. Somehow, certain kids break out of the normal way of being and <em>think differently.&nbsp;</em></p><p>In a <a href="https://www.perell.com/podcast/tyler-cowen-production-function" target="_blank">North Star Podcast interview</a>, the economist Tyler Cowen is asked why there aren’t more Tyler Cowens in the world. He says:</p><blockquote><p>You have to ask at some point, what are the <strong>returns</strong> both to <strong>starting early </strong>and to <strong>continuing fairly late</strong> in life? So starting early, you give up a <strong>normal childhood.</strong> I would say all for the better. Awesome. Bring it on. Let's double down on that one. But most people don't want to do that, or it just doesn't occur to them. They might in fact do it if they saw more<strong> role models.</strong></p></blockquote><p>I also gave up a “normal childhood.” I didn’t think about the returns or anything like that, I thought about what makes me happy, what makes me curious, and what makes me.&nbsp;</p><p>“But those crazy ambitious kids are dumb. They should just go out with friends, go to parties, make silly mistakes, and be a freaking teenager.” Hell yeah! Again, why bother?</p><p>If you have goals, there’s no need to pursue them. If you have passions, pursue them later. If you have curiosities, bro I don’t even know what those are.&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll have time…</p><p>Adults tell you should be a teen and enjoy these years. And don’t even worry about doing something too hard or complicated. After all, “you should be a teenager.”&nbsp;</p><p>If you don’t, these adults tell you that you will regret it. So what? Just be and do what you’re supposed to do, watch TV, use your phone, and follow the path of everyone else mindlessly. By the way, don’t forget to be happy [1].</p><p>But who are these adults? They are adults who aren't enjoying adulthood. They look back to when they were kids with no responsibilities. What if we checked with adults who love adulthood? You’ll get a different story.&nbsp;</p><p>You have the same experiences that everyone has at the expense of extraordinary experiences you can create for yourself such as creating a project, starting a company, building your own video game, and sharing your gifts with the world.&nbsp;</p><p>Hold up. What are you talking about? “You should be a teenager, don’t do any of that. That’s not cool. If you don’t try too hard and enjoy your childhood, you’ll be happy.” Right, right. Thanks for your advice.&nbsp;</p><p>However, there are a few teens out there who think differently and imagine a world of opportunities where age, credentials, or money isn’t a limiting factor, but an <a href="https://www.juandavidcampolargo.com/blog/leverage"><span>advantage</span></a>. The crazy ambitious kids are the ones who rule the world. The crazy ambitious kids are the ones who make things happen. The crazy ambitious kids are the ones who you look up to.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps I made the wrong choice and I should’ve been a normal kid. But I couldn’t be that. I simply couldn’t.&nbsp;</p><p>This isn’t about me or anyone else. This is about you. Ask yourself, What are your goals?

	  <p>As the 2020 US Presidential election grinds on, it makes me wonder if we need to unlearn the idea of a Nation State. The assumption that geographically collocated people share the same core identity and values seems quaint in just about every nation state these days. If we unlearn this increasingly fallacious idea, we might open ourselves up to something new.</p>

<p>I live in a small, Virginia college town, Charlottesville. We share increasingly little in common with people living 30 miles away. With no shared values, not even a shared perspective of what’s true, it makes little sense to share political institutions. We live in different worlds - I bet many Charlottesvillians could navigate the London Tube with greater ease than the streets of nearby Dillwyn or Buena Vista. The interaction between these groups occurs purely on economic lines, often in <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2019/09/10/america-has-two-economies-and-theyre-diverging-fast/">two parallel economies</a>.</p>

<p>Even more, if you put me in a room with a random Berliner or Londoner, It’s likely we would share a similar positive attitude towards diversity and inclusion. We’d enjoy similar sources of culture and entertainment, perhaps even curious about each other’s weird sports. There’s probably even a greater likelihood we’d discuss political ideas with an open mind. Indeed, I’ve had more conversations about Brexit with a British person than about Trump with a Trump supporter. Increasingly, we have a shared outlook with other educated, urban places around the world. We feel alien to fellow Americans, Brits, or Germans that live a stone’s throw away.</p>

<p>Instead of different nation states, the world’s turning into one big emerging city with a large, vast, global hinterland. With the Internet and easy air travel - Manhattan, SOHO, and Pankow feel like different neighborhoods in the same global city – not identical, but increasingly cut from a similar cloth. All supporting increasingly culturally aligned knowledge workers. Some places (like a college town, or small city) feel less ‘central’ to the emerging one-global-city, similar to an outer suburb. Some places seem much more central (Manhattan?). And certainly the ‘neighborhoods’ I know about are more culturally nearby. But that will certainly change over the 21st century as places (and people) sort themselves closer or farther from the center. (And even in a ‘remote centric’ world, this’ll be true, as we need places with good Internet and comparable social values)</p>

<p>The hinterlands deeply resent the emerging, educated, cosmopolitan one-global-city. Certainty, this had a lot to do with Trump being elected. Fear that a multicultural knowledge economy might trump nation state protected privileges runs deep. This fear underpins much of the anti-intellectualism and anti-immigration extremism in these groups. Notably Trump also seems to evoke a kind of nostalgia about an 80s era strong American nation state and criticizes opponents for supporting “open borders” and not being “true Americans”. This division between one-global-city nation-state-first perspectives goes beyond the US. It’s happening in Poland, Turkey, Germany and just about everywhere.</p>

<p>If we unlearn the nation state, we might begin to see this emerging, new society. Some might be brave enough to embrace it as an explicit, core ideology. This might let us build new institutions centered on this one-global-city. The closest institutions we have right now are heavily globalized tech companies . They explicitly work to build multi-national workforces, heavily aware of the inclusion and multiculturalism needed to pull something like this off. Certainly methods of collaborating in tech, such as sharing code on Github, and participating in common communities also underpins the one-global-city. Social media might provide a kind of hub for the one-global-city (as well as the disaffected).</p>

<p>But there’s reasons to be skeptical too. As the one-global-city develops, it will push more and more marginalized people out to the hinterlands. A one-global-city with aligned / same political institutions is perhaps an educated elite fiction. Or if it exists, it’s not morally superior to a nation state that looks out for all it’s citizens. A one-global-city might turn into a caste society, with upper class tech / knowledge workers and then everyone else. We’ll continue to live in an awkward economic sybmiosis. Like two species that both need and hate each other. Always at low-level of conflict, but not enough to blow out into some massive war.</p>

<p>Maybe, in the end, it’s the one-global city – the globalized, neo-liberal, New World Order that will need to be unlearned. Perhaps, it’s the hinterlands that will tame their elites - attenuating their ability to connect with the rest of the world. Nation states reassert themselves as explicitly anti-intellectual, parochial entities. Sometimes choosing ignorance and isolation to maintain national sovereignty.</p>

<p>Who knows? It’ll be interesting to observe the rest of my life to maybe find out?</p>

<p>One of the first concepts new developers learn is the if/else statement.  If/else statements are the most common way to execute conditional logic. However, complex and nested if/else statements can quickly become a cognitive burden and compromise the readability of a program.</p>



<h2>Guard Clauses</h2>



<p>Guard Clauses leverage the ability to return early from a function (or continue through a loop) to make nested conditionals one-dimensional. Instead of using if/else chains, we simply return early from the function at the end of each conditional block:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func divide(dividend, divisor int) (int, error) {
	if divisor == 0 {
		return 0, errors.New("Can't divide by zero")
	}
	return dividend/divisor, nil
}</code></pre>



<p>Error handling in Go naturally encourages developers to make use of guard clauses. When I started writing more JavaScript, I was disappointed to see how many nested conditionals existed in the code I was working on. </p>



<p>Let’s take a look at an exaggerated example of nested conditional logic:</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript">function getInsuranceAmount(status) {
  let amount;
  if (!status.hasInsurance()){
    amount = 1;
  } else {
    if (status.isTotaled()){
      amount = 10000;
    } else {
      if (status.isDented()){
        amount = 160;
        if (status.isBigDent()){
          amount = 270;
        }
      } else {
        amount = 0
      }
    }
  }
  return amount;
}</code></pre>



<p>Could be written with guard clauses instead:</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript">function getInsuranceAmount(status) {
  if (!status.hasInsurance()){
    return 1;
  }
  if (status.isTotaled()){
    return 10000;
  }
  if (!status.isDented()){
    return 0;
  }
  if (status.isBigDent()){
    return 270;
  }
  return 160;
}</code></pre>



<p>The example above is <strong>much </strong>easier to read and understand. When writing code, it is important to try to reduce the cognitive load on the reader by reducing the number of entities they need to think about at any given time.</p>



<p>In the first example, if the developer is trying to figure out when <strong>270</strong> is returned, they need to think about each branch in the logic tree and try to remember which cases matter and which cases don’t. With the one dimensional structure offered by guard clauses, it’s as simple as stepping through each case in order.</p>

<p>Choosing good colors for your charts is hard. This article tries to make it easier.</p>
<p>I want you to feel more confident in your color choices. And if you have no sense for colors at all, here’s my attempt to help you find good ones anyway. We’ll talk about common color mistakes I see out there in the wild, and how to avoid them.</p>
<p>This is not the right article for you if you’re trying to find good gradients or shades. But if you need to find beautiful, distinctive colors for different <strong>categories (e.g. continents, industries, bird species)</strong> for your line charts, pie charts, stacked bar charts, etc., read on.</p>

<h4 id="Before-we-start…">Before we start…</h4>
<p>I will mention saturation, brightness and hue a lot. The HSB (<strong>H</strong>ue, <strong>S</strong>aturation, <strong>B</strong>rightness) or HSV (<strong>H</strong>ue, <strong>S</strong>aturation, <strong>V</strong>alue) color spaces work fairly well to check them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hue</strong> ranges from 0° to 360°…that’s your typical color wheel: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span></li>
<li><strong>Saturation</strong> ranges from 0% (grey) to 100% (super duper colorful!!): <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span></li>
<li><strong>Brightness/Value</strong> ranges from 0% (black) to 100% (the actual color): <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span></li>
</ul>
<p>To convert your colors from HEX (e.g. <code>#cc0000</code>) or RGB (e.g. <code>rgb(207, 176, 58)</code>) to HSB/HSV, use a tool like <a href="http://colorizer.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>colorizer.org</strong></a>.</p>
<p>A relative of HSB/HSV is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HCL_color_space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HCL</a> color space. It uses the same parameters (<strong>H</strong>ue, <strong>C</strong>hroma = saturation, <strong>L</strong>ightness), but is closer to “how we really see colors”. <a href="https://academy.datawrapper.de/article/255-how-to-pick-colors-in-datawrapper" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Datawrapper</strong> uses the HCL color space</a> for its color picker:</p>
<p><img alt="HCL color picker in Datawrapper" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors31.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors31.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors31.png"></p>
<p>But since you won’t find HCL in Adobe Photoshop or <a href="http://colorizer.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">colorizer.org</a>, every time I mention degrees (like 0°) or percentages, I’ll be talking about the HSB/HSV color space.</p>
<p>Alright, let’s do this:</p>

<h4 id="Broaden-your-understanding-of-colors">Broaden your understanding of colors</h4>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors30.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors30.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors30.png"></p>
<p>You might think like this: “I need five colors for my chart. So I use green and yellow and blue and red. And …um…maybe orange? Or purple!”</p>
<p>If you haven’t thought much about colors since you were a kid coloring out your coloring book, this thought makes sense. So today I’m here to tell you: They are more colors than that.</p>
<p>Look at this graphic and compare them with the basic colors <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>:</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors13.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors13.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors13.png"><em><a href="https://whydocatsanddogs.com/cats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why do Cats and Dogs?</a> by Nadieh Bremer</em></p>
<p>They’re different. The red that Nadieh uses <span>⬤</span> is different from your typical red <span>⬤</span>. The green <span>⬤</span> is…can you even call it a green <span>⬤</span>?</p>
<p>So before we impose rules that limit us, let me freak you out a bit: There are thousands of colors you can use. There is yellow-ish red <span>⬤</span> and blue-ish red <span>⬤</span> and everything in between. There is grey <span>⬤</span>, but there is also cold grey <span>⬤</span> and there is warm grey <span>⬤</span>. And then there is blue. So much blue! Like this <span>⬤</span>, this <span>⬤</span>, this <span>⬤</span>, this <span>⬤</span> and this <span>⬤</span>. And we haven’t even talked about orange and yellow.</p>
<p>You have <em>lots</em> of options. Which means you can stay in a small area of the color wheel and still have many options. Which means:</p>

<h4 id="Don’t-dance-all-over-the-color-wheel">Don’t dance all over the color wheel</h4>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors28.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors28.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors28.png"></p>
<p>There’s no need to rely on hues from all around the color wheel like <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> for your visualizations. It will look more professional – and therefore more trustworthy – when it only uses a few hues and their neighbors.</p>
<p>Here’s where it becomes a good idea to actually look at a color wheel. You can use <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adobe Color</a> or <a href="https://www.sessions.edu/color-calculator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Color Calculator</a> to do so.</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors21.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors21.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors21.png"><em><a href="https://www.sessions.edu/color-calculator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Color Calculator</a> harmonies</em></p>
<p>Lots of these tools let you choose different harmonies. One of them is called “square” or “tetradic”. <strong>Don’t use it.</strong> It will result in too many hues –&nbsp;and we’re on a mission to avoid that.</p>

<p>In the video above, I used the color tool <a href="https://paletton.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paletton</a> to start with a tetradic harmony and then decrease the distance. Note how more beautiful the color combinations become.</p>
<p>If the distance becomes small enough, you’re basically using <strong>complementary</strong> colors. And that’s a great choice! Lots of complementary color pairs work awesome together. <strong>If in doubt, use complementary colors and their neighbors.</strong></p>
<p>So let’s do this –&nbsp;this time with Adobe Color:</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors22.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors22.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors22.png"><em>Our complementary colors in <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adobe Color</a></em></p>
<p>Our colors are opposite each other on the color wheel, so they’re clearly complementary. Yay! But they’re also unusable: The two oranges are way too similar. And everything looks so…bright.</p>
<p>There’s where we need to change the saturation and lightness:</p>

<h4 id="Use-saturation-and-lightness-to-make-your-hues-work">Use saturation and lightness to make your hues work</h4>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors27.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors27.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors27.png"></p>
<p>Saturation and brightness are as important as hue. In fact, you can create new colors when you just change the saturation and brightness. Here are two color pairs with the same hue, just different saturation and lightness: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> / <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>. (If you change the hue just a tiny bit, you’ll achieve even better results: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> / <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>.)</p>
<p>Let’s come back to our color combination: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>. After playing around with the saturation and darkness, it becomes this:</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors23.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors23.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors23.png"><em>Our better (!) complementary colors in <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adobe Color</a></em></p>
<p>I desaturated the light blue <span>⬤</span> and the lighter orange <span>⬤</span> and made every color darker except the lighter orange. Heck yeah, we can work with that!</p>
<p>So if your color combination doesn’t look awesome yet, don’t immediately add another hue. <strong>Change the saturation and lightness first and see if that’s better.</strong></p>
<p>That’s what I did to all of these color palettes: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> and <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> and <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>. They’re all roughly complementary, and they all come with different saturations and lightness. That’s what makes them work.</p>

<h4 id="Use-warm-colors-blue">Use warm colors &amp; blue</h4>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors29.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors29.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors29.png"></p>
<p>There’s a complementary color combination that is especially loved by data visualization designers: <strong>yellow/orange/red and blue</strong>. Scroll through graphics portfolios like the one from the <a href="https://multimedia.scmp.com/culture/article/SCMP-printed-graphics-memory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South China Morning Post</a> or this one by <a href="https://infographics.economist.com/2019/AChristmasGiftForYou/AYearInGraphicDetail.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Economist (PDF)</a> and you’ll notice that they use these colors far more often than colors like purple or green.</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors19.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors19.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors19.png"><em><a href="https://multimedia.scmp.com/culture/article/SCMP-printed-graphics-memory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Three pages by The South China Morning Post</a></em></p>
<p>That’s because these warm colors and blue are super versatile for categories. Yellow and orange and red look very pleasing together, but people will still perceive them as different colors: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> –&nbsp;which is exactly what we want for categorical colors. And blue is more flexible than any other hue: Lots of blues, no matter if dark <span>⬤</span> or light <span>⬤</span> or saturated <span>⬤</span> or not saturated <span>⬤</span>, look pleasing, calming and professional.</p>
<p>And they are accessible: colorblind people can easily distinguish blue and orange/red from each other.</p>
<p>So if in doubt, use an orange/red with blue.</p>

<h4 id="When-using-green-make-it-a-yellow-or-blue-one">When using green, make it a yellow or blue one</h4>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors26.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors26.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors26.png"></p>
<p>Forest green covers a full sixth on the color wheel, from approximately 90° <span>⬤</span> to 150° <span>⬤</span>, with 120° as its peak <span>⬤</span>. However, you will find few well-designed visualizations that use it. Why is that?</p>
<p>First, forest green is just very dark. And lightening up the forest green means going into an awkward neon <span>⬤</span>. So you need to lighten up <em>and</em> desaturate green enormously – more than other colors –&nbsp;to get to a nice one. That’s exactly what the Washington Post does with their green <span>⬤</span> here:</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors17.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors17.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors17.png"><em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-rolling-back-obama-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Trump is rolling back Obama’s legacy<br>
</a> by The Washington Post</em></p>
<p>It’s a 142° green, but only 14% saturated. Here’s what the same hue with the same brightness would look like 100% saturated: <span>⬤</span>. Yikes.</p>
<p>And remember our colorblind friends: A pure green in combination with red, orange or brown is hard for them to distinguish.</p>
<p>So when using green, make it a bit yellow or a bit blue. You can see this in the examples at the top of this article: All of the greens except FiveThirtyEight’s one <span>⬤</span> have a hue greater than 160° (=bluer) <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> or lower than 60° (=more yellow) <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>. Nadieh uses both yellow green and blue green in this project we’ve already seen:</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors13.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors13.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors13.png"><em><a href="https://whydocatsanddogs.com/cats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why do Cats and Dogs?</a> by Nadieh Bremer</em></p>
<p>Looks like you can use them in your visualization as two different colors as Nadieh does: Win-win!</p>

<h4 id="Avoid-pure-colors">Avoid pure colors</h4>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors5.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors5.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors5.png"></p>
<p>“Pure” hues are the ones that are located at exactly 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, 300° or 360°/0° in the color wheel:</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors7.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors7.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors7.png"></p>
<p>Here’s an example: In HSV/HSB, the <strong>H</strong>ue value of this bright blue <span>⬤</span> is 180°, the <strong>S</strong>aturation value is 67% and the <strong>L</strong>ightness value is 91%. You can also check the RGB values of your color: If at least two of the values are the same, they’re “pure”. For example, our <span>⬤</span> is a <code>rgb(77, 232, 232)</code>.</p>
<p>To make your colors look more natural and pleasing to the eyes of your readers, you can either tune down the saturation of pure colors or make them darker. <strong>If you want to have bright, saturated colors, rely on mixed colors</strong> that are at least 5-10° away from the pure colors.</p>
<p>In the image above, the red and orange, the blues and the greens have the same saturation and lightness. The only difference is the hue: The red <span>⬤</span> (0°), blue <span>⬤</span> (240°) and green <span>⬤</span> (120°) look more colorful than the orange <span>⬤</span> (40°), medium blue <span>⬤</span> (211°) and blue-ish green <span>⬤</span> (170°).</p>

<h4 id="Avoid-bright-saturated-colors">Avoid bright, saturated colors</h4>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors4.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors4.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors4.png"></p>
<p>Neon colors will definitely attract the attention of readers. But these readers won’t thank you. Most of us get a bit stressed out when we see them: “Highly saturated, light colors will NOT be appropriate [to communicate] Serious or Trust, or Calm,” as Bartram, Patra &amp; Stone explain in their paper “Affective Color in Visualization” from 2017 (<a href="https://research.tableau.com/sites/default/files/Affective%20Color%20CHI%202017.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PDF</a>).</p>
<p>If your colors come close to 100% saturation <strong>and</strong> 100% brightness, it’s likely your colors are too colorful. That’s definitely the case for pure colors like <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>.</p>
<p>“But I’ve seen such crazy colors before, and they look good,” you might say, and refer to projects like these ones:</p>

<p>If you compare the colors from these examples with colors like <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>, you see how they former ones are all less saturated or darker. A 100% saturated and 100% bright green <span>⬤</span> becomes less saturated in the New York Times <span>⬤</span>, and less saturated <em>and</em> darker in both the Bloomberg article <span>⬤</span> and the Pudding article <span>⬤</span>.</p>

    <h2 id="mcpu-emu--an-emulator-for-mcpu">mcpu-emu : an emulator for MCPU</h2>

<p>MCPU is a neat minimal 8-bit CPU (CPU design by Tim Boescke in 2001, cpldcpu@opencores.org) - see its <a href="https://opencores.org/projects/mcpu">opencores project file</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cpldcpu/MCPU">GitHub repo</a>. It fits into 32 macrocells on a CPLD and can operate on 64 bytes of RAM.</p>

<p>Being a minimal CPU it supports only four 8-bit instructions, that consist of 2 bit opcode and 6 bit address/immediate field.</p>

<p>It has two registers - an 8-bit accumulator and 6-bit program counter. MCPU supports 64 bytes of RAM shared between program and data.</p>

<p>The instruction set is:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>mnemonic</th>
      <th>opcode</th>
      <th>description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>NOR</td>
      <td>00AAAAAA</td>
      <td>Acc = Acc NOR mem[AAAAAA]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ADD</td>
      <td>01AAAAAA</td>
      <td>Acc = Acc +  mem[AAAAAA], update carry</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>STA</td>
      <td>10AAAAAA</td>
      <td>mem[AAAAAA] = Acc</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>JCC</td>
      <td>11AAAAAA</td>
      <td>PC = AAAAAA if carry = 0, clear carry</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>I’ve also added an “OUT” instruction according to Jean-Claude Wippler’s <a href="https://jeelabs.org/2017/11/tfoc---a-minimal-computer/">TFoC - A minimal computer</a> article, with the opcode of 0xFF that prints the accumulator to the standard output.</p>

<h2 id="the-emulator">The emulator</h2>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>mcpu_state</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>uint8_t</span> <span>accu</span> <span>:</span> <span>8</span><span>;</span>

<span>}</span> <span>mcpu_state</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then the emulation loop dispatches to instruction handlers based on the first two bits of the opcode.</p>

<p>I decided to represent the state of the CPU with a bitfield structure:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>//Acc = Acc NOR mem[AAAAAA]</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One can optionally print out the currently executed instruction with a small disassembler:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>disassemble</span><span>(</span><span>mcpu_state</span> <span>*</span><span>state</span><span>,</span> <span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<h3 id="getting-some-test-programs">Getting some test programs</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://jeelabs.org/2017/11/tfoc---a-minimal-computer/">TFoC - A minimal computer</a> article comes with two code examples, with the code formatted as a hexdump</p>

<div><div><pre><code>3E 45 7F C2 C4 FA 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 FF 01
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I converted this to a binary file (easier to consume by the C emulator)  with a following bash script that replaces the newlines with spaces, then gets rid of double spaces left by \r\n conversion and finally uses <code>xxd</code> to perform a “reverse hexdump”:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#/!bin/bash</span>
<span>cat</span> <span>$1</span> | <span>tr</span> <span>'\r\n'</span> <span>' '</span>  | <span>sed</span> <span>-e</span> <span>'s/[[:blank:]]\+/ /g'</span> | xxd <span>-r</span> <span>-p</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>$2</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using a disassembler and tweaking the output a bit  yields the following code</p>

<p>Notice that there are no immediate values, one can only work with what’s already in the memory, hence the literals 1, 250 and 255 need to exist somewhere within the RAM.</p>

<p>Stepping through the program shows it behaves as expected:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>NOR $3E [FF]          A:00 C:0 PC:01

JCC $04               A:00 C:0 PC:04
.. [JCC $04 repeats in an endless loop]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It seemed it would be a useful thing to add a simple infinite loop detection - if the JCC instruction is jumping to its own address, there is no escape from this state as it won’t change the carry flag.</p>

<p>A second example - printing out prime numbers that fit into 8-bit number (up to 251) is more complex. It also required adding the special output opcode as mentioned earlier to see the results.</p>

<p>What’s the best way to appreciate an emulator for a minimal chip published almost 20 years ago? Porting and running it on the smallest CPU I have at home - an ATTiny85 chip, which has 512 bytes of RAM and runs at 16 MHz in the form of the <a href="http://digistump.com/products/1">Digispark USB development board</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://jborza.com/assets/mcpu-digistump.jpg" alt="digistump"></p>

<p><em>Figure 1: The dev board sitting on top of the MCPU paper</em></p>

<p>There are two things that won’t work straightforward - there’s no filesystem to read the RAM/ROM binary from and  and there’s also no standard output.</p>

<h4 id="loading-the-binaries">Loading the binaries</h4>

<p>We can solve the first problem by including the emulated image to the source as a C array, <code>hexdump</code> can help producing the 0x-encoded bytes we need from the binary file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>hexdump <span>-ve</span> <span>'1/1 "0x%.2x,"'</span> prog_test.bin
0x3e,0x45,0x7f,0xc2,0xc4,...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This way we can directly use a byte array as the ROM/RAM image.</p>

<h4 id="output">Output</h4>

<p>We can solve the second problem by exploiting the fact that the DigiStump with ATTiny85 can act as an USB keyboard - so we just let it type out the output to the text editor of our choice.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>//using this instead of printf() or Serial.print()</span>
<span>DigiKeyboard</span><span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"NOR"</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A 3-second delay after initializing the board helped get me ready to switch to a different text editor to capture the output instead of overwriting the source code :).</p>

<h4 id="code-golfing-to-trim-the-binary-size">Code golfing to trim the binary size</h4>

<p>The code also required some golfing as the maximum binary size for my ATTiny board is 6 kb. The tricks I used to slim down the compiled version included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>inlining some functions</li>
  <li>simplifying the disassembler</li>
  <li>loading only the non-zero part of the binary</li>
</ul>

<p>Slimming the disassembler down:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>mnemonics</span><span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>"N"</span><span>,</span><span>"A"</span><span>,</span><span>"S"</span><span>,</span><span>"J"</span><span>};</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h5 id="random-code-golfing-tidbits">Random code golfing tidbits:</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Printing the newline as a part of string and using <code>DigiKeyboard.print</code> instead of <code>DigiKeyboard.println</code> saves 14 bytes</li>
  <li>using <code>#define</code> instead of variables saves bytes</li>
  <li>replacing <code>sprintf()</code> with a series of <code>DigiKeyboard.print</code> calls saved 1.4 kb of the binary size!</li>
  <li>replacing <code>sprinf()</code></li>
  <li>loading the binary as a sequence of <code>state-&gt;memory[0] = 0x3e;</code> calls is shorter than initializing an array, and copying to CPU memory by a for loop in case of short binaries (8 bytes)</li>
</ul>

<p>That meant I had enough space to add blinking a LED and making a “tick” sound on a buzzer on every clock cycle! 
I ended up with a final binary size of <strong>4498 bytes</strong> for the prime-calculating binary with just the number as the output and <strong>4858 bytes</strong> with disassembler and status information in.</p>

<p>It’s also painfully slow - the delay between the first few and the last prime numbers is noticeable and it takes around 300 ms to calculate and print the very last primes (up to 255).</p>

<p><a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2046" target="\_blank">Issue 2046 was recently disclosed on the Project Zero bugtracker by Sergey Glazunov</a>. This issue describes a bug that was introduced into V8 when the developers decided to reimplement two CodeStubAssembler (CSA) functions using the new Torque language. These two functions are used to create new <code>FixedArray</code> and <code>FixedDoubleArray</code> objects in JavaScript, and although the new implementations looked valid at first glance, they were missing a key component: a maximum length check to ensure that the newly created array’s length cannot not go past a predefined upper limit.</p>

<p>To the untrained eye, this bug does not look exploitable (and surely, had I come across it myself, I would have assumed it to be unexploitable initially), but as shown on the bug report, Sergey made use of TurboFan’s typer to gain access to a very powerful exploitation primitive: an array whose length field is much larger than its capacity. This primitive provides an attacker with an out-of-bounds access primitive on the V8 heap, which can very easily lead to code execution.</p>

<p>Lets perform a root cause analysis of the complex reproduction case provided in the bugtracker, and see exactly how such a powerful primitive was achieved from such a simple bug.</p>



<p>If you want to follow along, you will need to build V8 version 8.5.51 (commit <code>64cadfcf4a56c0b3b9d3b5cc00905483850d6559</code>). <a href="https://v8.dev/docs/build" target="\_blank">Follow this guide for build instructions</a>. I would recommend building with full symbols (modify <code>args.gn</code> and add the line <code>symbol_level = 2</code>).</p>

<p>From the <code>x64.release</code> directory, you can use the following command to compile the release version with zero compiler optimizations (line-by-line debugging of optimized binaries can be pretty annoying at times):</p>

<p><code>find . -type f -exec grep '\-O3' -l {} ";" -exec sed -i 's/\-O3/\-O0/' {} ";" -ls
</code></p>

<p>I would still recommend to build the normal release version (with compiler optimizations enabled) as well if you want to follow along with some of the code examples in this blog post. Without the optimizations, some of the examples will take an excruciatingly long time to run.</p>

<p>Grab the proof of concepts from the bugtracker linked above.</p>



<p>In order to understand why the bug was introduced in the first place, we first have to understand a little bit about the way the CodeStubAssembler works, and why Torque was created as a replacement for it.</p>

<h2 id="v8-before-2017">V8 before 2017</h2>

<p>Before 2017, many of the JavaScript builtin functions (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat" target="\_blank">Array.prototype.concat</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map" target="\_blank">Array.prototype.map</a>, etc) were written in JavaScript themselves, and although these functions made use of TurboFan (V8’s speculative optimizing compiler, explained in more detail later) to squeeze out as much performance as possible, they simply did not run as fast as they would have if they were written in native code.</p>

<p>For the most common builtin functions, the developers would write very optimized versions in hand-written assembly. This was doable because of how detailed the descriptions of these builtin functions are on the ECMAScript specifications (<a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-properties-of-the-array-prototype-object" target="\_blank">Example</a>). However, there was a big downside: V8 targets a large number of platforms and architectures, which meant that the V8 developers had to write and rewrite all of these optimized builtin functions for every single architecture. As the ECMAScript standard is constantly evolving, and new language features are constantly being standardized, maintaining all of this hand-written assembly became extremely tedious and error-prone.</p>

<p>Having ran into this issue, the developers started looking for a better solution. It wasn’t until TurboFan was introduced into V8 had they found a solution.</p>

<h2 id="the-codestubassembler">The CodeStubAssembler</h2>

<p>TurboFan brought with it a cross-platform intermediate representation (IR) for low-level instructions. The V8 team decided to build a new frontend on top of TurboFan that they dubbed the <strong>CodeStubAssembler</strong>. The CodeStubAssembler defined a portable assembly language that the developers could use to implement the optimized builtin functions. Best of all, the cross-platform nature of the portable assembly language meant that the developers only had to write each builtin function <strong>exactly once</strong>. The actual native code for all the supported platforms and architecture was left for TurboFan to compile. <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/csa" target="\_blank">You can read more about the CSA here</a>.</p>

<p>Although this was a great improvement, there was still a slight problem. Writing optimal code with the CodeStubAssembler’s language required the developers to carry a lot of specialized knowledge in their heads. Even with all of this knowledge, there were a lot of non-trivial gotchas that often led to security vulnerabilities. This lead the V8 team to finally write a new component that they dubbed <strong>Torque</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="torque">Torque</h2>

<p>Torque is a language frontend that’s built on top of the CodeStubAssembler. It has a TypeScript-like syntax, a strong type system, and great error-checking capabilities, all of which makes it a great alternative for the V8 developers to write builtin functions in. The Torque compiler converts the Torque code into efficient assembly code using the CodeStubAssembler. It greatly reduced the number of security bugs, as well as the steep learning curve that new V8 developers previously faced when learning how to write efficient builtin functions in the CSA assembly language. <a href="https://v8.dev/docs/torque">You can read more about Torque here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-reason-for-the-bug">The reason for the bug</h2>

<p>Because Torque is still relatively new, there is still a fair amount of CSA code that needs to be reimplemented in it. This included the CSA code that handled the creation of new <code>FixedArray</code> and <code>FixedDoubleArray</code> objects, which are “fast” arrays in V8 (“fast” arrays have contiguous array backing stores, whereas “slow” arrays have dictionary based backing stores).</p>

<p>The actual bug in Issue 2046 stems from the developers’ decision to reimplement this array creation builtin function in Torque. As bad luck would have it, the reimplementation missed a key security check that lead to an exploitable condition.</p>



<p>The developers reimplemented the <a href="https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/v8/src/codegen/code-stub-assembler.cc?rcl=5db4a28ef75f893e85b7f505f5528cc39e9deef5&amp;l=3805" target="\_blank">CodeStubAssembler::AllocateFixedArray</a> function into two Torque macros, one for <code>FixedArray</code> objects, and another for <code>FixedDoubleArray</code> objects:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>macro</span> <span>NewFixedArray</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Iterator</span><span>:</span> <span>type</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>intptr</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>:</span> <span>Iterator</span><span>):</span> <span>FixedArray</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>

<span>macro</span> <span>NewFixedDoubleArray</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Iterator</span><span>:</span> <span>type</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span>
    <span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>intptr</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>:</span> <span>Iterator</span><span>):</span> <span>FixedDoubleArray</span><span>|</span><span>EmptyFixedArray</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>length</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>kEmptyFixedArray</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>FixedDoubleArray</span><span>{</span>

    <span>floats</span><span>:</span> <span>...</span><span>it</span>
  <span>};</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you compare the above functions to the <code>CodeStubAssembler::AllocateFixedArray</code> variant, you’ll notice a maximum length check missing.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>NewFixedArray</code> should ensure that the new <code>FixedArray</code> being returned has a length below <code>FixedArray::kMaxLength</code>, which is <code>0x7fffffd</code>, or <code>134217725</code>.</li>
  <li>In the same way, <code>NewFixedDoubleArray</code> should sanity check the array’s length against <code>FixedDoubleArray::kMaxLength</code>, which is <code>0x3fffffe</code>, or <code>67108862</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before we look at what we can do with this missing length check, lets try to understand how Sergey triggers this bug, as it isn’t as simple as just creating a new array with a size larger than <code>kMaxLength</code>.</p>



<p>In order to understand the proof of concepts, we need to understand a little bit more about how arrays are represented in V8. Feel free to skip to the next section if you already know how this works.</p>

<h2 id="arrays-in-memory">Arrays in memory</h2>

<p>Let’s take the array <code>[1, 2, 3, 4]</code> as an example and view it in memory. You can do this by running V8 with the <code>--allow-natives-syntax</code> flag, creating the array, and doing a <code>%DebugPrint(array)</code> to get its address. Use GDB to view the address in memory. I’ll show a diagram instead.</p>

<p>When you allocate an array in V8, it actually allocates two objects. Note that every field is 4 bytes / 32 bits in length:</p>

<h4>This page and associated codepens are meant to share with other developers a means of creating a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.webmproject.org/">Webm</a>&nbsp;video from a dynamically generated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp">canvas</a>&nbsp;driven from user input and a audio file. If this sounds interesting, keep reading.</h4>



<br>



<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>I’m&nbsp;Jason. I’m building&nbsp;<a href="https://vizibop.com/">Vizibop</a>, a service currently in beta that allows musicians and podcasters to quickly and easily create a unique MP4 video synched to a audio file. Yes, this is a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/wavve/revenue">thing</a>.</p>



<p>At its core, Vizibop leverages a HTML Canvas, HTML5 Audio, MediaRecorder, and&nbsp;<a href="https://p5js.org/">P5.js</a>&nbsp;to generate a WebM file with front end code only. From there, that WebM file is sent through&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elastictranscoder/">AWS Elastic Transcoder</a>&nbsp;to convert the Webm file to a MP4 file which can then be shared on sites like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. Here is a basic video created from Vizibop:</p>









<h2>Creating a basic animation</h2>



<p>P5.js is a javascript library that make drawing on a canvas relatively straight forward. Even for the mathematically challenged like myself,&nbsp;<a href="https://p5js.org/examples/simulate-particle-system.html">particles</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://p5js.org/examples/simulate-flocking.html">flocking</a>&nbsp;are made easier to implement using P5. I am using P5&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Global-and-instance-mode">instance</a>&nbsp;mode to keep things tidy. Here is a very basic scaffolding for a p5 animation:</p>

  on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>








<br>



<h2>Playing Music</h2>



<p>Audio in the browser is a bit of a rabbit hole.&nbsp;<a href="https://howlerjs.com/">Howler</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://createjs.com/soundjs">SoundJS</a>&nbsp;will make your life a lot easier if you get into building jukeboxes and video games. To keep things simple, let’s simply create a hidden audio element and allow a user to click a button to begin playing a song. For Vizibop we allow users to upload their own songs in WAV or MP3 format using&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader">FileReader</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/createObjectURL">createObjectURL</a>.</p>



<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="result" data-user="Vizibop" data-slug-hash="qBZPMpv" data-pen-title="Play Music">
  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/Vizibop/pen/qBZPMpv">
  Play Music</a> by Vizibop (<a href="https://codepen.io/Vizibop">@Vizibop</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>








<br>



<h2>Wiring Audio to P5</h2>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js-sound">P5.sound</a>&nbsp;module makes it super easy to have the variables within your sketch change based on the volume and frequency of a sound. Out of the box you can use&nbsp;<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Amplitude">Amplitude</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.FFT">FFT</a>&nbsp;to do some pretty amazing things. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pn1g1wjxl_0">Coding Train</a>&nbsp;has a whole series of videos on sound within P5 that I encourage you to watch.</p>



<p>In this example, we want to do some beat detection to change the background of the canvas. Beat detection also gets a little tricky depending on the song and quality of the underlying audio. In Vizibop we let the user define which frequency bands to key off of to really dial in more accurate beat detection.</p>



<p>But…….IOS 13 had a <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=203435">major regression</a> with createMediaElementSource.  You can read about it <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=203435">here</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58306894/has-ios13-broken-audio-tags-used-as-audio-buffers-connected-to-the-audio-conte">here </a>and here.  As of the writing of this document, creating a media element source on certain versions of IOS mobile is completely broken.  Supposedly this is fixed in IOS 13.6 and 14.  If you are on mobile IOS right now, this and all subsequent codepens are not going to be awesome.  </p>

  on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>








<br>



<h2>Customize the animation</h2>



<p>The animation above is pretty basic. A better experience allows the users to turn knobs and dials to customize their animation. In our case, I have tried to balance just enough knobs and dials to create a wide range of videos without overwhelming the user with too many options. The possibilities are really unlimited when you combine images, typography, color, motion, and math.</p>

  on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>








<br>



<h2>Record a video</h2>



<p>We now have the key components to record a music video built entirely in the front end.</p>



<p>Now the fun begins, particularly across browsers and computers.&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/01/mediarecorder">MediaRecorder and captureStream</a>&nbsp;are the magic that allows us to create a Webm video from the components above. As of the writing of this document, Safari only supports MediaRecorder in experimental mode. Firefox does not support VP9 or H264 codecs. Chrome is our best friend here and clearly outperforms in this use case. With 70% market share between Chrome and Firefox, I was willing to move ahead with this approach betting that eventually Safari will make MediaRecorder generally available.</p>



<p>I am still tweaking the configuration here. It seems that both the VP9 and H264 codecs underperform VP8 for this application. Firefox has its issues. Adjusting both the frame rate of the animation and the captureStream combined with the optional videoBitsPerSecond parameter for the MediaRecorder seem to improve visual lag and artifacts due to compression. It’s not perfect but so far I am pleased with the results</p>



<p data-height="412" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="result" data-user="Vizibop" data-slug-hash="xxVXLrQ" data-pen-title="Vizibop - Record Video">

  on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>








<br>



<h2>What’s next?</h2>



<p>With this technique, there really isn’t a limit to the types of you can create in the browser. With that said, by design, Vizibop will not evolve into a full blown video editor. A guiding principle is to keep the user experience simple while maximizing the number of unique videos that can be created. <strong>Awesome Factor = Number of Unique Videos / Number of Knobs and Dials</strong>. My intent is to create a tool that is&nbsp;very simple to use&nbsp;for people who I believe should be spending more time focused on their core craft.</p>



<p>Your thoughts, feedback, advice, and guidance is always welcome</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>P</span>eople afflicted by Covid-19, particularly those with bad cases, experience difficulty breathing.&nbsp; We need oxygen in our tissues to keep our bodies working and our brains clear; viral damage to our lungs deprives bodies of this vital dissolved gas.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>	This oxygen-starved condition is called hypoxia, and itâ€™s also a serious condition in many parts of the worldâ€™s ocean, as well as in estuaries, lagoons, rivers, and lakes. Marine hypoxia receives much less public attention than ocean acidification or warming—but in many parts of the world its effects may be just as profound, and the problem is worsening.</p>
<p>	The causes of marine hypoxia are twofold. The first, which has been studied the most, is the too-much-of-a-good-thing problem of nutrient over-enrichment. Vast loads of nutrients are applied to farm fields as fertilizers, spill from our sewage and septic systems, and waft from the tailpipes of automobiles. Inevitably some of these make their way into water, stimulating blooms of tiny plankton that eventually die and decay.&nbsp;The process of decaying consumes the oxygen, and hypoxia ensues. Wastewater treatment plants have helped but are not enough. Some nutrient-loaded hypoxic waters are now-infamous â€œdead zones,â€� such as the northern Gulf of Mexico, the Chesapeake Bay, and Lake Erie most summers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>	The other major cause is global warming.&nbsp;Warmer water canâ€™t hold as much dissolved oxygen as colder water. Itâ€™s lighter, too, and therefore tends to float above cooler layers, cutting them off from atmospheric exchange so that they eventually become deoxygenated as well. This phenomenon isnâ€™t directly associated with nutrient over-enrichment, but can exacerbate and intensify dead zones and impact deep ocean waters that have few nutrients. Warming is a global problem affecting the oxygen status of all waters—and it also fuels blooms of algae that die and decay, again setting off the cycle of oxygen loss.</p>
<p>	The general public—and even many scientists—are unaware of the rapidly expanding scale of deoxygenation. Among the first researchers to describe it were marine ecologists Bob Diaz and Rutger Rosenberg, who in the 1980s began to study the impacts on bottom-dwelling organisms in estuaries and coastal seas. In 1995 they wrote, "There is no other environmental variable of such ecological importance to coastal marine ecosystems that has changed so drastically in such a short period as dissolved oxygen." &nbsp;</p>
<p>	In 2008, Diaz and Rosenberg published a landmark study in the journal <em>Science</em>, documenting over 400 such zones and showing that their growth was exponential.&nbsp;By 2019 their tally exceeded 700, and possibly as many as 1000, coastal dead zones.&nbsp;If we make a chart of the known history of increase and color-code it by Gross World Product, an index of global economic output, we can appreciate the linkage of these dead zones to human activity:</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_423219c2026b77bfba722aa122b966a6.jpg" alt="dead zones and GWP chart"><figcaption><span>Growth in the number of coastal marine ecosystems classified as â€œdead zonesâ€� by Diaz and Rosenberg (2008) and Diaz et al. (2019).  The colors indicate levels of Gross World Product (GWP), and show that as economic output has increased exponentially, so has the number of polluted, deoxygenated dead zones. </span><br><span>GWP data: World Bank and CIA Factbook (compiled in Wikipedia).</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Deoxygenation in open oceans, away from coasts, extends farther and deeper, and is largely caused by the aforementioned tendency of warm water to seal off the cool waters below. The extent and spread of these so-called oxygen minimum zones wasnâ€™t fully appreciated until around 15 years ago, when improved instrumentation allowed scientists to measure them.&nbsp;Ten years ago their total area was estimated at 8 percent of Earth's ocean surface area—11.7 million square miles altogether, an area larger than North America and comparable in size to the entire African continent. That area is expanding today.<br></p>
<p>Brief periods of hypoxia—or even no oxygen, a phenomenon called anoxia—are common in nature and many organisms adapt by moving away or going temporarily dormant.&nbsp;A very few species are exceptionally tolerant and even have specialized metabolic pathways to cope in these circumstances.&nbsp;As the scale of deoxygenation increases, however, we see low-oxygen events so large and long that even highly mobile organisms, like fish, canâ€™t always escape.&nbsp;Some may be able to survive but become so weak that they have difficulty moving and finding food, let alone digesting it.&nbsp;Think of the Covid-19 sufferers who are so exhausted from lack of oxygen that they can barely move.&nbsp;Itâ€™s the same basic issue.&nbsp;As scientists study the problem of marine deoxygenation, we are increasingly seeing the effects on everything from fish growth to reproductive impairment. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Although most of the studies on biotic effects of deoxygenation have taken place in laboratories, my colleague Ben Walther and I, together with our students and colleagues, have learned to decipher signs of hypoxia exposure that are â€œrecordedâ€� in tiny bones within fish heads, called otoliths or ear-stones.&nbsp;These calcium carbonate deposits grow incrementally and take up various trace elements including the element manganese, which becomes available only at very low oxygen concentrations.&nbsp;By studying the lifetime uptake of manganese, biologist Michele Casini and I showed that periods of intense hypoxia have profound impacts on the growth and health of Atlantic cod in the Baltic Sea. With less oxygen available, cod have less energy for foraging and fighting off parasites and infections. As a result, they are unhealthy and shrunken compared to cod living in better environments. By age three, cod with high levels of hypoxia exposure are one-third smaller than healthy cod from oxygen-rich waters. Multiply that by population size and you have an epic loss of biomass. This has direct economic consequences and likely causes enormous suffering for the fish themselves.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_15b7f377d5e469878f05995df3610167.jpg" alt="Cod before-and-after"><figcaption><span>Left: Cod caught in 1981 off the island of Gotland, Sweden. Right: Cod caught in 2020 in the same vicinity. Baltic cod today are affected by several stressors, foremost among them hypoxia. </span><br><span>K. Limburg and Y. Heimbrand</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Deoxygenation impacts ripple through entire ecosystems, too.&nbsp;Recent work has shown that in large stretches of the ocean even zooplankton, the microscopic animals who feed fish, often live on the edge of metabolic collapse. A study in the eastern tropical North Pacific oxygen minimum zone found that zooplankton there migrate in and out of microhabitats with extremely low oxygen; they are among the most hypoxia-tolerant organisms, yet are already at their metabolic limits. Projected further declines in oxygen may put them over the edge, with important consequences for carbon cycling and other biogeochemical processes in the open ocean.&nbsp;Food webs become compromised, particularly those on sea bottoms; there are many documented cases of sensitive invertebrate communities falling victim to hypoxic events since they cannot flee. Hypoxia has even been found to cause mass mortality in coral reef ecosystems, and in some instances may play as important a role as the better-known culprit of elevated water temperatures. Even open-water ecosystems change as the volume of healthy habitat shrinks and species crowd together, leading to novel food-web interactions. Covid-19â€™s web of long-term complications presents an uncanny parallel.<br></p>
<p>	Fortunately for humanity, a vaccine for Covid-19 should be available in 2021.&nbsp;The outlook for the oceans is not so optimistic, but neither is it hopeless.&nbsp;Think about the initial response to the virus, which was hamstrung by shortages of necessary medical supplies and technology, including masks and respirators; once the issues were recognized, it became possible to prioritize production to deal with the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the case of coastal hypoxia, nutrient pollution reductions coupled with wetland and seagrass restoration are akin to masks and respirators. They help protect the ecosystems and build up their resiliency. Those approaches resulted in greatly improved water quality and subsequent return of biodiversity in the waters off Tampa Bay, Florida, for example. And after decades of nutrient management, some parts of the Baltic Sea and Chesapeake Bay are beginning to show signs of recovery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>	The looming, elephant-in-the-room challenge is to deal with global warming, which will require new economic policies at national and global scales and the commitment of governments and citizens everywhere. Although overshadowed in the news cycle by Covid-19, global warming is still on the rise, fueled by human outputs of greenhouse gases.&nbsp;We <em>must</em> bend the curve on greenhouse gas emissions, just as we must flatten the Covid-19 curve. Without such change, we are headed in a dark, scary direction where nobody really wants to go.</p>

  <p>I had been a happy-go Java developer on Windows platform. And then I had to ride the Ruby-on-Rails wave over Linux platform, only to realize how much I didn't know about productivity with automation. Later I moved onto MacOS to experience bliss before starting to hate it for one thing after the other; right from their buggy operating system upgrades to Apple not providing power cable compatible to Indian market resulting in earthing issues. Out of frustration I jumped back to Ubuntu and now back on Windows after long years.&nbsp;</p><p>Getting onto Windows was more out of necessity than interest and I started to explore how much things have changed in the Windows world. It wasn't a smooth return for me but the teething period is over and I'm loving Windows again. If you are onto Windows 10 Pro edition, and wanting to get the best of both worlds (Windows and Linux), this post is for you. I am jotting down ProTips to experience delight and productivity at development work.</p>
<ol><li>Use WSL 2 instead of WSL 1, for the former is far less resource intensive by integrating natively with Windows 10 Hyper-V virtualization stack, and thus phenomenally faster too. If you are on Windows 10 Home edition, you need to upgrade it to Windows 10 Pro edition and it is worth it, for you can get it at half the price upon upgrade.</li><li>Do not mount windows native formatted drive (NTFS) onto WSL for code that can be developed both in WSL environment and Windows. While this works, it is snail paced and you will frustrated too soon. I tried this out of curiosity and frustrated beyond my anticipation. If you are still wanting this, you will have to first format the storage drive in DOS format (as FAT32), so that it works well with your WSL and host Windows operating systems. This is possible the best middle-ground that you can hit upon.</li><li>Use <a href="https://aka.ms/terminal" target="_blank">Windows Terminal</a>&nbsp;instead of&nbsp; <a href="https://blog.codonomics.com/2020/09/Cmder" target="_blank">Cmder</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu" target="_blank">ConEmu</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mintty/mintty" target="_blank">Mintty</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cygwin.com/" target="_blank">Cygwin</a> or any other console emulators. Why? You can customize it with default settings for each of WSLs, Windows Command Prompt, Powershell or other terminals integrated with it. Also Windows Terminal is lightweight and faster.</li><li>When you start your development server in WSL 2, try testing it in your browser with <b><i>localhost</i></b>, it won't work. WSL is one proper sandboxed environment or VM. You need to port forward localhost settings for this to work. This can be done by adding the line like below in your <b><i>.wslconfig</i></b> file in your windows <b><i>$HOME</i></b> directory.<br>--
 --<br>
 </li><li>WSL 2 can consume all of your host memory. You can set limits to it by appending the line&nbsp;<b><i>memory=16GB</i></b> in your <b><i>.wslconfig</i></b> file.</li><li>Do install <a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh" target="_blank">Oh-My-ZSH</a> to use zsh shell instead of the default bash. You get bunch of goodies like pre-configured aliases for Git and more by way of its plugins that you can configure to your preference.</li><li>If you are into using <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki" target="_blank">tmux</a>, you can use that too in your WSL 2, and power it up with <a href="https://github.com/erikw/tmux-powerline" target="_blank">tmux-powerline</a>.</li><li>You can change the location of your WSL 2 distribution's virtual hard drive.&nbsp;I keep all of my VMs (and now WSL 2 virtual hard drives) in <b><i>D:\VMs\&lt;platform&gt;\&lt;distribution name&gt;</i></b>. Run the following commands in PowerShell - replacing distribution name and preferred location: <br>----<br> Also at the time of writing, when you import a distribution, you may need to tell WSL 2 to start the distribution using the Linux user account you created when you first created the distribution. Thanks to <a href="https://www.58bits.com/blog/2020/05/30/wsl-2-setup-development">58bits.com </a> that you can run the below PowerShell script that imports the distribution, and resets the default user as you would like it to be. <br>-- --<br> Note that if your import fails with 'Unspecified error' (or other) - you may need to limit the amount of memory allocated to <b><i>vmmem</i></b>. You can do this with WSL2 config to limit memory as mentioned in ProTip 5 above.</li><li>If you are into using VS-Code as your IDE for development, you can launch the one you installed on your host Windows 10 OS from WSL 2 bash in your project's root folder and executing <b><i>`code .`</i></b>. With this you can work on your windows operating system launching your development servers in WSL environment, thus getting the best of both the worlds. Additionally, you can install your vs-code extensions on remote wsl as well as on host OS, all from within your IDE.</li><li>And <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/" target="_blank">Docker Desktop for Windows</a> works well with your WSL2 too. You just can extract the best from everything.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Windows 10 is super cool again with WSL 2. Whether you are a Windows buff wanting to leverage Linux goodies, or a Linux buff wanting to draw upon Windows 10 strengths, you can have it all. Happy coding!!..

            <p>What does it mean to be a software developer?</p>
<p>You can think about writing code running in a reasonable amount of time. You can think about design pattern, microservices, programming languages, and code syntax. What else?</p>
<p>We have tendency to forget that being a software developer means dealing all day long with fellow humans. Interacting with others, communicating, explaining ideas, adapting to your team members are very important skills.</p>
<p>The art of debating is part of this set of communication skills you need to have. It’s something we do a lot, sometimes without a real good reason. This is a complex subject which has its own rules and outcomes.</p>
<p>I propose to dive into the art of argumentation today for you to have a bigger and, hopefully, a better impact on what you’re working on. We’ll see:</p>
<ul>
<li>When should you argue with your peers, and when should you avoid the debate.</li>
<li>Tools and advice to have constructive debates.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to be meta and argue with me on the subject, the comment section is ready for our arguments.</p>
<h2 id="the-benefits-of-improving-your-debating-skill">The Benefits of Improving Your Debating Skill</h2>
<p>Imagine this: Dave, your colleague developer, thinks that creating a multi level inheritance tree to specialize a god class of 10 000 lines is a good idea. Obviously, if you speak with Dave and succeed to put down his plan to destroy the codebase, you’ll save some headaches for you, Dave and whoever will work on the project. Congratulations!</p>
<p>Debating can bring value and reduce technical debts by creating new ideas. It can avoid bugs and improve scalability. Communication is a very important quality, even more important as raw knowledge.</p>
<p>If you know how to argue and if you do it when you need to, you’ll be seen as well as somebody interested in his work. You’ll show that you’re not a code monkey.</p>
<p>Debating, even if it can be tiring at first and tricky to do correctly, can as well teach you a lot by confronting your ideas with others. Whatever the outcome, you will always learn something. It will increase:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your communication skills.</li>
<li>Your technical knowledge, especially if you’re wrong.</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be painful as well, but, like failures, it can bring you a lot.</p>
<p>Now, look around you: are your colleagues open to discussions? Can you propose your ideas freely, even if they might sound silly? Do they let you express your concerns and listen to your proposals of improvement?</p>
<p>This is really important if you want to learn more and blossom like a little flower: a company culture should be as open as possible to new ideas, even if it creates discussions and arguments. If nobody listens to you and never explain why what you’re saying is wrong with good and reasonable arguments, you really need to try to improve the situation and explain the benefits of debating and discussing in general… or you need to find another job.</p>
<h2 id="to-debate-or-not-to-debate">To Debate Or Not To Debate</h2>
<p>Discussing and debating have great benefits. But before going into a heated conversation with anybody, ask yourself: should I debate?</p>
<h3 id="think-twice-before-creating-or-participating-in-a-debate">Think Twice Before Creating or Participating in a Debate</h3>
<p>Let’s be honest: many discussions in the software world are useless. It’s the grotesque example of arguing about “space vs tab”:</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn’t bring any value, to anybody.</li>
<li>It’s purely based on ego: you argue that space is better than tab because you’re right, and the others are wrong.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you try to convince somebody that there is a better way, you should argue about things which matter for the business you work for. About things which bring real, concrete value. Spaces instead of tabs in a codebase won’t bring any value to a company. On the contrary, improving the UX of an application, for example, can bring a lot of value.</p>
<p>In general, beware when Dave, your colleague developer, comes to you, full of anger, to fight about code syntax rules: nobody, except him, care about that, even less the customer who pays good money for the product you work on. I could extrapolate to most technology wars between engineers. If they lack arguments and seem to be in loop on “this technology is better because of x reasons not related to the business”, you have to run away.</p>
<p>That said, customers will care if nobody can understand the codebase anymore and fix bugs or add new features. Most debates about technology might be useless, but some are very important to have.</p>
<p>Debating takes time and cost mental energy. Choose your debates wisely.</p>
<h3 id="patience-and-calm-are-valuable-developer-skills">Patience and Calm are Valuable Developer Skills</h3>
<p>Now let’s imagine the following situation: you’re in a heated discussion with Dave, your colleague developer, about this god class he wants to keep and extend. You know it’s wrong. Everybody knows it’s wrong. Still, Dave wants to do it. Maybe he felt attacked personally by your arguments. He might lack self-confidence. He might never want to be wrong.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, as a rule of thumb, don’t let a debate go beyond 20 minutes.</p>
<p>After this lap of time, you should have been able to throw your best arguments. If Dave doesn’t want to follow your idea and extend the god class instead of refactoring it, I would suggest two possible solutions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ask somebody external to the conversation, and therefore neutral, to solve your differences. It could be another colleague or even your boss (CTO, team leader, and whatnot).
Be aware though that you might make Dave angry if your boss think you’re right. Yet, it’s still better than letting very bad idea be implemented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accept the arguments, for now, and be patient. Write somewhere that you had this discussion. If you were right, there will be consequences. When bugs will occur because of the object of the debate, or when somebody will complain about it, launch a new conversation with this new knowledge. Show <em>concrete consequences</em> of the bad idea.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As a general rule, when you’re proven right, don’t claim loudly through your open office: “I told you so, you miserable pig! I was right! Therefore, I curse you and all your family on three generations!”. Nobody reacts well to the famous “I told you so”. It doesn’t bring anything to anybody, except maybe flattering your ego for a couple of minutes. Explaining with calm, in a simple and concrete way, the bad consequences an idea have or can have, is better than blaming to show how smart you are.</p>
<p>I insist on the idea of calm. During a debate, everybody is more sensible about the tone of your voice and your body language. I struggle myself with this, but try to keep your voice low and your movements deliberate, smooth and controlled.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you have to let some creepy code, bad ideas or nonsense features live in your shiny application. As a developer, not everybody will take your opinion in consideration, unfortunately. Keep in mind that coding is an iterative process: you can always refactor later, if the <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/fighting-software-entropy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entropy</a> doesn’t go through the roof.</p>
<p>At least, you tried to show the way. If nobody’s ready to take it, they might listen to you another day. Don’t forget as well that time is sometimes necessary for people to really understand your arguments and ultimately accept your opinion. A debate, even not resolved, can bring new ideas and can have consequences on a longer term.</p>
<h3 id="you-dont-have-the-perfect-answer">You Don’t Have the Perfect Answer</h3>
<p>Problems can be tackled in many ways. Don’t be closed to everything a colleague tells you because it sounds silly at first, or because you never heard of it before. Maybe the solution is valid but you never thought about it. Learning to pause and think is important: what could be the benefit of this approach? What could be the drawbacks?</p>
<p>In short, try to keep your mind open. You might learn way more by really taking every idea into consideration. Notably if the colleague you argue with is an interested developer you trust.</p>
<p>Be aware as well that everything has benefits and trade-offs. Every decision has a cost: time, money, technical debts. Assess your ideas, understand what are the possible problems in the specific context you’re in, and explain them during your argumentation.</p>
<h3 id="dont-let-emotions-cloud-your-judgment">Don’t Let Emotions Cloud your Judgment</h3>
<p>The mood you’re in can change your perception of basically everything. If you feel that you argue because you’re in a bad mood, or because of other external factors which have nothing to do with the subject of the conversation, it’s time to stop the debate. Reflect on why you reacted like you did, and try not to let your emotions drive your argumentation.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s easier to say than to do. Personally, I know that <a href="https://www.holybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/Buddha-in-Blue-Jean.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meditation</a> is a great way to be aware of my emotions before letting them take possession of my mind. Being able to stop and think before going into a diatribe full of anger is really useful.</p>
<h2 id="developing-the-skills-to-argue-effectively">Developing the Skills to Argue Effectively</h2>
<h3 id="the-ego-problem">The Ego Problem</h3>
<p><img src="https://thevaluable.dev/images/2018/debate-developer/02.jpg" alt="careful-of-your-ego"></p>
<p>If you need to follow a golden rule when debating, take this one: don’t take it personally. In other words: don’t feel attacked directly, as a person. You’re a professional and therefore you work for somebody. It’s not about you, it’s about this somebody.</p>
<p>If you try to defend your ideas just for the sack of being right, whatever the reason, you should stop the debate. Being a developer is a concrete job where you have to create value. Therefore, you, personally, is out of the equation when it comes to debates.</p>
<p>It’s easy to see if you argue for the sake of being right or if you don’t: just listen to you arguments. If they feel weak, stop the discussion, think about it, and find good arguments to defend your ideas if it’s worth defending.</p>
<p>Another important thing: you need to be ready, when expressing your disapproval, to be wrong. Nobody is always right; being wrong is a sign of humility and a proof that you are open-minded. You need to be able to question yourself to grow.</p>
<p>Don’t think about being wrong as something negative. It’s a vector of learning.</p>
<h3 id="use-experiences-from-others">Use Experiences From Others</h3>
<p>When you defend an idea, simply quote somebody who agrees with you. …</p></section></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span lang="EN-AU">IBM made some announcements today relating to
their latest POWER7 server offerings. The new line of systems includes new
entry level systems and the highly anticipated high-end system, the POWER7 <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=ca&amp;infotype=an&amp;appname=iSource&amp;supplier=897&amp;letternum=ENUS110-158">795</a>!
<span></span>They also officially outlined some of
the new features available in AIX 7.1. You can review the details <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/cgi-bin/common/ssi/ssialias?infotype=an&amp;subtype=ca&amp;htmlfid=897/ENUS210-200&amp;appname=isource&amp;language=enus">here</a>.
Ive discussed some of these new features </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://gibsonnet.net/blog/cgaix/entry/aix_7_open_beta_is_live_it_s_time_to_test?lang=en"><span>here</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">
and </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://gibsonnet.net/blog/cgaix/entry/creating_an_aix_5_2_wpar_on_aix_7?lang=en"><span>here</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">.
The official AIX 7.1 announcement details are available </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/power/news/announcement/20100817_annc.html"><span>here</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">The announcement got me thinking about my
recent customer engagements and why some have chosen to deploy AIX into their
IBM POWER environments, while others are considering a Linux on POWER solution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">Ive found that it usually comes down to a
skills decision more than anything else. Most customers are happy to either
continue working with AIX (if they are existing AIX users) or migrate from
another UNIX OS to AIX. Ive seen very few customers actually migrate to Linux
on POWER, but Ive worked with several that have seriously considered it. Those
that have chosen to deploy Linux are doing so purely because they have in-house
Linux skills. They are concerned that migrating to AIX may be too big a jump
for their technical staff. I find this thinking interesting, as most of the
customers Ive dealt with who run other UNIX OSs like Tru64, Solaris or HP-UX
are more than happy to migrate to AIX. They believe the move is relatively
minor and doesnt require massive re-training of their UNIX admins. I tend to
agree.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">For me, <b>AIX</b>
is my preferred Enterprise class UNIX Operating System. Notice Im prefacing
this with the words <b><i>Enterprise class</i></b>. Dont get me wrong, I have worked with Linux
systems in both small and large customer environments. It is a great OS. But
Ive found that it really only fits into environments that have a relatively
small number of users and where significant downtime can be tolerated for
things like operating system maintenance. This doesnt fit the Enterprise class
of UNIX server OSs that Im thinking of here. When I contemplate the word <i>Enterprise</i>, I think of servers and
operating systems that can respond to business demands in terms of performance,
reliability, stability and availability. An Enterprise UNIX can provide all of
these things without compromise. Linux can offer performance and reliability
(in my opinion). However, from what Ive seen, it lacks features &amp; functions
in the areas of stability and availability. AIX on the other hand ticks all the
boxes. Again, this is just my opinion based on my experiences with both AIX and
Linux in the Enterprise landscape. Others will no doubt have their own
experiences that may or may not match my own.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">So when Im designing an Enterprise UNIX
server environment for a customer, I always start with an AIX on POWER base. If
the customer wants Linux, sure I can look at that too, but I strongly recommend
AIX as my preferred choice for large systems. Most of my customers are running
relatively large SAP/Oracle systems. AIX on POWER is a great combination for
large Enterprise systems. If you need to deploy large database systems that
must service tens of thousands of users (like a big SAP system), then I believe
AIX is the perfect OS on which to provide a platform for these large scale
systems.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">AIX is a very mature and powerful UNIX OS. It
has been a major player in the UNIX server market for over 20 years (as shown
below). Some people are just not aware of how mature, robust and stable the AIX
OS has become over the years. There are many impressive aspects of the OS in
the areas of performance, scalability, reliability, management and
administration. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-AU"><o:p></o:p></span><a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/cgaix/resource/BLOGS_UPLOADED_IMAGES/aix_evolution.gif" target="_blank"><img alt="image" src="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/cgaix/resource/BLOGS_UPLOADED_IMAGES/aix_evolution.gif"></a> </p>





<p><span lang="EN-AU">Just looking at some of the administration
capabilities built into AIX are enough for me to always recommend AIX over
Linux (or any other UNIX OS), when it comes to large Enterprise servers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">For example, the System Management Interface Tool (</span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-smit/index.html"><span>SMIT</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">) can make the UNIX admins life a lot simpler.
This is an interactive tool that is part of the AIX OS. Almost all tasks that
an AIX administrator may need to perform can be executed using this tool. It is
a text-based tool (there is also an X interface but I recommend sticking with
the text-based menus). Everything it does, it does through standard AIX
commands and Korn shell functions. This feature is especially useful when you
need to automate a repetitive task; you can have SMIT create the proper
command-line sequence, and you can then use those commands in your own script.
My compatriot, Anthony English, has a nice intro to </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://gibsonnet.net/blog/AIXDownUnder/entry/smitty_to_his_friends20?lang=en"><span>SMIT</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU"> on his AIX blog. <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">The
<b>AIX Logical Volume Manager</b> (</span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redpapers/pdfs/redp0106.pdf"><span>LVM</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">)
is built into the OS, for free. AIX LVM helps UNIX system administrators </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-aixstorage/index.html"><span>manage their
storage</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU"> in a very flexible manner. LVM allows logical
volumes to span multiple physical volumes. Data on logical volumes appears to
be contiguous to the user, but might not be contiguous on the physical volume.
This allows file systems, paging space, and other logical volumes to be resized
or relocated, span multiple physical volumes, and have their contents
replicated for greater flexibility and availability. It provides capabilities
for mirroring data across disks, migrating data across disks &amp; storage
subsystems, expand/shrink filesystems and more.......all of which can be
performed dynamically.....<b>no downtime</b>
required. The concept, implementation and interface to the AIX LVM is one of a
kind. All of its features support the continuous availability philosophy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">One of the biggest reasons that I love AIX
over Linux is the <b>mksysb</b>. Its built
into the OS and allows you to create a bootable image of your AIX system. This
image can be used to restore a broken AIX system or for cloning other systems.
The cloning feature is truly amazing. You can take an image created on a
low-end system and deploy it on any POWER system, all the way up to the
high-end POWER boxes. This simplifies the installation and cloning processing
when you need to install and manage many AIX LPARs. By using an SOE mksysb
image you can deploy consistent AIX images across your Enterprise POWER server
environment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">This brings me to another wonderful feature of
AIX, the <b>Network Installation Manager</b>
(</span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg247296.html?Open"><span>NIM</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">).
NIM is powerful network installation tool (comparable to Linux Kickstart).
Using NIM you can backup/restore, update and upgrade one or more AIX systems
either individually or simultaneously. This can all be achieved over a network
connection, removing the need for handling physical installation media forever.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">Another fine example of AIXs superior OS management tools is </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://www.ibmsystemsmag.com/aix/aprilmay08/tipstechniques/20226p1.aspx"><span>multibos</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">. This tool allows an AIX administrator to
create and maintain two separate, bootable instances of the AIX OS within the
same root volume group (rootvg). This second instance of rootvg is known as a
standby Base Operating System (BOS) and is an extremely handy tool for
performing AIX TL and Service Pack (SP) updates. Multibos lets you install,
update and customize a standby instance of the AIX OS <b>without impacting</b> the running and active production instance of the
AIX OS. This is valuable in environments with tight maintenance windows. <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">When it comes to upgrading the OS to a new
release of AIX, the </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-migrate_nimadm/index.html"><span>nimadm</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">
utility can assist the administrator greatly in this task. </span><span lang="EN-AU">The <b><span>nimadm</span></b>
utility offers several advantages. For example, a system administrator can use <b><span>nimadm</span></b> to create a copy of a
NIM client's rootvg and migrate the disk to a newer version or release of AIX.
All of this can be done <b>without
disruption</b> to the client (there is no outage required to perform the
migration). After the migration is finished, the only downtime required will be
a single scheduled reboot of the system.</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">AIX
6.1 introduced new capability that most UNIX operating systems are still
working on. </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&amp;context=SG11G&amp;dc=DB520&amp;uid=isg3T1012104&amp;loc=en_US&amp;cs=utf-8&amp;lang=#concurrent"><span>Concurrent
Updates of the AIX Kernel</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">.....<b>without a reboot</b>! IBM is always working hard at making AIX an OS
that can provide <b>continuous availability</b>,
even if it needs to be patched. AIX now has the ability to update certain kernel
components and kernel extensions in place, without needing a system reboot. In
addition, concurrent updates can be removed from the system without needing a
reboot. Can you do this with other UNIX OSs? <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">And thats just some of the features that make
AIX <b>the</b> only UNIX OS that I recommend
for Enterprise systems. There are many more tools and features that I couldnt
live without (like alt_disk_install, savevg, installp, WPARs, etc, the list
goes on). If you are new to AIX and you are considering what your next UNIX OS
should be, then I recommend you take a <b>very</b>
close look at </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://ibm.com/aix"><span>AIX</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">And finally, the support provided by IBM, is
first class. Whenever Ive needed assistance with an AIX issue or query, I have
always received timely, professional and useful advice. On the rare occasions
where Ive uncovered a new bug, IBM AIX support have always been quick to
provide me with an interim fix to resolve or workaround a problem. Thats the
sort of support youd expect for an Enterprise UNIX OS, isnt it? Whats the
support like from your current UNIX (or Linux) OS vendor?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">Linux is still a viable UNIX operating system.
However, I think its more suited to certain workloads like small to medium
size mail, web and other utility servers and services. AIX, however, would be
my platform of choice for my 10TB Oracle database running SAP ERP, not just for
performance reasons, but primarily because of the system administration
features of AIX that allow me to support and manage the system without
impacting my customers or enforcing reboots/outages whenever I need to change
something on the system.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">All IBM need to do is create their own Linux
distribution (Blue Linux perhaps?)
that has all the features of AIX built in and then Im sold! But why would
they? We already have AIX.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">Follow me on Twitter:</span><span lang="EN-AU"> </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://twitter.com/cgibbo"><span>http://twitter.com/cgibbo</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Let's install OpenBSD on a Lenovo Thinkpad X270. I used this computer for my
computer science studies. It has both Arch Linux and Windows 10 installed as
dual boot. Now that I'm no longer required to run Windows, I can ditch the dual
boot and install an operating system of my choice.</p>

<p>First, I grab my work Thinkpad running Arch Linux and some USB dongle big enough
for the <a href="https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64/miniroot67.fs">amd64 miniroot
image</a> (roughly
five megabytes, that is). This small image does not include the file sets, which
will be downloaded during installation instead. I also download the <a href="https://mirror.ungleich.ch/pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64/SHA256">SHA256
checksums</a> from the
Swiss mirror, and verify the downloaded image, before I copy it on my dongle:</p>
<pre><code>$ sha256sum -c --ignore-missing SHA256 
miniroot67.fs: OK
$ sudo dd if=miniroot67.fs of=/dev/sda bs=1M
</code></pre>

<p>The Thinkpad X270 is connected to my network through Ethernet. The WiFi firmware
usually needs to be installed separately, so only Ethernet will work out of the
box. The BIOS has UEFI activated. OpenBSD and UEFI has issues on older hardware
(at least on a 2014 Dell laptop I have), but let's try it on this laptop,
anyway.</p>
<p>I plug in the dongle prepared before, and start the computer. I interrupt
the regular boot with Enter and pick an alternative boot method by pressing F12.
Now I pick my USB dongle. After roughly a minute, the installer has been
started. Now I follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>I choose the option <code>I</code> to install OpenBSD.</li>
<li>For the keyboard layout, I pick <code>sg</code>, for Swiss German.</li>
<li>As a hostname, I simply pick <code>x270</code>, because it's a Thinkpad X270, and I'm not
  very creative when it comes to naming things.</li>
<li>From the available network options (<code>iwm0</code>: WiFi, <code>em0</code>: Ethernet, and
  <code>vlan0</code>: Virtual LAN), I pick <code>em0</code>.</li>
<li>I try to get an IPv4 address over DHCP, which seems to work very quickly.</li>
<li>Next, I type in my very secret root password twice.</li>
<li>I do <em>not</em> start <code>sshd</code> by default, because I don't need to connect to this
  machine through SSH. It's supposed to be a workstation, not a server.</li>
<li>The X Window System should not be started by <code>xnodm(1)</code>, so I leave it to
  <code>no</code>.</li>
<li>Neither do I want to change the default to <code>com0</code>.</li>
<li>I set up my user <code>patrick</code> with my proper name <code>Patrick Bucher</code>, and a decent
  password.</li>
<li>The time zone has been detected properly as <code>Europe/Zurich</code>, which I just
  leave the way it is.</li>
<li>The installer detected two disks: <code>sd0</code> and <code>sd1</code>. Since <code>sd0</code> is the detected
  SSD in my laptop, the UEFI issue from my Dell laptop doesn't exist on this
  computer. I pick <code>sd0</code> for the root disk, since <code>sd1</code> is my USB dongle.</li>
<li>I choose to use the whole disk with a GPT partitioning schema, because it's
  2020.</li>
<li>An auto-allocated layout for <code>sd0</code> is presented. It looks decent to me, so I
  just go with that auto layout.</li>
<li>I don't want to initialize another disk, so I just press Enter (<code>done</code>).</li>
<li>Since the miniroot image does not come with the file sets, I pick <code>http</code> as
  the location for the sets.</li>
<li>I don't use a proxy, and use the mirror <code>mirrog.ungleich.ch</code> and the server
  directory <code>pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64</code> as proposed.</li>
<li>Next, I unselect the game sets by entering <code>-game*</code>. (I heard that they're not
  much fun to play.) I leave all the other sets activated, including the <code>x</code>
  sets, which will be required for the GUI later on.</li>
<li>After those sets are installed, I press Enter (<code>done</code>). Now the installer
  performs various tasks, after which I choose to <code>halt</code> the computer. This
  gives me time to remove the USB dongle.</li>
</ul>

<p>I now restart my laptop, and OpenBSD boots. This takes more time than booting
Arch Linux, which uses <code>systemd</code>, whereas OpenBSD uses <code>rc</code>, which performs the
startup tasks sequentially.</p>
<p>There's a message showing up that various firmware (<code>intel-firmware</code>,
<code>iwm-firmware</code>, <code>inteldrm-firmware</code>, <code>uvideo-firmware</code>, and <code>vmm-firmware</code>) has
been installed automatically. Very nice, indeed.</p>
<h2>WiFi Connection</h2>
<p>Now that the <code>iwm-firmware</code> has been installed, I can connect right away to my
WiFi network <code>frzbxpdb5</code>. I create a file called <code>/etc/hostname.iwm0</code>, wich
<code>hostname</code> being a literal string, and <code>iwm0</code> being the WiFi network card. The
connection to my WiFi network consists of a single line:</p>
<pre><code>dhcp nwid frzbxpdb5 wpakey [my-wpakey]
</code></pre>
<p>Whereas <code>frzbxpdb5</code> is my WiFi network's ESSID, and <code>[my-wpakey]</code> needs to be
replaced by the actual WPA key.</p>
<p>Then the networking can be restarted for that device:</p>
<pre><code># sh /etc/netstart iwm0
</code></pre>
<p>This script is kind enough to set the file permissions of <code>/etc/hostname.iwm0</code>
to <code>640</code>, and then connects to my WiFi network.</p>
<p>I unplug the Ethernet cable and <code>ping openbsd.org</code>, which works fine, even after
a restart.</p>

<p>My GUI on Unix-like systems is based on the Dynamic Window Manager (<code>dwm</code>) and a
couple of other tools, such as <code>dmenu</code>, <code>st</code>, <code>slstatus</code>, <code>slock</code>, all created and
maintained by the <a href="http://suckless.org/">Suckless</a> community.</p>
<p>This software doesn't come with configuration facilities, but needs to be
configured in the respective C header file <code>config.h</code>, and then re-compiled.
Even though OpenBSD offers <code>dwm</code> as a package, customizing and configuring that
window manager requires to build it from source.</p>
<h2>Building <code>dwm</code> and Friends</h2>
<p>First, I need to install <code>git</code> to fetch the source code:</p>
<pre><code># pkg_add git
</code></pre>
<p>Then I fetch the source code for <code>dwm</code>, <code>dmenu</code>, <code>st</code>, and <code>slstatus</code> from <a href="http://suckless.org/">Suckless</a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone https://git.suckless.org/dwm
$ git clone https://git.suckless.org/dmenu
$ git clone https://git.suckless.org/st
$ git clone https://git.suckless.org/slstatus
</code></pre>
<h3>Building <code>dwm</code></h3>
<p>Next, I try to build <code>dwm</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd dwm
$ make
</code></pre>
<p>This fails with an error message (<code>'ft2build.h' file not found</code>), which reminds
me of building <code>dwm</code> on FreeBSD roughly a month before. Since I can finde the
header file at another location:</p>
<pre><code># find / -type f -name ft2build.h
/usr/X11R6/include/freetype2/ft2build.h
</code></pre>
<p>I simply can modify the <code>config.mk</code> accordingly by changing</p>
<pre><code>FREETYPEINC = /usr/include/freetype2
</code></pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre><code>FREETYPEINC = $(X11INC}/freetype2
</code></pre>
<p>Actually, I only need to comment the above line, and uncomment the line below</p>
<pre><code># OpenBSD (uncomment)
</code></pre>
<p>The Suckless folks obviously are friendly towards OpenBSD, which is also
noticable in other places (more evidence to be shown further below).</p>
<p>The next compilation attempt succeeds:</p>
<pre><code>$ make
</code></pre>
<p>So let's install <code>dwm</code>, too:</p>
<pre><code># make install
</code></pre>
<p>By default, and as to be seen in <code>config.h</code>, the keyboard combination
<code>[Alt]+[Shift]+[Enter]</code> (deeply engraved into the muscle memories of many <code>dwm</code>
users) starts the <code>st</code> terminal. This will be built in a while. However, I
prefer to use the <em>Super</em> or <em>Windows</em> key instead of <code>Alt</code>, since the former
is of no use in OpenBSD, and the latter still comes in handy when working with
the emacs readline mode. Therefore, I change the <code>MODKEY</code> from</p>
<pre><code>#define MODKEY Mod1Mask
</code></pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre><code>#define MODKEY Mod4Mask
</code></pre>
<p>Then I rebuild and reinstall <code>dwm</code>:</p>
<pre><code># make install
</code></pre>
<h3>Building <code>st</code></h3>
<p>Let's switch over to the <code>st</code> source directory and just try to compile it:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd ../st
$ make
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we get a warning that the function <code>pledge</code> (an OpenBSD mitigation, which
is built into the <code>master</code> branch, but surrounded by an <code>ifdef</code> preprocessor
statement, so that it will only be compiled for OpenBSD) is imported implicitly.
Let's just ignore this warning for now.</p>
<p>What's worse, the compilation fails with the error message:</p>
<pre><code>ld: error: unable to find library -lrt
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the FAQ comes in handy, stating that</p>
<pre><code>If you want to compile st for OpenBSD you have to remove -lrt from
config.mk, ...
</code></pre>
<p>Having done so in <code>config.mk</code>, <code>st</code> compiles without any further issues, and,
thus, can be rebuilt and installed:</p>
<pre><code># make install
</code></pre>
<h3>Building <code>dmenu</code></h3>
<p>Even OpenBSD users with Suckless tools have to open another GUI application than
a terminal emulator once in a while. For this purpose, Suckless offers <code>dmenu</code>.
Let's switch over to it and compile it:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd ../dmenu
$ make
</code></pre>
<p>Again, we have the issue with <code>ft2build.h</code>, which can be resolved as above with
<code>dwm</code>: by using the proper path for <code>FREETYPEINC</code> in <code>config.mk</code>. Afterwards,
the build succeeds, and <code>dmenu</code> can be installed:</p>
<pre><code># make install
</code></pre>
<h3>Building <code>slstatus</code></h3>
<p><code>dwm</code> has a status bar on the top right, which can be used to show various
information. I used to write some shell commands in <code>.xinitrc</code> to compose such a
status line, and then set it by <code>xset -b</code> once every five seconds or so. This
approach generates a multitude of processes every couple of seconds.</p>
<p><code>slstatus</code> is a C programm that is capable of showing various kinds of more or
less useful information. Let's switch over to <code>slstatus</code> and see, what is
available in <code>config.def.h</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd ../slstatus
$ less config.def.h
</code></pre>
<p>The comments section lists different functions (<code>battery_perc</code> for the battery
percentage, <code>datetime</code> for date and time information, <code>temp</code> for thermal
information, etc.). I usually display the CPU load, the battery percentage, the
memory usage, the current keyboard layout, and the current date and time.</p>
<p>Before configuring those, let's try to compile <code>slstatus</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ make
</code></pre>
<p>This worked fine, so let's configure the information to be displayed in
<code>config.h</code>:</p>
<pre><code>static const struct arg args[] = {
    /* function    format    argument */
    { datetime,    "%s",     "%F %T" },
};
</code></pre>
<p>This renders the current date as follows:</p>
<pre><code>$ date +"%F %T"
2020-09-05 19:26:38
</code></pre>
<p>I also like to have the weekday included, but not the seconds, so I define a
different argument string:</p>
<pre><code>$ date +"%a %Y-%m-%d %H:%M"
Sat 2020-09-05 19:27
</code></pre>
<p>That's better, so let's use it in <code>config.h</code> (surrounded with some spaces in the
format string):</p>
<pre><code>static const struct arg args[] = {
    /* function    format    argument */
    { datetime,    " %s ",   "%a %Y-%m-%d %H:%M" },
};
</code></pre>
<p>The other settings I like to have do not require any arguments, at least not on
OpenBSD, so I only need to define a decent format string (with <code>|</code> as a
seperator) for those:</p>
<pre><code>static const struct arg args[] = {
    /* function    format           argument */
    { cpu_perc,     " cpu: %s%% |", NULL },
    { battery_perc, " bat: %s%% |", NULL },
    { ram_used,     " mem: %s |",   NULL },
    { keymap,       " %s |"         NULL },
    { datetime,     " %s ",         "%a %Y-%m-%d %H:%M" },
};
</code></pre>
<p>This actually compiles, so let's install it:</p>
<pre><code># make install
</code></pre>
<h2>Configuring X Startup</h2>
<p>Now that all software is compiled and installed, let's run X. To do so, a file
<code>.xinitrc</code> in the user's directory is …</p></div></div>

    <h5>compiled from various sources by Conrad R. Hoffman</h5>
    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>At the dawn of the electrical age it was quickly realized that a reproducible standard of voltage was needed. Ideally, that
      standard would be insensitive to temperature changes, current flow, and aging. It would have a long life. It should also be
      possible for workers in widely separated labs to construct the standard with a high degree of reproducibility. A voltaic cell
      was the obvious choice of the time, however construction of a cell meeting those requirements was to become the subject of much
      research.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Early Voltage Standards</h4>
    <p>One of the many early cells used for a voltage standard was the Daniell Cell (1836). A Daniell Cell consists of a zinc plate
      immersed in a zinc sulfate solution, and a copper plate immersed in a copper sulfate solution. The two solutions are kept
      separated by a porous earthen cup, or by gravity, but are in a common vessel. The gravity, or "crowfoot" type of cell
      was used almost exclusively in telegraph work. Either style produced about 1.08 volts. Though the Daniell cell was used briefly
      as a voltage standard, it suffered from short life and a non-constant e.m.f. In fact, the Daniell Cell requires that the
      electrodes be removed from the electrolyte when the cell is not in use.
    </p>
    <p>In 1872 Latimer Clark invented the Clark Cell. It consisted of mercury and zinc amalgam electrodes in a saturated solution of
      zinc sulfate. This was a big improvement over the Daniell Cell, but suffered from two major imperfections. It had a large
      temperature coefficient of -0.00115 V/°C, and suffered from cracking where the platinum connections entered the glass
      envelope. This was caused by the platinum alloying with the zinc amalgam. In spite of its problems, it was reproducible, and
      became the first commercially successful standard cell.
    </p>
    <p>Lord Rayleigh investigated a form of Clark Cell in 1885 that became known as the Board of Trade Cell of 1894. He established
      the e.m.f. at any temperature to be:
    </p>
    <p><img src="https://www.conradhoffman.com/Image34.gif" title="EMF of Clark Cell" alt="formula">
    </p>
    <p>He gave the voltage as 1.434 volts at 15°C, but subsequent investigation has shown this value to be too high by nearly 0.1%.
      An improved form of the cell was developed at the Reichsanstalt, by Kahle. The correct e.m.f. is 1.4328 international volts,
      according to Laws Electrical Measurements (1917).
    </p>
    
    <h4>Invention of the Weston Standard Cell</h4>
    <p>Edward Weston (1850-1936) described the Weston Cell in a patent application in 1891. By substituting cadmium for zinc, and
      cadmium sulfate for the zinc sulfate electrolyte, he created a cell that largely overcame the deficiencies of the Clark Cell.
      It was highly reproducible, had a lower temperature coefficient, and didn't crack unless dropped!
    </p>
    
    <h4>Construction of the Weston Standard Cell</h4>
    <p>The Weston Standard Cell is invariably built in a glass "H" tube. At the bottom of each "H", platinum
      wires are sealed into the glass to make contact with the electrodes of the cell proper. Packed around one wire is liquid
      mercury, topped with a paste of mercurous sulfate. This forms the positive electrode. Packed around the other wire is a
      cadmium/mercury amalgam. This forms the negative electrode. The saturated cells would have a layer of cadmium sulfate crystals
      above the electrodes, and the un-saturated cells would use various packings to retain the electrodes. The top of the cell is
      then filled with cadmium sulfate solution.
    </p>
    <p>The purity of chemicals used is critical. The following is from Harris:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"Materials of the highest purity are essential to the construction of satisfactory standard cells. The basic materials-
        mercury, cadmium, sulfuric acid, and water- are all purified by distillation, starting with the purest materials available.
        Cadmium sulfate is preferably prepared from cadmium metal and acid, the cadmium being dissolved in nitric acid, crystallized
        several times as a nitrate, precipitated as cadmium sulfate with redistilled sulfuric acid, and purified by repeated
        recrystallization as the sulfate. Mercurous sulfate is prepared electrolytically in a darkened room. The cadmium amalgam
        (10% cadmium) is prepared either electrolyticly or by heating the two metals together."
      </p>
      <p>The finished cell must be mounted in a suitable enclosure to protect it, and to provide measurement terminals. Bakelite cases
        thermally lagged with copper (aluminum in later cells) are often used, or fully temperature controlled enclosures for sets of
      saturated cells.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h4>Saturated &amp; Un-saturated Cells</h4>
    <p>Two forms of the Weston Standard Cell are available: saturated and un-saturated. This refers to the concentration of cadmium
      sulfate in the electrolyte. The saturated type of cell is the most permanent, however it also has a larger temperature
      coefficient, and is not portable. It is typically used only for very accurate work, and must be temperature controlled. It is
      this type of cell that was used by the national laboratories to standardize the value of the volt.
    </p>
    <p>The un-saturated type of cell is more common, as it is portable. The electrode material and mercurous sulfate are held firmly
      in place with porous plugs, so the cell won't be damaged if inverted. The temperature coefficient can be ignored in most
      applications, but is given by:
    </p>
    <p><img src="https://www.conradhoffman.com/Image35.gif" title="EMF of Unsaturated Cell" alt="formula">
    </p>
    <p>Further variations of both the saturated and un-saturated cell are available in the form of "neutral" or "acid
      " cells. Acid cells are similar to the neutral of normal cells, with the addition of a small amount of sulfuric acid. The
      e.m.f. of acid cells is lower than that of normal cells, depending on the concentration of acid. The following formula gives
      the difference in e.m.f., where N is the normality of the sulfuric acid:
    </p>
    <p><img src="https://www.conradhoffman.com/Image36.gif" title="Correction for acidity" alt="formula">
    </p>
    
    <h4>Performance of the Weston Standard Cell</h4>
    <p>The London Conference on Electrical Units and Standards adopted the Weston Standard Cell as the international standard of
      voltage in 1908. The National Bureau of Standards, now NIST, followed suite on January 1, 1911.
    </p>
    <p>At that time, the voltage was stated to be 1.01830 International Volts at 20°C. At any other temperature the voltage was
      calculated using the following formula:
    </p>
    <p><img src="https://www.conradhoffman.com/Image37.gif" title="EMF of Saturated Cell" alt="formula">
    </p>
    <p>The original work was done by Wolff and published by the NBS in 1908. The coefficients are still considered accurate today.
    </p>
    <p>As can be seen, the cell must be kept at a constant temperature to insure accurate results. If that requirement is met, and
      if the cell was constructed with sufficiently pure materials, the voltage will remain stable to better than 1 ppm for long periods
      of time. Some of the cells maintained by the NIST are 70-80 years old, and are still stable and reliable, though no longer
      officially used as a voltage reference.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Care and Use of the Weston Standard Cell</h4>
    <p>By today's standards of solid state ruggedness and reliability, standard cells are finicky, delicate, and prone to damage
      through misuse. The simple application of a voltmeter to measure the cell will draw enough current to change the value of the
      cell, and will do permanent damage if kept up for any length of time. Modern high impedance DVMs lessen the danger, but
      standard cells should never be measured or used in this manner. (This statement obviously does not include solid state
      scanners meant for the purpose, or "electrometer input" DVMs having input impedances of hundreds of megohms.)
    </p>
    <p>Any current flow into or out of the cell is detrimental. One µA for several minutes can produce measurable changes in
      e.m.f. Under no circumstances should more than 100 µA ever be drawn. The following table shows the result of various
      currents and the associated recovery time:
    </p>
    
    <table>
      <tbody><tr>
        <td>current</td>
        <td>time in minutes</td>
        <td>e.m.f. loss at →</td>
        <td>time</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>20 µA</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>10 µV</td>
        <td>1 hr.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>100 µA</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>(unspecified)</td>
        <td>24 hrs.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>short circuit</td>
        <td>30</td>
        <td>1000 µV</td>
        <td>24 hrs.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>short circuit</td>
        <td>30</td>
        <td>75 µV</td>
        <td>5 weeks</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody></table>
    
    <p>Standard cell measurements are almost always made in the "null" configuration. Two cells are connected "back to back
      ", and the voltage difference between the two is measured. The measurement is always as brief as possible.
    </p>
    <p>It takes a minimum of three cells to maintain the volt with any degree of reliability. With one cell, there is no way to know if
      a change has occurred. With two cells, a change in either one will be detected, but there is no way to determine which one. With
      three cells, the errant cell can be identified. In addition, one cell can be sent off for certification, then compared on its
      return to be sure no shift or damage has occurred. The following rules are condensed from Harris' Electrical Measurements (1952):
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Cells in general laboratory use should be checked against each other frequently. At least one cell should be reserved for such
        checks, and not be subjected to the hazards of routine operation. Such cells should be sent to a standardizing laboratory once a
        year for certification. This will expose the cell(s) to abnormal temperature and handling conditions, and at least a week should
      be allowed for the cell(s) to recover before measurements are made.</li>
      <li>Avoid large or sudden changes in temperature.</li>
      <li>Current drain from the cell should be kept to a minimum by protective resistances in standard cell circuits and by proper
      manipulation of keys. Laboratory conditions which would result in the condensation of moisture on the cell case should be avoided.</li>
      <li>Never expose cells to temperatures outside the range of 4°C and 40°C.</li>
      <li>Low galvanometer sensitivity may be caused by high resistance. Check the resistance, and discard the cell if it persists.</li>
      <li>Discard the …</li></ol></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Daniel J. Bernstein's IM2000 email proposal is not a good idea</h2>

	<p><small>September  6, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>A long time ago, Daniel J. Bernstein wrote a proposal for a new
generation of Internet email he called <a href="https://cr.yp.to/im2000.html">IM2000</a>, although it never went anywhere.
Ever since then, a significant number of people have idealized it
as the great white 'if only' hope of email (especially as the
solution to spam), in much the same way that people idealized Sun's
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeWS">NeWS</a> as the great 'if only'
alternative to X11. Unfortunately, IM2000 is not actually a good
idea.</p>

<p>The core of <a href="https://cr.yp.to/im2000.html">IM2000</a> is summarized by Bernstein as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>IM2000 is a project to design a new Internet mail infrastructure
around the following concept: Mail storage is the sender's
responsibility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first problem with this is that it doesn't remove the fundamental
problem of email, which is (depending on how you phrase it) that
email is an <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/EmailVsModernProtocols"><em>anonymous push</em> protocol</a>
or that it lacks <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/SignedEmailWrongProblem"><em>revocable authorization</em> to send you things</a>. In IM2000, random strangers on the
Internet are still allowed to push to you, they just push less data
than they currently do with (E)SMTP mail.</p>

<p>The idea that IM2000 will deal with spam rests on the idea that
forcing senders to store mail is difficult for spammers. Even a
decade ago this was a questionable assumption, but today it is
clearly false. A great deal of serving capacity is yours for the
asking (and someone's credit card) in AWS, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cloud_Platform">GCP</a>, Azure, OVH,
and any number of other VPS and serverless computing places.  In
addition many spammers will have a relatively easy time with
'storing' their email, because their spam is already generated from
templates and so in IM2000 could be generated on the fly whenever
you asked for it from them. We now have a great deal of experience
with web servers that generate dynamic content on demand and it's
clear that they can run very efficiently and scale very well,
provided that they're designed competently.</p>

<p>(I wrote about this a long time ago <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/spam/SenderStorageHelpsSpammers">here</a>, and things have gotten much
easier for spammers since then.)</p>

<p>At the same time, IM2000 is catastrophic for your email privacy.
People complain vociferously about 'tracking pixels' in HTML email
that betray when you open and read the email from someone; well,
IM2000 is one giant tracking pixel that reliably reports when and
where you read that email message. IM2000 would also be a terrible
email reading experience, because it's like a version of IMAP where
message retrieval has random delays and sometimes fails entirely.</p>

<p>(As far as spam filtering your incoming IM2000 messages goes, IM2000
gives you far less up front information than you currently get with
SMTP email. I wrote up this and other issues a long time ago in an
entry about <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/spam/SenderStorageProblems">the technical problems of such schemes</a>. Some of those problems are no longer
really an issue more than a decade later, but some continue to be.)</p>

<p>At a broader 'technical choices have social impacts' level, IM2000
would create a very different experience than today's email systems
if implemented faithfully, one where 'your' email was actually not
yours but was mostly other people's because other people are storing
it. Those other people can mostly retract individual messages by
deleting them from their servers (you would still have the basic
headers that are pushed to you), and they can wipe out large sections
of your email by deleting entire accounts (and the sent messages
associated with them), or even by going out of business or having
a data loss incident. Imagine a world where an ISP getting out of
the mail business means that all email that its customers have sent
from their ISP email accounts over the years just goes away, from
everyone's mailbox.</p>

<p>(If 'ISP' sounds abstract here, substitute 'Yahoo'. Or 'GMail'.)</p>

<p>In addition, in some potential realizations of IM2000, email would
become mutable in practice (even if you weren't supposed to in
theory), because once again the sender is storing the message and
is in a position to alter that stored copy. Expect that capability
to be used sooner or later, just as people silently revise things
posted on the web (including official statements, perhaps especially
including them).</p>

<p>Some of these social effects can be partially avoided by storing
your own local copies of IM2000 messages when you read them, but
there are two issues. The first is pragmatic; the more you store
your own copies and the earlier you make them, the more IM2000 is
SMTP in a bad disguise. The second is social; in the IM2000 world
the server holds the authoritative copy of the message, not you,
so if you say the message says one thing (based on your local copy)
and the server operator says it says something else (or doesn't
exist), the server operator likely wins unless you have very strong
evidence.</p>

<p>In general, I think that IM2000 or anything like it would create
an 'email' experience that was far more like the web, complete with
the experience of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot">link rot</a>
and <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/CoolUrlsChange">cool messages changing</a>, than today's
email (where for better or worse you keep your own full record of
what you received, read and reread it at your leisure, and know
that it's as immutable as you want it to be). And it would still
have the problem that people can push stuff in front of you, unlike
the web where you usually at least have to go looking for things.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When the pandemic hit global news, everyone (I presume) and especially on Twitter were sharing their predictions about the future.<br></p><p>Apart from the range of predictions from dark and gloomy to “it’s going to be alright soon” optimism, there was intense collective thought being shared on how to adjust to the new life.&nbsp;</p><p>A dangerous outside world with a potentially lethal virus, getting stuck indoors and hence being wrenched out of every routine and social habits, general anxiety and fear for yourself and your loved ones - didn’t stop people from sharing “if you don’t build your business ideas while you’re stuck indoors, you’ll never do it”. Or “this is the best time to become fit and the best version of yourself.”&nbsp;</p><p>You know, non-empathetic BS that treats human beings like a robot following a set of instructions.</p><p>I spent month 1 in anxiety and fear desperately trying to adjust to the situation.&nbsp;</p><p>By month 2, I’d figured out that to not go insane, I will have to block news, browsing Twitter, and any websites tracking the pandemic 12 times a day. And so I did. My mind felt wrinkled until I let go, and it felt like I could relax and breathe &nbsp;again.</p><p>In the same month, I thought I would adjust and “become the best version of myself” or whatever hustle porn phrase was trending that week. I failed at adjusting and living a “normal” life for several months. I stopped trying so hard.</p><p>It also dawned on me that while my problems are real, the people really facing a hard time are those from the lower economic strata. They don't just have an option to live indoors and "WFH". They can't quit their jobs and go home. I became grateful about my position and privilege in life and internally I stopped complaining to myself about how difficult life is during a pandemic. I became calm.</p><p>It’s month 7 and I think I finally got a grip on my life.</p><p>You see, building new routines and adjusting to new social normals is a long process. Sure, you can write it down on a piece of paper and try to follow it, but your body and mind aren’t fully aligned and adjusted.</p><p>In particular, I found being stuck within 4 walls and not talking to anyone other than my family members for months wasn't going to help me adjust to the new normal.</p><p>In June, I started writing. This was the first step towards normalcy as I finally got in touch with my thoughts again and found an outlet to express them.</p><p>And only in the last month, I created a routine around going downstairs for a long 45-min brisk walk (while wearing a mask and avoiding people like the plague). I also started scheduling a lot of calls whenever someone from my life reached out, just to catch up with them and behave like we would had we bumped into each other at a coffee shop.</p><p>Human beings are incredible at adapting to a situation and normalising it. Life is finally starting to feel normal again. It just takes time, in this case 7 &nbsp;months.</p><p>I can see this in other people too - their behaviours, their mood, what they are saying when you talk to them and what you see people talk about on Twitter and other social platforms.&nbsp;</p><p>Yesterday, I played <a href="https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=puertorico" target="_blank">Puerto Rico</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/sankalpjonna" target="_blank">Sankalp</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/akashjdotcom" target="_blank">Akash</a> in the afternoon. In the evening. I walked while listening and occasionally babbling with a group of people on <a href="https://leher.app/" target="_blank">Leher</a> (Clubhouse for India). It felt like a fun conversation we would have otherwise had over a beer had we met physically. At night, I joked and laughed around with college friends over a Zoom call. </p><p>Life felt normal.</p><p>While the pandemic is bigger than ever and it’s imperative that we continue following all safety guidelines, having a routine you follow everyday, going outdoors regularly, socialising with people on video or phone calls - helps me adjust to this life in a pandemic.</p></div></div>]]>

							<p>Fog clings to a never-ending row of low-rise buildings down the length of a dusty road, it’s early, around eight o’clock on a cool April morning. The fog clears and voices breakthrough and you see the first glimpses of the large bazaar, sounds of shutters slamming open, doors being unlocked and people greeting each other as their day starts. The occasional chatter of gunfire can be heard as firearms are test fired nearby.</p>
<p><em>Darra Adam Khel</em>. This bustling town is situated in modern-day <em>Pakistan</em>, a stone’s throw from the Pak-Afghan border. <em>What makes it so special?</em> You may ask and the answer lies within the myriad of myths and legends put out over the years.</p>

<p><span><iframe width="1160" height="653" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J-f7j-RlN_Q?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
<p>As of this year, 2019, <em>Darra</em> is the last main tribal arms market and manufacturing town that remains in the Pak-Afghan FATA region (Federally-Administered Tribal Region – FATA pronounced Faa-Thaa locally), the last vestige of old-world freedom in the area. Over the last few years, the other manufacturing hubs and markets in towns like <em>Landi Kotal</em>, just a few minutes’ drive from <em>Torkham</em> border on the <em>Khyber Pass</em>, have finally died out leaving a handful of shops and a couple of gunsmiths who repair the large number of firearms still found across the region. <em>Peshawar’s</em> massive arms bazaars have also disappeared leaving a few licensed manufacturers in a small industrial estate on its outskirts and a few licensed dealers scattered throughout the city.</p>
<p><em>Darra</em> held out against the threat of the <em>Taliban</em> in the early 2010s, fighting them off on a number of occasions seeing as they had the arms, supplies and manpower to fend for themselves. They are no friend to these <em>Taliban</em> as you can see even though they have been linked by a few journalistic sources with selling them an enormous number of arms and ammunition. Contrary to popular belief that the market is now dead or not operating, the bazaar still thrives with many firearms bought and sold daily in its now-legendary bazaar. Yes, there were times were the shutters ere down but this was always just a façade, something that happened on the face and business continued in the back alleys and dusty basements.</p>
<p>However, the town of thousands of arms dealers and manufacturing workshops has been relegated to around a thousand of both due to the global war on terror and its impact on the global arms trade and international smuggling routes. They do not get as much as they used to though they still have a steady but small supply of items that get through to them even to this day. Due to this war on terror, the FATA area – which for many years managed to retain its autonomy, was regulated to prohibit the sale and ownership of explosive type ordnance and large-caliber arms such as HMG’s (e.g: DsHK / KPV) and up to the general population there. Fortunately, <em>Darra</em> still maintains its hold on the trade of tribal arms throughout the now regulated tribal areas and still holds a monopoly on arms manufactured there that are sold within <em>Pakistan</em> and <em>Afghanistan</em> too.</p>
<p>The war on terror has a lot of detriments with the main one being that it has increased the price of arms so much; that now an AK rifle which would have cost approximately Rs10,000 (~£55/~$67), around fifteen years ago, now costs a minimum of around ten times that. Yes, as with all markets, prices do fluctuate depending on many local and regional factors but prices still remain relatively high due to this. Genuine, original factory-made arms command a high premium on the market as a whole throughout the Pak-Afghan region and this has meant that locally made arms are sold more than originals due to the somewhat extortionate prices that can be seen. Due to soaring inflation and prices of raw material, locally made arms now cost the same as originals were only a decade or so ago.</p>

<p>Some older background information would be needed to understand why such a place even exists on such a scale as it is or even was. During the British Raj period of the 1800s where the British Empire ruled over these tribal areas, small workshops opened up in many areas across the region to produce exact copies of arms used by the British to fight back against them. Gunsmiths started with muskets and then progressed onto Lee-Enfield action rifles and that was their mainstay for a lengthy period continuing to upgrade and produce newer variations, turning those small shops into larger ones. That is how <em>Darra</em> and many other manufacturing towns and bazaars got their start and from then, the markets grew and grew becoming what they then were known as. <em>Darra’s</em> second major call to fame was that it supplied arms and ammunition to the <em>Mujahideen</em> in <em>Afghanistan</em> during the 1979-1989 Soviet-Afghan War, some say it was even supported by the federal government too at this point. More recently, <em>Darra’s</em> notoriety came to surface as ill-informed people conducting poor journalism claimed it was a black market and that the gunsmiths manufactured guns in mud huts, with basic tools using their bare hands. Putting this to rest, let me start with calling it a black market; this is incorrect as the areas where these markets were/are based comes under its own tribal laws and governance much different to the rest of <em>Pakistan</em>, they are operating well within their own laws therefore it is not a black market in any sense within these borders. There is an element of truth to the thought of mud huts, bare hands and rudimentary methods but the times long past, when this was the norm, are not an indication of how things are in this day and age. Yes, some processes such as heat-treating and finishing are done in so-called mud huts and outdoors under makeshifts structures (this is much needed for ventilation) however the actual workshops are almost always in brick structures and the gunsmiths utilize milling machines, CNC machines and other tools to make their products. Yes, they do use basic tools but those are used to fit and finish the firearm and not to actually manufacture or produce it.</p>

<p>A negative misconception in regards to the firearms produced is the thought that they aren’t heat-treated or are of poor quality. This isn’t true for the most part as they do go through a heat-treating process, however the detractor is that the method of heat-treating leaves a lot to be desired, especially in the cheaper copies. Many users of lower quality copies complain of metal warping and deformation causing a firearm to become inoperable or dangerous to use, this is what leads to people surmising that all arms made in such areas are no good. This is an issue for lower quality copies, a lower quality firearm will have its flaws as it is not built using quality material and to the same tolerances as a firearm made to exact specs with all care taken in production. At the end of the day, you must repeat the same phrase to people who ask why a cheap item is no good; you get what you pay for – if you want a cheap item, you will get a cheap item that will end up having issues or breaking much like any cheap thing you buy.</p>
<p>Moving away from the negatives, let us talk about positives. Apart from the exquisite food that the food gurus cook up there, <em>Darra</em> is also famous for some of the firearms designs to come out of its shops – most notable is the infamous AKMSU which resides in the Royal Armouries, Leeds, UK. Even though that particular firearm could have been made elsewhere in FATA or <em>Afghanistan</em> by a number of other gunsmiths, it has been linked to <em>Darra</em> due to the town being the main source of arms for sale and the similar types of AK designed copies/modifications known to have come out of there. I could list an almost infinite number of firearms designs displaying their know-how such as the modified SKS made to resemble an AK, or the well-known 8mm bolt-action faux AK and even the more recent AK M4geries. Forget all of those firearms, the gunsmiths themselves are the ones to keep this market and tradition alive, it’s them you have to appreciate as without them there would be more-or-less nothing left of the industry. The ingenuity and skill they have has made <em>Darra</em> a household name throughout the region and extending to much of the world, even to those who are not versed on firearms.</p>

<p><em>Darra</em> has managed to stand against the tide of time and change in an increasingly connected world and holds its own against all odds but has still found a way to use newer technologies and retain its own methods &amp; procedures of manufacturing in its regular business. Even with all that, there is now news that changes things, FATA and Darra with it, will finally be incorporated into the neighboring <em>KPK</em> (<em>Khyber</em> <em>Pakhtunkhwa</em>) province of <em>Pakistan</em>. Regrettably, this means that their own tribal laws will now be abolished and government/regional laws and regulations will be implemented in its place there. The whole town’s industry will be made to register for licenses in either manufacturing or dealing sectors or be shut down. It is said that they will have easier access to raw materials and the costs of business will hopefully decrease, this is something that we can only hope does not destroy this historic industry. <em>Darra</em> will move into the new age with much newer equipment and tooling plus workshops and industrial estates that are planned to be built there and in other places with support of the current federal government of <em>Pakistan</em>. It is planned that arms manufactured there will be available to international markets via some …</p></div></div></div></div></div></article></div>

        <p>Design is a broad topic. This post won’t approach the adjective qualifying a style with simple forms and a pure appearance. No. Design is broader than a sleek car or an harmonious living room.</p>

<p>Design is a creative activity that aims to invent, improve and solve problems. Life is full of them, in various domains, which pushes people to eventually become a designer of something. Whether you’re conceiving a recipe, an apartment layout, a software or a rocket you are designing. By learning the fundamentals, you will arm yourself for various situations. Here is a list of the best pragmatic principles I’ve learned to better design. In spite of their obviousness and renown, my experience has shown me that some of these principles are often forgotten.</p>

<p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: In english, <em>to design</em> means both <em>to draw</em> and <em>to conceive according to a plan</em>. Similarly in French, the word <em>dessin</em> (a drawing) derives its etymology from the word <em>dessein</em> (have the intention).</p>

<h2 id="incremental-improvement">Incremental improvement</h2>

<p>Believing you can do it right the first time is naive at best, pretentious at worst. <strong>You will fail and have to accept it</strong>. Do not postpone but instead <strong>release fast</strong>, get feedback early and iterate to make it better. You will find many references, notably on Lean Startup, DevOps culture or Site Reliability Engineering, which encourage <strong>a quick redesign capability rather than a perfect design at the first place</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To write clean code, you must first write dirty code and then clean it. […]
Learning to write clean code is hard work. It requires more than just the knowledge of principles and patterns. You must sweat over it. You must practice it yourself, and watch yourself fail. Robert C. Martin — Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="reuse-what-exists">Reuse what exists</h2>

<p>It is unlikely that the problem you face is fundamentally new. Before making any effort, look for <strong>existing solutions</strong> or proven practices. <strong>Be humble</strong> and accept you can’t compete with years of expertise on a subject. If so, the motivation to develop the new model must come from reaching the limits of the previous one. In software engineering for instance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern">design patterns</a> are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.</p>

<p>Don’t limit yourself to the area of the original problem, sometimes a similar problem has been found and solved long before in <strong>a different field</strong>. Learn about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_theory">queuing theory</a> will help you to write an operating system scheduler as well as being frustrated in a supermarket queue. Solutions come from fields of experiences and theories that you would not necessarily expect.</p>

<h2 id="five-whys">Five whys</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys">Five whys technique</a>, originally developed by Toyota, has been mostly used for exploring the root cause of a defect in a system. It involves asking the relevant question starting with a why in order to find the source which cause the failure. Adapt this technique to find out what really matter in our design. For example, “<em>We need a program which exports our documentation to PDF</em>”:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Why? - So the export can go on the website.</li>
  <li>Why? - Because our customers has to read it.</li>
  <li>Why? - Because they require it to maintain the software.</li>
  <li>Why (don’t they have access to the documentation like everyone else)? - Because they haven’t been integrated into our platform.</li>
  <li>Why? Because they have never been on-board on the platform.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Decision</strong>: instead of developing a complex program which exports PDF, write a simple on-boarding guide for the customers.</p>

<p>This situation often occurs when the given requirement includes the design. Before answering the question <em>“How do we do it?”</em> directly, the first and most important step is to remember “<em>Why do we do it?</em>”. Once you have understood the <strong>root reasons</strong> and constraints for the requirement, it clears the path on how to get there and can <strong>prevent</strong> you from taking <strong>very long detours</strong> in addition to <strong>simplifying</strong> the design.</p>

<h2 id="keep-it-simple-stupid">Keep it simple stupid</h2>

<p><strong>Resolve problems, don’t create them</strong>. You should be suspicious of providing a solution that makes the overall system more complicated than before. Remember: You’ll have to maintain everything you build, so you’d better build as little and simply as possible.</p>

<p>Simple designs are easy to <strong>learn</strong>, easy to <strong>teach</strong>, easy to <strong>use</strong> and therefore easily <strong>appeal</strong> to customers. It forces the design to be intuitive and obvious, reducing the learning curve and facilitates the adoption. Like Denis Diderot says in Pensées sur l’interprétation de la nature:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These books [of Sthal and Newton] were just waiting to be heard, to be valued for what they were worth; and it would not have cost their authors more than a month to make them clear; that month would have spared three years of labor and exhaustion to a thousand good spirits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what is a simple design? In the <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/simplicity/">Simplicity chapter of the Site Reliability Engineering</a> book of Google, they mention a great quote from the French poet Antoine de Saint Exupery about perfection which could fit very well with simplicity:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer more to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away - A. de Saint Exupéry, Terre des Hommes</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="perfect-is-the-enemy-of-good-enough">Perfect is the enemy of good enough</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.pinterest.de/pin/397724210839705109/"><img src="https://reflexio.debec.eu/assets/moka-pot.svg" alt="moka"></a></p>

<p>The moka coffee maker may not produce perfect coffee, but it requires so little maintenance compared to a large coffee machine with radiators, pipes, grinder, etc. that it makes the compromise “complexity / coffee taste” great.</p>

<p>Remember the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto principle</a>: in general <strong>80% of a things can be done in 20%</strong> of the total allocated time. Conversely, the hardest <strong>20% left takes 80%</strong> of the time. Perfection requires infinite time and energy. This is impossible and therefore should not be part of your design.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Beware of the perfection pitfall and design your architecture only as good as necessary and not as good as ultimate possible. - Ralf S. Engelschall</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="postpone-complexity">Postpone complexity</h2>

<p>Simplicity and incremental improvement principles give birth to a another principle: <strong>Postpone complexity</strong>. Complexity lies in early optimization, as Donald E. Knuth points out in his article <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/361604.361612?download=true">Computer Programming as Art</a> with “<em>premature optimization is the root of all evil</em>”. Focus on designing something that works instead of something finely tune that does not.</p>

<p>Complexity lies also in early generalization. Focus on designing something that works in a single use case rather than something that will not work in many. When designing a coffee machine, first design something that makes a simple black coffee. If you plan ahead to include all extra options for latte, cappuccino or irish coffee you will end up not making a simple back coffee. As elegantly summarized by Ralf S. Engelschall: “<em>Use before reuse</em>”.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Do you think there’s a principle missing? Send me your comments! This list will certainly be extended and refined, subscribe to the <a data-formkit-toggle="78a863d4eb" href="https://reflexio-debec.ck.page/78a863d4eb">newsletter</a> if you wish to be notified about it. In the meantime, how are you going to ensure that you do not forget to implement the principles you have just learned?</p>

    <h3>PDP 11/70 Emulator - v3.1 August 2020</h3>
    <p>
      This emulator came about because years ago I was a programmer for RSTS/E on a PDP 11/45 and had admired the console idle loop light pattern - but I couldn't quite remember how it looked. Given the unavailability of real systems it became time to write
      an emulator!
    </p>
    <p>
      I was going to start with a PDP 11/45 emulator but the extra memory of a PDP 11/70 became far too attractive (a whole 4MB!). It took some time before I finally produced a
      <a href="https://skn.noip.me/pdp11/pdp11-45.html">PDP 11/45</a> version.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have met my core objective - I can now see the RSTS/E console light pattern that I was looking for, and found that newer versions (eg v9.6) have a different light pattern. Also I have now seen some of the light patterns for other OSes. RSX and BSD 2.11
      have their own different patterns and Unix V5 and Ultrix operate with absolute minimum light movement (I'm assuming they operates mostly in WAIT mode).
    </p>
    <p>
      Getting all of the operating systems used here presents its own set of challenges - one of which is finding the software in the first place. But one of the most interesting was RSTS/E V06C which has its own
      <a href="https://skn.noip.me/pdp11/RSTSv06c.html">story</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: The boot code in this emulator is a custom PDP 11 program running with it's own set of light patterns. It is initially loaded at address 140000 and has a LIGHTS command which operates by mapping and executing a WAIT instruction from a pattern of virtual addresses located in Supervisor
      mode. You can also use the BOOT command to start one of the guest operating systems listed below, or the ODT command to start a version of the Octal Debugging Tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      However boot code like this was not part of early PDP 11s. These systems had no BIOS or other software to help get the bare metal started. If you were lucky perhaps the previous boot code would still be intact in non-volatile magnetic core memory, but in general booting the system required toggling in a small bootstrap loader from the front panel. There are listings of bootstrap loaders for various devices
      <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/psychology/pdp-11/bootstraps.html">here</a>.
      If you are a purist don't use the boot code! Instead find the bootstrap code for the device you want to boot from and toggle it in through the switches. However be warned - the boot program will not work unless toggled in perfectly which often takes a few goes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is an example of the switch commands for booting from an RK05 where the value at address 1002 selects the unit number (rk0, rk1, rk2, etc). Goodluck!
    </p>

      If you wish to toggle in a simple light chaser to the front panel then here are some switch commands which can be used:
    </p>
    <pre><b>

                            HALT, 001000, LOAD ADDRESS

                            001000, LOAD ADDRESS, ENABLE, START
</pre>
To restart the initial boot code (if it has not been overwritten) use the switch commands:
    <pre>HALT, 140000, LOAD ADDRESS, ENABLE, START
</pre>
    <p>
      If you plan to run the emulator repeatedly or for a project, consider downloading the emulator to your own machine or server.
      This will <b>significantly</b> speed any of the emulator disk accesses and response times. All files and emulator OS
      disks can be found in the top level folder of
      <b><a href="https://skn.noip.me/pdp11/">http://skn.noip.me/pdp11/</a></b> or in the zip file
      <b><a href="https://skn.noip.me/pdp11/pdp11.zip">pdp11.zip</a></b> Please note that browser security
      policy may prevent local emulator pages from booting disk images so please read the information in <b>StartChrome.cmd</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are interested in how the emulator works then you can browse the source files on
      <b><a href="https://github.com/paulnank/nankervis-pdp11-js">Github</a></b>.
      The main Javascript files are pdp11.js, fpp.js and iopage.js
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many PDP emulators out there and I have never seen what I consider to be a complete list. Some of the really interesting ones can be found by googling terms such as "vhdl pdp 11". However the gold standard is SIMH at
      <a href="http://simh.trailing-edge.com/">Trailing Edge</a>.
      A different approach to Javascript PDP 11 emulation can be found at
      <a href="http://www.pcjs.org/devices/pdp11/">www.pcjs.org</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe that the first PDP 11 emulator would be SIM-11 written in FORTRAN before the first PDP 11/20 hardware was even built - see
      <a href="http://www.hampage.hu/pdp-11/birth.html"> How the PDP-11 Was Born</a>. There is more PDP 11 history at
      <a href="http://www.hampage.hu/pdp-11/main.html">www.hampage.hu</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course if you want your own PDP 11/70 front panel you might consider a
      <a href="http://obsolescence.wixsite.com/obsolescence/pidp-11">PiDP-11</a>.

      Happy emulating!
