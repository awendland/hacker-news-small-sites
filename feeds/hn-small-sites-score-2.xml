September 9, 2020 | https://bighack.org/5-most-annoying-website-features-i-face-as-a-blind-screen-reader-user-accessibility/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bighack.org/5-most-annoying-website-features-i-face-as-a-blind-screen-reader-user-accessibility/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span>These are the five most annoying inaccessible web elements I face as a blind screen reader user every day, and how to fix them.
</span>
					</p><div>
						<p><span>For blind and visually impaired people like me, accessibility is the difference between us being able to use a website and clicking off it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2>How screen readers work</h2>
<p><span>Screen readers allow blind and visually impaired people to use computers, phones and tablets independently. Most screen readers use software, and a Text To Speech (TTS) engine, which is what converts the text from the screen reader into speech. Screen readers convert the text displayed on screen into a format that blind users can process.</span></p>
<p><span>Screen readers read out loud everything that’s on the screen and allow people to navigate using touch gestures and shortcut keys. They also work with other output devices such as a braille display.</span></p>
<p><span>As a screen reader user, here are the most common issues I encounter on a daily basis.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2>Unlabelled links and buttons</h2>
<p><span>Screen reader users rely on links and buttons to navigate around a website and to find the information we need. If links and buttons are not labelled correctly or if at all, then it makes it difficult for screen reader users to find the information they need. Ultimately, unlabelled links make it much harder to navigate the website easily, quickly and independently.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, when linking to an about page, ‘click here’ doesn’t give any clue as to where it leads to, but ‘find out more about who we are’ is clear.</span></p>
<p><span>If links and buttons are labelled correctly, screen readers can read the label out loud. It means that blind and visually impaired people don’t have to press the link or button without knowing where it will take them.</span></p>
<p><span>As well as unlabelled elements, links and buttons that do not have a clear description are also really frustrating. They must have a clear description of where they will lead to when pressed, rather than ‘click here’. Never make your users guess where a link will take them or force them into a trial-and-error situation. This makes for tedious user experience.</span></p>
<h2>No image descriptions</h2>
<p><span>This is probably the most common issue I encounter when browsing the web.&nbsp;</span><span>Using image descriptions is essential for accessibility. Image descriptions are also known as alt text (alternative text) which is a written description of an image.</span></p>
<p><span>Screen readers read image descriptions out loud. This means that blind and visually impaired people can understand the content of the image in an accessible way.&nbsp;</span><span>If images do not have alt text, then screen readers will simply say “image” or “graphic” which gives no context or meaning.</span></p>
<p><span>Images often convey valuable information. It’s therefore important that people with a visual impairment can access this information as well.&nbsp;</span><span>Alt text should be clearly written and give an accurate description of the image.</span></p>
<p><strong>Check out <a href="https://bighack.org/how-to-write-better-alt-text-descriptions-for-accessibility/">our tips for writing better alt text</a> to ensure your images are fully accessible.</strong></p>
<h2>Poor use of headings</h2>
<p><span>For quick and easy navigation, many screen reader users navigate using various elements on the page such as headings. They are a great way to find the information we need quickly and effectively. Especially when they follow a logical heading structure with H1s, H2s and H3s helping to prioritise the content.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x.jpg" alt="Logical heading structure begins with Heading 1, with Heading 2 sitting beneath heading 1. Heading 3 sits within heading 2 and so on." width="1958" height="1236" srcset="https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x.jpg 1958w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-300x189.jpg 300w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-768x485.jpg 768w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-1536x970.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1958px) 100vw, 1958px" data-srcset="https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x.jpg 1958w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-300x189.jpg 300w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-768x485.jpg 768w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-1536x970.jpg 1536w" data-src="https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></p>
<p><span>If websites don’t use headings, it means screen reader users are unable to use the keyboard shortcuts to navigate through the webpage this way. If that’s the case, we have to resort to tabbing or arrowing through a long web page to find the information we need.</span></p>
<p>Headings also help to break up the web content visually and improve readability. Other elements that screen reader users use to navigate webpages include links, lists or landmarks.</p>
<h2>Inaccessible web forms</h2>
<p><span>Most websites use forms in one way or another. Whether it’s to help you search for a product or to get in touch through a contact form. However, when these forms are not labelled, or not labelled correctly, it means we cannot use them.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, if a search box is not labelled, it means screen reader users have no idea of the purpose of that box. It means people who use screen readers cannot access the same functionality.</span></p>
<p><span>Contact forms are an effective way for customers to get in touch with your brand or business. And as a screen reader user, there’s nothing more frustrating than these forms being labelled incorrectly.</span></p>
<p><span>Especially CAPTCHA checkout requirements. Without an option to hear the audio, it’s not accessible. It means we are unable to fill in the form independently. I often have to enlist help from a sighted person, but this isn’t possible for everyone.</span><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<h2>Auto-playing audio and video</h2>
<p><span>Most people will know how annoying it is to load a web page with noisy adverts that start playing suddenly. But for screen reader users, it can be even more alarming. When video or audio starts playing automatically, it can drown out the voice of the screen reader. This makes it harder to find the pause or stop buttons.</span></p>
<p><span>(And if these buttons are unlabelled, then it’s practically impossible for me to stop the video quickly which causes extra frustration.) If I’m unable to stop the sound or video, I normally click off.</span></p>
<p><span>The solution? Make sure there’s no auto-playing video or audio when your website loads. If you really want to use video, make sure the audio is muted and the user can pause, stop or hide the media player.</span></p>
<p><span>These issues may seem small to sighted users. But they’re the difference between me being able to use a website independently or not. And they make a huge difference when implemented correctly.</span></p>

08 September 2020
</p>
<p>In the information security field, we have developed lots of thoughts that can’t be discussed (or rarely discussed):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Never roll your own crypto</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always use TLS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security by obscurity is bad</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And goes like this. Most of them are very generally correct. However, I started to think that people are telling those because everyone is telling them. And, most of the people are actually not thinking about exceptional cases. In this post, I will raise my objection against the idea of “Security by obscurity is bad”.</p>
<h2 id="risk-defense-in-depth-and-swiss-cheese">Risk, Defense in Depth and Swiss Cheese</h2>
<p>One of the main goal of defensive security is reducing the risk for the target business. According to the OWASP’s methodology, the risk of an issue is calculated with the formula below:</p>
<p><code>Risk = Likelihood * Impact</code></p>

<p>According to this formula, a Remote Code Execution issue poses more risk than a Cross Site Scripting one since the RCE causes more impact. This is easy. But what about the likelihood metric. According to the OWASP, likelihood refers that:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>At the highest level, this is a rough measure of how likely this particular vulnerability is to be uncovered and exploited by an attacker
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>So, if we can reduce the likelihood, we can reduce the overall risk. That’s good. It’s actually very similar to a very common idea called “Defense in Depth”. It’s also referred as “Swiss Cheese Model”</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Swiss_cheese_model.svg" alt="Swiss Cheese"></p>
<p>According to this model, you need to build your defense mechanisms in a layered model so that even the attackers pass the first one, they will get caught on the others.</p>
<h2 id="security-by-obscurity">Security by Obscurity</h2>
<p>So let’s talk about security by obscurity. It’s a bad idea to use it as a single layer of defense. If the attacker passes it, there is nothing else to protect you. But it’s actually would be good to use it as an “additional” layer of defense. Because it has a low implementation cost and it usually works well.</p>
<p>Let’s think about a couple of scenarios here:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a server that runs the SSH with it’s default port <code>22</code> and my credentials are: <code>root:123456</code>. What is the likelihood of being compromised?</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s almost 100% since the hackers are conducting brute force attacks to the services with common credentials globally.</p>
<ul>
<li>SSH runs in port <code>22</code> and my credentials are <code>utku:123456</code>. What is the likelihood of being compromised?</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, we have eliminated the global brute forcers since we are not using a common username. The likelihood and risk are reduced. However, we still have to deal with targeted attackers. A targeted attacker can guess the username as <code>utku</code> since it’s my name.</p>
<ul>
<li>SSH runs in port <code>64323</code> and my credentials are <code>utku:123456</code>. What is the likelihood of being compromised?</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we changed the default port number. Does it help? Firstly, we’ve eliminated the global brute forcers again since they scan only the common ports. What about the others? To find this out, I did a small survey on my Twitter to find out people’s port scan behaviors.</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I'm trying to prove a point for my new article. I need your answers for the question below. (please be honest)</p><p>-When you do a port scan with nmap to find open ports on the target, are you specify a custom port range to scan all 65,535 ports? (with -p0-65535 parameter)</p></div>— Utku Şen (@utkusen) <a href="https://twitter.com/utkusen/status/1303021175556145154?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 7, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>As you can see here, lots of people tend to scan the default/most popular ports only. So, if you switch your port from 22 to 64323, you will eliminate some of them. You will reduce the likelihood and risk.</p>
<p>The same thing goes for software vulnerabilities as well. If a vulnerability found in the Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol, everybody will scan for the port 3389 globally. You can reduce your risk just by changing the default port.</p>
<h2 id="other-applications">Other Applications</h2>
<p>Of course, it’s possible to use the same methodology in other fields other than changing the defaults. For example, the following ideas might be a good idea for some specific cases (not always)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Obfuscating codes:</strong> Of course, it’s common knowledge. Hackers are people too. If you obfuscate your code well, they will need to spend more time to find issues. They may give up eventually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Using random variable names for a web application:</strong> Instead of using clear variable names, you can switch them with random strings. It might help just like the code obfuscation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Using Symmetric Encryption in the Database:</strong> When you write data to the database, use a function like <code>encryption_algorithm(data,key)</code>. Likewise, when you read data, use a function like <code>decryption_algorithm(data,key)</code>. If the attacker can read your backend code, obviously he/she can decrypt your database. But if there is an issue that allows an attacker to read data from the database, but not the backend code (like SQL Injection), the gathered data won’t be helpful for the attacker.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="real-life-applications">Real Life Applications</h2>
<p>Security by obscurity is widely used in physical/real-life security. For example, the president goes from point A to point B with his 30 cars convoy. But he’s not sitting on his own presidential car so that the attacker won’t target him easily. He can be in any car and it reduces the risk of an attack.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/06/04/00/14330600-0-image-a-38_1559605545988.jpg" alt="President"></p>
<p>Camouflaged animals are using security by obscurity as well. Obscurity reduces the likelihood of being killed. Therefore, they gained this ability in the evolutionary process.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uuuploads/animal-camouflage/animal-camouflage-4.jpg" alt="Animal"></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Security by obscurity is not enough by itself. You should always enforce the best practices. However, if you can reduce the risk with zero cost, you should do that. Obscurity is a good layer of security.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>A physicist loses half the value of their physics knowledge in just four years whereas
an English professor would take over 25 years to lose half the value of the
knowledge they had at the beginning of their career [1]. These estimates are
taken form a paper written in 1982 so software engineers obviously weren’t
included. But it begs the question… What would the half-life of the value of a
software engineer’s knowledge be? I suspect it’s somewhere between the physicist’s
and the English professor’s because a software engineer’s knowledge is a combination
of eternal computer science/engineering principles and ephemeral technologies that
drift in and out of popularity over time.</p>

<h2 id="knowledge-that-doesnt-expire">Knowledge that doesn’t expire</h2>
<p>Software engineers with a traditional computer science background learn things
that never expire with age: data structures, algorithms, compilers,
distributed systems, etc. But most of us don’t work with these concepts
directly. Abstractions and frameworks are built on top of these well studied
ideas so we don’t have to get into the nitty-gritty details on the job
(at least most of the time). Examples are the C++ standard library which
implements optimized sorting for arrays, and Apache Spark which provides fault
tolerant cluster computing out of the box.</p>

<h2 id="knowledge-that-does-expire">Knowledge that does expire</h2>
<p>The unavoidable ephemeral knowledge one accumulates during their career comes in
many forms and this isn’t an exhaustive list:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A vogue framework or programming paradigm that falls out of favor in a couple of years.</li>
  <li>Domain knowledge in a rapidly evolving industry/field.</li>
  <li>Knowledge of proprietry technology: e.g. internal tools at your company.</li>
</ol>

<p>Knowledge of this kind can quickly transition from zealous adoption to every company who
uses said knowledge trying to sunset everything they’ve built with it.</p>

<h2 id="my-experience">My Experience</h2>
<p>I’m inclined to say I use ephemeral knowledge more than eternal knowledge to perform
my job. And then there’s the added pressure in our industry of always having to learn
new and useful things.</p>

<p>A theoretical physicist who spends a great deal of time mastering a theory and
the mathematical techniques behind it, only to see that theory rendered obsolete
by a new and improved theory several years later, is analogous to a software
engineer who spends a great deal of time mastering a web development framework,
learning its intricacies and gotcha’s, only to see that framework rendered
obsolete by a new framework several years later, leaving no more demand for
that knowledge in the labor market.</p>

<p>I relate to the physicist more than the English professor. What do you think?</p>

Since its inception back at the start of the century, the demand for this medium-sized, energy and space-efficient, the memory storage device has been growing at a fast rate. Therefore, to meet the market requirements, the SDA was set up as a non-profit organization to promote and create SD Card standards. There are various topics related to the SD card such as the different device families, speed classes, smart cards, card security and so on and it is used in various markets like digital cameras, personal computers, and embedded systems. Some of the standard variations include SD, SDHC, SDXC, SD-ultra high speed etc. The microSD is the miniaturized SD memory card format with a small form factor and is widely used in various electronic devices.<br>
What we are going to learn is the use of SD cards in an embedded system. To be specific, we will be dealing with the use of SD cards in small embedded systems.</p><h2>Circuit&nbsp;and Interfacing</h2><p>SD card has a native host interface apart from the SPI mode for communicating with master devices. The native interface uses four lines for data transfer where the microcontroller has SD card controller module and it needs separate license to use it. Since the SPI is a widely used protocol and it is available in most low-cost microcontrollers, the SPI mode is the widely used interface in low cost embedded systems. The working voltage range of SD family is 2.7V to 3.6V and this is indicated in the operation condition register (OCR).</p><p><img src="https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2000px-SD_Pins.svg_-1.png" alt="2000px-sd_pins-svg" width="214" height="292"></p><div id="attachment_2345"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2345" src="https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card.png" alt="sd-card" width="371" height="229" srcset="https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-200x124.png 200w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-300x185.png 300w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-400x247.png 400w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-600x371.png 600w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-768x475.png 768w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-800x495.png 800w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px"><p id="caption-attachment-2345">SD Card pinout</p></div><div id="attachment_2347"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2347" src="https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-2.png" alt="sd-card-2" width="381" height="213" srcset="https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-2-200x112.png 200w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-2-300x168.png 300w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-2-400x223.png 400w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-2-600x335.png 600w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-2-768x429.png 768w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-2-800x447.png 800w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-2.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px"><p id="caption-attachment-2347">MicroSD Card pinout</p></div><p>Most micro-controllers use the SPI communication protocol to interface with the SD cards. The SD cards have a microcontroller that shows their availability to the master controller(microcontroller). The micro-controller sees the SD card as an addressable sector on which read/write functions are possible. Once the microcontroller is in the SPI mode, communication between the master and the slave is done via 4 pins viz. clock, chip select, data in and data out. It should be kept in mind that throughout the communication between the two devices, the micro-controller will be sending out the clock.<br>
Most development boards have a dedicated SD card slot. But to understand the connections, let us analyze this fairly simple circuit.</p><div id="openl-1450463586"><div data-animationoffset="100%"><div><div data-link="https://openlabpro.com/online-courses/pic-microcontroller/" data-link-target="_self" data-animationoffset="100%"><div>From the very basic I/O control to the advaced SD Card interfacing, this course covers what you need to get started in Embedded Systems.<div><div><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/362065141?autoplay=0&amp;autopause=0" width="600" height="360" allowfullscreen="" title="vimeo362065141" allow="autoplay; fullscreen"></iframe></div></div></div><a href="https://openlabpro.com/online-courses/pic-microcontroller/" target="_self">Learn more about the course</a></div></div></div></div><h3>Circuit</h3><p><img src="https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-circuit.png" alt="sd-card-circuit" width="506" height="284" srcset="https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-circuit-200x113.png 200w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-circuit-300x169.png 300w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-circuit-400x225.png 400w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-circuit-600x338.png 600w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-circuit-768x432.png 768w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-circuit-800x450.png 800w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-circuit-1024x576.png 1024w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-circuit-1200x675.png 1200w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-circuit.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px"></p><p>If the logic level of the microcontroller is different than the SD card, level shifter needs to be used for converting the line voltages.<br>
The MISO (master in serial out) pin should be connected to the SDI (serial data in) pin on the microcontroller.<br>
The MOSI (master out serial in) pin should be connected to the SDO (serial data out) pin on the microcontroller.<br>
The SCK (serial clock) pin should be connected to the SCK (serial clock) pin on the microcontroller.<br>
The CS (chip select) pin should be connected to the corresponding CS pin on the microcontroller or on any digital I/O pin on the microcontroller. A common ground is provided.</p><p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b>: While connecting the power supply, make sure that the supply is drawn from a 3.3V supply as a 5V supply would see your card go up in smoke.</p><h3>Interfacing</h3><p>Once the connections are set up, we are ready to interface our hardware with the software.<br>
Set the directions of each of the four pins correctly. While activating the SPI mode, an ideal configuration should be, mode(0,0) and the phase with input sampled at the middle of data out. Also, the clock frequency should be set in the range of 100 kHz and 400 kHz prior to initializing the card. Once the initialization is done, the clock can be set to a more desired frequency.</p><h2>SD Commands</h2><p>Next comes the tricky part, initializing the SD card and performing the raw data communication. A systematic approach to programming the software would make the task pretty easy.<br>
But first, it is important to learn how the micro-controller activates the SD card. There are a fixed set of commands and responses, which must be followed to create a command to response structure in our program. The data is transmitted in a byte-oriented format with a definite length.<br>
The following table shows the necessary<b> commands</b> to the card and the corresponding response from the card.</p><p><img src="https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-3.png" alt="sd-card-3" width="507" height="1118" srcset="https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-3-136x300.png 136w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-3-200x441.png 200w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-3-400x882.png 400w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-3-464x1024.png 464w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-3-600x1323.png 600w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-3-768x1694.png 768w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-3-800x1765.png 800w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-3-1200x2647.png 1200w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-3.png 1274w" sizes="(max-width: 507px) 100vw, 507px"></p><p>Every command has a constant length of 6 bytes.<br>
The first byte is the addition of the command number and the number 64.<br>
<b>Example</b>:<br>
For CMD0: command number 0 + 64 = 64 = 0x40 in hexadecimal.<br>
For CMD1: command number 1 + 64 = 65 = 0x41 in hexadecimal.<br>
And so on.<br>
This is followed by a set of four bytes which are known as the arguments. These arguments usually contain the address of a data or the length of a block.<br>
The last byte is the CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) Byte. Most commands in the SPI mode does not require a check byte if the CRC feature isn’t enabled. For some commands like CMD0, the CRC is 0x95 and in most cases, a 0xFF is sent. Enabling the CRC requires you to send the correct check byte from the micro-controller. So, ensure whether the CRC feature is enabled or disabled.<br>
A <b>command frame</b> looks like this-</p><p><img src="https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Clr_frame1-800x267.png" alt="Interfacing Microcontrollers with SD Card - Command frame" width="800" height="267" srcset="https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Clr_frame1-200x67.png 200w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Clr_frame1-300x100.png 300w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Clr_frame1-400x133.png 400w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Clr_frame1-600x200.png 600w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Clr_frame1-768x256.png 768w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Clr_frame1-800x267.png 800w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Clr_frame1-1024x342.png 1024w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Clr_frame1-1200x400.png 1200w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Clr_frame1.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p><p>The card will receive a command when the DO pin (Data Out) is driven high as shown above. The CS pin (Chip Select) must be driven high to low before sending the command and must be kept low during the process. The time between a command and its response is known as the command response time (NCR). As mentioned earlier, regarding the clock pulses from the micro-controller, the corresponding response byte sent back from the card to the microcontroller should be driven by the serial clock pulses of the micro-controller. There is a chance that the response byte from the card might get skipped by the microcontroller due to the absence of a driving clock pulse. Hence it is necessary to make sure that an 8-Bit clock pulse is sent to the Card soon after the Command Frame is sent (Refer the <b>TECHNICAL NOTE </b>below). Also while receiving a Byte from the card, the DI pin (Data In) must be driven high.</p><p>Furthermore, let us analyze the different<b> types of responses</b> that we get from the card and what they mean.</p><p><img src="https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Response_Color-1.jpg" alt="response_color" width="568" height="289"></p><p>An R1 response, 0x01 means that the command sent prior to the response has resulted in the card going into an idle state.<br>
A response byte 0x00 means that the command has been accepted and the card will be waiting for the proposed event to take place. If any other bits in an R1 response is set, it is the result of an error and it’ll be down to the factor mentioned in each R1 response bit in the figure.</p><h2>Initializing&nbsp;the SD Card</h2><p>Now, as far as sending the commands are concerned, there is an order in which they must be sent. Only the commands, CMD0, CMD1, ACMD41, CMD58 and CMD59 will be accepted when the card is in its idle state. Sending any other command will likely to yield an illegal response.</p><p><b>TECHNICAL NOTE</b>: After interfacing the card, the micro-controller must always send a set of bytes, which we will refer to as dummy bytes. One dummy byte is 0xFF. These dummy bytes have a simple yet significant purpose. Prior to the initialization, the card must know the frequency at which the data is being sent. By sending around 75 dummy bits approximately (dummy byte * 10 times = 80 bits), the card will be ready for communication. Also even after every command is sent, it is a good practice to send at least one dummy byte. A logical explanation for this is that communication is driven by the clock pulse of the micro-controller. The clock pulse is sent only when the data buffer is filled. After every response is sent and prior to the next command or between command and response, the SCK will stop generating pulses due to an empty data buffer. To ensure the continual transmission of clock pulses between every command, fill the data buffer with a junk value such as a dummy byte. To create a dummy byte function with the number of loops as the argument.</p><p>The<b> first command</b> to be sent to the card is the <b>CMD0</b> command. The structure of every other command-response should be based on this model.</p><ul><li>Drive the DO pin high.</li><li>Drive the CS pin from high to low.</li><li>Send a dummy byte.</li><li>Then send the following 6-byte command continuously<br>
First byte: 0x40<br>
Next four bytes: 0x00000000<br>
CRC byte: 0x95</li></ul><ul><li>Send another dummy byte or as many as required, to generate the SCK giving time for the SD card to respond to the command request.</li><li>Wait for the receive flag bit to set and then read the response from the SD card or create a loop to read the response a few number of times. The response should reach back within the command to response (Ncr) time. Or else, something must be wrong.</li></ul><ul><li>The desired response is 0x01, meaning the card is in the idle state and we are good to go.</li></ul><p>Send the <b>CMD8</b> command next to check the version of your SD card.<br>
The difference in the 6-byte commands are<br>
First byte: 0x48<br>
Next four bytes: 0x000001AA<br>
CRC byte: 0x87</p><p>We are looking for two possibilities in our response byte. Either 0x01 or 0x05.</p><p>A 0x01 response means that you have a version 2 SD card. The 0x01 response is followed by the 4 bytes 0x00, 0x00, 0x01, 0xAA in the order of their transmission from the SD card which is, in fact, the argument you send in your command.</p><p>If the response is 0x05, it means the card is a version 1 or an MMC card. If the card is actually a version 2 SD card, then this response is the result of an illegal command. Also, the card is now in the idle state.</p><p>Once the above two commands (CMD0 and CMD8) are done, it is safe to say that our SD Card is working in good condition and ready for data Read/Write.<br>
Additionally, just to ensure whether the SD Card is functioning in the correct working voltage, send the <b>CMD58</b> Command.</p><p>Next, we must initiate the i<b>nitialization</b> process. For this send a <b>CMD1</b> command and wait for response 0x00, meaning the idle state bit is cleared.<br>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Several times in my career, I’ve joined a team whose work was already well
under way, where I had a massive knowledge deficit, and didn’t have
pre-existing relationships. None of those excuses relieved me from the pressure
I felt to establish myself and contribute. Over time, I realized that the
natural instinct to push for early impact leads many incoming leaders into
challenging relationships as they expose their knowledge deficit and waste
time. So, I developed an algorithm that has helped me ramp up quickly — and
in several cases — have an impact in a relatively short period of time, while
minimizing collateral damage.</p>
<p>The first step is to find someone on the team and ask for 30 minutes with them.
In that meeting you have a simple agenda:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the first 25 minutes: ask them to tell you everything they think you
should know. Take copious notes. Only stop them to ask about things you don’t
understand. Always stop them to ask about things you don’t understand.</li>
<li>For the next 3 minutes: ask about the biggest challenges the team has right
now.</li>
<li>In the final 2 minutes: ask who else you should talk to. Write down every
name they give you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Repeat the above process for every name you’re given. Don’t stop until there
are no new names.</p>
<p>The sum of the answers from the first 25 mins will not give you a complete
picture of the team’s work. That will take months to develop. But they will
give you a framework for integrating new information more quickly, which will
speed up how fast you ramp. It will also heavily over index on the areas of
work under active discussion, which will help you dive in productively to the
most critical discussions immediately. The nature of what people choose to
discuss is a very valuable signal about the problems the team face, as it may
be about the work, the organization, or process. Finally, it will give you a
sense of the language and terminology that can very often be a barrier to
working smoothly with teams.</p>
<p>The answers from the second question give you a cheat sheet on how to impress
the team with early positive impact. Some of the things you’ll hear will take
time to fix, such as “we need a bigger team” or “our infrastructure isn’t
scaling.” Those are important and it will be good for the team to hear you
internalize those challenges. But a surprising number of the issues you’ll
hear repeatedly will be things you can easily help with, like “we waste a
bunch of time in meetings every week” or “we need a dedicated conference
room.” I start with the latter as quickly as I can because those are the
types of things teams often neglect to prioritize, in spite of a compounding
negative impact on progress.</p>
<p>The third question will give you a valuable map of influence in the
organization. The more often names show up and the context in which they show
up tends to provide a very different map of
the organization than the one in the <a href="http://boz.com/articles/damn-the-org-chart.html">org chart</a>.</p>
<p>For all the value I just described, the greatest value in this process isn’t
in the answers — it is in the asking. Taking these meetings and listening
shows proper respect for the team that’s in place. It can be hard to remember,
but while you may be insecure about taking a new role because you feel like
you’re at a disadvantage, the people you’re speaking with may also be unsure
about you taking that role and what it means for them. Demonstrating mutual
respect builds the trust required to make progress.</p></section></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Hey there!</p>
<p>I wanted to learn more about Pandas, a Python library for data analysis, so I decided to embark on a mini-project to experiment with it. If you use Reddit, you’ve probably seen a chain of comments like below:</p>
<p><img src="https://sshawarma.github.io/reddit-comment-chain.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Clearly, you can see that there’s a pattern in the number of upvotes. Every reply to the parent comment receives less upvotes compared to the previous reply. It would be interesting to create a bar graph, comparing the number of upvotes the parent comment received, the number of upvotes the first reply received, the number of upvotes the second reply received, …, the number of upvotes the <code>nth</code> reply received. Using Reddit’s API and Pandas, I implemented a program that would do just that. You can find it on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/sshawarma/comment_analyzer">here</a>.</p>
<p>First, we need to import the following:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> praw
<span>import</span> pandas <span>as</span> pd
<span>import</span> matplotlib.pyplot <span>as</span> plt
<span>import</span> sys
<span>import</span> math
<span>from</span> concurrent.futures <span>import</span> ThreadPoolExecutor
</code></pre></div><p>PRAW is a Python wrapper for Reddit’s API. <code>matplotlib</code> is a library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. These imports will become clearer as we move on.</p>
<p>Next, we need to define authenticate to Reddit’s API. PRAW allows us to do this pretty easily with OAuth2:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span># Authenticate using our client secret</span>
<span>def</span> <span>authenticate</span>():
    <span>with</span> open(<span>'client_secret.txt'</span>, <span>'r'</span>) <span>as</span> f:
        data <span>=</span> f<span>.</span>read()<span>.</span>split()
        CLIENT_ID <span>=</span> data[<span>0</span>]
        CLIENT_SECRET <span>=</span> data[<span>1</span>]

    <span>return</span> praw<span>.</span>Reddit(client_id<span>=</span>CLIENT_ID,
                    client_secret<span>=</span>CLIENT_SECRET,
                    user_agent<span>=</span>USER_AGENT)
</code></pre></div><p>In this case, the client ID and client secret is stored in a file (called <code>client_secret.txt</code>). We read this and return an instance of PRAW’s <code>Reddit</code> class, which allows us to interact with Reddit’s APIs.</p>
<p>Now, we break down what we have to do in logical chunks. First, we need to get a list of submissions, so that we can look at the comments under each post. PRAW allows us to get a list of the hottest submissions from r/all, which is basically an amalgamation of a bunch of submissions from different subreddits:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>get_submission_upvotes</span>(reddit, m, n):
    upvotes_list <span>=</span> []
    submissions <span>=</span> list(reddit<span>.</span>subreddit(<span>'all'</span>)<span>.</span>hot(limit<span>=</span>m))
    <span>with</span> ThreadPoolExecutor() <span>as</span> executor:
        futures <span>=</span> [executor<span>.</span>submit(count_upvotes, submissions[i], n) <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> range(<span>0</span>, m)]
        [upvotes_list<span>.</span>append(future<span>.</span>result()) <span>for</span> future <span>in</span> futures]
    <span>return</span> upvotes_list
</code></pre></div><p>The reason we use <code>concurrent.futures</code> is because, depending on the length of the comment chain we are examining, we might end up taking very long to collect upvotes on one submission but a very short time to collect upvotes on another submission (we will see what the <code>count_upvotes</code> function does next). Here, <code>m</code> represents the number of submissions to look at and <code>n</code> represents the number of comments in a comment chain to examine.</p>
<p>Next, we need to count the number of upvotes of each comment in a comment chain in each submission. This can be done as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>count_upvotes</span>(submission, n):
    upvotes <span>=</span> []
    submission<span>.</span>comments<span>.</span>replace_more(limit<span>=</span><span>0</span>)

    count <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    comment <span>=</span> submission<span>.</span>comments[<span>0</span>]
    <span>while</span> count <span>&lt;</span> n:
        upvotes<span>.</span>append(comment<span>.</span>score)
        count <span>+=</span> <span>1</span>
        <span>if</span> len(comment<span>.</span>replies) <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span>:
            comment <span>=</span> comment<span>.</span>replies[<span>0</span>]
        <span>else</span>:
            <span>break</span>

    <span>while</span> len(upvotes) <span>&lt;</span> n:
        upvotes<span>.</span>append(float(<span>'nan'</span>))
    <span>return</span> upvotes
</code></pre></div><p>In essence, we get the top comment and keep examining each reply until we have gotten <code>n</code> comments or until the comment chain ends (to get more comment chains of length <code>n</code>, we can increase <code>m</code>). If the comment chain ends prematurely, we add <code>nan</code> (Not a Number) to indicate that no data was collected for the particular reply in the comment chain because that reply did not exist (the comment chain ended, so there were no more upvotes to count).</p>
<p>After counting the upvotes of each comment in the top comment chain, we only have to process the data. First, we compute the average number of upvotes for the top comments, the 1st reply, the 2nd reply, etc:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>compute_data</span>(upvotes_list):
    avg_upvotes <span>=</span> []
    <span>for</span> col <span>in</span> range(<span>0</span>, len(upvotes_list[<span>0</span>])):
        avg <span>=</span> <span>0.0</span>
        n <span>=</span> len(upvotes_list)
        <span>for</span> row <span>in</span> range(<span>0</span>, len(upvotes_list)):
            <span>if</span> math<span>.</span>isnan(upvotes_list[row][col]) <span>==</span> False:
                avg <span>+=</span> upvotes_list[row][col]
            <span>else</span>:
                n <span>-=</span> <span>1</span>
        <span>if</span> n <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span>:
            avg_upvotes<span>.</span>append(avg <span>/</span> n)
        <span>else</span>:
            avg_upvotes<span>.</span>append(<span>0</span>)
    <span>return</span> avg_upvotes
</code></pre></div><p>We return a list called <code>avg_upvotes</code>, which contains the average number of upvotes for the top comment, first reply, second reply, etc. We now convert this list into a bar graph:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>render_data</span>(avg_upvotes, n):
    <span># Solution from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9647202/ordinal-numbers-replacement</span>
    ordinal <span>=</span> <span>lambda</span> n: <span>"</span><span>%d%s</span><span>"</span> <span>%</span> (n,<span>"tsnrhtdd"</span>[(n<span>//</span><span>10</span><span>%</span><span>10</span><span>!=</span><span>1</span>)<span>*</span>(n<span>%</span><span>10</span><span>&lt;</span><span>4</span>)<span>*</span>n<span>%</span><span>10</span>::<span>4</span>])
    x <span>=</span> [str(ordinal(i)) <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> range(<span>0</span>, n)]
    df <span>=</span> pd<span>.</span>DataFrame({<span>'Comment Reply Number'</span>: x, <span>'Average Upvotes'</span>: avg_upvotes})
    df<span>.</span>plot<span>.</span>bar(x<span>=</span><span>'Comment Reply Number'</span>, y<span>=</span><span>'Average Upvotes'</span>, rot<span>=</span><span>0</span>, legend<span>=</span>False)
    plt<span>.</span>xlabel(<span>'Comment Reply Number'</span>)
    plt<span>.</span>ylabel(<span>'Average Upvotes'</span>)
    plt<span>.</span>xticks(size<span>=</span><span>4</span>)
    plt<span>.</span>yticks(size<span>=</span><span>4</span>)
    plt<span>.</span>show()
</code></pre></div><p>Now all we have to do is put it together:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>if</span> __name__ <span>==</span> <span>'__main__'</span>:
    <span>if</span> len(sys<span>.</span>argv) <span>&lt;</span> <span>3</span>:
        <span>print</span>(<span>'./comment_analyzer.py [number of submissions to analyze] [number of comments]'</span>)
        exit()
    m <span>=</span> int(sys<span>.</span>argv[<span>1</span>])
    n <span>=</span> int(sys<span>.</span>argv[<span>2</span>])
    reddit <span>=</span> authenticate()
    upvotes_list <span>=</span> get_submission_upvotes(reddit, m, n)
    avg_upvotes <span>=</span> compute_data(upvotes_list)
    render_data(avg_upvotes, n)
</code></pre></div><p>The program takes two parameters: the number of submissions to look at and the “depth” of the comment chain we have to look at.</p>
<p>Running the program (assuming you have the necessary libraries installed with Python 3.6+), you get a bar graph like so:</p>
<p><img src="https://sshawarma.github.io/pandas.png" alt="a right-skewed bar graph"></p>
<p>(The “0th” comment represents the top comment).</p>
<p>The above graph allows us to visualize the distribution of upvotes on comments on Reddit. Clearly, the distribution is right-skewed: the number of upvotes diminish as we get deeper down the reply chain. This is to be expected, since the top comment tends to be seen first.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you can see how tools like Pandas and PRAW allow us to collect data and visualize it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-w-id="0ea0c8ae-8333-a516-8908-f86a85ef9373"><blockquote>One of my key goals this month is to make sure we're not burning ourselves out. We've got a lot of priorities but there's no need to stretch ourselves thin and run the risk of longer-term issues.<p>- Jean Vincent (CTO, Lytehouse)</p></blockquote><p>‍</p><p>Unhealthy working patterns can build up over time and create longer-term issues. </p><p>In this article, we'll be showing you signs of burnout debt - and how to recognize it before it's too late.</p><p>‍</p><h3>What is 'Burnout Debt'</h3><p>Symptoms of burnout can slowly grow on a team. As sprints go on it's easy to overlook the signs that build up over time. We refer to this build up as 'burnout debt'.</p><p>You should treat burnout debt in the same way we treat technical debt. Identify it early and take measures to reduce longer-term negative effects.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Signs of 'Burnout Debt'</h3><ol role="list"><li>Unhealthy Working Patterns</li><li>High Workloads</li><li>Spikes in Weekend Activity</li></ol><p>‍</p><h3>Sign #1: &nbsp;Unhealthy Working Patterns</h3><p>One key factor in burnout is overwork. It's important we help our teams manage their workloads and reduce burnout. If your team feels the need to work late nights and weekends - it's time to have a conversation about workloads.</p><p>This team for example consistently works late nights and weekends. This is a strong signal that your team is overworking and may approach burnout. We'll see the effect of this below.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ed57622ee14fb96d022d544/5f593cd3ba2ac780cf72cc15_unsustainable-working-patterns.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><h3>Sign #2: Unusually High Workloads</h3><p>Spikes in workload can be early warning signs of burnout.</p><p>The team below was under tight deadlines - working nights and weekends. You can a large spike in Throughput followed by immediate burnout which lasted ~3 months.</p><p>This is a typical situation. We take on too much work and burn out. The following weeks remain unproductive. As leaders it's our job to make sure our teams have a more sustainable, manageable workload.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ed57622ee14fb96d022d544/5f593cecff346bf77d54af02_unusually-high-workload.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><h3>Sign #3: Spikes in Weekend Activity</h3><p>Large spikes in weekend activity can be an incredibly high signal for overworked. Are your current tasks too much to handle in a week? Did we poorly estimate that workload? Is the workload unmanageable?</p><p>As engineering leaders we have to protect our team from situations like that which can cause long term effects to team morale, culture, and overall productivity. As we saw in the image above, the effects of burnout can be long lasting and in some cases can lead to the highest cost for an engineering team - turnover.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ed57622ee14fb96d022d544/5f593d086702304230624666_high-weekend-activity.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><h3>Is your team accumulating 'burnout debt'?</h3><p>Just like technical debt, burnout debt silently builds up in the background. As it accumulates it not only gets harder to resolve but it's impact becomes more severe.</p><p>When left unchecked 'burnout debt' impacts team culture, creates an environment of overwork, and degrades trust among the team. At an individual level it decreases satisfaction, happiness, and productivity while boiling up to team-wide frustration, low morale, and high turnover.</p><p>So.. Is your team affected by burnout debt?</p><p>‍</p><h3>What should I do about it?</h3><p>It’s important to identify these signs early so you can intervene. Luckily, there are ways to identify and resolve burnout debt.</p><p>‍</p><h5>Make it a ritual</h5><p>The first step is having conversations around workload and sustainability. Make it a recurring ritual. At Haystack we bring this up every week. We're constantly adjusting workloads and introducing new, challenging work - to combat burnout.</p><p>‍</p><h5>Get data-driven</h5><p>As engineers, we often feel productive (and happy) when we're pushing new features. There's a certain rush to grabbing a coffee, throwing on some headphones, and getting that #todo closed out - even if it takes staying up late to do it.</p><p>Unfortunately, this makes it difficult to see or address burnout debt. In the moment, we feel great about the work we did - unknowingly allowing burnout debt to build over time. What feels great now build up in the background and soon enough you'll start feeling burnt out.</p><p>In this case, having data helps quite a bit. Being able to see trends and alert on them helps us catch burnout debt before it's too late.

Notice that the quasirandom distributions appear less regular than a lattice but do not have as many ‘clumps’ or ‘gaps’ as the random distribution.</figcaption></figure><p>The methods of creating fully deterministic low discrepancy quasirandom sequences in one dimension are extremely well studied, and generally solved.&nbsp; In this post, I focus almost solely on open (infinite) sequences, first in one dimension and then extending to higher dimensions. The fundamental advantage of open sequences (that is, extensible in $n$ is that if the resultant errors based on a finite number of terms is too large, the sequence can be extended without discarding all the previously calculated points. There are many methods to construct open sequences. One way to categorise the different types is by the method of constructing their basis (hyper)-parameters:</p><ul><li>irrational fractions: Kronecker, Richtmyer, Ramshaw</li><li>(co)prime numbers: Van der Corput, Halton, Faure</li><li>Irreducible Polynomials : Niederreiter</li><li>Primitive polynomials: Sobol’</li></ul><p>For brevity, this post generally focuses on comparing this new additive <strong>recurrence</strong> $R$-sequence, which falls into the first category as it is a recurrence method based on irrational numbers (often called Kronecker,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equidistribution_theorem">Weyl</a>&nbsp; or Richtmyer sequences) which are rank 1 lattices, and the Halton sequence, which is based on the canonical one-dimensional van der Corput sequence. The canonical Kronecker Recurrence sequence is defined as: $$R_1(\alpha): \;\; t_n = \{s_0 + n \alpha\}, \quad n=1,2,3,…$$ where $\alpha $ is any irrational number. Note that the notation $ \{x\}$ indicates the fractional part of $x$. In computing, this function is more commonly expressed in the following way $$R_1(\alpha): \;\; t_n = s_0 + n \alpha \; (\textrm{mod} \; 1); \quad n=1,2,3,…$$ For $s_0 = 0$, the first few terms of the sequence, $R(\phi)$ are: $$t_n = 0.618, \; 0.236, \; 0.854, \; 0.472, \; 0.090, \; 0.708, \; 0.327, \; 0.944, \; 0.562, \; 0.180,\; 798,\; 416, \; 0.034, \; 0.652, \; 0.271, \; 0.888,…$$</p><p>It is important to note that the value of $s_0$ does not affect the overall characteristics of the sequence, and in nearly all cases is set to zero. However, especially in computing the option of $s \neq 0$ offers an additional degree of freedom that is often useful. If $s \neq 0$, the sequence is often called a ‘shifted lattice sequence.</p><p>The value of \( \alpha \) that gives the lowest possible discrepancy is achieved if&nbsp; \( \alpha = 1/\phi \), where \( \phi \) is the golden ratio. That is, $$ \phi \equiv \frac{\sqrt{5}+1}{2} \simeq 1.61803398875… ; $$ It is interesting to note that there are an infinite number of other values of&nbsp; $\alpha$ that also achieve optimal discrepancy, and they are all related via the Moebius transformation $$ \alpha’ = \frac{p\alpha+q}{r\alpha+s} \quad \textrm{for all integers} \; p,q,r,s \quad \textrm{such that} |ps-qr|=1 $$ We now compare this recurrence method to the well known van der Corput reverse-radix sequences [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Corput_sequence">van der Corput, 1935</a>] . The van der Corput sequences are actually a family of sequences, each defined by a unique hyper-parameter,&nbsp;<span id="MathJax-Element-15-Frame" tabindex="0"><span id="MathJax-Span-163"><span id="MathJax-Span-164"><span id="MathJax-Span-165">b</span></span></span></span>.&nbsp;The first few terms of the sequence for b=2 are: $$t_n^{[2]} =&nbsp; \frac{1}{2},&nbsp;\frac{1}{4},\frac{3}{4},&nbsp;\frac{1}{8},&nbsp;\frac{5}{8},&nbsp; \frac{3}{8},&nbsp;\frac{7}{8}, \frac{1}{16},\frac{9}{16},\frac{5}{16},\frac{13}{16}, \frac{3}{16}, \frac{11}{16}, \frac{7}{16}, \frac{15}{16},…$$ The following section compares the general characteristics and effectiveness of each of these sequences. Consider the task of evaluating the definite integral $$ A = \int_0^1 f(x) \textrm{d}x $$ We may approximate this by: $$ A&nbsp; \simeq A_n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i),&nbsp; \quad x_i \in [0,1] $$</p><ul><li>If the \( \{x_i\} \) are equal to&nbsp; \(i/n\), this is the <strong>rectangle</strong> rule;</li><li>If the \( \{x_i\} \) are chosen randomly, this is the <strong>Monte Carlo method</strong>; and</li><li>If the \( \{x_i\} \) are elements of a low discrepancy sequence, this is the <strong>quasi-Monte Carlo method</strong>.</li></ul><p>The following graph shows the typical error curves \( s_n = |A-A_n| \) for approximating a definite integral associated with the function, \( f(x) = \textrm{exp}(\frac{-x^2}{2}), \; x \in [0,1]&nbsp; \) with: (i) <span>quasi-random points based on the additive recurrence, where&nbsp; \( \alpha = 1/\phi \), (blue);&nbsp;</span>(ii) <span>quasi-random points based on the van der Corput sequence, (orange)</span>;&nbsp;(iii) <span><span>randomly selected points, (green)</span><span><span>;&nbsp;(iv) <span>Sobol sequence (red).</span></span></span></span> <span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span>It shows that for \(n=10^6\) points, the random sampling approach results in an error of \( \simeq 10^{-4}\), the van der Corput sequence results in an error of&nbsp;\( \simeq 10^{-6}\), whilst the \(R(\phi)\)-sequence results in an error of&nbsp;\( \simeq 10^{-7}\), which is \(\sim\)10x better than the van der Corput error and \(\sim\) 1000x better than (uniform) random sampling.</p><figure id="attachment_624" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-624"><img loading="lazy" src="http://extremelearning.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Numerical-integration-1D-v2.webp" alt="" width="960" height="609" srcset="http://extremelearning.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Numerical-integration-1D-v2.webp 960w, http://extremelearning.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Numerical-integration-1D-v2-300x190.webp 300w, http://extremelearning.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Numerical-integration-1D-v2-768x487.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-624">Figure 2. Comparison of 1-dimensional Numerical integration using various Quasirandom Monte Carlo methods. Note smaller is better. The new $R_2$ sequence (blue) and the Sobol (red) are clearly the best.</figcaption></figure><p>Several things from this figure are worth noting:</p><ul><li>it is consistent with the knowledge that the errors based on uniform random sampling asymptotically decrease by $ 1/\sqrt{n} $, whereas error curves based on both quasi-random sequences tend to&nbsp; $1/n $.</li><li>The results for the $R_1(\phi)$-sequence&nbsp; (blue) and Sobol (red) are the best.</li><li>It shows that the van der Corput sequence offers good, but incredibly consistent results for integration problems!</li><li>It shows that, for all values of $n$, the $R_1(\phi)$-sequence produces results better than the van der Corput sequence.</li></ul><blockquote><p><span> The new $R_1$ sequence, which is the Kronecker sequence using the Golden ratio,&nbsp; is one of the best choices for one-dimensional Quasirandom Monte Carlo (QMC) integration methods</span></p></blockquote><p>It should also be noted that although \(\alpha = \phi\) theoretically offers the provably optimal option, \(\sqrt{2}\) and is very close to optimal, and almost any other irrational value of \(\alpha\) provides excellent error curves for one-dimensional integration. This is why, \(\alpha = \sqrt{p} \) for any prime is very commonly used.&nbsp; Furthermore, from a computing perspective, selecting a random value in the interval&nbsp; $ \alpha \in [0,1] $ is with almost certainty going to be (within machine precision) an irrational number, and therefore a solid choice for a low discrepancy sequence. For visual clarity, the above figure does not show the results the Niederreiter sequence as the results&nbsp; are virtually indistinguishable to that of the the Sobol and $R$ sequences.&nbsp; The Neiderreiter and Sobol sequences (along with their optimized parameter selection) that were used in this post were calculated via Mathematica using what is documented as “closed, proprietary and fully optimized generators provided in Intel’s MKL library”.</p><p>Most current methods to construct higher dimension low discrepancy simply combine (in a component-wise manner), \(d\) one-dimensional sequences together. For brevity, this post mainly focuses on describing the Halton sequence [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halton_sequence">Halton, 1960</a>] , Sobol sequence and the \(d-\)dimensional Kronecker sequence.</p><p>The Halton sequence is constructed simply by using \(d\) different one-dimensional van de Corput sequence each with a base that is relatively prime to all the others. That is, pairwise co-prime. By far, the most frequent selection, due to its obvious simplicity and sensibility, is to select the first \(d\) primes. The distribution of the first 625 points defined by the (2,3)-Halton sequence is show in figure 1. Although many two-dimensional Halton sequences are excellent sources for low discrepancy sequences, it is also well known that many are highly problematic and do not exhibit low discrepancies. For example, figure 3 shows that the (11,13)-Halton sequence produces highly visible lines. Much effort has gone into methods of selecting which pairs of ( \(p_1, p_2) \) are exemplars and which ones are problematic. This issue is even more problematic in higher dimensions.</p><p>Kronecker recurrence methods generally suffer even greater challenges when generalizing to higher dimensions. That is, although using \( \alpha = \sqrt{p}&nbsp; \) produces excellent …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h4>Silcon Labs EFM8: Fantastic value and ease-of-use from the only 8-bit part with a totally-free cross-platform vendor ecosystem</h4><p>The <a href="https://jaycarlson.net/pf/silicon-labs-efm8/">EFM8</a> was the fastest 8-bit part in my round-up, and admittedly, my favorite 8-bit architecture to develop with overall. What these parts lack in brains they make up for in brawns — 14-bit ADCs, 12-bit DACs, lots of timers, and a 72 MHz core clock speed that gives you timing options not found in any other part in the round-up.</p><p>Plus, this is the only 8-bit part with a totally-free, cross-platform, vendor-provided ecosystem. Let that sink in.</p><p>Keil C51 is a silly compiler, but Silicon Labs does an excellent job hiding it under the hood — even when running its Eclipse-based Simplicity Studio on Linux or macOS.</p><p>Simplicity Configurator is the lightest-weight code generator in our round-up, using only 534 bytes of flash to house the entire DMX-512 receiver project. It was one of the easiest to use, and seemed to strike a good balance between abstraction, performance, and ease of use.</p><p>Debugging speeds are snappy with a J-Link debugger, but at $35, the official Silicon Labs USB Debug Adapter is one of the cheapest first-party debugger in the round-up, and clones of the hardware are even cheaper.</p><p>And call me old-fashioned, but I think the 8051 definitely has a place in 2017 — especially among hobbyists and students, where its bit-addressable memory, easy-to-use peripherals, and fuse-free configuration help get students comfortable with microcontrollers quickly.</p><h4>Microchip megaAVR &amp; tinyAVR 1-Series: Different strokes for different folks — still with the best 8-bit toolchain available</h4><p>The <a href="https://jaycarlson.net/pf/atmel-microchip-megaavr/">megaAVR</a> came in surprisingly flat for me: especially when compared with its lower-cost, new sibling, the <a href="https://jaycarlson.net/pf/atmel-microchip-tinyavr-1-series/">tinyAVR 1-Series</a>.</p><p>There’s no comparison when it comes to price: tinyAVR has incredible value — packing in a nice assortment of timers, analog peripherals (including a DAC), and a new 20 MHz internal oscillator — while costing 20-40% less than the megaAVR.</p><p>While the megaAVR has a perplexing debugging experience that requires two completely different interfaces and protocols to work with the part, the new one-wire UPDI interface the tinyAVR sports worked flawlessly in my testing.</p><p>But that’s the crux of the problem for the tinyAVR — by shedding many of its megaAVR roots, Microchip ended up with a wonderful microcontroller that will be challenging to use for a large base of Atmel fans: indie developers and hobbyists who use low-cost, open-source programmers (which don’t support the UPDI interface).</p><p>While the tinyAVR wasn’t the fastest part in the round-up (even among 8-bitters), it was the most efficient – both in terms of active-mode power and clock efficiency. Amazingly, the AVR only uses about twice as many instructions as 16- and 32-bit parts when performing 16-bit math.</p><p>Unfortunately, the AVR system as a whole is not without its issues. The Windows-only Atmel Studio is still buggy (especially with older megaAVR devices and AVR Dragon stuff in my tests), and there isn’t an under-$50 low-cost debugger available (other than hacking apart Xplained Mini dev boards).</p><p>In many ways, there seems to be a tacit demarcation Atmel creates between its hobbyist/indie developers, and the professional shops that use Atmel parts.</p><p>As a professional embedded developer, I most definitely have access to Windows computers, and I have no problem blowing a few billable hours’ worth of pay on a $140 debugger.</p><p>But even as popular as Atmel is among hobbyists, Atmel has largely stayed out of this space directly. Instead, they’ve secured small-volume AVR sales by relying on the open-source community to build their own tools for themselves: turning out a slew of hardware and software used to program the megaAVR devices.</p><p>While I applaud the efforts of these developers, these tools are inferior to Atmel’s. Their programming speeds are terrible, they don’t support the new tinyAVR 1-Series devices, and they have absolutely no debug capability.</p><p>Having said that, both the megaAVR and tinyAVR have the best toolchain available for 8-bit MCU development. The part supports a full, end-to-end Makefile-based GCC toolchain.</p><p>If you love printf() debugging, would never touch a proprietary toolchain, and hate IDEs, megaAVR and old tinyAVR parts are definitely for you. The older ones are still available in DIP packages, and as you probably know, there are a ton of low-cost programmers available across the world. The online community is massive, and as clunky as I find Atmel START to be, I have to applaud its support for Makefile-based project generation.</p><p>Consequently, the megaAVR remains the most open-source 8-bit microcontroller on the market — by a long shot.</p><p>But I’d really like to see Microchip provide a PicKit-priced debugger with UPDI support — and allow off-board debugging the way their PIC Curiosity Boards do.</p><p>I also hope these open-source projects can add UPDI support to their tools, so that hobbyists and indie developers can start integrating the tinyAVR into their projects — it’s a much better part, and if you’re an AVR user with access to Atmel Studio, you really ought to buy an Xplained Mini board and take it for a spin.</p><h4>STM32F0: A low-cost, no-nonsense part with arguably the best Arm development ecosystem tested</h4><p><a href="https://jaycarlson.net/pf/st-stm32f0/">The STM32F0</a> was the lowest-power Arm microcontroller in the round-up, and also one of the easiest to use. STM32CubeMX doesn’t generate the most compact code on Arm (that honor belongs to Cypress PSoC Creator and Infineon DAVE), but it has a snappy interface, and the generated code is easy enough to manipulate for your own goals.</p><p>I love the nearly-stock Eclipse-based environment that System Workbench for STM32 provides, and the ST-Link and excellent Discovery/Nucleo boards seals the deal for me.</p><p>Most pros have used ST parts in their work, but for all these reasons, any hobbyist looking at moving to Arm should probably pick up a dev board from this ecosystem, too. ST has a huge market footprint, so there’s tons of resources online — aimed at both hobbyists and professionals.</p><h4>SAM D10: Killer performance &amp; peripherals, but with runtime library hiccups</h4><p>The Microchip/Atmel <a href="https://jaycarlson.net/pf/atmel-microchip-sam-d10/">SAM D10</a> (and the broader D11/D20/D21 ecosystem) has good value (considering their analog portfolio includes a DAC, and they have good timing options), and the SAM D10 was the most efficient part tested when running at full speed.</p><p>Professionals will like the easy-to-use, well-documented header files, and hobbyists will appreciate the 1.27mm-pitch SOIC package options and GCC compilers that come with the Arm ecosystem. But before I grab this part for a project, Microchip really needs to fix the extremely slow, bloated peripheral library, and update their code-gen tool to do proper error-checking of clock and peripheral configurations.</p><p>As it is, whenever I use Atmel START on the D10, I want to STOP almost immediately. And there are no current, stand-alone peripheral drivers that Microchip has released for this part, so unless you want to do register programming from scratch, you’ll be relying on third-party, open-source projects — like Alex Taradov’s <a href="https://github.com/ataradov/mcu-starter-projects">code examples</a>.</p><h4>Infineon XMC1100: Interesting peripheral perks make this Cortex-M0 stand out</h4><p>The most interesting Arm chip was, without a doubt, the <a href="https://jaycarlson.net/pf/infineon-xmc1100/">Infineon XMC1100</a> — and I think professionals who may be wary of getting out of the ST/NXP/Atmel Arm ecosystem need to take a second look at these XMC1000 (and XMC4000) parts.</p><p>The timer options are amazingly flexible, and you can squeeze fantastic performance out of the USIC module.</p><p>I’m going to go out on a limb and recommend that serious hobbyists who are building motor / lighting control projects look into these parts, too. DAVE makes setting up these complex peripherals painless, and the 38-pin TSSOP chips will be substantially easier to solder than the 0.5mm QFNs and QFPs you usually end up with in these pin counts.</p><p>Like many of the parts reviewed here, the biggest problem for hobbyists and indie developers is the tiny online communities and lack of GitHub repos with open-source projects that use these chips. My advice — be bold, and post in the forums. Infineon employees monitor and usually respond within a day or so.</p><h4>PIC16: Tons of peripherals with a slower, power-efficient core</h4><p>When you compare the <a href="https://jaycarlson.net/pf/microchip-pic16-five-digit-enhanced/">PIC16</a> with other 8-bit parts out there, it’s obviously a part built for low-power applications, and not processing power. And while the development ecosystem is workable, there are other parts more friendlier pathways — especially for smaller shops, hobbyists, and students who need extremely low-cost tools (and free software).</p><p>To add fuel to the PIC-vs-AVR debate, my testing found that a 32 MHz PIC16 is roughly equivalent to an AVR part running at 1.4 MHz (in terms of math performance), and 9 MHz (in terms of bit-shuffling performance).</p><p>Having said that, the DMX-512 receiver seems a perfect match for the PIC16, and that’s where it looks best in my testing: the PIC16 was the lowest-power 8-bit part in my testing.</p><p>It’s also full of timers and digital logic-oriented peripherals that make it suitable for funky special-purpose projects that require some crafty use of configurable logic and and the numerically-controlled oscillator — these peripherals help offload the (relatively slow) CPU, at the expense of requiring more developer familiarity with the device and these peripherals.</p><p>The usual Microchip gotchas apply: clunky IDE, expensive compilers, and expensive debuggers.</p><p>The usual Microchip advantages apply: huge online community, seemingly infinite product lifetime guarantees, and DIP, SOIC, QFP, and QFN package availability.</p><h4>PIC24: An expensive MSP430 wannabe that doesn’t hit the mark</h4><p>The <a href="https://jaycarlson.net/pf/microchip-pic24/">PIC24</a> is nearly forgettable. In the biquad test, it’s marginally faster than the <a href="https://jaycarlson.net/pf/renesas-rl-78/">Renesas RL-78</a> but uses almost three times as much power. In the DMX-512 test, both the RL-78 and MSP430 beat it, too. It was also one of the least-endowed parts in the round-up (which really just means it’s expensive — higher-end PIC24 parts have no shortage …</p></div></div>

<p>About six years ago I started learning Unity in my spare time, going through several official and unofficial tutorials. One was a simple tutorial on how to create a wire chain through physics. After its completion, I added a simple platform and a sphere. When arrow keys were pressed the sphere was torqued, and on spacebar press a vertical force was added to sphere, which caused it to jump. I was at awe. Unity’s physics were accessible and felt natural out of the box. Not only that, but a rough working scene could be quickly setup by gluing some basic concepts.</p>


<p>Wire chain and sphere physics</p>

<p>An idea started to bubble up about around this simple project: staying as long as possible on top of a platform. Antagonists, materialized in the form of various hazards, were added in order to coerce (directly or indirectly) the player off the platform. Frequency and power of these hazards increased over time, raising the probability of reaching the level’s finishing state. From this starting point, more elements were added, such as interactable platform edge blocks, destroyable floor tiles, backdrops, user interface and basic sound effects.</p>

<p>Two versions resulted from this. The first ad supported version was available for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rockbyte.survivalball">Android mobile</a> devices only, having one playable level in single-player mode. Afterwards, a new adless version was released for <a href="https://www.ouya.tv/game/Survival-Ball/">OUYA</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rockbyte.survivalltv">Android TV</a> and Kongregate, featuring a new versus mode.</p>


<p>Game prototype version for OUYA, Android TV and Kongregate</p>



<p>I went to work on other projects after the prototype’s launch, but the feedback provided from gamers was kept in the back of my mind in the meanwhile. Several ideas eventually piled up for a new, improved version of the game, and about two years ago they were first brought to fruition. First at night after work, then full-time until completion.</p>

<p>Laying out a solid base was was essential in the beginning of the project, specially concept wise. Pre-production, if you will. Surviving on top of a platform was the root idea, but was there latitude for perpendicular ideas? Multiplayer mode? Versus or Cooperative? Online or local only? Powerups? Which player movements would be available, only jump? Progressive difficulty (the player does not choose the difficulty level) or bucket based difficulty (e.g. easy, normal, hard)? What will be the direction of visual style, audio, and code architecture? How many levels? What is the player’s motivation play these levels?</p>

<h2 id="root-ideas-and-game-modes">Root ideas and game modes</h2>

<p>Less is more when it comes to the game’s root ideas, and surviving on top of a platform seemed like a good premise. This idea was dissected and questioned thoroughly during the initial phase of development, in order to make sure it was well sustained. Other ideas such as going as high as possible or objective based levels were considered, but set aside in the initial stage of the project. They were not completely scrapped, such that both survival/time based and objective based levels would later cohabitate throughout the game’s development.</p>

<p>Assuming survival as the most important root idea, a question came up: survive what? It could be either you against the world, or you against other player(s), or a combination of both. The latter two options would prompt the need of a multiplayer versus mode and/or player AI, and the former one would naturally accommodate a single player and/or cooperation mode.</p>

<p>Allowing for a local multiplayer mode would be something desirable, since I had a personal bias towards games that physically join a group of friends in the same place. Also, online multiplayer was set aside due to the added entropy and complexity associated with it. </p>

<p>As for cooperative (co-op) games, there is usually an increased inclusion factor due to the wealth of opportunities to strike a balance between experienced and less experienced players, translating to less chances of frustration caused by huge proficiency gaps.</p>

<p>Given the above points, solo and local co-op modes were chosen to be included in the game.</p>

<h2 id="difficulty">Difficulty</h2>

<p>Again, having in mind that less is more, a progressive difficulty mode (where the player does not choose the difficulty level) was strived for, instead of a bucket based approach (e.g. easy, normal, hard). Choosing a difficulty level when starting a simple game like this one, forces the player to commit to a given difficulty level at start, and accepting that decision. The responsibility is on the player. Often happens to me that when I choose a difficulty level like “easy” or “normal”, I keep wondering throughout the game if I am really good at that game, or am I just being thrown softballs. Progressive difficulty resolves that problem immediately, but it falls on the developer shoulders to craft the game in such a way that all difficulty ranges are covered just right.</p>

<p>Progression would be 2-fold: each level would start in an accessible way, but would gradually get more difficult as time passes. On the other hand, each level would be more challenging than the last one during the campaign. </p>

<h2 id="control-and-movement">Control and movement</h2>

<p>There was the need to have offensive manuevers against hazards, and to provide mid-air control to the player. Two new movements were added to the already existing jump and double jump movements: dash and stomp. Dash provided mid-air control and allowed the player to interact with the world’s objects and attack hazards. Stomp, inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_64">Super Mario 64</a>, allowed for button interaction, and mid-air stop and plunge for precise vertical landings.</p>

<p>With this set of movements, the player was able to gain full control over the ball. Easy to learn, hard to master. Additionally, it suppressed the need for aerial control via directional controls, which would be less physically coherent and could quench some of the fun of gaining control proficiency.  </p>

<h2 id="powerups">Powerups</h2>

<p>An assumption was made that powerups would be distributed randomly, either by items scattered throughout the level or by other means. Powerups were not used because of these four reasons: </p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Added game design complexity</strong> - every new powerup would increase the realm of possible scenarios during a game session, which would increase the difficulty of striking good game balance.</li>
  <li><strong>Simplicity</strong> - simplicity was held at high value during development, and powerups would probably require the usage of a new button to trigger the power, more UI elements and new concepts for the player to grasp.</li>
  <li><strong>Skill based gameplay</strong> - the game aimed to be purely skill based. Since the randomized nature of hazards already abducted some of this intent, having powerups attributed by chance would further decrease the player’s perception that the level was completed by his/her own merit.</li>
  <li><strong>They could be used as crutches</strong> - powerups are outstanding when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollcage_(video_game)">used</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Kart_8">properly</a>, but can also be abused to cover up design flaws. Having a no-powerup limitation forced me think in alternative ways to make the game more interesting, a challenge I was drawn to. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="visual-aesthetics">Visual Aesthetics</h2>

<p>Defining the game’s visual appearance early on was quite important, since it would influence the reasoning behind 3D models, textures, UI, colors, mood and even audio. The two most influential references were <a href="https://material.io/archive/guidelines/">Material Design (first version)</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/540840/Lara_Croft_GO/">Lara Croft GO</a>.</p>

<p>Coming from an Android development background, I was exposed to Material Design, which is a visual language that synthesizes the classic principles of good design. Its principles go beyond mobile UI development, and span to a swath of different form factors and use cases. I personally found it beautiful and applyed its principles throughout the game’s aesthetics, both in UI, but also in the overall style of the game. This influenced the game to have a simple, clean and coherent style.</p>

<p>Lara Croft GO is a beautiful game. The charming colors and elegant (yet simple) style made an impression on me. While building up the game’s aesthetics, I consulted several screenshots of Lara Croft GO and attempted to transpose its most pleasant design elements into Survival Ball.</p>

<p><img src="https://lopespm.github.io/files/sb_making_game/lara_croft_go_0.jpg"></p>

<h2 id="codebase">Codebase</h2>

<p>The prototype was a literal extension of the initial <a href="#prototype">wire chain and ball physics experiment</a>, and features were added at the same time I learned Unity’s ropes. This, added to rapid prototyping and little to no code architecture planning, resulted in a codebase that was entangled, difficult to follow and hard to extend.</p>

<p>The new version was built from scratch and several arquitectures were explored in the beginning of the project, until one was found to fit the game best. The chosen approach followed these principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each level had a single entry point, the game controller, which orquestrated the different actors.</li>
  <li>The game controller contained all top level parameters. Sub-parametrization was facilitated via <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-ScriptableObject.html">Scriptable Objects</a>. For example, the PlayerController had PlayerParameters (which was a scriptable object) exposed on the game controller. The PlayerParameters could in turn have sub-parameters, if needed.</li>
  <li>Dynamic objects, such as the player, hazards and interactable level parts should be created programmatically whenever possible.</li>
  <li>The initial scene stage should only have static or decorative objects.</li>
  <li>Object …</li></ul></div></div>

<p>While working on another piece, I came upon the question of how much time is spent at traffic lights, for which there is not a well-sourced answer. I posted to Twitter and got some useful replies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Transport Twitter: What percent of total travel time is spent stopped at traffic lights? Empirical results please.</p>
<p>— David M. Levinson (@trnsprtst) <a href="https://twitter.com/trnsprtst/status/967547973788827648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 24, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p>With that and some additional digging, I attempt to answer the question.</p>
<p>As the saying goes: Your Mileage May Vary. This depends on your origin and destination and path and mode and time of day and local traffic signal policies and street design. <a href="https://twitter.com/tvanvuren">Tom VanVuren</a> notes: “Much of the impact is in slow moving queues, rather than waiting for the signal cycle to complete. I expect you can make this number smaller than 10% (time at the stop line) or larger than 50% (time affected by traffic lights).” For simplicity, I am considering vehicles that would be stopped if they could either move at the desired speed or must stop (i.e. they are subject to “vertical” or “stacking” queues), but clearly measurement will depend on assumption. Still, there must be a system average. I had heard the number 20% bandied about, which feels right, but let’s first begin with some thought experiment, then look for some empirical results. We take different modes in turn.</p>

<h2><strong>Thought Experiments</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Thought Experiment&nbsp;</strong><strong>1 A</strong></h3>
<p>Imagine an urban grid.</p>
<ul>
<li>Assume 10 signalized intersections per km.</li>
<li>Assume a travel speed of 60 km/h when in motion. (This is probably too high with so many intersections and no platooning, but we are imagining here that you would not be stopping.)</li>
<li>Time to traverse 1 km=1 minute + signal delay. &nbsp;(Some of the distance traversal time overlaps some of the signal delay time, but we will imagine a stacking queue, rather than one that has physical distance for simplicity, we can correct this later if it matters.)</li>
<li>Assume each intersection has only 2 phases.</li>
<li>Assume fixed time signals at each intersection evenly distributing green time between N/S and E/W directions. &nbsp;So&nbsp;red time = 1/2 cycle length.</li>
<li>Assume 1 minute cycle length</li>
<li>If a vehicle stops, it waits 1/2 red time.</li>
<li>Vehicles obey traffic signals.</li>
<li>Assume no platooning.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>This means that the average vehicle will&nbsp;stop at 5 intersections for 15 seconds each = 75 seconds (or 1.25 &nbsp;minutes) (vs. 1 &nbsp;minute in motion time). In this case, 1.25/2.25 minutes (55.5%) is spent waiting at signals.</em></p>
<h3><strong>Thought Experiment 1 B</strong></h3>
<p>In contrast.</p>
<ul>
<li>Assume near perfect platooning.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, the vehicle will stop at 1 intersection per km, for 15 seconds = 15 seconds. In this case 0.25/1.25 = 20% of the time is spent waiting at signals.</p>
<h3><strong>Discussion</strong></h3>
<p>Now, not all travel takes place on an urban grid.</p>
<ul>
<li>Assume 25% of travel is on limited access roads (this is approximately true in the US), &nbsp;75% on non-limited access roads.</li>
</ul>
<p>With perfect platooning on the grid, and 25% off-grid, then 15% of travel time is intersection delay with near perfect platooning.</p>
<p>Clearly in practice platooning is far from perfect. My guess is the green wave breaks down after one or two intersections during peak times, but can survive well in the off-peak. As a rule of thumb, about ~10% of travel is in the peak hour, ~30% peak period. ~60% AM + PM Peak.</p>
<h2>Data</h2>
<h3>GPS Studies</h3>
<p>Eric Fischer of MapBox was kind enough to offer to run this question on their open traffic data. The results are not yet in. I will update when they are.</p>
<h3>Arterial Travel Time Studies</h3>
<p>There are a variety of Arterial Travel Time studies for specific corridors, but nothing that is universally generalizable. &nbsp;(And logically where people do arterial travel time studies, there is a congestion problem, otherwise why study it.)</p>
<p>I recall that in my childhood,<a href="https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/179862"> I did a study in Montgomery County, Maryland</a>&nbsp;using such data (from 1987 traffic counts and a floating car study published by Douglas and Douglas), I did not actually compute the percentage, but fortunately I reported enough data that allows me to compute the percentage now. (The sample is of course biased to what is measured). For the average arterial link, the speed was</p>

<p>Which is consistent with expectations that signals are more significant in more urbanized areas (inside the beltway is basically Bethesda and Silver Spring, MD), and with our general estimates. Now of course the speed here is impacted by downstream signals, and so is lower than the speed limit and certainly lower than the free-flow speed sans-signals. More details are in the paper.</p>

<p>Moaz Ahmed pointed me to a<a href="https://tc.gc.ca/eng/policy/annual-2014-3141.html"> Vehicle Idling Study</a> by <a href="http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/efficiency/communities-infrastructure/transportation/cars-light-trucks/idling/4415">Natural Resources Canada</a>.</p>
<p>The percent of time of vehicle idling ranged from 20-25%. (Not all vehicle idling is at signalized intersections).</p>
<p>(Engine idling of course burns fuel without doing work, so if the engine is going to be idling for an extended period, it would save fuel (and reduce air pollution) to turn it off. Turning the engine on and off also has costs, so the estimate was if idling was going to be longer than 10 seconds, it uses more fuel, but considering other wear and tear costs, the recommended threshold is if idling is longer than 60 seconds, then turn off the engine. &nbsp;But at a signalized intersection, how will vehicles know how long they will wait? Smart traffic signals with connected vehicles could provide this, but now they don’t. Eventually this will be moot with a full electric vehicle fleet. Until that time, it matters. I suspect given the longevity and sluggishness of the traffic control sector, smart signals informing trucks will not be widely or systematically deployed before trucks are electrified.)</p>

<p>Now as noted above, Your Mileage May Vary. If you are a pedestrian, you are unlikely to hit a greenwave designed for cars, though of course your travel speed is slower is well. So redoing the Thought Experiment</p>
<h2><strong>Thought Experiment 2</strong></h2>
<p>Imagine an urban grid.</p>
<ul>
<li>Assume 10 signalized intersections per km.</li>
<li>Assume a travel speed of 6 km/h when in motion. (this is a bit on the high side, average pedestrian speed is closer to <a href="https://westernite.org/datacollectionfund/2005/psu_ped_summary.pdf">5 km/h</a>)</li>
<li>Time to traverse 1 km=10 minutes + signal delay. &nbsp;(Some of the distance traversal time overlaps some of the signal delay time, but we will imagine a vertical stacking queue, rather than one that has physical distance for simplicity, this is a much better assumption for pedestrians than vehicles.)</li>
<li>Assume each intersection has only 2 phases.</li>
<li>Assume fixed time signals at each intersection evenly distributing green time between N/S and E/W directions. &nbsp;So&nbsp;red time = 1/2 cycle length.</li>
<li>Assume 1 minute cycle length</li>
<li>If a pedestrian stops, she waits 1/2 red time. (That is the “walk” phase for pedestrians is as long as the green phase for cars. Strictly speaking this is not true, it is more true in cities with narrow streets than it is in suburban environments with wide streets, as narrow streets can be crossed more quickly, so the amount of “walk” time allocated can be most of the phase. This is certainly not true in Sydney, where the “walk” phase is cut short so turning cars have fewer conflicts with late pedestrians.)</li>
<li>Pedestrians obey traffic lights. &nbsp;(This is not as good an assumption as vehicles obey signals, pedestrian signal violation is probably higher. This is not a moral judgment one way or the other, people tend to obey authority, even when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment">authority abuses power</a>.)</li>
<li>Assume no platooning. (This is probably too severe, a quick pedestrian with some signal coordination can probably make a couple of lights in a row).</li>
</ul>
<p>Here the average pedestrian will&nbsp;stop at 5 intersections for 15 seconds each = 2.5 minutes (vs. 10 &nbsp;minute in-motion time). In this case, 2.5/(2.5+10) minutes (or 20%) is spent waiting at signals. Now, this number is probably true for more pedestrians than the vehicle delay estimate is for vehicles, since pedestrians are more likely to be found on an urban grid and less in a suburban or limited access environment. (Self-selection at work).</p>

<p>If you are a bicyclist, you are unlikely to hit a greenwave designed for cars unless you travel at exactly an integer fraction (1/1, 1/2, 1/3) of the green wave, as your travel speed is slower is well. So redoing the Thought Experiment</p>
<h2><strong>Thought Experiment 3</strong></h2>
<p>Imagine an urban grid.</p>
<ul>
<li>Assume 10 signalized intersections per km.</li>
<li>Assume a travel speed of &nbsp;20 km/h when in motion. (This is a typical for <a href="http://www.road-bike.co.uk/articles/average-speed.php">experienced riders</a>).&nbsp;Time to traverse 1 km=3 minutes + signal delay. (Assume a stacking queue)</li>
<li>Assume each intersection has only 2 phases.</li>
<li>Assume fixed time signals at each intersection evenly distributing green time between N/S and E/W directions. &nbsp;So&nbsp;red time = 1/2 cycle length.</li>
<li>Assume 1 minute cycle length</li>
<li>If a bicyclist stops, she waits 1/2 red time. (That is the ‘bike’ phase for bicyclists is as long as the green phase for cars.)</li>
<li>Bicyclists obey traffic lights. &nbsp;(This is not as good an assumption as ‘motor vehicles obey signals’, bicyclists signal violation is probably higher.)</li>
<li>Assume no platooning. (This is probably too severe, a quick bicyclists with some signal coordination can probably make a couple of lights in a row).</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case the average bicyclists will&nbsp;stop at 5 intersections for 15 seconds each = 2.5 minutes (vs. 3 &nbsp;minute in-motion time). In this case, 2.5/(3+2.5) minutes (or 45%) is spent waiting at signals in an urban environment.</p>
<h2>Strava Data</h2>
<p>Strava, an app for tracking bicyclists and runners can produce some useful data. <a href="https://twitter.com/dr_hsu">Andrew Hsu</a>, e.g., <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/16556#interval_type?chart_type=hours&amp;interval_type=week&amp;interval=201807&amp;year_offset=0">reports</a>&nbsp;“28 mile bike commute. 1:30-ish moving time. 10-15 minutes waiting at lights.” From this, for him, we estimate 15 / (15+90) = 14%. To be clear, 1:30 is an extreme commute. I don’t have access to …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">


<p>A while ago, I released <a href="https://orib.dev/git9.html">git9</a>, a git client for
Plan 9. However, it always felt like it was missing something: A git server.
over a few weekends of work, I sat down and put one together. This Labor
Day weekend, I took the opportunity to labor on it, and got something working.</p>

<h3>usage</h3>

<p><code>Git/serve</code> is a git server designed to fit into the Plan
9 ecosystem, allowing hosting of, and interacting with, code on a Plan 9
server, while still allowing legacy clients running on Unix to get a copy
of the code.</p>

<p><code>Git/serve</code> only speaks the <code>git://</code> protocol.
But because it runs behind
<a href="http://man.9front.org/8/listen">aux/listen</a>
and 
<a href="http://man.9front.org/8/tlssrv"><code>tlssrv</code></a>, we
effectively get two additional protocols for free: <code>gits://</code>, or
TLS-encrypted <code>git://</code>, and <code>hjgit://</code>, which is
<code>git://</code> but with Plan 9 authentication to support user login
over TLS. Unfortunately, only the unencrypted <code>git://</code> protocol
is supported out of the box by upstream git. There may be ways to solve
this, using <a href="https://rovaughn.github.io/2015-2-9.html">custom
transports</a>, and a unix port of tlsclient</p>

<p>To start a <code>git://</code> server, just run it under aux/listen1.
To enable encryption and user authentication, run it under
<code>tlssrv -a</code>. This doesn't need a certificate, because
the Plan 9 authentication generates the secret used for TLS. And,
finally, if you just want encryption, you can use <code>tlsclient</code>
with a certificate.</p>

<pre># git:// server, serving every repository under the current directory
% aux/listen1 'tcp!*!9418' git/serve -r `{pwd}

# gits:// server, doing the same: But with encryption.
% aux/listen1 'tcp!*!9418' tlsclient -c /path/to/cert.pem git/serve -r `{pwd}

# hjgit:// server doing the same: Requires account on server to connect
% aux/listen1 'tcp!*!9418' tlsclient -a git/serve -r `{pwd}
</pre>

<p>If you want to allow people to write, you can just add the
<code>-w</code> flag to git/serve. While you can do this on
any of the protocols, keep in mind that only <code>hjgit://</code>
authenticates the users. Push to the world, but don't let the
world push to you!</p>



<p>All the protocols git uses are closely related. The <code>ssh://</code>
protocol is just the <code>git://</code> protocol, with the command selected
sightly differently. The smart <code>http://</code> protocols are the same
as the <code>git://</code> protocol, with a different handshake, and split
over multiple post requests.</p>

<p>Git9 implements the git protocol in under 500 lines of C. The
full code is available on github, in
<a href="https://github.com/oridb/git9/blob/24abe6c00b6f65e7241763399fc72c043b7d9bbf/serve.c">serve.c</a>.
</p>

<p>The protocol look something like this for pushing:</p>

<pre>&lt;=w= 0030:	"git-fetch-pack /oridb/git9\0host=github.com\n"
=r=&gt; 0086:	"747e9e80f710c0b8bbd928080745915ad2493322 HEAD\n"
=r=&gt; 009d:	"747e9e80f710c0b8bbd928080745915ad2493322 refs/heads/master\n"
&lt;=w= 0076:	"747e9e80f710c0b8bbd928080745915ad2493322 dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1 refs/heads/master\0report-status\n"
&lt;=w= 0000
&lt;=w= <pack-data>
=r=&gt; 000e:	unpack ok
=r=&gt; 0019:	ok refs/heads/master
</pack-data></pre>

<p>And this for pulling:</p>

<pre>&lt;=w= 0030:	"git-upload-pack /oridb/git9\0host=github.com\n"
=r=&gt; 013b:	"dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1 HEAD\n"
=r=&gt; 003f:	"dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1 refs/heads/master\n"
=r=&gt; 0000
&lt;=w= 0032:	"want 5d761590cfdce23e4b17e94050b0776c8804d4a1\n"
&lt;=w= 0032:	"want 8f0eb1386a2c748cb7bf26917684479ff8c6d5b5\n"
&lt;=w= 0032:	"want dc4a9d467c6a28dab3927c8611a1bfbc571f1568\n"
&lt;=w= 0000
&lt;=w= 0033:	"have dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1\n"
&lt;=w= 0009:	"done\n"
=r=&gt; 0031:	"ACK dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1\n"
<pack-data>
</pack-data></pre>

<p>The git protocol consists of pkt-lines, which are strings with a
hex-formatted length prefix.  The length prefix includes itself.  So,
the string <code>"hi"</code> would be formatted as
<code>0006hi</code>. A zero lenth packet where the length prefix
is not included is special. This is called a 'flush packet', and
is used to terminate a phase of negotiation.</p>

<p> All negotiation is with these packet lines, at
which git flips over to pure binary mode to transfer a pack file
over.</p>

<p>In the <code>git://</code> protocol, the client always starts off
by saying which action it wants to do: Either it wants the server to
fetch a pack from the client, or it wants the server to upload a pack
to the client.  That's this line:</p><pre>&lt;=w= 0030:	"git-fetch-pack /oridb/git9\0host=github.com\n"
</pre>

<p>The upload side of this protocol is simpler on the server side so
we'll go through it first.</p>

<h3>pushing</h3>

<p>In the upload protocol, the server begins by sending a list of
references that the client may update. In <code>git/serve</code>
we grab all the refs in the repository, and filter down to just
the ones beginning with <code>heads/</code>.</p>

<pre>	if((nrefs = listrefs(&amp;refs, &amp;names)) == -1)
		sysfatal("listrefs: %r");
	for(i = 0; i &lt; nrefs; i++){
		if(strncmp(names[i], "heads/", strlen("heads/")) != 0)
			continue;
		if(fmtpkt(c, "%H refs/%s\n", refs[i], names[i]) == -1)
			goto error;
	}
	if(flushpkt(c) == -1)
		goto error;
</pre>

<p>With the first phase of the protocol, the client then
sends the list of references it wants to update. This
takes the form of:</p>

<pre>	OLDHASH NEWHASH heads/refs/updateme\n"
</pre>

<p>Because the client knows what the reference versions are on
the server, it can compute what commits are between the version
on the server and the version that it has. If the new hash
is the zero hash, this signals to the server that the reference
should be deleted. This list of updates is terminated with a
flush packet. The code in git9 that handles this is below:

</p><pre>	while(1){
		/* Did we get a packet? */
		if((n = readpkt(c, pkt, sizeof(pkt))) == -1)
			goto error;
		/* Was it a flush packet? */
		if(n == 0)
			break;
		/* Split it up into the 3 parts: old, new, reference */
		if(getfields(pkt, sp, nelem(sp), 1, " \t\n\r") != 3){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR  protocol garble %s\n", pkt);
			goto error;
		}
		/* verify that these are valid hashes */
		if(hparse(&amp;old, sp[0]) == -1){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR bad old hash %s\n", sp[0]);
			goto error;
		}
		if(hparse(&amp;new, sp[1]) == -1){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR bad new hash %s\n", sp[1]);
			goto error;
		}
		/* and valid refs */
		if(!validref(sp[2])){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR invalid ref %s\n", sp[2]);
			goto error;
		}
		/* and then remember them for when we do the update */
		*cur = erealloc(*cur, (*nupd + 1)*sizeof(Hash));
		*upd = erealloc(*upd, (*nupd + 1)*sizeof(Hash));
		*ref = erealloc(*ref, (*nupd + 1)*sizeof(Hash));
		(*cur)[*nupd] = old;
		(*upd)[*nupd] = new;
		(*ref)[*nupd] = estrdup(sp[2]);
		*nupd += 1;
	}
</pre>

<p>Next, the client uploads the pack. This is a blob containing
the commit data. It goes into <code>.git/objects/packs/recv-$pid.pack</code>,
at least until we can index it and rename it.</p>

<pre>	while(1){
		n = read(c-&gt;rfd, buf, sizeof(buf));
		if(n == 0)
			break;
		if(n == -1 || write(pfd, buf, n) != n)
			return -1;
		packsz += n;
	}
	if(checkhash(pfd, packsz, &amp;h) == -1){
		dprint(1, "hash mismatch\n");
		goto error1;
	}
	if(indexpack(packtmp, idxtmp, h) == -1){
		dprint(1, "indexing failed\n");
		goto error1;
	}
	if(rename(packtmp, idxtmp, h) == -1){
		dprint(1, "rename failed: %r\n");
		goto error2;
	}
</pre>

<p>Finally, we update the references. Note that we haven't
locked the repository yet. This is because none of the data
we have here can conflict: All objects are addressed by hash,
so a race would simply leave us with a duplicate hash in the
packfile. Eventually, a <code>git/repack</code> will clean
that up.</p>

<p>However, updating the references can conflict. So,
for updating the references, we acquire a lock file.
We then read all the references, make sure that they
match the old reference, and then write in the new
reference.</p>

<pre>	for(i = 0; i &lt; nupd; i++){
		if(resolveref(&amp;h, ref[i]) == 0 &amp;&amp; !hasheq(&amp;h, &amp;cur[i])){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR old ref changed: %s", ref[i]);
			goto error;
		}
		if((o = readobject(upd[i])) == nil){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR update to nonexistent hash %H", upd[i]);
			goto error;
		}
		if(o-&gt;type != GCommit){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR not commit: %H", upd[i]);
			goto error;
		}
		unref(o);
		if(snprint(refpath, sizeof(refpath), ".git/%s", ref[i]) == sizeof(refpath)){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR ref path too long: %s", ref[i]);
			goto error;
		}
		if((fd = create(refpath, OWRITE, 0644)) == -1){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR open ref: %r");
			goto error;
		}
		if(fprint(fd, "%H", upd[i]) == -1){
			close(fd);
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR upate ref: %r");
			goto error;
		}
		close(fd);
	}
</pre>

<p>And that's pushing.

</p><h3>pulling</h3>

<p>Pulling takes more work on the server side, because the
server needs to compute a reasonable packfile to send to
the client. The protocol itself is still fairly simple.</p>

<p>It begins the same way as pushing, by sending all the
branches that a client may want to obtain from the git
repository.</p>

<pre>=r=&gt; 013b:	"dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1 HEAD\n"
=r=&gt; 003f:	"dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1 refs/heads/master\n"
=r=&gt; 0000
</pre>

<p>The client then starts telling us what commits they want,
and what commits they have. This lets us find a graph difference
between the server and client graph, and generate a pack file
that contains few, if any, extraneous commits. </p>

<pre>&lt;=w= 0032:	"want 5d761590cfdce23e4b17e94050b0776c8804d4a1\n"
&lt;=w= 0032:	"want 8f0eb1386a2c748cb7bf26917684479ff8c6d5b5\n"
&lt;=w= 0032:	"want dc4a9d467c6a28dab3927c8611a1bfbc571f1568\n"
&lt;=w= 0000
&lt;=w= 0033:	"have dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1\n"
&lt;=w= 0009:	"done\n"
=r=&gt; 0031:	"ACK dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1\n"
</pre>

<p>Computing the commits that go into a pack is not always trivial.
The comits that the client may be on may have "bubbles" in the graph,
so simply walking back from the start of the graph to the commits
that the client has may end up walking around the commit, leading
to nearly the whole history of the repository being sent, instead
of just one or two commits.</p>

<p>Consider a repo where the server is ahead of the client, and
now the client is trying to pull the changes. The client has commits
<code>c</code>, and we're trying to compute a pack with only the
commits <code>o</code>.</p>


<pre>                o---o
               /     \
    --c---c---c---c---o---o &lt;-- server
                  ^
                client
</pre>

<p>The client does a git/pull, and sends that it has the
commit marked <code>[c]</code>. Since the server has
every commit the client does, and more, it can look at
all ancestors of the client commit. If we're smart, we
would, but a naive …</p></div>

					<div><p>Brent Morris eagerly studied the figures. Rows and rows of neatly arranged, entirely indecipherable markings, like hieroglyphs or Chinese hanzi, only written in Greek or Latin or Hebrew. In the center, a pyramid made of 14 rows of blocks encased the letter <em>S</em> with a horizontal line above it. Elsewhere on the page, which was taken from an obscure 19th-century text, appeared other illustrations: in one corner, an open book adorned with strange lettering; in another, a scroll surrounded by a skull, stars, and a crescent moon.</p><p>Other people had puzzled over the page before, reproduced in a volume titled <i>A History of Royal Arch Masonry</i>. And yet to Morris, it wasn’t bewilderment or frustration that seized him when he looked over the mysterious passage in the late 1970s. It was exhilaration.</p><p>No wonder: By day, Morris worked as a mathematical cryptologist for the National Security Agency, studying, developing, and breaking codes for secret government communications. In his free time, Morris was—and still remains—an active Freemason, a 33rd degree in the Scottish Rite, an editor of the <a href="https://scottishrite.org/media-publications/scottish-rite-journal/the-scottish-rite-journal/journals/"><i>Scottish Rite Journal</i></a>, a former master of the <a href="https://www.quatuorcoronati.com/">Quatuor Coronati</a> research lodge, and an affiliate of dozens of lodges and concordant bodies. So the case of the Masonic cipher spoke to both sides of his brain.</p><p>Of course, it wasn’t the first time Morris had encountered secret Masonic writings. For hundreds of years and across many countries, Masons have used codes to mask communications of various kinds. According to Masonic lore, the first such cipher was cut with a mallet and chisel and used by Hiram, the king of Tyre; Hiram Abif; and Solomon, the king of Israel. By the 17th century, references abounded to the “Masonic word” known only to members. “By the 1700s, this arcane knowledge was part of the mystique of the Masons,” Morris says.</p><p>French Masons in the 18th century further popularized this sort of clandestine writing, including use of the Pigpen cipher, which came to be known as the Masonic cipher and drew characters based on a tic-tac-toe or X-shaped grid. These simple substitution codes, in which a new figure or character replaces each letter of the alphabet, are crude and easy to break, Morris explains. Yet they provide just enough of a barrier to the noninitiate to safeguard a message—at least for a while. “It’s somewhat useful in that it lets you preserve secret information, but more important, it becomes a symbol of secrecy,” Morris says. “It’s like when you get the key to a city: It doesn’t really unlock anything.”</p><p>Such substitution ciphers proliferated through various grand lodges in the 19th and 20th centuries, and keys to many were even sold in guidebooks by Masonic publishers. Today the use of Masonic codes remains common, although in place of formal ciphers, ritual training manuals are often written in a sort of shorthand, or what Morris describes as an “aide-memoir.” “It provides a sort of casual security,” he says. “So if you left it on a coffee table or an airplane seat, anyone who picked it up would go, ‘Huh, what’s this?’” Morris explains their use this way: “Think about the lock on a door. Sometimes it’s not that strong, but all you need is something to keep the dog in the house.”</p><p>The cipher Morris encountered in <i>A History of Royal Arch Masonry</i>, part of a manuscript belonging to a Dr. Robert Folger of New York dated 1827, was altogether different. Where other Masonic ciphers used simple, mono-alphabetic substitutions, the Folger manuscript was far more complex. Each figure, or hieroglyph, seemed to be composed of several characters nestled into groups. Morris puzzled over the enigma, using his usual code-breaking techniques, but without luck. He referenced the Folger cipher in an <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0161-118391857766?needAccess=true&amp;">article on fraternal cryptography</a> he wrote for the summer 1978 issue of the NSA’s internal journal, <i>Cryptolog</i>, and at the same time shared it with a fellow cryptanalyst named Donald Bennett.</p></div>

					<div><div><p>Bennett <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/Portals/70/documents/news-features/declassified-documents/cryptologic-spectrum/unsolved_puzzle.pdf">attacked the cipher with zeal</a>—and a lot of patience. He started out by scanning the document for clues related to frequency. For instance, among characters grouped together inside a box, 42 percent included a horizontal line near the top. Surmising that the box stood for the first letter of the word and the line for the second, Bennett hypothesized that the line stood for the letter <i>E</i>, the most common letter in English (and the letter most frequently appearing as the second letter of a word). Then he searched for repeating digraphs, or pairs of strokes appearing together. In English, a common example is <i>Q-U</i>. That turned up a distinctive pairing in the text: a crescent-moon shape followed by a backward gamma figure. It couldn’t be <i>Q-U</i>, however, because in several instances it appeared at what Bennett determined must be the end of a word. (No English words end with <i>Q-U</i>.) But it did suggest another common pairing: <i>T-H</i>. By focusing on figures containing the likely <i>T-H </i>digraph, Bennett was able to zero in on what he believed was a four-letter word that read <i>TH_T</i>. The only possible word it could be was <i>THAT</i>. Armed with this knowledge, he now knew the symbol for the letter <i>A</i>—a single dot. Having shaken loose the letters <i>T</i>, <i>H</i>, <i>A</i>, and <i>E</i>, he was able to hunt for longer words.</p><p>Here, Bennett relied on Morris for additional hints.</p><p>In any text, there’s a coded element hiding in plain sight: the language itself. “There’s specialized terminology in just about everything,” Morris says. For instance, in an academic setting, correspondence is likely to contain references to <i>semesters</i>, <i>adjuncts</i>, <i>symposia</i>, or <i>deans</i>—all familiar enough English words, but rarely used outside a collegiate environment. For anyone who’s read through an uncoded Masonic writing, the experience of feeling overwhelmed by the lexicon is all too familiar. Words like <i>brethren</i>, <i>ashlar</i>, and <i>cowan </i>occur far more frequently within Freemasonry than outside it. Armed with a list of common Masonic terms, Bennett inferred that, for example, the frequently occurring figure he interpreted as <i>T_ _TH </i>was more likely to be <i>TRUTH </i>than, say, <i>TENTH</i>.</p><p>From there, more coded terms could be pried open. Bennett hunted for two-letter possibilities like <i>TO </i>and <i>OR</i>. Then three-letter words like <i>OUR </i>were within his grasp. Next he searched for double letters, as in <i>EFFORT</i>. On and on he went, picking apart each graphic for clues, cautiously making assumptions, testing them, and swapping in letters as they were revealed. Before long, he had 15 characters deciphered, then 20. Finally, he’d recovered the entire alphabet, along with several figures that represented common words like <i>AND</i>, <i>HIS</i>, and <i>THEY</i>.</p></div></div>

				<div>
					<div><div><p>In relatively short order, Bennett produced a rough translation of the manuscript, which read like a homily on the importance of the Bible as a guidebook for living—possibly a speech to be delivered to initiates. While the excerpt was not familiar to Morris as being from a regular Masonic degree, it seemed clearly related to the craft. In fact, the word <i>Masonry </i>appeared on line three, and the phrase <i>newly enrolled initiate </i>was used several times throughout. Reviewing it, Morris determined that the lecture must come from a Master Mason degree in a French-style lodge—a strange possession for a 19th century American Mason in New York.</p><p>Even with the text deciphered, the mystery felt unsolved. The <i>what </i>of the cipher had been cracked. The <i>why </i>remained.</p></div></div>

				<div>
					<div><div><p>So Morris took up the case again, trying to piece together information about the text’s purpose and its author. He knew that the manuscript had been recovered from a journal kept by a Robert Benjamin Folger, a New York physician and Freemason. On the title page, the journal reads that it should be bequeathed to a Brother Dr. Hans B. Gram, and that if he’s unable to take possession of it, it should pass to a Mr. Ferdinand Halsey, “to preserve the substance in his mind while he [committed] the manuscript to the flames.”</p><p>Morris began to research the mysterious Dr. Folger, combing through Masonic records and meeting minutes. The picture the materials painted was one of an enthusiastic, if somewhat freewheeling, Freemason.</p><p>Folger was born in 1803 in Hudson, New York, and moved to New York City in 1817, where he apprenticed to become an apothecary. In 1824, he was initiated at Fireman’s Lodge No. 368, and he set out on a dizzying campaign of Masonic endeavors. Two years after his first initiation, he joined the Jerusalem Chapter of the Royal Arch, was received in a council of the Royal and Select Masters, and was dubbed a Knight Templar in Columbia Encampment No. 1. Soon after, he helped launch a new and short-lived chapter of the Royal Arch, received the fourth through 32nd degrees of the Scottish Rite, and joined the Lafayette Chapter of the Rose Croix. At the time he wrote his cipher, Folger was senior warden of the newly chartered Zerubabel Lodge No. 242.</p><p>From there, Folger rose—and fell—rapidly through the various appendant bodies. Partly that was a result of his own almost boundless zeal for …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div></div></div>

                        <div><p>
                            There are a few reasons you may need to be able to prove who you are without revealing who you are.</p><p>
                            
                            Suppose you desire to share many different pieces of information online but must remain anonymous for security reasons. Since you are anonymous, you have no reputation online and therefore no trust or credibility.<br>
                            You can release one piece of information that will later prove to be true, thus gaining credibility for yourself. People will now take your information seriously, except you were fully anonymous, so that credibility is useless to you as you can't claim it in the future when sharing future information.<br>
                            What's worse, others may impersonate you, claiming to be the original author of the first piece of information, and then share bad information thus soiling all of the credibility you built up.</p><p>
                            
                            With AnoProof you can sign your first piece of information with an AnoProof signature using your AnoProof secret key.<br>
                            Now, once it gains credibility, you can sign your future informations with your same secret key.<br>
                            Using AnoProof, anyone can verify that the future information (signed) was authored by the same anonymous author as the original credible information.
                            </p></div><hr>
                            <p>
                            AnoProof doesn't always have to be used anonymously, another great use-case for AnoProof is in proving your known identity, online, in an ever increasing world of spoofing, deep-fakes, and general impersonation.</p><p>
                            
                            Consider the <a href="https://www.fedscoop.com/leoni-ag-email-scam-40-million-ceo-hack-september-2016/">case of Leoni AG</a>, in which the CEO instructed the CFO to wire transfer $40m to an offshore account, the only problem for the CFO, it wasn't a true eMail from the CEO, it was a hacker pretending to be the CEO.<br>
                            Had the company policy been that all instructions of such nature must be signed with an AnoProof signature, the CFO could have easily proven that the hackers weren't the CEO.</p><p>
                            
                            This example was just a simple eMail spoofing, but imagine a few years from now when DeepFakes, SIM spoofing, and a combination of other tools will allow a hacker to video call one of your employees, and pretend to be you not only with caller ID but visibly and audibly as well.<br>
                            Signing protocols like AnoProof will become more and more necessary in the identity verification crisis realm AI will bring us towards.</p><hr>
                            <p>
                            To use AnoProof, simply paste, verbatim, two messages that have AnoProof signatures, in the text boxes at the bottom of this page, then tap the 'Verify' button.</p><p>

He feels that he’s letting valuable time slip through the cracks, and perhaps now is the moment to do something about it.</p><p>After reviewing his financial situation and seeing that he has enough, he decides to take a deep breath and <a href="https://moretothat.com/take-the-leap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">make the leap</a>.</p><p>He hands in his resignation letter. It’s over. He packs up all his stuff, and gets into his car.</p><p>A rush of excitement takes hold.

If this is what it’s like to have Creativity with him all the time, then everyday would be an opportunity to get so much done.</p><p>Since Stan is a disciplined guy, he blocks out a set number of hours each day to sit down in front of his notebook and get to work. The first week of this new schedule runs smoothly – whenever it’s time to make something, Creativity is there and everything flows without question.</p><p>Stan manages to keep up this daily routine for a number of weeks, and everything is going well.</p><p>But one day, something weird happens.</p><p>Stan gets up, arrives at his workspace at his predetermined time, sits down to start, but then it hits him:</p><p>He has no clue what the hell he wants to make.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/B02-Looking-at-a-blank-page.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/B02-Looking-at-a-blank-page.png" alt="Looking at a blank page" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/B02-Looking-at-a-blank-page.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/B02-Looking-at-a-blank-page-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/B02-Looking-at-a-blank-page-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/B02-Looking-at-a-blank-page-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/B02-Looking-at-a-blank-page-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>This is strange. Not only is his mind blank, but he also can’t seem to locate his friend either.

Maybe it’s still sleeping?</p><p>Stan tries to go at it alone, but no matter how much he thinks, nothing substantive comes to mind.

He thinks to himself:</p><p><em>What was the point of quitting my job to do this, when I’m not spending 8 hours each day on it? I should have just kept my job and reserved this for the evenings like before. At this rate, I would be spending the same amount of hours on my creative work in both scenarios anyway…</em></p><p>Frustrated, Stan decides to spend the day at a nearby park, bringing a book with him to keep him company. He finds a nice, shaded bench on this beautiful sunny afternoon, sitting atop a small hill that overlooks a familiar city skyline. He’s been to this park many times before, but for some reason, today he feels compelled to take a closer look at his surroundings.</p><p>He surveys the landscape, and his eyes are drawn to the blades of grass that cushion the feet of humans and animals alike. The innumerable blades sway back and forth, dancing to the gentle rhythm of a wind that ebbs and flows. He can’t quite understand why this simple sight is so beautiful, yet he feels it viscerally.</p><p>Nostalgia then sweeps through him. He’s reminded of all the times his childhood friend would join him at this very park, chasing him through the patches of green that have now turned yellow. Those were simpler times, and even amidst the increasing complexities of life, their <a href="https://moretothat.com/are-you-my-friend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">friendship continued to grow</a>, and they remain best friends to this day.</p><p>Thinking about this, Stan decides to pick up the phone and give him a call.

Why didn’t Creativity show up when he needed it most, and instead it’s showing up when he’s getting ready for bed?</p><p>Matter of fact, what’s Creativity’s deal here?! Why has it been perpetually absent over the past few days? Has it been avoiding him the whole time?</p><p>These are all interesting questions, but in asking them, Stan is missing something important here:</p><p>He is unaware that <span><strong>creating things is just a small part of what Creativity is all about</strong></span>.</p><p>Stan believes that Creativity starts and ends with the time they spend working on things with each other. That it lives in the space between the moment he opens his notebook and the time he closes it.</p><p>But in reality, that’s only the final stage of Creativity’s entire routine.</p><p>Most of Creativity’s time is spent following Stan around as he lives his day-to-day life. Even if Stan doesn’t realize it, Creativity is always in the background, observing what he’s doing and taking note of everything that’s going on. Whether it arrives in the form of experience or knowledge, Creativity is there to document whatever is happening at various times.</p><p>For example, when Stan was at the park, speaking with his childhood friend about the course of their lives, Creativity was there to take note of what he was thinking:</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/E01-Creativity-observing-at-the-park.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/E01-Creativity-observing-at-the-park.png" alt="Creativity taking notes at the park" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/E01-Creativity-observing-at-the-park.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/E01-Creativity-observing-at-the-park-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/E01-Creativity-observing-at-the-park-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/E01-Creativity-observing-at-the-park-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/E01-Creativity-observing-at-the-park-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>Whenever Stan is enjoying a book and engaging with the author in this way, Creativity is there to keep track of what he’s learning:</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/F01-Creativity-while-reading.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/F01-Creativity-while-reading.png" alt="Creativity taking notes while reading book" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/F01-Creativity-while-reading.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/F01-Creativity-while-reading-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/F01-Creativity-while-reading-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/F01-Creativity-while-reading-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/F01-Creativity-while-reading-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>And even when Stan was at his <a href="https://moretothat.com/pointless-job/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">boring old job</a>, Creativity was there observing what he was pondering.

The first word you write is a distillation of the knowledge you’ve accumulated over time. The first brushstroke you paint is a reimagining of the experiences you’ve stored somewhere in the mind.</p><p>While Stan was working at his old job, Creativity was building out an extensive list for him. But since he wasn’t investing the time necessary to compress it regularly, the list went largely untouched. A vast resource was accumulating, but nothing was processed or cultivated.</p><p>So when Stan first left his job, this untapped list was essentially gifted to him. This is why Stan was able to spend entire weekdays making things with ease. There was so much to sift through, so much for him to distill.</p><p>But after weeks of output without adding any new experiences of his own, he soon had nothing left in the tank. When Stan arrived at his notebook that day to find Creativity missing, it wasn’t actually gone.</p><p>It was hovering in the background, hoping that Stan would give it reason to take out its notepad and document things for later.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/J01-Creativity-wanting-him-to-go-do-something.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/J01-Creativity-wanting-him-to-go-do-something.png" alt="Go and do something" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/J01-Creativity-wanting-him-to-go-do-something.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/J01-Creativity-wanting-him-to-go-do-something-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/J01-Creativity-wanting-him-to-go-do-something-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/J01-Creativity-wanting-him-to-go-do-something-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/J01-Creativity-wanting-him-to-go-do-something-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>We often glamorize Creativity as this whirlwind of activity that culminates in greatness.

internal workings of some of the core algorithms that underly Dolt's
implementation. The previous posts in this series were about:</p>

</ol>
<p>In this post, we explore the Merkle DAG structure underlying Dolt's
commit graph and table storage a little more, and investigate how push
and pull to remote repositories is implemented in Dolt.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>A Dolt repository contains any number of branches and tags, where each
branch or tag is a top-level reference to a particular commit. A
commit, in turn, points to a value of the database at that commit, and
0 or more parent commits. All data in the repository, the commits and
the table data, is stored in content-addressed <code>Chunk</code>s which in turn
can contain references to other <code>Chunk</code>s, forming a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle
DAG</a>. This was the example
of a three commit branch from our previous blog post on the commit
graph:</p>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>Dolt supports remotes, which means it can clone, push and pull branch
and tag references from a Dolt repository stored in
<a href="https://www.dolthub.com/">Dolthub</a> or in cloud storage like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">AWS
S3</a> or <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage">Google Cloud
Storage</a>. This blog post briefly
explores what Dolt remotes are and how they operate under the hood.</p>
<h2>A Dolt Remote</h2>
<p>A Dolt repository can have multiple remote repositories configured,
and each of these repositories can be fetched from and pushed to
separately. Each configured Dolt remote consists of three pieces of
configuration within a Dolt repository:</p>
<ol>
<li>The name of the remote. After a clone, this will be <code>origin</code>.</li>
<li>Configuration for a networked endpoint that implements a network
protocol that Dolt can use as a remote. Most commonly, this is the
GRPC API exported by <a href="https://doltremoteapi.dolthub.com/">https://doltremoteapi.dolthub.com</a> and a
Dolthub repository path like <code>Liquidata/image-net</code>.</li>
<li>Default fetch specs for the remote. After a clone, this will be
<code>refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*</code>, and most users never need to
interact directly with fetch specs.</li>
</ol>
<p>The fetch spec is the subtlest piece of the configuration, but it's
also fundamental to the way that remotes actually work. The above
fetch spec says: When we <code>fetch</code> from <code>origin</code>, create a new <code>ref</code> in
<code>refs/remotes/origin/...</code> for each ref we find in the remote at
<code>refs/heads/...</code>. <code>refs/heads/...</code> will be all the branches in the
remote, and so fetching from the remote will create corresponding refs
in our local repository for each branch in the remote repository. If
the remote had the branches <code>main</code>, <code>bh/agi</code> and <code>aaron/by-zip</code>, and
we fetched from it, Dolt would create the refs
<code>refs/remotes/origin/main</code>, <code>refs/remotes/origin/bh/agi</code> and
<code>refs/remotes/origin/aaron/by-zip</code>, each pointing at the corresponding
commits that the remote branches were pointing at when we ran the
<code>fetch</code>.</p>
<p>So the remotes <code>ref</code>s namespace is seperate from our local branches
namespace, and Dolt is keeping a copy of the branches that we fetch
from the remote locally. The only time that copy is updated, and the
only time we reference the remote generally, is when we run <code>dolt
fetch</code> (or <code>dolt pull</code>, which does a <code>fetch</code> and then <code>merge</code>). And
the fundamental operation involved in a <code>fetch</code> is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Contact the remote to list all the branches we will clone.</li>
<li>For each branch we will clone, update our local repository to
contain the referenced Commit <code>Chunk</code> and all <code>Chunk</code>s reachable from
it.</li>
<li>Set a corresponding <code>ref</code> in our local repository to point to the
newly fetched Commit <code>Chunk</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Step #2 is where all the missing data actually gets copied into our
local repository. Let's take a look at exactly how that happens.</p>
<h2>Chunk Stores and DAG Traversals</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, all the data in the repository, both Commits and
the table data, is stored in these content-addressed variable sized
blocks called <code>Chunk</code>s. A storage abstraction exists in the Dolt
storage layer called a <code>ChunkStore</code>, which is a place where we can
read, and potentially write, chunks.</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>package</span> chunk

<span>type</span> Address <span>[</span><span>20</span><span>]</span><span>byte</span>

<span>type</span> Chunk <span>interface</span> <span>{</span>
    
    <span>Refs</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span>Address
    
    <span>Bytes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>byte</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>type</span> Store <span>interface</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Has</span><span>(</span>addr Address<span>)</span> <span>bool</span>
    <span>Get</span><span>(</span>addr Address<span>)</span> Chunk
    <span>Put</span><span>(</span>contents Chunk<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can create a <code>Store</code> implementation for a remote repository which
is hosted in DoltHub, and we have a <code>Store</code> implementation for our
local repository as well. A simple recursive DAG walk to copy a given
commit (or any <code>Chunk</code> with all of its children) into our local
repository looks like:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>CopyChunks</span><span>(</span>to<span>,</span> from Store<span>,</span> a Address<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>if</span> <span>!</span>to<span>.</span><span>Has</span><span>(</span>a<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
		c <span>:=</span> from<span>.</span><span>Get</span><span>(</span>a<span>)</span>
		<span>for</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> r <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> c<span>.</span><span>Refs</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
			<span>Fetch</span><span>(</span>to<span>,</span> from<span>,</span> r<span>)</span>
		<span>}</span>
		to<span>.</span><span>Put</span><span>(</span>c<span>)</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This approach already has some nice properties. Ideally, if a <code>Chunk</code>
is in a <code>Store</code>, all the <code>Chunk</code>s it references would also be in the
<code>Store</code>. We don't want our algorithm to persist any <code>Chunk</code>s to the
<code>Store</code> whose children we haven't already fetched and persisted,
because if the algorithm gets aborted halfway through the <code>Store</code>
could then be in an inconsistent state. So we're careful not to <code>Put</code>
the fetched <code>Chunk</code> until its children are persisted.</p>
<h2>Better Performance With Batching</h2>
<p>In Go, the recursion is not much of a concern because goroutines have
on-heap growable stacks. But if it is a concern, it's easy to
translate the call stack state into an explicit stack with on-heap
state as well.</p>
<p>The above algorithm has one glaring issue: it's very slow. If <code>from</code>
is a remote <code>Store</code>, then every <code>Get</code> is a round-trip RPC, and as
written there's no capacity for pipelining or batching. The simplest
solution is to make the batching explicit. We can give <code>Store</code> batch
methods, and make <code>CopyChunks</code> take a slice of <code>Address</code>es instead:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>type</span> Store <span>interface</span> <span>{</span>
    
    
    <span>HasMany</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>]</span>Address<span>)</span> <span>(</span>present<span>,</span> missing <span>[</span><span>]</span>Address<span>)</span>
    
    
    <span>GetMany</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>]</span>Address<span>)</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span>Chunk
    
    <span>PutMany</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>]</span>Chunk<span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>CopyChunks</span><span>(</span>to<span>,</span> from Store<span>,</span> as <span>[</span><span>]</span>Address<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>_</span><span>,</span> missing <span>:=</span> to<span>.</span><span>HasMany</span><span>(</span>as<span>)</span>
	chunks <span>:=</span> from<span>.</span><span>GetMany</span><span>(</span>missing<span>)</span>
	nextlevel <span>:=</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span>Address<span>{</span><span>}</span>
	<span>for</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> c <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> chunks <span>{</span>
		nextlevel <span>=</span> <span>append</span><span>(</span>nextlevel<span>,</span> c<span>.</span><span>Refs</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
	<span>}</span>
	<span>CopyChunks</span><span>(</span>to<span>,</span> from<span>,</span> nextlevel<span>)</span>
	to<span>.</span><span>PutMany</span><span>(</span>chunks<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>That improves the round-trips for remote clones substantially and
allows for better bandwidth utilization. But it introduces two new
flaws.</p>
<ol>
<li>Memory usage is potentially unwieldy. In the batched version, we're
holding a potentially large number of <code>Chunk</code>s in memory at every call
to <code>CopyChunks</code>, and we're making a call to <code>GetMany</code> with an
unbounded number of <code>Address</code>es. Previously we were only holding one
<code>Chunk</code> in memory at each level of the call.</li>
<li>It potentially fetches the same <code>Chunk</code>s from <code>from</code> multiple
times. Two different length paths through the DAG to the same <code>Chunk</code>
will have <code>to.HasMany()</code> returning <code>missing</code> for the same <code>Chunk</code>
multiple times, with consequent calls to <code>GetMany()</code> with the same
addresses.</li>
</ol>
<p>Addressing those actually gets somewhat complicated. In Dolt, for #1
we form explicit RPC batches and write the fetched <code>Chunk</code>s to
temporary chunk files so that they don't have to stay in memory. The
temporary files are constructed so that they can be cheaply integrated
into the <code>to</code> <code>Store</code> when all their dependencies are
persisted. Addressing #2 involves adding a little bit of book keeping
across recursive calls.  But perfect behavior with regards to case #2
is actually a tradeoff between the batch sizes and memory usage. Once
the chunk from a higher level leaves memory and goes into the
temporary chunk file, it needs to be refetched from the remote or from
the disk in order to be incorporated in the <code>to</code> <code>Store</code> earlier than
its peers.</p>
<h2>Fetch and Push</h2>
<p>It's neat that the above algorithm works great whether operation is a
<code>push</code> or a <code>fetch</code>. If the remote <code>Store</code> is <code>from</code>, we're doing a
<code>fetch</code> and we will get new chunks from the remote into our local
<code>Store</code>. But we can also make the remote <code>Store</code> <code>to</code>, in which case
its a <code>push</code>—the remote <code>Store</code> gets the new <code>Chunk</code>s that were
unique to our local <code>Store</code>. In either case, once all the <code>Chunk</code>s are
persisted in the <code>to</code> <code>Store</code>, we can update any <code>refs</code> appropriately,
setting them to point to the newly persisted commit <code>Chunk</code>s based on
the operation we're performing and the fetch/push specs as
appropriate.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Dolt remotes are a powerful feature that allows for data
synchronization, collaboration and easily maintaining local changes
while tracking upstreams. Underlying the feature is a simple model for
how to build up the commit graph and the table data as a merkle DAG of
content addressed chunks. Building on top of that model allows for
<code>push</code> and <code>fetch</code> to be both be implemented by the same elegant DAG
walk. At the same time, practical engineering and performance concerns
introduce an opportunity for tradeoffs and optimization. Hopefully
we've given you some insight into the ways that Dolt approaches and
solves the issues underlying its implementation.</p></div></div>]]>

    <h2 id="just-for-fun">Just For Fun</h2>

<p>I finally managed to get a complete piglit run over the weekend, and, for my own amusement, I decided to check the timediffs against a reference run from the IRIS driver. Given that the Intel drivers are of extremely high quality (and are direct interfaces to the underlying hardware that I happen to be using), I tend to use ANV and IRIS as my references whenever I’m trying to debug things.</p>

<p>Both runs used the same base checkout from mesa, so all the core/gallium/nir parts were identical.</p>

<p>The results weren’t what I expected.</p>

<p>My expectation when I clicked into the timediffs page was that zink would be massively slower in a huge number of tests, likely to a staggering degree in some cases.</p>

<p>We were, but then also on occasion we weren’t.</p>

<p>As a final disclaimer before I dive into this, I feel like given the current state of people potentially rushing to conclusions I need to say that <strong>I’m not claiming zink is faster than a native GL driver</strong>, only that <strong>for some cases, our performance is oddly better than I expected</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
<p><img src="https://zmike.github.io/assets/piglit-misc-bench.png" alt="piglit-misc-bench.png"></p>

<p>The first thing to take note of here is that IRIS is massively better than zink in successful test completion, with a near-perfect 99.4% pass rate compared to zink’s measly 91%, and that’s across 2500 more tests too. This is important also since timediff only compares between passing tests.</p>

<p>With that said, somehow zink’s codepath is significantly faster when it comes to dealing with high numbers of varying outputs, and also, weirdly, a bunch of <code>dmat4</code> tests, even though they’re both using the same softfp64 path since my icelake hardware doesn’t support native 64bit operations.</p>

<p>I was skeptical about some of the numbers here, particularly the <code>ext_transform_feedback</code> <code>max-varying-arrays-of-arrays</code> cases, but manual tests were even weirder:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>time MESA_GLSL_CACHE_DISABLE=true MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=zink bin/ext_transform_feedback-max-varyings -auto -fbo

MESA_GLSL_CACHE_DISABLE=true MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=zink  -auto -fbo  2.13s user 0.03s system 98% cpu 2.197 total
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>time MESA_GLSL_CACHE_DISABLE=true MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=iris bin/ext_transform_feedback-max-varyings -auto -fbo

MESA_GLSL_CACHE_DISABLE=true MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=iris  -auto -fbo  301.64s user 0.52s system 99% cpu 5:02.45 total
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>wat.</p>

<p>I don’t have a good explanation for this since I haven’t dug into it other than to speculate that ANV is just massively better at handling large numbers of varying outputs.</p>

<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>

<p>By contrast, zink gets thrashed pretty decisively in <code>arb_map_buffer_alignment-map-invalidate-range</code>, and we’re about <strong>150x slower</strong>.</p>

<p>Yikes. Looks like that’s going to be a target for some work since potentially an application might hit that codepath.</p>

<h2 id="the-weird">The Weird</h2>
<p><img src="https://zmike.github.io/assets/piglit-fp64-bench.png" alt="piglit-fp64-bench.png"></p>

<p>Somehow, zink is noticeably slower in a bunch of other fp64 tests (and this isn’t the full list, only a little over half). It’s strange to me that zink can perform better in certain fp64 cases but then also worse in others, but I’m assuming this is just the result of different shader optimizations happening between the drivers, shifting them onto slightly less slow parts of the softfp64 codepath in certain cases.</p>

<p>Possibly something to look into.</p>

<p>Probably not in too much depth since softfp64 is some pretty crazy stuff.</p>

<h2 id="in-closing">In Closing</h2>
<p>Tests (and especially piglit ones) are not indicative of real world performance.</p>

<p>CMake is known as a <strong>meta build system</strong>. It doesn't actually build your source code: instead, it generates native project files for the target platform. For example, CMake on Windows will produce a <em>solution</em> for Visual Studio; CMake on Linux will produce a Makefile; CMake on macOS will produce a project for XCode and so on. That's what the word <em>meta</em> stands for: CMake builds build systems.</p>
<p>A project based on CMake always contains the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file. This special text file describes how the project is structured, the list of source files to compile, what CMake should generate out of it and so on. CMake will read the instructions in it and will produce the desired output. This is done by the so-called <strong>generators</strong>, CMake components responsible for creating the build system files.</p>
<p>Another nice CMake feature is the so-called <strong>out-of-source build</strong>. Any file required for the final build, executables included, will be stored in a separated build directory (usually called <code>build/</code>). This prevents cluttering up the source directory and makes it easy to start over again: just remove the build directory and you are done.</p>
<h2>A toy project to work with</h2>
<p>For this introduction I will be using a dummy C++ project made up of few source files:</p>
<pre><code>myApp/
    src/
        engine.hpp
        engine.cpp
        utils.hpp
        utils.cpp
        main.cpp
</code></pre>
<p>To make things more interesting, later on I will spice up the project with an external dependency and some parameters to pass at build stage to perform conditional compilation. But first let's add a <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file and write something meaningful in it.</p>
<h2>Understanding the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file</h2>
<p>A modern CMake's <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> is a collection of <strong>targets</strong> and <strong>properties</strong>. A target is a job of the building process or, in other words, a desired outcome. In our example, we want to build the source code into a binary executable: that's a target. Targets have properties: for example the source files required to compile the executable, the compiler options, the dependencies and so on. In CMake you define targets and then add the necessary properties to them.</p>
<p>Let's start off by creating the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file in the project directory, outside the <code>src/</code> directory. The folder will look like this:</p>
<pre><code>myApp/
    src/
        engine.hpp
        engine.cpp
        utils.hpp
        utils.cpp
        main.cpp
    CMakeLists.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Then open the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file with the editor of your choice and start editing it.</p>
<h2>Define the CMake version</h2>
<p>A <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file always starts with the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/cmake_minimum_required.html"><code>cmake_minimum_required()</code></a> command, which defines the CMake version required for the current project. This must be the first thing inside a <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file and it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>cmake_minimum_required(VERSION &lt;version-number&gt;)
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>&lt;version-number&gt;</code> is the desired CMake version you want to work with. Modern CMake starts from version 3.0.0 onwards: the general rule is to use a version of CMake that came out after your compiler, since it needs to know compiler flags, etc, for that version. Generating the project with a CMake older than the required version will result in an error message.</p>
<h2>Set the project name</h2>
<p>The second instruction a <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file must contain is the project name, defined by the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/project.html"><code>project()</code></a> command. This command may take multiple options such as the version number, the description, the homepage URL and much more. The full list is available in the documentation page. A pretty useful one is the programming language the project is written in, specified with the <code>LANGUAGES</code> flag. So in our example:</p>
<pre><code>project(myApp
    VERSION 1.0
    DESCRIPTION "A brief CMake experiment"
    LANGUAGES CXX)
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>CXX</code> stands for C++.</p>
<h2>Define the executable target</h2>
<p>We are about to add our first CMake target: the <em>executable</em>. Defined by the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_executable.html"><code>add_executable()</code></a> command, it tells CMake to create an executable from a list of source files. Suppose we want to call it <code>myApp</code>, the command would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>add_executable(myApp
    src/engine.hpp
    src/engine.cpp
    src/utils.hpp
    src/utils.cpp
    src/main.cpp)
</code></pre>
<p>CMake is smart enough to construct the filename according to the target platform conventions: <code>myApp.exe</code> on Windows, <code>myApp</code> on macOS and Linux and so on.</p>

<!-- internalpointers responsive -->
<h2>Set some target properties</h2>
<p>As said earlier, targets have properties. They are set by a bunch of commands that start with the <code>target_</code> suffix. These commands also require you to define the <strong>scope</strong>: how properties should propagate when you include the project into other CMake-based parent projects. Since we are working on a binary executable (not a library), nobody will include it anywhere so we can stick to the default scope called <code>PRIVATE</code>. In the future I will probably write another article about CMake libraries to fully cover this topic.</p>
<h3>Set the C++ standard in use</h3>
<p>Let's assume our dummy project is written in modern C++20: we have to instruct the compiler to act accordingly. For example, on Linux it would mean to pass the <code>-stdc++=20</code> flag to GCC. CMake takes care of it by setting a property on the <code>myApp</code> target with the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_compile_features.html"><code>target_compile_features()</code></a> command, as follows:</p>
<pre><code>target_compile_features(myApp PRIVATE cxx_std_20)
</code></pre>
<p>The full list of available C++ compiler features is available <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_gbl/CMAKE_CXX_KNOWN_FEATURES.html#prop_gbl:CMAKE_CXX_KNOWN_FEATURES">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Set some hardcoded preprocessor flags</h3>
<p>Let's also assume that our project wants some additional preprocessor flags defined in advance, something like <code>USE_NEW_AUDIO_ENGINE</code>. It's a matter of setting another target property with the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_compile_definitions.html"><code>target_compile_definitions()</code></a> command:</p>
<pre><code>target_compile_definitions(myApp PRIVATE USE_NEW_AUDIO_ENGINE)
</code></pre>
<p>The command will take care of adding the <code>-D</code> part for you if required, so no need for it.</p>
<h3>Set compiler options</h3>
<p>Enabling compiler warnings is considered a good practice. On GCC I usually go with the common triplet <code>-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic</code>. Such compiler flags are set in CMake with the
<a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_compile_options.html"><code>target_compile_options()</code></a> command:</p>
<pre><code>target_compile_options(myApp PRIVATE -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic)
</code></pre>
<p>However, this is not 100% portable. In Microsoft's Visual Studio for example, compiler flags are passed in a completely different way. The current setup works fine on Linux, but it's still not cross-platform: we will see how to improve it in a few paragraphs.</p>
<h2>Running CMake to build the project</h2>
<p>At this point the project is kind of ready to be built. The easiest way to do it is by invoking the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html"><code>cmake</code></a> executable from the command line: this is what I will do in the rest of this article. A graphical wizard is also available, which is usually the preferred way on Windows: the <a href="https://cmake.org/runningcmake/">official documentation</a> covers it in depth. On Unix <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ccmake.1.html"><code>ccmake</code></a> is also available: same thing for Windows but with a text-based interface.</p>
<p>As said earlier, CMake supports out-of-source builds, so the first thing to do is to create a directory — sometimes called <code>build</code> but the name is up to you — and go in there. The project folder will now look like this:</p>
<pre><code>myApp/
    build/
    src/
        engine.hpp
        engine.cpp
        utils.hpp
        utils.cpp
        main.cpp
    CMakeLists.txt
</code></pre>
<p>From inside the new folder invoke the CMake as follows:</p>
<pre><code>cmake ..
</code></pre>
<p>This will instruct CMake to read the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file from above, process it and churn out the result in the <code>build/</code> directory. Once completed, you will find your generated project files in there. For example, assuming I'm running CMake on Linux, my <code>build/</code> directory will contain a <code>Makefile</code> ready to be run.</p>
<p>What we have seen so fare is a barebone yet working CMake configuration. We can do better, though: keep reading for additional improvements.</p>
<h2>Add multiplatform support: Linux, Windows and macOS</h2>
<p>CMake gives you the ability to detect which platform you are working on and act accordingly. This is done by inspecting <code>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</code>, one of the many variables that CMake defines internally. CMake also supports <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/if.html">conditionals</a>, that is the usual if-else combination. With this tools in place, the task is pretty easy. For example, assuming we want to fix the portability issue we had before with the compiler options:</p>
<pre><code>if (CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME STREQUAL "Windows")
    target_compile_options(myApp PRIVATE /W4)
elseif (CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME STREQUAL "Linux")
    target_compile_options(myApp PRIVATE -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic)
elseif (CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME STREQUAL "Darwin")
    # other macOS-specific flags for Clang
endif()
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how <code>STREQUAL</code> is the CMake way for comparing strings. A list of possible <code>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</code> values is available <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/-/wikis/doc/tutorials/How-To-Write-Platform-Checks#cmake-system">here</a>. You can also check for additional information such as the operating system version, the processor name and so on: full list <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-variables.7.html#id2">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Passing command line variables to CMake</h2>
<p>In our current configuration we have a hardcoded preprocessor definition: <code>USE_NEW_AUDIO_ENGINE</code>. Why not giving users the ability to enable it optionally while invoking CMake? You can do it by adding the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/option.html"><code>option()</code></a> command anywhere in the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file. The syntax is the following:</p>
<pre><code>option(&lt;variable&gt; "&lt;help_text&gt;" [value])
</code></pre>
<p>The optional <code>[value]</code> can be <code>ON</code> or <code>OFF</code>. If omitted, <code>OFF</code> is used. This is how it would look like in our dummy project:</p>
<pre><code>option(USE_NEW_AUDIO_ENGINE "Enable new experimental audio engine" OFF)
</code></pre>
<p>To use it, just run CMake as follows:</p>
<pre><code>cmake -DUSE_NEW_AUDIO_ENGINE=ON ..
</code></pre>
<p>or:</p>
<pre><code>cmake -DUSE_NEW_AUDIO_ENGINE=OFF ..
</code></pre>
<p>This is also how <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-variables.7.html">internal CMake variables</a> and other …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div href=""><p><em>Quantum</em> <em>entanglement</em> is, as you know, a phrase that's jam-packed with meaning in physics. But what you might not know is that the linear algebra behind it is quite simple.&nbsp;If you're familiar with singular value decomposition (SVD), then you're 99% there. My goal for this post is to close that 1% gap. In particular, I'd like to explain something called the<em> </em><strong>Schmidt rank</strong> in the hopes of helping the math of entanglement feel a little less... tangly. And to do so, I'll ask that you momentarily forget about the previous sentences. Temporarily ignore the title of this article. Forget we're having a discussion about entanglement. Forget I mentioned that word. And let's start over. Let's just chat math. </p><p>Let's talk about SVD. </p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5b527d2844acede360b8e7ae_hline.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>Singular Value Decomposition</h2><p>SVD is arguably one of the most important, well-known tools in linear algebra. You are likely already very familiar with it, but here's a lightning-fast recap. Every matrix $M$ can be factored as $M=UDV^\dagger$ as shown below, called the <strong>singular value decomposition</strong> of $M$. The entries of the diagonal matrix $D$ are nonnegative numbers called <em>singular values</em>, and the number of them is equal to the rank of $M$, say $k$. What's more, $U$ and $V$ have exactly $k$ columns, called the <em>left and right singular vectors</em>, respectively.</p><figure id="w-node-c5cffac943b5-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f5562528e82aa6ab6d78ae1_open.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>There are different ways to think about this, depending on which applications you have in mind. I like to think of singular vectors as encoding meaningful "concepts" inherent to $M$, and of singular values as indicating how important those concepts are. For instance, this perspective arises naturally in a study of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10531">learning dynamics of deep neural networks</a>. As another example, you can imagine a matrix whose rows are indexed by people, and whose columns are indexed by movies.&nbsp;The $ij$th entry could be a 0 or 1, indicating whether or not person $i$ has watched movie $j$. In an applied setting—a recommender system, for instance—one may wish to compute a <em>truncated SVD </em>of this matrix. Here, only the top largest singular values are kept. The rest are viewed as containing little information and are set to zero. In this way, the diagonal matrix $D$&nbsp;operates on a low-dimensional "feature space," which provides a nice way to <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/recommendation/collaborative/basics">compress and glean information about the data</a>.</p><p>Either way, I like to think of $D$ as providing a bridge between two worlds: information about the columns of $U$ (e.g. people) and information about the columns of $V$ (e.g. movies). Below is a very <em>non</em>-mathematical cartoon of this. You can imagine the thickness of the blue bridge relates to the number of singular values. Lots of singular values?&nbsp;The bridge is wide and lots of information passes through. Only a few singular values?&nbsp;The bridge is narrow and not much information gets through.</p><figure id="w-node-fc7a2c3b2624-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f55643d546e4a903f261c30_bridge2.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>An actual mathematical picture is found in a <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/matrices-as-tensor-network-diagrams">tensor network diagram</a> representation of SVD.&nbsp;There, $D$&nbsp;really is a bridge! As a visual cue, we might draw the edges adjacent to the blue node as very thick if the number of singular values is large, and draw them to be thin otherwise. This again represents the idea of information "flowing" between systems described by $U$ and $V$.</p><figure id="w-node-235ea1f864dc-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f5564d7d7916c43e6f8c4ce_TN2.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Alternatively still, if you enjoy thinking of <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/matrices-probability-graphs">matrices as bipartite graphs</a>, then you might have in mind the graphs below. If we have lots of blue nodes—i.e. lots of singular values—then there are lots of pathways between the pink and green nodes (i.e. people and movies). But if we have only a <em>few</em> blue nodes—i.e. a few singular values—then there are fewer pathways between pink and green.</p><figure id="w-node-9ef538caa942-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f577be8bc99498290bfcb81_graph2.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Either way we wish to visualize it, the role of the singular values—that is, the role of the diagonal matrix $D$—is key. Intuitively, they indicate the amount of "interaction" between the information stored by $U$ and $V$, and they mediate how those interactions contribute to the information represented by the original matrix $M$.</p><p><em>And this precisely idea behind the mathematics of entanglement</em>.</p><p>In the context of physics, one simply applies SVD to a particular matrix and then looks at the number of nonzero singular values of that matrix. This is the main idea behind something called the <em>Schmidt rank</em> of a quantum state (explained below), which is an integer that indicates how much entanglement is present. </p><blockquote>Entanglement is measured by the number of nonsingular values of a particular matrix. </blockquote><p>So what makes a physicist's application of SVD different from that of, say, someone building a movie recommender system?&nbsp;Well, in physics, your matrix $M$ presumably encodes information about a physical system and takes spatial considerations into account (ex. particles in a lattice). Its entries may also contain complex numbers, and the sum of their squares should satisfy $\sum_{ij}|M_{ij}|^2=1$. In this case—as I'll explain below—$M$ represents a <strong>quantum state</strong>. But lingo aside, the template is much the same: singular values convey important information about how two things—whether users and movies, or two quantum subsystems—are related.</p><p>I could stop here, but I'd like to dig a little deeper. In the next section, let me restate this punchline using slightly more specialized language.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5b527d2844acede360b8e7ae_hline.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>Singular Values vs. Schmidt&nbsp;Rank</h2><p>To start, let's back up a bit. In a discussion of physics, what exactly is the matrix to which we apply SVD?&nbsp;In the opening example, we applied SVD to a user-by-movie matrix. But what's going on now?</p><p>Rather than starting with a matrix, we instead start with a <em>unit vector</em>. To that end, suppose $\psi$ is any unit vector in a <strong>tensor product</strong> of vector spaces $\mathbb{C}^n\otimes\mathbb{C}^m$. Here, it's important that our discussion takes place in a tensor product. After all, entanglement is defined <em>between two things</em> (So, if someone were to ask you, "How much entanglement is there?" one proper response would be, "Entanglement <em>between</em> <em>what</em>?"), and in quantum mechanics, the tensor product is the mathematical operation used to combine two systems. Now, if the phrase "tensor product" is unfamiliar to you, I recommend the article "<a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/the-tensor-product-demystified">The Tensor Product, Demystified</a>." I&nbsp;think you'll be pleasantly surprised at how easy the concept is!</p><p>Alright, now that we have the vector $\psi$, it's easy to get a linear map $\mathbb{C}^m\to\mathbb{C}^n$ from it. Simply reshape the entries of $\psi$ into an $n\times m$ matrix $M$. (Said more formally, look at $\psi$&nbsp;under the isomorphism $A\otimes B^*\cong\text{hom}(B,A)$ for finite-dimensional vector spaces $A$&nbsp;and $B$.)</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f5517185b36106928a313a9_reshape.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>In the language of physics, $\psi$ is called a <strong>quantum state</strong>, and $M$&nbsp;is simply the matrix associated with it. More generally, the terms&nbsp;"unit vector" and "quantum state" are synonymous. That's because the squares of the entries of any unit vector define a probability distribution, and—in the context of physics—that probability distribution tells you about the <em>state</em> of the system you're studying. (This is the Born rule.)</p><p>But I&nbsp;digress. Let's get back to SVD.</p><p>Suppose the singular value decomposition of our matrix $M$ is given by $UDV^\dagger$. Here I'm using the dagger to denote the conjugate transpose of $V$ since we're allowing $M$ to have complex entries. Now I'd like to use this decomposition&nbsp;to rewrite $M$ in a slightly messier way. Let $\mathbf{u}_i$ and $\mathbf{v}_i$ denote the $i$th columns of $U$ and $V$, respectively, and let $d_i$ denote the $i$th singular value of $M$. Then we can expand the matrix $M$ as the following sum, where $k$&nbsp;is the rank of $M$. </p><figure id="w-node-dc0fefa9bd0b-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f556da578cb1b3bbc952fdd_expand2.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>We're almost at the punchline, but let me first introduce a definition and then make one final cosmetic change.</p><p>For any two vectors $\mathbf{u}$&nbsp;and $\mathbf{v}$, the matrix $\mathbf{uv}^\dagger$ is called their <strong>outer product</strong>. This simple operation is also denoted with a tensor product symbol $\mathbf{u}\otimes \mathbf{v}$ or in physicists' bra-ket notation by $|u\rangle\langle v|$. So for example, if $\mathbf{u}=\begin{bmatrix}1&amp;2&amp;3\end{bmatrix}^\top$ and $\mathbf{v}=\begin{bmatrix}4&amp;5\end{bmatrix}^\top$, then their outer product is the following little matrix.</p><figure id="w-node-c2af2f15f3fb-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f551c63f2d18fc4ccbcb28b_outer.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Why introduce this?&nbsp;Let's think back that expansion of $M$&nbsp;above. Under the correspondence $\mathbf{uv}^\dagger \leftrightarrow \mathbf{u}\otimes \mathbf{v}$, we can write $\psi$&nbsp;explicitly using the columns of $U$ and $V$, weighted by the singular values of $M$ like this:</p><figure id="w-node-3ff996165bf0-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f556f9788b112261c051ef6_decomp0.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>At this point, you might think we haven't done much (and we haven't, really), <em>and yet</em> familiar things are now given <em>new names</em>. In the context of physics, the above decomposition of $\psi$ is called its <strong>Schmidt decomposition</strong>. The integer $k$, which is the rank of the original matrix $M$, is called its <strong>Schmidt rank</strong>. And the singular values $d_1,d_2,\ldots, d_k$ are called its <strong>Schmidt coefficients.</strong></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f556fb589f1f866fb28a990_decomp1.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Although terminology is new, the ingredients aren't. And that's the punchline.</p><blockquote>Punchline: the quantum state $\psi$ is said to be <strong>entangled</strong> if its Schmidt rank&nbsp;(i.e. number of singular values) is strictly greater than 1, and is <strong>not entangled</strong> otherwise.</blockquote><p>So, do you see the connection with our discussion above? As we stressed earlier, singular values can be thought of as providing a "bridge" between two subsystems. They are a measure of how much interaction exists between them. In the context of physics, this interaction is understood as entanglement.</p><p>The upshot is that a large number of singular values—i.e. a high Schmidt rank or a "wide bridge"—corresponds to lots of communication between two subsystems. A small number of singular values—i.e. a low Schmidt rank or a "narrow bridge"—corresponds to little communication. At the lowest extreme, <em>one</em> singular value corresponds to <em>zero</em> entanglement, and we might as well omit the thin bridge in the image below.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f559310bc99491aa62d994a_zero1.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Indeed, notice that if the Schmidt rank of $\psi$ is equal to <em>one</em>—that is, if $M$&nbsp;is a rank one matrix $M=\mathbf{uv}^\dagger$—then we can write $\psi=\mathbf{u\otimes v}$. In the mathematics literature, vectors of this form (i.e. a tensor product of vectors) are sometimes called <strong>simple tensors</strong>.&nbsp;For this reason, some mathematicians associate entanglement with "linear combinations of …</p></div></div>

<p>Web scraping is that activity where a party uses automated software to crawl the internet and copy data and other content, usually so that it can compile that together and make its own product offering.  This may be of concern to you because you are a company that does web scraping. Or you may be a web publisher and there are other parties that are scraping your content. Let’s examine some of the legal issues around web scraping.</p>



<h3>Breach of contract</h3>



<p>One of the questions that commonly arises around web scraping is whether the activity is a breach of contract. More specifically, the question is whether the use of automated software violates the terms of service of the website that is being scraped. You often see website terms of service prohibit the use of spider and other automated crawling software to access and use the site. Parties who own websites that are being scraped will often look to see whether the scraping of their site is a breach of contract. </p>



<h3>Copyright infringement</h3>



<p>Another common question arising when analyzing web scraping is lawful whether scraping constitutes copyright infringement. This is a difficult argument to make if all that is being scraped is data, because mere facts usually are not subject to copyright protection. But if there is other content being scraped, such as images or specific compilations of data, the question of copyright infringement becomes a bit easier to answer in that unauthorized copying is an likely an infringement.</p>



<h3>Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</h3>



<p>The <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</a> is another topic that often comes up in discussions about web scraping. This is a federal law that makes it unlawful for a person to access a protected computer without authorization, or in excess of a specific authorization. So the question becomes whether that access by the automated web scraper violates the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. There are some important things that have to be proven for a plaintiff to succeed under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and one of those is loss or damage that results from the unauthorized access. It is a very fact intensive inquiry that has to be made,  but the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act is one thing that parties should think about in the context of web scraping. </p>



<h3>Trade secrets</h3>



<p>The question of trade secrets is another good one to raise in the context of web scraping. A trade secret is any information that a company has that gives that company a commercial advantage in the marketplace because it is secret. The information also has to be the subject of protective efforts — the company has to try to keep the information secret. For example, if information on a website is put there in a way that is behind certain protective barrier,s and the party doing the scraping circumvents those barriers, it could be that there is a misappropriation of trade secrets, particularly if that information is used for some competitive purpose. </p>



<h3>Let’s talk</h3>



<p>Web scraping legal issues can be complex. Scraping presents certain legal risks to the ones doing it, and the law provides certain powerful remedies when web scraping runs afoul of the rules.

            <p>Bad news: you’re in the meeting room.</p>
<p>You can distinctly see your team leader proposing the solution he had in mind for the next feature of your startup’s disrupting product.</p>
<p>“Great solution! Pretty easy to implement!”, you think. You only need to change two fields in the database, modify two or three existing features, and that’s all!</p>
<p>You give your estimation. Only two hours. After all, you did that so often. This feature won’t match your impressive skills! You will crush it, and everybody will praise you for generations.</p>
<p>Not so fast! I’m sorry, but you might have fallen into multiple cognitive biases, in only three minutes.</p>
<p>Did you ever create bugs or wrote nonsense because your certitudes and your self-confidence gave you wrong assumptions and wrong solutions? Don’t lie to me. I know you did. I did, too.</p>
<p>If not, you might not have a lot of experience yet. That’s fine. Be patient. It will happen.</p>
<p>This article is about our mistakes, caused by the most common and discussed cognitive biases in software development.</p>
<p>On today’s menu:</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ll learn what are cognitive biases and how they can pop up in our work, as software developers.</li>
<li>We’ll study more in details:
<ul>
<li>The optimistic bias</li>
<li>The overconfidence bias</li>
<li>The confirmation bias</li>
<li>Wishful thinking</li>
<li>The anchoring bias</li>
<li>The bandwagon effect</li>
<li>The cargo cult</li>
<li>The correspondence bias</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We’ll see different techniques to prevent these biases, to take more logical decisions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why is it important? If you think that programming is about languages and technobabble, you’re wrong. It’s about problem solving. When you solve problems, assumptions will mislead you. Cognitive bias will bring you a lot of them, on a platter.</p>
<p>The result: you’ll come up with wrong solutions. You’ll get lost on the wrong path. It’s not only about you, but about everybody else, too. You only need to be a human.</p>
<p>Depending on the project, the impact of biases can be completely different, from insignificant to dangerous for the survival of the project itself.</p>
<p>Let’s not wait longer. Come with me, I will show you what’s our enemy looks like, and how to bring it down with a sharp mind. Bim.</p>
<h2 id="whats-a-cognitive-bias">What’s a Cognitive Bias?</h2>
<p>Let’s open the sacrosanct <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/cognitive-bias" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cambridge dictionary</a> to find out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The way a particular person understands events, facts, and other people, which is based on their own particular set of beliefs and experiences and may not be reasonable or accurate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I explain briefly in my article about the <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/expert-blind-spot-software-development/">expert blind spot</a>, it’s easier for our cognitive system to reason about things by cutting details out, using already what we know. However, these details might be important, and our past believes and experience not adequate for the situation at hand.</p>










  
  
  
  





  


<blockquote>
  <p>Everyone takes the limit of his own vision for the limits of the world.</p>
  
</blockquote>

<p>There are no definitive cognitive biases codex, but we can roughly count more than 200 of them in psychology, sociology and management research.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, however, that there is a lack of study about interconnected bias, which means that some cognitive biases will be similar to one another. Plus, some of these biases might be more frequent when another one is already in action.</p>
<p>Be aware as well that there is a serious lack of consistency in the research papers.
Depending on the study, they will be called with different names, even if they refer to the same ideas, more or less.</p>

    <img src="https://thevaluable.dev/images/2020/cognitive-bias-software-development/easy-changing-db-tables.jpg" alt="Stop and thinks before saying it's easy">
</picture>



<p>The biases I choose to write about is mainly based on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328410759_Cognitive_Biases_in_Software_Engineering_A_Systematic_Mapping_Study" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this study</a> and my own experience.</p>
<p>I’ll explain:</p>
<ul>
<li>The biases themselves</li>
<li>In what context they can appear</li>
<li>Some technique to fight them (debiasing techniques).</li>
</ul>
<p>The most evident of these debiasing techniques is to point out the biases when somebody makes a mistake; however, it has been shown that blaming people for their bias, or showing them that they, personally, are victim of biases, won’t help.</p>
<p>Instead, try to show the biases creeping in specific task or situation.</p>
<p>This article can be useful as well for you to learn how to fight your own biases.</p>
<p>Debiasing techniques are no silver bullets. There is no strong evidence of their effectiveness: we lack studies about them. However, they are still useful guidelines to show you the good direction to take. See them as experiments you can try to take better, more logical decisions.</p>
<h2 id="the-optimistic-bias-and-the-overconfidence-bias">The Optimistic Bias and the Overconfidence bias</h2>
<p>The optimistic bias is this tendency to be unrealistically optimistic for events happening around us. This is a common and well documented bias in software development.</p>
<p>It can be linked to the overconfidence bias, which makes us utterly optimistic in our own skills and talents.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-optimism-look-like">What Does Optimism Look Like?</h3>
<p>Did you hear, during your career, one of your colleague developer claiming, without even checking the codebase, that a random new feature should <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/development-easy-just-simple/">be easy to implement and won’t take time</a>?</p>
<p>If you have a bit of experience as a developer, I’m sure you did. Developers have tendency to be optimistic when asking to estimate tasks.</p>
<p>In fact, studies show that technical persons, including developers, fall into the optimistic bias trap even more than anybody else!</p>
<p>How many of these estimates have proven to be wrong? How many times the work took more time than estimated? Yep. Too many.</p>
<p>The cherry on the cake: people have even tendency to be optimistic for hard tasks, and pessimistic for easy task. This is known as the hard-easy bias.</p>
<p>Optimistic bias will kick in as well more easily if the task is abstract and far in the future. It makes sense: we have all difficulties to project ourselves too far in the future. Even when we try, we’re often wrong.</p>
<p>This bias can be detrimental for estimations and for understanding the requirements of a task. The optimistic bias can whisper to you that you understood everything, even if you didn’t spend enough time to really assess all the nuances of the task.</p>
<p>This can lead to a superficial, or even incorrect, understanding of a situation, which will bring wrong implementations.</p>
<h3 id="debiasing-the-optimistic-bias">Debiasing the Optimistic Bias</h3>
<h4 id="ask-directed-questions">Ask Directed Questions</h4>
<p>To find out if an estimate is too optimistic, or to be sure you really understood everything, you can ask directed questions to your colleagues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you see any reason why your solution might be wrong?</li>
<li>Do you see anything which might cause problem?</li>
<li>Can you think about dependent features which are coupled to the one we modify?</li>
<li>Can we look at the codebase before giving our estimation?</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions try to put the optimistic affirmations on their heads. It will force people to reverse their way of thinking, and think about the difficult parts instead of the easy ones.</p>










  
  
  
  





      
      
      
    
     
      
    
    

    
    
         
         
         

         
        
        
        
        
        
        
      
      
    
  


<blockquote>
  <p>Optimism is an occupational hazard of programming; feedback is the treatment.</p>
  
</blockquote>

<h4 id="the-double-loop-learning">The Double Loop Learning</h4>
<p>Questioning your initial assumptions, or the ones from your colleagues, is always good, if it’s done for the good reason. The goal is not trying to be right whatever the cost, but to avoid biases.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-loop_learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">double loop learning</a> approach does exactly that. Basically, you can try to frame the problems differently, with another mental model than the primary one used.</p>
<p>Let’s take an example. One of your colleague tells you that changing every name of every table in your wonderful database is an easy task which takes 1 hour. After all, it’s only changing names!</p>
<p>You could easily answer that it will be done quickly. You’re a <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/software-developer-titles-junior-senior/">senior developer</a>, you know much about programming and you want people to know that, for you, changing a bunch of names is easy.</p>
<p>However, instead of thinking about changing simply names, let’s think about the database itself. How many tables does it have? Where these tables are queried in the source code, with their names hard-coded?</p>
<p>Changing the mental model, from thinking about simply a bunch of names to think about the database itself and where it’s queried, can change drastically the difficulty of the task, and its estimation!</p>
<h4 id="smaller-tasks-are-easier">Smaller Tasks Are Easier</h4>
<p>It’s true that estimating future features is hard. Estimating features which have 13647 sub-tasks and 82372 nuances is harder.</p>
<p>I will never stress it enough: if your features are big, break them down to the smaller unit you can, and push these units in production as often as you can. Even if the customers don’t want to see a tiny bit of a feature: you can put a switch on it and hide it to their eyes.</p>
<p>Estimations will become way easier, you’ll learn the joys of continuous deployment, you’ll have quick feedback on your possible over-optimistic estimations, and everybody will live happy for the rest of their lives.</p>
<h4 id="logging-the-estimations">Logging the Estimations</h4>
<p>I tried an experiment not long ago: logging my estimations. Each time I estimated a task, I would write it in my development journal. I did the same for my colleagues, too.</p>
<p>As expected, in the company I was working with, we were all very optimistic. It led me to always add 50% of my first estimation on top. Two days of work becomes three days.</p>
<p>I would encourage you to log your estimations too, and see for yourself if you are overly optimistic.</p>
<p>Another good idea: each time your estimations are wrong, ask yourself why. Did you forget some other features tight to the one you modified? Were you interrupted too much the last few days?</p>
<p>Finding the reasons can help you next time to fix the efficiency problems you might have faced.</p>
<h2 id="confirmation-bias-and-wishful-thinking">Confirmation Bias and Wishful Thinking</h2>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://kickstartcoding.online/learn/articles/i-converted-reactjs-org-to-use-hooks/">Last week we announced our adaptation of the ReactJS.org website to use all React Hooks examples and explanations</a>. This week I thought I would write a bit more about what it was like to make that conversion. The challenges getting set up, re-writing the explanations, and getting the examples adapted both on the website itself and in the linked CodePen examples.</p>
<p>ReactJS.org is built with Gatsby, and this was actually my first time using Gatsby for anything significant. All things considered it went pretty well, although I will probably wait to see if Gatsby’s leadership adequately addresses <a target="_blank" href="https://gist.github.com/gatsbyjs-employees/5b08b884be088bce54abaf4f980fbf7b">their horrific corporate culture issues</a> before deciding to use their tooling on any projects in the future.</p>
<p>Without further ado, let’s get into it.</p>
<h2>Getting Up and Running</h2>
<p>As it turns out, getting the ReactJS.org site running locally and deployed online is pretty straightforward. I had a couple of errors before I figured out I should be using <code>yarn</code> commands instead of <code>npm</code> commands, but after I figured that out, the basic yarn commands were all it took to get running:</p>

<p>Getting it deployed was as simple as wiring it up to Netlify and the letting Netlify handle the rest. It may have been the most straightforward process I've ever gone through for getting someone else’s project up and running.</p>
<h2>Converting the “Main Concepts” Pages to Hooks</h2>
<p>Once I had everything running, I decided to start the updates by adapting the "Main Concepts" pages one by one. The “Main Concepts” pages cover most basic React concepts, and since they are divided up into shorter, individual explanations, I figured starting with them would be a good way to assess how much work it would be to convert the entire site. At this point in the process, we were still in the ”Let’s see how much work it is to make these changes before committing to adapting the whole site” phase.</p>
<p>As it turned out, these conversions where mostly straightforward: converting class components to function components and adding the requisite <code>useState</code> calls was the majority of the work.</p>
<p>I was pretty excited from the start to see that almost every example got shorter as I updated it. There was no more need for constructors, no more need to explicitly bind component methods, no more <code>this</code>, and also no more weird technically-not-valid-JavaScript method declaration statements like this</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>handleClick</span> <span>=</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"Is handleClick a let? A const? A...var?"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>I also found that while some of the conceptual explanations did require some re-working, there were other sections I was able to get rid of entirely (for example, explanations of how <code>this</code> works).</p>
<p><img src="https://kickstartcoding.online/media-content/share/1597456981/383/" alt="a Git diff of removing an explanation of the “this” keyword"></p>
<p>Though there were a few times things got longer as well.</p>
<p><img src="https://kickstartcoding.online/media-content/share/1597456961/379/" alt="a Git diff of changing a three-step set of instructions to a four-step set of instructions"></p>
<p>Overall, most of changes I was making to the documentation seemed like evidence that the switch to hooks would make learning React an easier process for newbies than it had been before. And it was incredibly satisfying to watch almost all of the code examples get both shorter and easier to read.</p>
<p><img src="https://kickstartcoding.online/media-content/share/1597456966/380/" alt="a Git diff removing “this.state” from some code"></p>
<p><img src="https://kickstartcoding.online/media-content/share/1597456976/382/" alt="a Git diff of some React code getting shorter"></p>
<p><img src="https://kickstartcoding.online/media-content/share/1597456971/381/" alt="a Git diff of replacing a React constructor function with a useState call"></p>
<p>Converting the examples was mostly straightforward. The hardest part of converting the ”Main Concepts” documentation turned out to be converting the conceptual explanations. Changing the existing writing on things like constructors, <code>setState</code>, and <code>componentDidMount</code> to bits on <code>useState</code> and <code>useEffect</code>. But after a few drafts and re-drafts, I got those to a place where I felt like they worked reasonably well.</p>
<p>Converting the ”Advanced Guides” section turned out to be more difficult.</p>
<h2>Converting the “Advanced Guides” Pages to Hooks</h2>
<p>While converting the ”Main Concepts” section was pretty straightforward, converting the ”Advanced Guides” pages required a lot more working through tricky code constructs and techniques.</p>
<p>Some advanced React concepts, like <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html#introducing-error-boundaries">error boundaries</a>, don’t exist in hooks at all. Others, like <a target="_blank" href="https://reactwithhooks.netlify.app/docs/context.html#updating-context-from-a-nested-component">context updating</a>, or <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#forceupdate">the <code>forceUpdate</code> function</a>, do exist but are more awkward to use via hooks. Some, including error boundaries, I decided to remove entirely. Others, like <code>forceUpdate</code>, I searched around a bit and was able to find <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#is-there-something-like-forceupdate">explanations of how to update them for a hooks context</a>.</p>
<p>I dedicated <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kickstartcoding/reactjs.org/tree/convert-all-to-hooks#unresolved-issues-with-modifying-the-docs-to-be-100-hooks">a section of the README</a> to listing things I couldn’t figure out and worked my way as best I could through the rest. Fortunately, the advanced concepts that were the most trouble to adapt were mostly concepts that aren’t used very much by beginners.</p>
<p>The hardest part was probably the ”Integrating with Other Libraries” page. It’s been seven years or so since I’ve tried to do anything with Backbone.js. I still haven’t figured out a working conversion of <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/integrating-with-other-libraries.html#extracting-data-from-backbone-models">the “Extracting Data from Backbone Models” section of that page on ReactJS.org</a>, but I did manage to get a somewhat weird working version of <a target="_blank" href="https://reactwithhooks.netlify.app/docs/integrating-with-other-libraries.html#using-backbone-models-in-react-components">the “Using Backbone Models in React Components” section</a> cobbled together after much tinkering.</p>
<p>For a while as I was working on the “Main Concepts” and the “Advanced Guides” sections, I worked on converting the code examples on the documentation pages, but ignored the CodePen-based examples. Those I decided to comment out and save for later. Eventually, though, especially as I got to working on converting the “build a tic-tac-toe game” tutorial pages, it got harder to put those conversions off.</p>
<h2>Converting the CodePen Examples</h2>
<p>One of the first things I realized when I started converting the CodePen examples was that the React CDN used by CodePen doesn’t expose hooks functions directly. Everywhere I used functions like <code>useState</code> or <code>useEffect</code> on the documentation pages, I had to use <code>React.useState</code> and <code>React.useEffect</code> on CodePen. For a while I just dealt with this by peppering my code with <code>React.</code> statements, but after a while I decided to do some fiddling to see if there was a better way.</p>
<p><code>import</code> and <code>require</code> statements are not available on CodePen, so that wasn’t an option. I briefly experimented with setting the hooks functions as constants at the top of each example, like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>useState</span><span>,</span> <span>useEffect</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>React</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>but that seemed messy, and it meant that there would still be differences between the code showing on the documentation site and the code in the CodePen links. This seemed like it could be confusing for people just starting out and fiddling around with the examples.</p>
<p>Finally, I hit on the idea of hosting a small JavaScript file that exposed the hooks functions myself. Once that file was online, I could import it with a script tag the same way that CodePen imports the React CDN. The resulting file, which is included in almost all of the CodePen examples, is at <a target="_blank" href="https://reactwithhooks.netlify.app/expose_hooks.js">reactwithhooks.netlify.app/expose_hooks.js</a> and looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>typeof</span> <span>React</span> <span>!==</span> <span>'undefined'</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>useState</span> <span>=</span> <span>React</span><span>.</span><span>useState</span>
  <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>useEffect</span> <span>=</span> <span>React</span><span>.</span><span>useEffect</span>
  <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>useRef</span> <span>=</span> <span>React</span><span>.</span><span>useRef</span>
  <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>useContext</span> <span>=</span> <span>React</span><span>.</span><span>useContext</span>
  <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>useReducer</span> <span>=</span> <span>React</span><span>.</span><span>useReducer</span>
  <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>useCallback</span> <span>=</span> <span>React</span><span>.</span><span>useCallback</span>
  <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>useMemo</span> <span>=</span> <span>React</span><span>.</span><span>useMemo</span>
  <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>useRef</span> <span>=</span> <span>React</span><span>.</span><span>useRef</span>
  <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>useImperativeHandle</span> <span>=</span> <span>React</span><span>.</span><span>useImperativeHandle</span>
  <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>useLayoutEffect</span> <span>=</span> <span>React</span><span>.</span><span>useLayoutEffect</span>
  <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>useDebugValue</span> <span>=</span> <span>React</span><span>.</span><span>useDebugValue</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And just like that, the CodePen examples worked without any weird extra lines added to the main body of code. It’s all hidden away in the script tags.</p>
<p>The rest of the conversion of the CodePen examples went mostly smoothly, and it revealed quite a few bugs I had accidentally left in the code examples I had written on the documentation pages.</p>
<h2>Smaller (mis)adventures</h2>
<h3>Semicolons</h3>
<p>In the middle of this work I discovered that there was <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#guidelines-for-text">a contribution guide</a> that I had not bothered to look for previously, and it stipulated among other things that all the JavaScript examples out to use semicolons. Because I usually don't use semicolons in my JavaScript, there are now about fifteen different commits in the git log specifically for adding semicolons back to every example ever 😅</p>
<h3>Autorefresh Limitations</h3>
<p>For the most part, Gatsby is set up to automatically recompile and reload pages as you make changes to project files. If you change a code example in the <code>state-and-lifecycle.md</code> file, the application reloads to show the new content. However, code examples that are stored in their own separate javascript files do not trigger automatic reloads. For those, it takes a full cycle of <code>control + c</code>, <code>yarn dev</code>, and waiting for the Gatsby start-up-and-compile process to complete to see what changes will look like.</p>
<p>When I first encountered this, I had some trouble figuring out why the changes I was making weren’t showing up. Was a editing the right file? Were there errors preventing it from completing some required process?</p>
<p>Once I figured it out, it wasn’t so much of a problem, although still a bit frustrating to have to do a complete re-start of Gatsby to see each change.</p>
<h3>Search Bar</h3>
<p>The last significant issue that came up was with the search bar the site uses. When students first started trying the site out, we discovered that the search bar was still directing them to pages on <code>ReactJS.org</code> instead of our <code>reactwithhooks.netlify.app</code> domain. This led to students seeing a confusing mix of hooks-based and class-based React explanations without knowing why the examples were changing so much from page to page.</p>
<p>After doing some digging, I discovered that the search bar on ReactJS.org uses a hosted site search service called Algolia. I did a little bit of research into the service to see about adopting it for our version, but decided for now to just leave the search bar off.</p>
<h2>It’s Live!</h2>
<p>All in all, making this adaptation was one of the most fun projects I’ve been able to work on recently. We got a chance to use it as a resource for students during our last cohort, and it seemed to work pretty well. I’m hoping that it will be useful for other people trying to learn React as well, and as with all of our open source work, feedback is appreciated. The repo is at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kickstartcoding/reactjs.org/tree/convert-all-to-hooks">github.com/kickstartcoding/reactjs.org</a> (on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kickstartcoding/reactjs.org/tree/convert-all-to-hooks">the <code>convert-all-to-hooks</code> branch</a>)[1] and the documentation site itself is live at <a target="_blank" href="https://reactwithhooks.netlify.app/">reactwithhooks.netlify.app</a>.</p>

	<p><span face="Arial" size="2">In this book we are concerned with how to <b>

	<p><span face="Arial" size="2">"A Marxist begins with his prime truth that all

	of the proletariat, and finally the last stage -- the political paradise of

			<p>
			<span face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			Alinsky's tactics were based, not on Stalin's revolutionary violence, 
			but on the Neo-Marxist strategies of&nbsp;
			<a href="http://www.crossroad.to/text/articles/Bush4-99.htm">Antonio Gramsci</a>, an Italian 
			Communist. Relying on
			<a href="http://www.crossroad.to/articles2/05/stuter-quiet-revolution.htm">
			gradualism</a>, infiltration and the
			<a href="http://www.crossroad.to/Quotes/brainwashing/dialectic.htm">dialectic process</a> rather 
			than a bloody revolution, Gramsci's transformational Marxism was so 
			subtle that few even noticed the deliberate changes.</span></p>
			<p>
			<span face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			Like Alinsky, <a href="http://www.crossroad.to/text/articles/gorb10-95.html">Mikhail Gorbachev</a> 
			followed Gramsci, not Lenin. In fact, Gramsci aroused Stalins's wrath 
			by suggesting that Lenin's revolutionary plan wouldn't work in the West. 
			Instead the primary <b>assault </b>would be on <b>Biblical absolutes</b> 
			and Christian values, which must be crushed as a social force before 
			the new face of Communism could rise and flourish. Malachi Martin gave 
			us a progress report:</span></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><span face="Arial" size="2">"By 1985, the influence 
				of traditional Christian philosophy in the West was weak and negligible.... 
				Gramsci's master strategy was now feasible. Humanly speaking, it 
				was no longer too tall an order to <b>strip large majorities</b> 
				of men and women in the West of those last vestiges that remained 
				to them of Christianity's transcendent God." </span></p>

<h3><strong>Stack ranking is natural human behavior&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>I have a buddy from high school named Murph. His real name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bfelt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ben Felt</a> but every legit teenage crew in Pitsford, New York in the 90s needed a Murph so Ben took one for the team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He’s a quant. Like Taylor Mason from the show Billions.&nbsp;</p>







<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/aLSHkNWCVa3tsooRGsEIn_ePCfPbm8q76JG1IFkqXgNr5XQ9UDaadhEWwDWx6PmnYKQbYUg3RejrISynwYZy21haJKT_N8O12TRFNBojxdP37hpOO80kmOoRc-ViIo2AWv2cJboF" alt=""></figure>







<p>It would have been easy to predict Murph would end up as a big shot on Wall Street. For starters, he got a perfect 1600 score on his SATs and was accepted early admission to Yale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There was also his unique approach to fantasy football. I’ve been playing with the same group of guys since 1999. We started in my Mom’s basement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it came time for draft day, the regular nerds in our group like me would bring fantasy football magazines with last year’s stats and analyst opinions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Murph brought his computer. He wrote a program that organized his draft board based on each player’s predicted performance correlated to his personal skill preferences. This is years before Daryl Morey founded <a href="http://www.sloansportsconference.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sloan Conference</a>. Murph was ahead of his time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People naturally want to quantify objects by ranking them in lists of best to worst, most expensive to least expensive, most important to least important. We do this throughout our personal and professional lives. Often subconsciously before we even realize we’re doing it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sometimes it makes sense to rank objects by performance. Like ranking athletes in your fantasy league. Murph won our league multiple times using his ranking algo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sometimes it even makes sense to rank real people by performance. Like on a sales team where there is a relatively direct link between the contribution of a sales rep and the outcomes (e.g. new customer, revenue) they deliver.</p>



<p><strong>When it comes to members of your dev team, it does not make sense to rank them using personal performance statistics.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<h3><strong>Running a data-driven team does not mean stack ranking developers&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>A software development team is less like a sales team and more like a band. Everyone is highly dependent on one another to deliver a great result. If one person is off, it throws everyone off. And, like in a band, there are often unsung heroes (like the bass player or drummer) who make it possible for other stars (like the lead singer) to shine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-cqrL_fBle6dxY8DlVUhtTWbh54DZMympB2IVKA4EfMFLQ5y712qgwgXxHwVAsZH_8cxd3MCAmoRRGoIkbrpFVtpDrjTIWQqXjFijyhLLF2eRgjvCJmP7--6FkGXpmFnheNvtZyJ" alt=""></figure>







<p>The contributions of your most selfless team members may not show up if you just look at lines of code, number of commits or personal story point velocity.</p>



<p>The other big reason not to stack rank your devs is that they just don’t like it. Unlike sales people, your engineers did not sign up to work in a hyper competitive environment.</p>



<p>So why does stack ranking still happen? Some would say bad managers are the culprit. That’s probably true sometimes. Many bad managers want control and pitting teammates against each other in competition is certainly one way to get it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of the time the reason is more nuanced. I believe most managers have good intentions and want their people to succeed. But they get caught in the “data-driven trap.”</p>



<p>I hear it from engineering leaders every day… “My CEO wants me to be more data-driven” or “Our company is rolling out a metrics initiative.” Pressure to become data-driven can lead to arbitrary use of data to show the boss metrics are being used. “Let’s use data to make better decisions” gets confused as “let’s use data for performance management.”</p>



<p>When this misconception occurs, one of two things happens. Performance stack ranking metrics are implemented and it damages the team culture. Or the manager knows performance management is bad and avoids using metrics all together. Both are bad outcomes for the team.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>You can run a highly data and metrics-driven dev organization with absolutely zero performance management statistics.&nbsp;</strong></p>







<h3><strong>Data-driven engineering leadership anti-patterns</strong></h3>



<p>To avoid the “data-driven trap”, watch out for these 5 anti-patterns:&nbsp;</p>







<p><strong>Not knowing your “why”</strong></p>



<p>Without the “why”, the metrics themselves can become the outcome everyone cares about instead of being an indicator of the actual outcome you are trying to achieve like faster innovation, more predictable delivery dates, happier customers, etc.&nbsp;</p>







<p><strong>Only measuring individual stats</strong></p>



<p>As leaders we preach that we’re all working together as a band (team) to make beautiful music. What we measure shows what matters to us. If we track tons of individual metrics, we’re showing our people that individual stats matter more than team accomplishments. To get around this, I’ve actually seen some engineering leaders maintain secret dashboards with individual performance data. Their rationale is that it’s helpful for management as long as its existence does not get out. Everything always comes out eventually so I don’t recommend this. Plus, if you’re measuring something you don’t want your team to know about, that’s a good indicator you’re measuring the wrong thing.&nbsp;</p>







<p><strong>Focusing on just 1 or 2 metrics&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>I can’t tell you how many dev leads I meet that look only at velocity to determine the success of an iteration. <a href="https://linearb.io/blog/why-agile-velocity-is-the-most-dangerous-metric-for-software-development-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Even if you think velocity is a useful indicator (I don’t)</a>, there is no silver bullet. Without a balanced approach to measuring each area of your team and process, it’s easy to lose sight of the big picture. For example, if you just focus on data that measures your delivery speed, you could encourage behavior that has a negative effect on quality.&nbsp;</p>







<p><strong>Thinking your new hammer (data) works for every nail (problem)&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>When we first start experiencing how powerful data can be as a tool to quantify trends and diagnose problems, it’s really exciting. And this is precisely when we need to be careful. We can’t forget to seek out input from our people too. Reports and dashboards are at their best when they prompt penetrating questions and point us in the right direction. We can’t get lazy and base decisions exclusively on the numbers.&nbsp;</p>







<p><strong>Just using metrics that are easily available&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>“Let’s use velocity to measure team performance. We get it from our project management system automatically.” Pulling the data you really need can be an initial large lift but the benefit overtime will pay back 100x. And it’s actually worse to force the wrong metrics than to use none at all.</p>







<h3><strong>14 ways to use data in your daily dev team practices without being a performance tyrant</strong></h3>



<p>Forget about individual performance management stats. There are many other ways to incorporate data into your team’s day to day routine that will have a positive impact on delivery efficiency, quality and predictability and actually improve your culture, not hurt it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So what should we measure?&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I was a team lead, I answered that question for myself by taking a step back and looking at my personal leadership responsibility areas. After analyzing all of my important jobs, I found that they fit into three pillars.&nbsp;</p>







<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/13hUMY4HlnRRfrtmq4bMgYWOYBAHk95xsSDCvXbi7FRgNp7vUckkpkgFONefECxyU7deWyn46tOXd6QKnSNvrbKGwuiRzlS8hOFbKe1mhwgHXrXW6GxPUTRFTQzgWSXS-BkB67e0" alt=""></figure>







<p>These pillars became my “why”. So instead of starting with metrics and looking for a place to apply them, I looked for data that would help me understand and improve these areas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s 14 ways we use data to run our team on a day-to-day basis at <a href="https://linearb.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LinearB</a>.&nbsp;</p>







<h4><strong>How we use data to accelerate project delivery</strong></h4>



<p>Project delivery is highly complicated because of the number of things happening in parallel. Even if your team is only 6-8 people. Technology, time constraints, priority shifts, developers, business stakeholders, customers… The only way to see across all of these dimensions is with data. Better yet, visual representations of data help distill complex things into manageable views and show you where to look and how to invest your time.&nbsp;</p>







<p><strong>1. Pull request throughput</strong></p>



<p>My friend <a href="https://linearb.io/coffee-talk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris Downard</a>, the VP of Engineering at GigSmart, put it well.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Knowing what to measure starts with aligning your team around what’s important to the business. In most companies, they want the dev team to deliver new value. So I care about metrics that are proxies for value delivery. I lean on merge requests because it helps me see throughput for work related to new features and bug fixes.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>We use our PR throughput dashboard the exact same way on our team. We like to see that the ratio of PRs opened to PRs merged stays in the 90-95% range otherwise we know we have a bottleneck in review.&nbsp;</p>







<figure><a href="https://linearb.io/get-started-linearb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dHWqhiCedjAb52oN1VY0S8uFUZ1cR7gJcHRrcRWQbb84XouHrTD21sRih0oQz9SwhywEdmp6ZHTaJ6niGMnWxReoMigGIieLXM2glZ5CUkCqc1HBGIrKM1vc7FKWCZCsBaTBqkwC" alt=""></a></figure>







<p><strong>2. Stuck pull requests&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>We look for A) PRs that have not been picked up for review, B) PRs that have abnormally high back and forth interaction and C) PRs with long review time.&nbsp; Then we alert the team to these in Slack so we can start a conversation about how to help and click through to the PR directly in Git.&nbsp;</p>







<figure><a href="https://linearb.io/get-started-linearb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/1JL97AoLYrbimIpkxfT405N-FxrCieSqchuaEn2Dh6dwlRe5OYYBCX6TlpsUDIQiSHiEtQPsa9Sl_iJRDS2845EB4DyMUm03OvDba3_ASMiKaBe7ToucIUMAgyhFZYPjD6ICAywB" alt=""></a></figure>







<p>We implemented this in <a href="https://linearb.io/blog/dev-productivity-is-way-down-at-linearb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March when work-from-home started</a> and it’s become a critical part of our delivery process. Our devs love it because it’s one less thing they need to remember and they can jump in and help teammates more easily.&nbsp;</p>







<p><strong>3. PRs merged without review</strong></p>



<p>Our team is great about reviews but occasionally things slip. Flagging large PRs that have been merged without review has helped us catch a lot of mistakes before customers found them.&nbsp;</p>







<figure><a href="https://linearb.io/get-started-linearb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/PsPxncxslm2V2acQox3pnFiR_nULYXN8FCXnvxjD-JLlVSiihieUMDayOELHpubE5aZ45QonVchJt9WhrDdD_M2TMyBlGCAp96lhU0BGVI2pzkRM6CB_j_pP4YivthPHVqgXs26N" alt=""></a></figure>







<p><strong>4. High risk branches</strong></p>



<p>About 15 months ago we analyzed all of our bugs and found a connection between bugs and large branches with a high rate of immediate rework (more than 30%). So now we look for those branches proactively and use our Slack alerts to get another set of eyes on them for review.&nbsp;</p>







<figure><a href="https://linearb.io/get-started-linearb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/XuW12YJqhGmUTkMDRueIlTudnmil0P7uElElddlcDcc17COKUaporHhX7XhljQrRTWnjc2F1eHK1enijyKwIcppaIDnVnFpngbWYBYvslH0QI8U7W3uAK0-883deZ28d9cCN58Qq" alt=""></a></figure>







<hr>











<hr>







<p><strong>5. Days remaining to open work ratio&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>We work in two week iterations. Once we’re about a week in, there’s a general equation our leads use to figure out if we’re on track to deliver the iteration: WIP + to-do ÷ days remaining = almost everything you need to know about whether or not you are going to finish on time.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Work in progress</strong>: I still need to clean this up &amp; add the complete source code. ETA for a more or less done version is Soon(TM).<br>
<strong>Last updated</strong>: 2020/09/10 because how the eff did this end up on the front page of Hacker News? :D<br>
<strong>Suggestions welcome</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/AnotherKamila/kamila.is/issues/new?labels=teaching&amp;title=[teaching/how-routers-work]+Title">complain</a> if something is unclear or wrong!</p>

<p>This is the inside view of how exactly a router operates. You only need to know this if you are poking inside a router implementation. If that is the case, my condolences.</p>

<p>At the end of this exposition, I will give you the complete source code to a functional router (written in <a href="https://p4.org/">P4</a>, the new &amp; shiny software-defined networking thing). My aim is that you will understand every line of that.</p>

<p>I accompany my explanations below with some P4 code. I think it is useful to read it even if you’ve never seen P4, because it shows a bit more detail than the text and I believe that it is sufficiently pseudocode-ish. Here is a summary of what you need to know to read it:</p>

<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24436585">Cyph0n on HN did a good job explaining this distinction.</a></p>



<p>A <em>switch</em> (or an L2 switch :-) ) is an L2-only<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> thing. It knows about L2 stuff such as MAC addresses and ports<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>. It does <strong>not</strong> know about anything like IP addresses. It has a <strong>MAC table</strong>: it maps MAC addresses to ports.</p>

<p>A <em>router</em> (or an L3 switch by some people’s vocabulary) operates on L3 only. It knows about L3 stuff such as IP addresses and interfaces and hosts. It does <strong>not</strong> know about L2 stuff such as MAC addresses or ports.<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> In fact, the routing parts of the router would not have to be changed at all if you decided to use something other than ethernet on L2. It has a <strong>routing table</strong> (details later): a table of subnets/prefixes and how to reach them.</p>

<p>What you normally call a router (that box sitting over there) is actually a router (for handling L3) and one or more switches (for handling L2), and some glue in between. They may in fact be separate chips in hardware.</p>

<p>You need glue to put together the L2 and the L3. This “L2.5” glue is ARP (or NDP for IPv6). It usually lives in the router, but it is glue, not routing, and you can think about it separately.</p>

<h2 id="the-data-plane-life-of-a-packet">The Data Plane: Life of a Packet</h2>

<p>When a packet arrives and needs to be sent further, these things have to happen to it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It needs to be <em>routed</em>: the <strong>router</strong>, based on L3 information, decides where it needs to go, in L3 speak – it will decide which <em>host</em> to send it to, but not how. This corresponds to the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_table">routing table</a></em>.</li>
  <li>It needs to be passed down to L2: this is where the L2.5 ARP/NDP <strong>glue</strong> translates the L3-speak IP address to L2-speak MAC address. This is the <em>ARP table</em>.</li>
  <li>It needs to be <em>forwarded</em> on the correct port: the <strong>switch</strong> puts the packet on the correct port. This is the <em>MAC table</em>.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="life-of-a-packet-now-properly">Life of a Packet, Now Properly</h2>

<h3 id="1-it-needs-to-be-routed-l3router">1. “It needs to be routed”: L3/router</h3>

<p>The packet has a destination IP address. This is matched in the <em>routing table</em>, using a longest-prefix match (LPM), i.e. it matches IP address prefixes. It may either be for a host the router is directly connected to (on some interface), or it may need to be sent further, through a <em>gateway</em> (through some interface). Therefore: <strong>The routing table maps a <em>prefix</em> to either <em>a next hop through a gateway and an interface</em>, or <em>a direct connection through an interface</em></strong>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>routing_table : Prefix -&gt; NextHop (GatewayIP, Interface) | Direct Interface
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that the next hop’s IP address is in the router’s memory only: it does not appear in the packet at any time.</p>

<p>The P4 code defining the IPv4 routing table is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>action ipv4_through_gateway(ipv4_addr_t gateway, interface_t iface) {
    meta.out_interface = iface;
    meta.ipv4_next_hop = gateway;  // send through the gateway
}

action ipv4_direct(interface_t iface) {
    meta.out_interface = iface;
    meta.ipv4_next_hop = hdr.ipv4.dst_addr;  // send directly to the destination
}

table ipv4_routing {
    key = {
        hdr.ipv4.dst_addr: lpm;  // match prefixes
    }
    actions = {
        ipv4_through_gateway;    // ipv4_through_gateway(gateway, iface)
        ipv4_direct;             // ipv4_direct(iface)
        drop;
    }
    default_action = drop();     // If there is no route, drop it -- in reality, we might want to
                                 // send an ICMP "No route to host" packet.
                                 // Note that this is the default route, so control plane might
                                 // want to set a default gateway here instead of dropping.
    size = ROUTING_TABLE_SIZE;
}
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>(and the exact same thing for IPv6)</p>

<h3 id="2-it-needs-to-be-passed-down-l25arp-glue">2. “It needs to be passed down”: L2.5/ARP glue</h3>

<p>If we did not drop the packet because there was no route, we now know the IP address and interface of the next hop. (Note that this is a host that is connected to us directly – it is sitting on the same wire.)
We need to translate this into an L2 MAC address in order to pass it to the switch. We do it via the ARP table:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>arp_table : (IPv4Address, Interface) -&gt; MACAddress
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note: <code>Interface</code> conceptually belongs there, but <code>IPv4Address</code> should be unique. We need to store the interface in the control plane anyway, because we want to pre-emptively re-send ARP requests when an entry is about to expire, but in the data plane it is not strictly necessary.</p>

<p>An interesting question arises here: What do we do if there is no match, i.e. when we don’t know the MAC address for the IP? First, we send an ARP request. Then, most routers drop the packet (relying on either retransmissions or “nobody will miss it”). Storing the packet until the ARP reply comes back (or until it expires) would also work, but usually isn’t done.
Sending ARP requests is normally done in the control plane, because the ARP requests need to be throttled and expired and such.</p>

<p>P4 code:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>action set_dst_mac(mac_addr_t dst_addr) {
    hdr.ethernet.dst_addr = dst_addr;
}

table ipv4_arp {
    key = {
        meta.ipv4_next_hop: exact;     // next_hop is the host we found in the routing step; we want to send to that
        // meta.out_interface: exact;  // conceptually this belongs here, but actually next_hop should be unique, so
                                       // we can leave it out
    }
    actions = {
        set_dst_mac;                // set_dst_mac(mac)
        drop;
    }
    default_action = drop();
    size = ARP_TABLE_SIZE;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>IPv6 uses NDP instead of ARP, which is different but the same ;-)</p>

<h3 id="3-it-needs-to-be-forwarded-l2switch">3. “It needs to be forwarded”: L2/switch</h3>

<p>This is L2 / the switch. It works on each interface separately (it could be multiple chips in hardware). It gets a packet with some destination MAC address, and it decides on which port it should put it. It uses a <em>MAC table</em> to do it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>mac_table : MACAddress -&gt; Port
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>P4 code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>// note: we're operating on metadata.out_interface

action set_out_port(port_t ports) {
    standard_metadata.egress_spec = ports;
}

action broadcast() {
    // Implementation depends on the switch.
    // In v1model, use a multicast group corresponding to all ports on metadata.out_interface.
}

// we call it dmac -- see below why
table dmac {
    key = {
        hdr.ethernet.dst_addr: exact;
    }
    actions = {
        set_out_port;  // set_out_port(port)
        broadcast;     // no params, uses metadata.out_interface
                       // remember to set broadcast for 0xffffffffffff in the control plane
        drop;
    }
    default_action = drop();
    size = ARP_TABLE_SIZE;  // we can have at most as many ports as MAC addresses
}

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note: Real switches are a bit more complicated than that: for example, redundant links mean that a MAC address may be on more than one port. However, you will notice when you need to think about this. Normally considering the simple version is sufficient.</p>

<h3 id="the-logic-applying-the-tables">The logic: Applying the tables</h3>

<ol>
  <li>apply routing =&gt; find the next hop (either gateway or direct)</li>
  <li>apply ARP translation to the “next hop” host</li>
  <li>send out on the right port</li>
</ol>

<p>In P4:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>apply {
    routing.apply();  // fills out metadata.next_hop
    arp.apply();      // sets pkt.ethernet.dst_addr to the MAC of next_hop
    dmac.apply();     // sends out on the port for pkt.ethernet.dst_addr
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(Note: While this is conceptually correct, we actually also want to apply the auxiliary table mentioned below. The full code contains that.)</p>

<h2 id="the-control-plane-how-to-fill-the-tables">The Control Plane: How to Fill the Tables</h2>

<p>Starting at the bottom for a change:</p>

<h3 id="l3--routing-table">L3 / routing table</h3>

<p>Filled out by the control plane, depending on the context:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In your home router, it probably has only two entries: the local network (something like 192.168.0.0/24) =&gt; direct on the internal interface, and a default route via your ISP’s gateway on the external interface.
 In this case, the routing table is static and is filled out by the firmware according to the settings.</li>
  <li>In a small company router, there might be a direct network such as 10.0.0.0/24, a remote office in 10.0.1.0/24 via a VPN server, and a default route from the ISP.
 The default route and the direct route would also be filled …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">                                   
                    <p>Something is wrong with clinical trials for ALS. It seems difficult, if not impossible, to do worse than current experts in the field. The situation is similar for other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's.</p>

<p>Over 700 clinical trials, nearly 500 of which are interventional studies [15], have been conducted over the past 15 years on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In the case of Alzheimer's, there have been over 1900 interventional clinical trials and over 2000 of them for Parkinson's disease.</p>

<p>The cumulative cost of these unsuccessful attempts is colossal.</p>

<p>While the average success rate for a phase III clinical trial is over 40%, it is close to zero for neurodegenerative diseases.
In fact, there have been more than 80 negative phase III clinical trials in the case of ALS [14].</p>

<p>The public might expect it to be truly unlikely that experts would fail 500 times in a row, or fail 82 times in Phase III, without any success, when the success rate of phase III clinical trials is close to 50%.</p>

<p>Is it an exaggeration to say that this huge number of failures means that not only do we have no idea of ​​the cause and mechanism of this disease, but that <strong>experts in charge have no clues about this type of disease?</strong></p>

<p>One of the first paradigms was that since ALS is caused by the death of upper motor neurons (it's the medical definition of ALS), drugs and treatments for stroke should be effective. It shows the thinking of a doctor, not a biologist.</p>

<p>It has been the main paradigm for decades. There is indeed good reason to think that ALS is similar to an extremely slow stroke. In particular, it mainly occurs in the elderly and the symptoms start locally, for example in the muscle of the hand called the thenar. The symptoms then reach increasingly larger areas of the anatomy as the disease develops.</p>

<p>One of the two drugs approved for ALS, Edaravone, is an intravenous drug used to aid healing after stroke.
In line with this paradigm that says ALS is a kind of stroke, oxidative stress has long been suspected to be a major factor in the spread of the disease. This is why Rilutek has been approved for ALS.</p>

<p>Then, over the last century, there has been the extraordinary expansion of molecular biology. <strong>Biologists then, considerably surpassed physicians in numbers and publications</strong>. Biologists became the de-facto experts  in ALS.</p>

<p>The promise of molecular biology is indeed revolutionary, and that is to find a simple solution to any non-contagious disease.</p>

<p>It is also a promise of considerable simplicity in tooling, which seems to come out of a kitchen rather than from a sophisticated laboratory. In particular, it becomes possible for biologist students to publish on these subjects a few years earlier than if they were studying medicine.</p>

<p>Molecular biology involves a complete paradigm shift in the way we think about ALS disease.</p>

<p>The brains, the nerves and the muscles are forgotten. The cells, whose internal mechanisms are however still largely unknown at the end of the XX century, are rejected as irrelevant in a process of thought which is centered on the translation of the genome in proteins.</p>

<p>The blindness towards medicine, is however difficult to understand for neurodegenerative diseases, because for example reactive astrocytes have been repeatedly identified as a component of senile amyloid plaques in the cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease. from 1988 [9-12]. But not long ago, 30 years later, the theory implicating amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease was still the dominant theory.</p>

<p>This may correspond to what was known at the time, as astrocytes and microglia were then considered almost useless. This is, however, something astonishing to say, even at the end of the 20th century, since these cells clearly constitute a large part of the matter of the brain and the spine.</p>

<p>It started off well for the application of cell biology in neurodegenerative diseases, with an apparent success in 1998, when mutations in the SOD1 gene were implicated in familial ALS.
Unfortunately, it quickly became clear that SOD1 mutations only affect a small number of familial cases of ALS and they presented a great diversity with a life expectancy varying from one year in severe forms to 10 years or more in other less dangerous mutations.</p>

<p>Although the vast majority of articles on ALS concern SOD1, mutations in SOD1 therefore appear to be an epiphenomenon in the case of ALS, both because of their very low frequency but also for the diversity of phenotypes.</p>

<p>The main cause of familial ALS was not found until 2011, 20 years after promises from like those of the human genome project. Mutations in C9orf72 create repeats motifs in some proteins. Geneticists had been investigating familial ALS for about 30 years, and the lack of progress raised concerns. C9orf72 is not a gene, it is an area that was considered non-coding until then, hence the difficulty in using molecular biology tools.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, these pattern repeats are also present in everyone, but more pronounced in the elderly. They are also present in other diseases. So it seems that the number of repetitions could involve different diseases.</p>

<p>Molecular biology has proposed more than a hundred genes as participating in the etiology of ALS and has proposed thousands of drugs and at one point scientists started to be reluctant to incriminate even more genes in ALS (or Alzheimer's, etc.).</p>

<p>Thus, for scientists who had decided to pursue a career in molecular biology and who thought they were in an impasse, there was a strong temptation to turn towards translation and post-translational modifications of proteins.</p>

<p>We were then inundated with studies claiming that this or that protein was poorly translated, poorly conformed or poorly localized in the cell. The subject of misfolded proteins even created small wars between biologists (Tauiste against Baptiste). The problem is that most of these proposed proteins are found in most neurodegenerative diseases, Tau, TDP-43, etc [1]. <strong>So they do not seem specific to ALS, Alzheimer's or Parkinson's.</strong> If they are not specific, how can they be causative of one, but not other neurodegenerative diseases?</p>

<p>There are however alternative views among scientists working in the field of ALS, one is that ALS starts in muscles, not in the brain. This hypothesis has been both * proven and disproved * on several occasions, which seems very confusing from a non-specialist's point of view.
But anyway this hypothesis does not explain what would cause the muscle disease, it only pushes the explanation of this muscle wasting, away to future works.</p>

<p>If we think globally, like a doctor, there are two common reasons for cells to die (be it muscle cells or upper motor neurons). There is no need for extremely sophisticated explanations for this.</p>

<p>Either their blood supply is faulty (see the similarity to stroke above) or the cellular metabolism is faulty (hence the appearance of reactive stress).</p>

<p>It seems that articles on a defective metabolism are quite rare, but they could be found, here are examples [7-8, 13]. Some articles have even blamed the use of methionine sulfoximine (MSO) in a now abandoned flour bleaching process [8] or other environmental contaminants as contributing factors to ALS.
It is surprising that although there have been many publications on these two topics, <strong>no clinical trial has tried drugs linked to metabolic dysfunction</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, clinical trials could study:
 * MAO-B inhibitors [2],
 * Methionine sulfoximine (MSO) which dramatically extended the lifespan of a SOD1 G93A mouse model for ALS. [3]
 * Pathological inhibition of glutamine synthetase (GS). In the brain, GS is exclusively localized in astrocytes where it is used to maintain the glutamate-glutamine cycle, as well as nitrogen metabolism. Changes in GS activity have been identified in a number of neurological conditions [4].
 * Methionine sulfoximine (MSO), a well-characterized glutamine synthetase inhibitor, is a convulsant, particularly in dogs, but shows significant therapeutic benefits in animal models for several human diseases [5, 6]
 * But also many other drugs related to the brain and spine metabolism.</p>

		<h2 id="003">0:03</h2>

<p>Welcome to Signals and Threads, in-depth conversations about every layer of the tech stack from Jane Street. I’m Ron Minsky. Today, we’re going to have a conversation about hardware, and in particular about how you can take the tools that come out of the world of chip design and apply them to a much broader space of problems than people typically think they can be applied to. And I’m joined in this conversation by Andy Ray.</p>

<h2 id="031">0:31</h2>

<p>Hello, Ron, good to be chatting with you.</p>

<h2 id="033">0:33</h2>

<p>Andy is a longtime veteran of the hardware industry. He spent over a decade building real shippable hardware designs, working on things like modems and video codecs. And along that time, he also did a lot of interesting work exploring and eventually designing his own alternative languages for expressing hardware designs. The final one was called <a href="https://github.com/janestreet/hardcaml">Hardcaml</a>, which is a hardware design language embedded inside <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>, which itself is the primary programming language we use here at Jane Street. And that work actually led him to us. And today he works here and leads Jane Street’s hardware design team. And so, to start with Andy, maybe you can tell us a little bit about why hardware is useful for a technology organization and an organization like ours, and what advantages it has over traditional software-style approaches?</p>

<h2 id="123">1:23</h2>

<p>Sure. So hardware allows you to build customized architectures for a specific problem, which can be tuned to trade off, at a very fine level, lots of things like performance, and cost and power usage. That lets you design a range of different products. Whereas with a CPU, you’re very much more limited in the software world to the CPU design that can meet the performance of the problem domain. I think the sorts of problems that it can solve are very, very broad. And you can see that just because well, a CPU is a hardware design, in fact. And you can create all sorts of hybrid designs with multiple CPUs or digital signal processors or custom hardware blocks that make up your final solution. So I think that’s why hardware exists, why it will always exist. It’s the fact that you can build architectures entirely suited to your problem domain that optimize along these sort of areas.</p>

<h2 id="230">2:30</h2>

<p>That description on the face of it sounds awesome. And in fact, it sounds from what you said so far, strictly superior to writing software. I don’t think that’s quite true. Can you see more about what the downsides are of operating inside of a hardware context?</p>

<h2 id="243">2:43</h2>

<p>Oh, my goodness, yes, there are a lot. So it is fundamentally this: hardware designs are much, much more difficult to write than equivalent software. So all that flexibility in choosing, you know, the architecture for your problem domain, you actually have to implement that. In software, you have reams and reams of support libraries that either your organization has developed or that you can pull in from open source or that you can go and purchase. To some extent that infrastructure works in hardware with the idea of intellectual property suppliers. They’re basically just companies who supply a hardware design for you to integrate into your system. That’s actually the job I used to do when we were developing video codecs.</p>

<h2 id="327">3:27</h2>

<p>Yeah. And just to interrupt for a second though, that was a bit of terminology that really confused me when I first encountered the hardware world. When people in hardware say, “IP,” they mean something like when a software person says “library.”</p>

<h2 id="338">3:38</h2>

<p>Correct.</p>

<h2 id="339">3:39</h2>

<p>Which is to say some component that somebody else wrote that you get to integrate. Except in this case, the component is a bundle of wires that you kind of plop into your design rather than something that looks more like a module or library.</p>

<h2 id="351">3:51</h2>

<p>Yeah, that’s right. I don’t know why that terminology came about, but it’s just always been called IP when you buy hardware library design. There’s some sort of infrastructure there for buying external blocks to integrate with your hardware. It’s a vastly smaller ecosystem than we have in software. It’s vastly more expensive. There is in the last maybe ten years more of an open source community around providing hardware blocks that you can integrate. But it’s still absolutely miniscule compared to software. And then just the process of writing hardware is slow and detailed. And I’m gonna say difficult. I’m not so sure it is really technically that difficult. It’s just that it’s so detailed, and you’re dealing with such big systems that it becomes a real problem trying to manage the complexity of all these very simple bits that sit together.</p>

<h2 id="449">4:49</h2>

<p>Right, I think of that as one of the paradoxes of hardware: hardware is in the micro, in many different ways, simpler than software.</p>

<h2 id="456">4:56</h2>

<p>Yes.</p>

<h2 id="457">4:57</h2>

<p>The thing that you’re generating in a hardware design is essentially some layout of the circuit, the individual gates and wires that connect them. And it’s some kind of fairly static graph that represents the structure of the computation, and is converted into, when you actually get one of these fabricated, actual bits of material laid out on a physical surface. And understanding how those individual pieces work, at least logically how they work, leaving the physics aside, is relatively simple. But then having a big design that does a lot of these things, is enormously hard to reason about.</p>

<h2 id="532">5:32</h2>

<p>It is and unfortunately, the abstraction tools we have, they take us some way. So you know, you talked about a chip design, which you can think of as a layout of just two things really, lots of lots of NAND gates (a Boolean AND function with the output NOTed) and metal wires that connect them together. And it’s interesting because NAND is a universal Boolean function. Any other Boolean function can be computed with the NAND function. That’s not true of AND, for example, you can’t create an OR with an AND, but you can create it with a NAND. And they are like, I think sixteen Boolean functions, and four of them are universal. I think NAND and NOR are quite often like the basis of technology (NOR being an OR gate with the output inverted). We don’t actually think about writing circuits at the level of just interconnected NAND gates. An interesting aside, I believe the first ARM processor was basically designed that way. But actually even lower, they were drawing the transistors for the NAND gates in like just a graphics package. That’s how they created the very first ARM processor. But that’s not how they do it now. So we’re a little bit above that: we work with a tool called a synthesizer, and it takes a slightly more abstract notion of a hardware design in which we can think about components like adders and multiplexers. And the job of the synthesizer will be to turn those components into the actual low level hardware components for the chip, which might be NAND gates if you’re doing an ASIC, it might be look-up tables for an FPGA. But that being said, it’s not massively above building it with NAND gates. But really a lot of the industry just works at this sort of level of putting together these macros, which represent adders and multiplexers, and multipliers and registers and just wiring them together and getting them to form some function.</p>

<h2 id="738">7:38</h2>

<p>So you were talking there about ASICS and FPGAs. Can you just quickly explain what those are.</p>

<h2 id="743">7:43</h2>

<p>An ASIC is a custom-made chip that can perform a single function. In contrast, an FPGA is a reprogrammable chip that can be programmed to perform many different functions.</p>

<h2 id="757">7:57</h2>

<p>Got it. So when you talked about what the advantages are of hardware, you talked about how by having much more control, you get to really optimize the things you care about via power consumption or performance or latency or whatever it is of the, of the, system. Can you put a little bit of meat on the bones of that? What is the scale of the improvements that you can get by taking something that you might do in software and moving it into a hardware design?</p>

<h2 id="825">8:25</h2>

<p>It’s obviously going to depend on the sort of problem you’re trying to solve. But you know, an area I know really well, video coding. I used to work on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Video_Coding">H.264</a> a lot and there was just a really good software implementation called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X264">x264</a>, which was almost entirely written in assembly, using the SSE instructions, which is a vector instruction set on the x86 processor. And it could just about manage like real-time 1080p on modern Intel processors of the time, which were like four gigahertz processors. In order for it to achieve that sort of performance, you had to turn off lots of lots and lots of codec features. If you’re willing to go non-real-time, you could turn on all sorts of features that would compress it better. There’s an extremely large standard for H.264 that I used to read a lot, and there’s a lot of features on that thing, but you just can’t do them all. And so we used to target different markets, there was like, a sort of low-end video codec, which could fit in smaller FPGAs, could be used for like internet based communication. And there was like really high-end video codecs, which were built over multiple FPGAs, and had a really high end feature set, and was used for professional-grade encoding. So that’s the sort of video that you get over your satellite link or over your cable link. That bitstream is compressed as much as it possibly can be so they can fit more channels into that link. We didn’t have to compromise so much on the features to do that with hardware, we could pick the features that made the difference that got us to the bit rate, and they could run in real time. And you just couldn’t do that real time in software. You know, in that world, you’re looking at an order of magnitude more computation being done by these FPGAs. But these sort of things can scale massively. They’re like chips, which do packet processing, for example. So the idea here is you’ve got a switch and you want to do packet processing to detect threats in those packets to route …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>Joe and I recently <a href="https://twitter.com/stopachka/status/1295411936625074178" target="_blank">kicked off a re-read of SICP</a>. I can say that it is <em>the</em> most interesting textbook I have gone through. Imagine, you begin with just 4 or 5 constructs, and you end up building algebraic equation solvers, circuit simulators, and even logic programming languages. Because you start off with such few constructs, the added benefit is that you begin to see the fundamentally simple, shared essence in programming. </p><p>I wanted to give you one example that surprised me in the book. We tend to think that <strong>classes belong in a</strong> <strong>fundamentally different category</strong> <strong>from functions.</strong> </p><p>But are they so different? </p><p>For example, let’s say we have a class like this:</p><pre><code>class Person { 
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    this.fName = firstName; 
    this.lName = lastName;
  }
  getFullName() { 
    return this.fName + ' ' + this.lName;
  }
  setFirstName(firstName) {
    this.fName = firstName;
  }
}</code></pre><p>Well, if we think about it, this is really just a higher order function. a <code>Person</code> higher order function accepts arguments (constructor), and returns a list of functions that can manipulate those arguments (methods). We could write <code>Person</code> like this: </p><pre><code> function Person(firstName, lastName) {
  let fName = firstName; 
  let lName = lastName;

  function getFullName() { 
    return fName + ' ' + lName;
  }
  
  function setFirstName(firstName) { 
    fName = firstName
  }

  return function(method) { 
    switch (method) { 
      case 'getFullName': 
        return getFullName;
      case 'setFirstName': 
        return setFirstName;  
    }
  }
}</code></pre><p>Now, </p><pre><code>const person = new Person("Ben", "Bitdiddle")
person.getFullName()</code></pre><p>becomes</p><pre><code>const person = Person("Ben", "Bitdiddle")
person('getFullName')()</code></pre><p>Here, instead of invoking a method, we are “passing” a message. This is why by the way, many classic OO folks talk about object orientation really being about message passing.  </p><p>Yup, really. Classes are just higher order functions, which accept arguments (constructor) and return a list of functions that can manipulate those arguments (methods). </p><p>When you previously thought two concepts were different, but they turn out to be the same, you’re ripe to discover new ideas: you can find the deeper abstractions between them, apply ideas from across those seemingly different categories, and move between concepts more fluidly. So, not only are epiphanies like this fun, but they’re much more useful than you’d think. </p><p>If you liked this, there are a <em>ton</em> of similar epiphanies in the textbook. To experience it best, I suggest picking a partner and working through the book together.</p><p><em>Thanks to Daniel Woelfel, Alex Reichert, Jacky Wang for reviewing drafts of this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><p>Our <strong>12 Questions</strong> series takes you into the minds of influential leaders to discuss today’s hot topics. Read their fresh views on leadership, managing through change, and the ins and outs of modern work. Think of it as your office hours with some of the most innovative people in business.</p><p>We continue this series on resilience with Ben Werdmuller. <a href="https://twitter.com/benwerd?lang=en" rel="noopener" target="_self">Ben</a> is an award-winning startup founder, venture capital investor at the intersection of media and technology, product owner, CTO, and full-stack developer. He writes prolifically about his work and loves to work on projects that allow him to draw together his diverse experience in the service of great ventures that make society more informed, empowered, and empathetic. <strong>Full interview below.</strong></p><hr><p><br><strong>Can you describe your career in 12 words or less?</strong></p><p>Engineer to accidental founder to impact investor to mission-driven product lead.</p><p><strong>What does being resilient mean to you?</strong></p><p>Work is getting faster and more intense. Our work lives are often hyperconnected, and the lines between work and life continue to blur. But we're also still human: real people with lives, commitments, and stresses outside of work.</p><p>Being resilient as a person means finding ways to intentionally set boundaries, conserve your energy, be self-aware, and meet your needs in a way that allows you to sustainably be present and effective at work and in your home life. It's partially about establishing the right rhythms and structures for you and your team, and partially about recognizing and embracing our human characteristics.</p><p>In a world where more workers are suffering from burnout than ever before, tools for stronger resiliency are vital work practices.</p><p><strong>How has your thinking about resilience changed in 2020?</strong></p><p>2020 has made the need for resilience more pressing for many people, myself included. We're still in the middle of a global, deadly pandemic. Many of us have had to learn to be more mindful, to find techniques for better emotional regulation, to more actively learn, and to more intentionally lead by example in our companies and communities.</p><p>At the same time, it's been made clearer to a lot more people that some communities have faced harsher challenges than others for generations. The current civil rights movement - one of the largest in the history of the world - gives me a lot of hope that we'll see real change, but there's a lot of work to do. The resiliency that truly matters is going to be found in the people that are fighting to challenge the discriminatory institutions and assumptions that underpin almost every aspect of society, in the face of stark opposition.</p><p>Companies are communities of people. Resilience at work means acknowledging that you can't separate the worker from the human. We all bring our whole selves to work, and that should include our moral compass. By tackling the human rights issues that affect the lives of members of our communities, we can build safer, more resilient workplaces.<br></p><p><strong>How have you come to understand the importance of resilience in your own career?</strong></p><p>For most of the last decade, my mother has been suffering from a terminal, genetic disease that I assumed I would eventually get too. Thankfully, a recent DNA test showed me that I wouldn't, but the battle remains for my mother and others in my family. There are certainly times when I lie awake at night, unable to let go of my anxiety. But through mindfulness, therapy, coaching, and a lot of leadership training, I've been able to show up as support for my family while making significant progress in my career and leading teams that have built products I'm proud of.</p><p>If I hadn't shown up for my family, and instead had focused on my career, I never would have been able to forgive myself. Likewise, making real progress on meaningful work has improved my well-being in a way that helped me better support the people I love. Being resilient meant taking care of my whole self, so I could take care of the people around me.<br></p><p><strong>When was the last time you had to check in with yourself?</strong></p><p>I try and check in with myself every day. Inspired by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/design/thinking/page/toolkit/activity/feedback-grid" rel="noopener" target="_self">feedback grids</a>, I like to ask myself four questions:</p><p><em>1. What did I do well today?</em></p><p><em>2. What could have gone better?</em></p><p><em>3. What questions do I have about the future?</em></p><p><em>4. What ideas do I have for changing how I show up?</em></p><p>The answers could be personal, or they could be professional. Usually, it's a mix of both.</p><p>I try to be honest with myself, but I also like to get feedback from the people I work with, using a <a href="https://medium.com/matter-driven-narrative/feedback-is-a-gift-df8fbf599b69" rel="noopener" target="_self">technique</a> inspired by <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/carole-robin-how-create-feedback-rich-environment" rel="noopener" target="_self">Carole Robin's framework for a feedback-rich environment</a>. It's good to be self-reflective and check in with myself, but I want to make sure that I check in with others, too. I'm certain I could be more self-aware than I am, and I want to avoid blind spots if I can.<br></p><p><strong>Is there a time when you wish you were more resilient?</strong></p><p>Frankly, always. Life is stressful; work is stressful; living in a pandemic is stressful. In our current moment, I've intentionally lowered my bar for what constitutes "showing up" - but I wish it could be higher.</p><p><strong>What’s one big mistake you made and how did you bounce back?</strong></p><p>At a startup earlier in my career, I made an architecture decision that made our platform noticeably slow for users. We had to scramble to fix it. I was embarrassed, but learned how to make sure I never did anything like it again.</p><p>The way to bounce back is to place the emphasis on learning, not blame. These are the questions I try to ask:</p><p><em>1. What actually happened, and why?</em></p><p><em>2. What would prevent it from happening again?</em></p><p><em>3. What checks can we establish to make sure that happens?</em></p><p>I also push back - hard - against any attempts to ascribe blame or create bad feelings for a mistake. We all make them. Environments that punish people for trying and failing will just result in fewer people trying.<br></p><p><strong>What are some mistakes we all make when it comes to resilience?</strong></p><p>Ignoring it, and pushing ourselves harder than we should at the expense of our well-being. Not only do we hurt ourselves in the process, but we become part of making a less resilient environment for others. It takes a lot more strength to maintain boundaries and look after yourself if no-one else around you is doing it.</p><p><strong>How can people be more resilient in their work-life?</strong></p><p>Emotions play an important role in the way we think and act. So does our physical wellness. It's important to take care of ourselves: exercise, eat well, get good sleep, and practice mindfulness. In times of extreme stress, finding the things to be grateful for is also important - otherwise we tend to over-index on our negative experiences. And finally, it's not just about ourselves: we need to promote these things in the people around us, too, and be mindful and observant about how they're doing.</p><p>We all need to look out for the whole human, not just the tiny sliver of a human that is responsible for completing tasks relevant to the work we do. And we need to take it seriously.<br></p><p><strong>Vulnerability plays a critical role in building trust among teams. How much does showing humanity help in building a resilient team?</strong></p><p>Culture is the most important thing in any team. By a mile. Your collective norms, beliefs, and practices will define how everyone acts and reacts, how safe they feel to be themselves at work, and as a direct result, how high quality the work itself is.</p><p>Showing someone that you're human gives them permission to do the same. It also gives them permission to be more honest with you; you'll get better feedback, catch issues earlier, and understand when someone is having struggles. It makes it easier to create an environment where everyone can do their best work.</p><p><strong>Who's the most resilient person that you know? Why?</strong></p><p>I'm inspired by all the people who have literally been fighting for equality for their entire lives. I can't begin to imagine the resiliency required to fight for the human rights of you and your community, day in, day out, with no end in sight. I wish it wasn't required.</p><p><strong>If you could leave people with one piece of advice about how to deal with what's happening right now in the world, what would it be?</strong></p><p>Listen to the experts, center their lived experience and expertise - and then participate. We're all part of what happens next.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@benwerd" rel="noopener" target="_self"><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/1e6d0351b98744fece0ad48104ceb5e6aa9da61e-2316x2316.jpg?fm=jpg&amp;w=330&amp;dpr=2&amp;q=40" alt="Inline image"></a></p><p>Ben in the great outdoors!</p><hr></div></div></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>When it comes to building apps, no-code is having its moment. Typeform is a shining example of how no-code is well suited for simple use cases, and here at JourneyApps we use it extensively. However, therein lies the problem: No-code’s sweet spot is simple use cases. This limitation of no-code tools has been well analyzed. [<a href="https://journeyapps.com/blog/low-code-road-to-software-enlightenment-part-1/">1</a>][<a href="https://www.alexhudson.com/2020/01/13/the-no-code-delusion/">2</a>]</p>

<p>If you want to build more sophisticated custom software, you essentially have two options:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Use a no-code/low-code tool and jump through nasty hoops to implement the sophisticated parts of your app — which most often means writing actual code that needs to conform to the constraints of the tool.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use pro-code tools such as Swift/Objective-C, or frameworks like Xamarin/MAUI, etc.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://journeyapps.com/assets/images/blog/2020-09-08-no-code-vs-pro-code-a-new-hope/1.png" alt="image"></p>

<p><em>Image: building anything beyond basic logic with a visual programming language ends up looking like this</em></p>

<h3 id="a-big-problem-that-needs-solving">A Big Problem That Needs Solving</h3>

<p>Both of the above approaches (using pro-code, or using a low-code platform’s pro-code extensibility) are time-consuming, although for different reasons. Both also require senior developer talent, while senior developers are as scarce as hen’s teeth.</p>

<p>The result is that many companies are highly constrained while executing on ambitious software and digital initiatives.</p>

<p>These are the companies that we serve. Enterprise developers have been building custom apps using code on JourneyApps since 2009.</p>

<p>Towards the end of 2019 we wanted to up the ante. We wanted to offer a new app development paradigm for companies with a large app backlog, especially where a big chunk of that backlog consisted of ambitious B2E and B2B apps.</p>

<p>We set two high level goals for ourselves: help companies write great software much more productively (especially those whose core focus is not software), and let them do this using modern software technologies and best practices, without the typical barriers.</p>

<h3 id="key-tenets-of-what-we-set-out-to-build">Key Tenets of What We Set Out to Build</h3>

<p>We decided that the best thing we could do was to build a next-generation IDE (as a complement to our full-stack app platform) that has the <strong>power and flexibility of pro-code</strong> at its core, but also has the high <strong>development velocity and easy adoption of no-code/low-code platforms</strong>.</p>

<p>From the start, we decided that some things are non-negotiable:</p>

<h4 id="1-coding-should-be-easy">1. Coding should be easy</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Creating a new app shouldn’t require any configuration or setup.</li>
  <li>Developers should be able to start coding immediately.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2-coding-should-have-a-fast-feedback-loop">2. Coding should have a fast feedback loop</h4>

<ul>
  <li>We will have a first-class IDE with real-time error checking, keyboard shortcuts, IntelliSense, etc.</li>
  <li>Developers should have access to a real debugger.</li>
  <li>We will have live, stateful hot reload on an actual device in development mode — not a time-consuming compile &amp; deploy process.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="3-coding-in-the-ide-should-be-fun-and-relevant">3. Coding in the IDE should be fun and relevant</h4>

<ul>
  <li>We will not use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">DSL</a>: We will support open-source programming languages – preferably those with gradual typing.</li>
  <li>We will not use convoluted proprietary visual interfaces.</li>
  <li>We will not use a proprietary “app store”. Developers must be able to import open source packages.</li>
  <li>The IDE should be easily accessible to junior developers.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="4-coding-should-be-as-efficient-as-possible">4. Coding should be as efficient as possible</h4>

<ul>
  <li>We will provide developers with powerful functionality that can be used with minimal lines of code, and customized as required. This will include things like bi-directional relational offline data sync, dozens of UI components including Excel-like data grids, full audit trails, a cross-platform BLE engine, to name just a few.</li>
  <li>We will offer full git support with either hosted git, or external git providers (e.g. GitHub)</li>
  <li>We will support unit testing.</li>
  <li>We will support multiple environments, with easy portability of changes as new versions of software are moved from one environment to the next.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="5-there-should-always-be-an-escape-hatch">5. There should always be an escape hatch</h4>

<ul>
  <li>There will be APIs for everything.</li>
  <li>We will allow developers to easily mix in fully custom HTML in their UIs, and allow those custom HTML components to communicate bidirectionally with the rest of the frontend stack, when required.</li>
  <li>There will be a Node.js environment in our cloud backend where developers can build any custom backend functionality, without any configuration or setup.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="6-the-platform-should-be-secure-by-design">6. The platform should be secure by design</h4>

<h3 id="a-foundational-decision-building-a-web-ide">A Foundational Decision: Building a Web IDE</h3>

<p>We were taking the time to figure out a new approach to app development from first principles, so we had to make big design decisions with significant trade-offs. One major early decision was whether to build a web-based IDE or an installable desktop IDE.</p>

<p>The obvious question is: “Why an IDE on the web?”. We strongly believe that the recent developments across browser technology, transpiled languages and new approaches to software development (such as declarative UI) have made it possible to not only reach a desktop-grade level of quality in a web IDE, but also capitalize on the inherent benefits of the web paradigm.</p>

<p>Using this approach, we would have an IDE that is evergreen, cross-platform, cross-device, backed by modern UI and most importantly, ready for the future. Oh, and there would be nothing to install. Perhaps the biggest win, however, would be our ability to innovate quickly due to the open nature of web technologies and how quickly they evolve.</p>

<p>We’ll discuss other key design decisions in separate posts.</p>

<h3 id="unveiling-the-solution">Unveiling the Solution</h3>

<p>Today, we’re incredibly proud to announce <a href="https://journeyapps.com/platform/oxide/">OXIDE</a>. It’s the fruit of a lot of hard work by the JourneyApps team over the past year.</p>

<p>OXIDE helps both junior and senior developers build sophisticated cross-platform apps using JavaScript or TypeScript, complemented by visual tools. Apps can run natively on mobile and desktop operating systems, or in the browser as PWAs. Under the hood, OXIDE uses CRDTs [<a href="https://blog.kevinjahns.de/are-crdts-suitable-for-shared-editing/">3</a>] to enable live co-editing in teams, and it is deeply integrated with both GitHub and npm. In OXIDE, developers can switch between visual editing and coding for UI layout and schema design. Developers also have access to a first-class code debugging tool.</p>

<p>OXIDE is a fundamental pillar of the broader JourneyApps platform. Therefore, all apps inherit other flagship JourneyApps technologies out of the box — technologies that have seen around 10 years of R&amp;D and battle-hardening:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All apps ship with an enterprise-grade BaaS, and it’s easy to integrate with other data sources (in part because the platform is not based on a DSL).</li>
  <li>All apps are offline-first: Data is automatically synced to user devices, and loaded from the local database on each view. Querying data is fast. This avoids complicated state management and/or query cache systems. (What happens when data volumes scale? The platform provides highly configurable <a href="https://docs.journeyapps.com/reference/container/introduction-to-sync-rules">selective syncing.</a>)</li>
  <li>Each app is automatically provisioned with a Node.js serverless compute environment so that developers of all skill levels can add server-side logic and functionality.</li>
  <li>Developers have access to a rich built-in UI component set that is designed to work with data, with very little development overhead. No tweaking of styles or adding event listeners and state management to each component — this is handled for you.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, JourneyApps takes the complexity out of the development cycle. We take care of the hard problems of enterprise software development (hosting, offline data sync, mobile app builds, backend APIs, deployment tooling, audit trails, and more) so that developers can focus on core app requirements and maximize the rate of innovation at their companies.</p>

<p>Working in OXIDE looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://journeyapps.com/assets/images/blog/2020-09-08-no-code-vs-pro-code-a-new-hope/2.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>And here’s a view of a debugging session. The app can be seen on the bottom right (running on macOS), the Chrome developer tools on the top right, and OXIDE on the left:</p>

<p>48 hours after the shocking <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/08/28/unplugged-tesla-model-3-crashes-at-pikes-peak-pics-videos/">crash of the Unplugged Performance Tesla Model 3 at Pikes Peak</a>, the car was back to the track one more time. Thanks to the tireless efforts of the Unplugged team and the Tesla engineers who came to help in this crucial moment.</p>



<h2>The Resurrection</h2>



<p>The sub-frames of the car were bent and it was almost declared ‘totaled’ — but if there’s a will, there is always a way. A new Tesla Model 3 Performance was purchased to retrofit the sub-frames, motors, and other parts. </p>



<p>Tesla also rushed to cooperate in this effort by providing parts within hours of requirements from the car’s resurrection team.</p>



<p>Our friend Sofiaan Fraval from the Third Row Podcast covered the entire event with his camera and kept the Tesla Community in the loop. He took us inside the Eurocars workshop in the following video when the team was prepping the new glass roof for the tuned Model 3.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/owner-stories/">Tesla Community</a> also helped the team working on the CORSA 42 Unplugged Performance Tesla Model 3 at the workshop. They supported the team by giving moral support in person, on social media, and even sending meals for the team to keep their energy levels up and running.</p>



<p>Here are a few photographs of the Unplugged team working on the Tesla Model 3 resurrection for its next and final run on the Pikes Peak for this year.</p>

<p>As we showed in the first part of this story, one wheel of this Model 3 was totally damaged, and probably the other ones also weren’t in their perfect shape. So Unplugged Performance brought in a new set of Forged Monoblock Made-for-Tesla wheels.</p>

<p>Legendary pro racing car driver Randy Pobst is the one piloting this ultra-tuned electric beast of a vehicle. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The night before the Race Day, Randy test drove the newly rebuilt Unplugged <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-3/">Tesla Model 3</a> at the local airport, he thought the car was ready for the Pikes Peak hill climb.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>He talks about the re-building of the totaled Tesla Model 3 Performance in record time in the following video before attempting the final run on Pikes Peak. He calls this heroic vehicle restoration effort the ‘Teslurrection’.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Impossible? Better luck next year? </p><p>We laughed in the face of adversity and overcame the odds. </p><p>We then raced 14,000 feet to the summit at Pikes Peak to say: Tesla spirit never quits!</p><cite>Unplugged Performance via <a href="https://twitter.com/UnpluggedTesla/status/1300138406324965377" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter</a>.</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2>The Race Day</h2>



<p>Randy started the race with the utmost enthusiasm that is required to accomplish such feat as the Pikes Peak Hill Climb. As the Model 3 reached higher altitude, he felt something was not right.</p>



<p>The battery pack temperature of the car was rising beyond what is considered normal in these conditions. The Tesla safety algorithm kicked in and slowed down the vehicle to protect the battery pack.</p>

</figure>

<amp-youtube data-videoid="d7MFCRsE4ag" layout="responsive" width="16" height="9" title="Race Day Teslurrection" i-amphtml-layout="responsive"><i-amphtml-sizer></i-amphtml-sizer><a placeholder="" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7MFCRsE4ag"><amp-img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d7MFCRsE4ag/hqdefault.jpg" layout="fill" object-fit="cover" alt="Race Day Teslurrection" i-amphtml-layout="fill"></amp-img></a></amp-youtube>
</div></figure>



<p>This was perhaps a broken coolant tube or other damage in the battery pack of the car from the previous crash that went undetected in the restoration process.</p>



<p>However, Unplugged Performance is still investigating the actual cause of this battery pack overheating. This problem in the heat management system restricted the car’s peak power to a meager 240hp that is even lower than a Standard Range Plus Model 3.</p>



<p>The dream of completing the Pikes Peak hill climb lap in less than 10 mins wasn’t achieved. But still, it was a great adventure and the Tesla Community around the world is proud of the efforts of everyone involved.</p>



<p>The 2020 Unplugged Performance Tesla Model 3 Ascension-R completed the Pikes Peak lap in 11:04.131 — just behind a 2018 Tesla Model 3 which did it in 11:02.802 in the Exhibition category (full results PDF below).</p>



<h2>What Went Wrong</h2>



<p>As of this writing, Unplugged Performance released the following side-by-side comparison video of their qualifying vs Race Day runs — the results show that at least 230hp of the power was missing.</p>



<p>The Unplugged team also posted its analysis in the video description as:</p>



<blockquote><p>A week has gone by and we still do not know the causation of our casual Sunday drive on race day, but we at least now clearly know the problem. We ran the full race in limp mode! Our 11:04 run was with a power limit of 180kw for 10 of the 11 minutes. That’s 240hp peak power for almost the entire race…basically half of what the car should be outputting. We would have had more power in a Standard Range Model 3! </p><p>In the video, you’ll see that even despite a full battery state of charge, our power was lower right off of the line. Then something even more strange happened, the battery went directly to bright red and severe power cut at just under a minute (the display is visible in our other video). After that 180kw / 240hp was all the power the car could give us for the full race. Randy Pobst described the race as a tourist drive and that he had time to admire the scenery as the car gracefully, albeit slowly, escorted him to the summit. </p><p>In the end, we celebrated overcoming the extreme odds. It was still a victory for us. Just a much more leisurely pace to the top than we all expected.</p><cite>Source: Unplugged Performance / YouTube.</cite></blockquote>

<p>Still, the race and all the mission-critical stuff was an exciting joyride and this is just the beginning of what emission-free electric vehicles can achieve in the future. Let’s watch the in-car video of the final Race Day attempt and:</p>

			<section>
				<p>Blogging has been an exciting experience so far. After writing about <a href="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/open-core-first-principles/">a simple framework for building Open Core businesses</a>, I wanted to explore why Open Core is the better model (compared to Red Hat’s “Stable Release” approach). I didn’t do it, because I ended up writing about <a href="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/red-hats-business-model-was-an-outlier/">market data that proves that Open Core companies are financially more successful</a>. Now I’m sitting here, and I want to write the Open Core “deep-dive” blog post, but my brain keeps wandering off. I can’t stop thinking about MongoDB, the open source vendor with the highest market cap<sup>[1]</sup>. It’s such a fascinating business and extraordinarily transformed itself over the last years. But let’s take it step by step.</p><h2 id="self-managed-software-was-mongodb-s-roots">Self-managed Software Was MongoDB’s Roots</h2><p>MongoDB Inc. is the commercial vendor behind the MongoDB NoSQL database. Startup success stories are never a straight line, and MongoDB<sup>[2]</sup> is no exception. In 2007, the team planned on building an open source PaaS, but couldn’t find a database that would fit their needs. MongoDB was born, and eventually, the company scrapped its old vision and focused exclusively on building the database business<sup>[3]</sup>. Fast-forward a couple of years, MongoDB sees more than 30M downloads of the open source project, generates $100M+ in revenue, serves more than 4,000 customers, and goes public on October 20, 2017.</p><p>To quote from MongoDB’s S-1:</p><blockquote>“<em>MongoDB is the leading, modern database platform, built to run applications at scale across a broad range of use cases in the cloud, on-premise or in a hybrid environment. <strong>Our primary subscription package is MongoDB Enterprise Advanced, our comprehensive offering for enterprise customers that can be run in the cloud, on-premise or in a hybrid environment. </strong>MongoDB Enterprise Advanced includes our proprietary database server, advanced security, enterprise management capabilities, our graphical user interface, analytics integrations, technical support and a commercial license to our platform. <strong>We also offer MongoDB Atlas, our cloud hosted database-as-a-service</strong>, or DBaaS, offering that includes comprehensive infrastructure and management of our Community Server offering.</em>”</blockquote><p>In 2016, the year before MongoDB went public, the company generated 90% of its revenue from the downloadable, self-managed<sup>[4]</sup> enterprise product (called “MongoDB Enterprise Advanced”). Another 9% came from professional services associated with its enterprise business. Only 1% came from its “MongoDB Atlas” SaaS offering. That’s not surprising. <strong>The developer tool and infrastructure market lagged other market categories in terms of SaaS and public cloud adoption.</strong> It has started to shift over the last years, and nowadays, most newly founded B2B startups go SaaS first. But if you founded a company in 2007, the world looked very different.</p><p>In terms of numbers, MongoDB is a healthy, high-growth technology company (this was before companies like Zoom reset our expectations for what’s possible). Pre IPO, revenue grew 50%+ YoY, and MongoDB’s customer growth was accelerating with YoY growth between 70-90%.</p><figure><img src="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/2020/09/Revenue-and-Customer-Growth.svg" alt=""></figure><p>I remember looking at those numbers a few years ago. I was curious about the financial profile of developer-focused companies to better plan and model the Codeship business. In 2016, there weren’t many public companies selling to developers. I looked at all of them, and there was a pattern between the Atlassian’s, New Relic’s, and Twilio’s of the world. All of them saw quarter-over-quarter increases in their average revenue per customer. It wasn’t surprising. New Relic and Twilio became successful through developers championing their products and bringing them into their companies. Atlassian did product-led growth before it became the latest trend of the day. Atlassian has always been focused on the end-user, a simple online purchase process, and avoided a sales team as long as possible. All those companies have terrific Net Dollar Expansion rates, and their customers spend more and more over time. Additionally, when those companies matured, they started to move up-market. Once they seeded their products with enough teams inside a given company, they sold enterprise-level agreements. Larger companies spend more on software, are often willing to prepay for many years, and churn less than the SMB or Midmarket segment. <strong>Starting with SMBs, the Midmarket, or small teams inside large organizations and eventually moving upmarket is a well-established playbook.</strong></p><p>All of this brings me back to MongoDB. Atlassian, New Relic, Twilio - they all increased their average revenue per customer over time. They grew their customer base, and they grew their revenue proportionally faster than their customer base. MongoDB was the exception. Its revenue per customer declined over time, which at first didn’t make any sense to me.</p><figure><img src="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/2020/09/Average-Revenue-Per-Customer.svg" alt=""></figure><p>It was even more astounding that while their average revenue per customer decreased, MongoDB successfully grew the number of customers paying more than $100K per year. At the end of FY16 (the first time they reported the metric), MongoDB had 246 $100K+ customers. One year later, the number grew to 354, and by the end of FY18, MongoDB had 557 of those high-value customers. Despite the larger number of high-ACV customers, MongoDB’s average revenue per customer decreased. The only explanation for that could be that there’s a growing long-tail of small customers.</p><figure><img src="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/2020/09/Average-Revenue_Customers-and-_-100K-Customers.svg" alt=""></figure><h2 id="disrupt-yourself-or-get-disrupted">Disrupt Yourself or Get Disrupted</h2><p>When a company goes public, its S-1 filing shares much more data than a private company would ever transparently communicate. Yet, it only provides a short history, and if a company goes through a significant transformation, it’s hard to see the full picture. In hindsight, everything is more obvious. MongoDB was quietly working on their next S-curve. Developers are more and more building new applications in the cloud. It was clear to MongoDB that SaaS was the future. Without a solution for this increasingly important market segment, MongoDB knew that they couldn’t keep growing and would eventually stall and become irrelevant.</p><p>Looking back, MongoDB’s average revenue per customer decreasing was a good sign. The cause was its blossoming Atlas SaaS business. Only after the IPO, MongoDB started to break out dedicated numbers for SaaS vs. self-managed, and they are mind-blowing. Atlas grew 15.5x in FY18, 5.4x in FY19, and another 2.7x in FY20. It could be a standalone public company. What was 1% of total revenue at IPO time in 2017 became 44% of total revenue in Q2 2020 (= Q2’FY21).</p><figure><img src="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/2020/09/Revenue-By-Product.svg" alt=""></figure><p>SaaS revenue per customer is typically lower than revenue from self-managed products. It implies a specific customer segmentation. SaaS skews towards SMB, Midmarket, and pockets of teams in enterprises. Self-managed skews towards enterprises. Those large companies adopt new technology slower and have more stringent security requirements. The two worlds couldn’t be more opposite. SMB/Midmarket SaaS results in many small customers. Enterprise/Self-managed results in fewer and larger customers. Christopher Janz wrote a fantastic blog post about <a href="http://christophjanz.blogspot.com/2019/04/five-years-later-five-ways-to-build-100.html">the different ways to generate $100M in revenue</a>. I highly recommend reading it.</p><figure><img src="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/2020/09/Total-Number-of-Customers.svg" alt=""></figure><p>As long as MongoDB didn’t break out customer and revenue numbers per product, there was no way to tell them apart. The result was the confusing, decreasing average revenue per customer chart. With more data available now, we can analyze both revenue streams. We can see that MongoDB is growing its Atlas customer base, while its self-managed product is losing customers. Most customers of the self-managed product are likely converting to the SaaS solution. MongoDB is not churning those customers but leveraging its existing relationships to transition those customers to a cloud-native model. Despite the customer churn, the traditional business is still growing its overall revenue. The average revenue per customer of the self-managed business grew 3x over two years. That segment of customers is expanding, using the product more, and paying MongoDB more every year<sup>[5]</sup>.</p><figure><img src="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/2020/09/Average-Revenue_Customer-By-Product-1.svg" alt=""></figure><p>Even those hefty increases can’t offset the influx of small SaaS customers. The Atlas customers are paying a fraction (1/17!) of the self-managed customers. That’s despite the average revenue per SaaS customer doubling over the last two years as well. Keep in mind, this is positive, and only a testament to MongoDB’s SaaS efforts’ success. All it means is that the aggregated numbers are confusing, and frankly irrelevant.</p><h2 id="winners-consolidate-markets">Winners Consolidate Markets</h2><p>The number of Atlas customers increased significantly FY18 to FY19. This jump didn’t happen organically. MongoDB acquired one of its competitors in the SaaS market in October 2018 (which is FY19) - mLab. In the same month, MongoDB Inc. decided to relicense the MongoDB open source project under the Server Side Public License (SSPL)<sup>[6]</sup>. The license change resulted in an outcry in the open source community. Debating whether the SSPL still counts as “open source” and why MongoDB felt they had to do this deserves a dedicated blog post. The purpose of the SSPL is clear. To quote from <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-now-released-under-the-server-side-public-license">MongoDB’s announcement blog post</a>:</p><blockquote>“<em>The SSPL is designed to make sure that companies who do run a publicly available MongoDB (or any software subject to the SSPL) as a service are giving back to the community.</em>”</blockquote><p>In a nutshell, this means that <strong>anybody who offers a MongoDB-aaS product needs to open-source the underlying code that makes providing such a service possible</strong>. MongoDB took a clear shot at the large cloud providers, particularly Amazon Web Services. AWS excels in taking open source projects and running those for their customers as-a-Service.</p><p>AWS mostly didn’t care. A few months after MongoDB’s license changed, AWS launched DocumentDB, a proprietary NoSQL database that is compatible with MongoDB<sup>[7]</sup>. The compatibility only works for older versions that were released before the license change. But, that’s sufficient for AWS to provide a migration path for the many MongoDB enterprise workloads that rarely run on the latest version anyway. I still find it …</p></section></div></article></div></div>

<p>Since the IETF’s CFRG decided to recommend OPAQUE as a next-generation <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/04/21/authenticated-key-exchanges/">Password Authenticated Key Exchange</a>, there has been a lot of buzz in the cryptography community about committing authenticated encryption (known to the more academically inclined as Random Key Robustness), because OPAQUE requires <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/2W9LoeeiRzAiTWVnDsyxvjYPPmo/">an RKR-secure AE scheme</a>.</p>



<p>Random Key Robustness is a property that some symmetric encryption modes have, where it’s not feasible to decrypt a valid (ciphertext, tag) pair into two different plaintexts if both recipients are using different keys.</p>



<p>To illustrate this visually:</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="1348" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/robustness/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/robustness.png" data-orig-size="750,550" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="robustness" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/robustness.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/robustness.png?w=580" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/robustness.png" alt="An example of random key robustness: encrypting two different images, with two different keys, can produce an identical stream of bits (ciphertext + tag)."><figcaption>RKR-secure ciphers don’t let people produce the same ciphertext+tag from two different plaintexts, with two different keys. You might be able to create an identical ciphertext, but the authentication tag will differ. (Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/SwizzlestixUK">Swizz</a>.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In the wake of the CFRG discussion, it became immediately clear that <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/">AES-GCM doesn’t meet this requirement</a>.</p>



<p>What wasn’t immediately clear is <a href="https://keymaterial.net/2020/09/07/invisible-salamanders-in-aes-gcm-siv/">that AES-GCM-SIV also falls short</a>. But don’t take my word for it, Sophie Schmieg worked out the math in the linked post, which I highly recommend reading.</p>



<p>This isn’t to say that AES-GCM or AES-GCM-SIV are doomed, or should be deprecated. You probably don’t even care about Random Key Robustness in most of the places you’d use either algorithm! But if you are doing something where RKR actually matters, you probably care a lot. And it certainly violates the principle of least astonishment.</p>



<p>ChaCha20-Poly1305 won’t save you here either, since this is a property that message authentication codes based on cryptographic hash functions (e.g. HMAC) provide, but polynomial MACs (GMAC, Poly1305, etc.) do not.</p>



<p>So, if every standardized and widely-supported AEAD construction fails to provide RKR security, what’s a software engineer to do?<em> <a href="https://vnhacker.blogspot.com/2020/08/so-you-want-to-roll-your-own-crypto.html">Roll their own crypto</a>?!</em></p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="61" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/glitch-ecb/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/glitch-ecb.png" data-orig-size="224,224" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="glitch-ecb" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/glitch-ecb.png?w=224" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/glitch-ecb.png?w=224" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/glitch-ecb.png" alt=""><figcaption>Don’t actually do that. (Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/SwizzlestixUK">Swizz</a>.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>If you’re always on a well-tread path with a well-defined, standard threat model (i.e. client-server application accessible via TLS 1.3, possibly storing hashed passwords server-side), then rolling your own crypto isn’t just dangerous; it’s wholly unnecessary.</p>



<h2 id="coping-with-nonstandard-threat-models">Coping with Non-Standard Threat Models</h2>



<p>Systems that require Random Key Robustness do not fall within the standard threat model of AEAD cipher constructions.</p>



<p>However, RKR is far from the only scenario in which application developers might find themselves without a clear solution. Another example that comes up a lot:</p>



<blockquote><p>“I need to encrypt data in a relational database, but still somehow use it in SELECT queries.”</p><cite>— Far too many damn developers who haven’t heard of <a href="https://ciphersweet.paragonie.com/">CipherSweet</a>.</cite></blockquote>



<p>The first thing that you should do is clearly document your requirements and what attacks your system must protect against. Any undefined attack vector in your model should be assumed to be a vulnerability in your design. (This gets into <a href="https://www.cryptofails.com/post/75204435608/write-crypto-code-dont-publish-it">Unknown Unknowns</a> territory quickly.)</p>



<p>And then you should have a cryptographer review your design, and then have a cryptography engineer build it for you.</p>



<p><strong><em>But where’s the fun in that?</em></strong></p>

(Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/lynxvsjackalope">Khia</a>.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Instead of copping out with sane and reasonable advice, let’s actually walk through the process. At the end of this post, I’ll share a toy example I cooked up for this blog post.</p>



<h2 id="designing-new-cryptography">Designing New Cryptography</h2>



<h3 id="understand-the-problem">First, Understand the Problem</h3>



<p>Why don’t AES-GCM, etc. provide Random Key Robustness? Because they’re built with universal hash functions rather than cryptographic hash functions.</p>



<p>Cryptographic hash functions have different properties (i.e. preimage resistance and collision resistance) that make it significantly difficult to calculate two different authentication tags under two different keys. Attacking HMAC-SHA-256 in this way is about <a href="https://pthree.org/2016/06/19/the-physics-of-brute-force/">as expensive as brute forcing a 128-bit AES key</a>. (Good luck with that!)</p>



<p>However, cryptographic hash functions are much slower than polynomial MACs, and using them in a construction like HMAC approximately doubles the slowness.</p>



<p>You might be tempted to just hash they key and the message together to save on CPU cycles, but that’s actually <a href="https://blog.skullsecurity.org/2012/everything-you-need-to-know-about-hash-length-extension-attacks">not safe for the hash functions nearly everybody uses</a> (due to length extension attacks).</p>



<p>It logically follows that, <strong>if we had an AEAD cipher construction based on a hash function, we could have RKR security</strong>.</p>

(Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/lynxvsjackalope">Khia</a>.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3 id="prior-art">Look At Prior Art</h3>



<p>Before the days of AES-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305, there were a lot of ad hoc constructions used everywhere based on <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/07/12/comparison-of-symmetric-encryption-methods/#aes-gcm-vs-aes-cbc">AES-CBC and HMAC</a>. (In that era, everyone used HMAC-SHA1, but don’t do that.)</p>



<p>However, there are a number of problems with ad hoc CBC+HMAC that we don’t want to reintroduce in modern systems:</p>



<ol><li>If you forget to include the initialization vector in the HMAC tag, you give attackers free reign over the first 16 bytes of the decrypted plaintext without having to break the MAC.</li><li>The order of operations (Encrypt-then-MAC, MAC-then-Encrypt, Encrypt and MAC) matters tremendously.</li><li>CBC+HMAC is usually implemented in application-layer code, but the security of such a construction depends heavily on the availability and utilization of <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/08/27/soatoks-guide-to-side-channel-attacks/#string-comparison">constant-time functions</a>.</li><li>There is no standard format for CBC+HMAC, nor the order of operations for what gets fed into the MAC.<ul><li>IV + ciphertext? Ciphertext + IV?</li></ul><ul><li>Append the MAC, or prepend it?</li></ul></li><li>CBC+HMAC is only an AE mode, there is no room for additional authenticated data. If you try to naively shove extra data into the HMAC, <em>now you have to worry about canonicalization attacks</em>!</li><li>CBC mode requires padding (usually PKCS #7 padding), whereas cipher modes based on CTR do not.</li></ol>



<p>This is among the long list of reasons why cryptographers have spent the past decade (or longer) pushing developers towards AEAD modes.</p>



<p>Boring cryptography is good cryptography!</p>

(Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/lynxvsjackalope">Khia</a>.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Make sure you clearly understand the risks of the components other constructions have used.</p>



<h3 id="sketch-first-draft">Sketch Out A First Draft</h3>



<p>By now, it should be clear that if we have an Encrypt-then-MAC construction, where the MAC is based on a cryptographic hash function (e.g. SHA-256), we may be able to attain RKR security.</p>



<p>With that in mind, our sketch will probably look something like this:</p>



<ul><li>Encrypt(K1, M, N) -&gt; C<ul><li>Where Encrypt() is AES-CTR or equivalent</li></ul></li><li>Auth(K2, C, A) -&gt; T<ul><li>Where Auth() wraps HMAC-SHA2 or equivalent</li><li>How we feed C and A into the underlying MAC is important</li></ul></li><li>???? -&gt; K1, K2</li></ul>



<p>We still have to define some way of splitting a key (K) into two distinct keys (K1, K2). You never want to use a cryptographic key for more than one purpose, after all.</p>



<h3>Key-Splitting and Robustness</h3>



<p>Your encryption key and authentication key should be different, but they should also derived from the same input key! This is mainly to protect implementors from having independent keys and accidentally creating a forgery vulnerability.</p>



<p>There are several different ways you can split keys:</p>



<ol><li>Just use SHA-512(k), then cut it in half. Use one half for encryption, the other for authentication.</li><li>Use HMAC-SHA256(k, c1) and HMAC-SHA256(k, c2), where c1 and c2 are distinct (yet arbitrary) constants.</li><li>Use HKDF. This works with any secure cryptographic hash function, and was specifically designed for situations like this. HKDF also supports salting, which can be used to randomize our derived keys.</li></ol>



<p>We can really pick any of these three and be safe, but I’d advise against the first option. HKDF uses HMAC under-the-hood, so either of the latter options is fine.</p>



<h3 id="speed">Can We Make it Faster?</h3>



<p>What if, instead of HMAC-SHA256, we used <a href="https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3">BLAKE3</a>?</p>

<p>BLAKE3’s advertised 6.8 GiB/s can be even faster than <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/60269">Poly1305 or GHASH</a> (and BLAKE3’s speed really shines through with long messages, due to its extreme parallelism through Merkle trees).</p>

<p>It’s no secret that <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/">I’m not a fan of AES</a>. It’s not the mathematical properties of AES that bother me, it’s the 128-bit block size and the fact that software implementations have to decide between being fast or being secure.</p>

<p>ChaCha’s 256-bit security level is easier to justify: The underlying PRF state is 512 bits (which implies an approximately 256-bit security level) and the keys are always 256 bits.</p>



<p><s>Furthermore, if you’re building ChaCha and BLAKE3 in the same codebase, you could reuse some components (i.e. the compression function, G). This is very desirable if you’re trying to ship a small amount of code (e.g. embedded systems).</s> EDIT: <a href="https://twitter.com/veorq">One of the BLAKE3 authors</a> informed me that I’m mistaken about this: “[N]ope, not exactly the same logic (rotations in different direction)”.</p>



<h3 id="other-desirable-properties">Other Desirable Security Properties</h3>



<h4 id="nonces">Nonce Nonsense</h4>



<p>One of the biggest problems with standard AEAD modes is that they explode gloriously when you reuse a nonce. There are two ways out of this peril:</p>



<ol><li>Use a nonce misuse resistant AEAD construction (AES-GCM-SIV, etc.).<ul><li>For prior art on nonce-misuse resistant cipher modes based on ChaCha, check out <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/067">DAENCE</a>.</li></ul></li><li>Use large nonces (e.g. XChaCha20 uses 192-bit nonces) and generate them randomly, so the probability of nonce reuse becomes negligible.</li></ol>



<p>Since we’re already planning on using a hash function to derive subkeys (one for encryption, one for authentication), it makes sense to also accept a longer nonce than our stream cipher demands. The excess bytes can be passed to our KDF without significant risk or additional overhead.</p>



<p>Since the IETF’s ChaCha20 variant expects a 96-bit nonce, designing our construction to support 256-bit nonces means we can pass the first 160 bits of the nonce to the KDF and the latter 96 bits to the stream cipher. You can expect a single KDF collision after 2^80 encryptions, but it will almost certainly occur with a different nonce.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><p>Recently, while conducting research, I wanted to follow a specific kernel code flow: I was about to modify the behavior of an existing kernel mechanism, and I needed to understand the flow of data between different functions.</p><p>As with any open source project you’re trying to analyze, your go-to assistant is the source code. Linux, besides being open source, provides tons of <em>dynamic</em> tools for debugging, and they are a great supplement to static reading of the code. In this post, I’ll focus on one of these tools, <em>ftrace</em>, and present a modification I made to make its filtering capabilities more versatile.</p><h4>ftrace</h4><p>At its base, ftrace (Function Tracer) is a <em>dynamic function instrumentation infrastructure.</em> It can be used to set dynamic traces on virtually all kernel functions, and also supports a large set of static tracepoints, used to record core kernel events. It is available in most modern Linux distributions.</p><p>It’s a powerful tool for tracing flows and events in the kernel. Providing both in-kernel API and usermode control interface via <code>tracefs</code>, it’s arguably one of the most comprehensive tracing tools in Linux.</p><p>ftrace has many modes of operation, in this post I’ll focus on the <code>function_graph</code> mode: It allows you to record the call graph originating from a given function, recursively.</p><p>In case you’ve never used it (or just as a slight reminder) — here’s how it looks when tracing the kernel path for a <code>vfs_read</code> call on <code>/proc/version</code>:</p><pre>  8)               |  vfs_read() {

....</pre><p>That call graph can provide great aid in understanding flow, alongside reading the code.</p><p><em>This isn’t a starters guide for ftrace, so I will assume you know its basics from this point onward. If you want a longer introduction on ftrace and its additional modes, I recommend reading the articles in [1], [2] and [3].</em></p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p>Back here, I was trying to understand the receive flow of a specific TCP packet (which functions does it go through).</p><p>The TCP receive entry-point function is <code><a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0/source/net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c#L1781" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0/source/net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c#L1781">tcp_v4_rcv</a></code>. We can <code>function_graph</code> it, but we’ll soon encounter a problem — there are <strong>heaps</strong> of data generated by graph-tracing this function: On my desktop, under a not-so-heavy network load, I was getting a 5MB/s trace file! That’s a lot of data.</p><p>There are 2 limitations pointed out here:</p><ol><li>The calls didn’t undergo any filtering — all calls were written to the trace file. I wanted to see the graph of <code>tcp_v4_rcv</code> on a specific packet, not on all TCP packets processed by the system.</li><li>There’s no information attached to the calls (for example, function arguments). Take a look on the sample graph above — there are only function names and durations. How can we differentiate the “interesting” calls?</li></ol><h4>Existing filters?</h4><p>Let’s seek help from existing ftrace features. For this purpose, we can start with the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/trace/ftrace.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/trace/ftrace.txt">very long documentation</a>.</p><p>ftrace can record the current PID/TGID and the command (<code>/proc/pid/comm</code>), and report them in the trace file. As far as I can tell, no more specific details are available to be recorded on each entry.</p><p>ftrace also supports <strong>filtering</strong> by PID: Using the <code>set_ftrace_pid</code> file, we can limit the traced calls to specific processes. For example, this will limit traces to the <code>init</code> process:</p><pre># cd /sys/kernel/tracing
# echo 1 &gt; set_ftrace_pid</pre><p>Sounds nice, eh? For many filtering use-cases, this is just enough: A simple program that writes its PID to <code>set_ftrace_pid</code> and then invokes some kernel code you wish to trace.</p><p>In the network RX case, it’s impossible⁴: Network packets are processed in <em>software interrupts⁵</em> running possibly on any CPU, in the context of virtually any thread of the system. There goes filtering by PID…</p><p>I’m not aware of any other sophisticated filters allowed by ftrace. We can try to filter out the events externally (e.g in the case of network RX — filter away unwanted packets with <code>iptables</code>, this way they won’t end up in <code>tcp_v4_rcv</code>)…</p><p>… or, we can tweak ftrace to provide the filtering we need!</p><h4>Tweaking ftrace’s filtering</h4><p><em>All following Linux references are based on kernel 5.0+.</em></p><p>What I had in mind: ftrace has its PID-based filtering. I can provide external filtering, and after a call, I wish to trace passes my filter, the PID of the currently running process can be “added” to <code>set_ftrace_filter</code>, effectively making the process traced (and I’ll get the call graph I desired)</p><p>What happens when you write to <code>set_ftrace_pid</code>? A quick search of this string yields <code><a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0/source/kernel/trace/ftrace.c#L6593" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0/source/kernel/trace/ftrace.c#L6593">ftrace_init_tracefs</a></code> which registers the <code>tracefs</code> file; And <code><a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0/source/kernel/trace/ftrace.c#L6526" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0/source/kernel/trace/ftrace.c#L6526">ftrace_pid_write</a></code> actually implements the write.</p><p><code>ftrace_pid_write</code> is rather long for its seemingly simple purpose. Summing it up, this function does 3 things:</p><ol><li>Creates a <code>trace_pid_list</code> struct from the input PIDs (you can write multiple PIDs for tracing), and stores it for later use.</li><li>Registers a <code>sched_switch</code> event handler called <code><a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0/source/kernel/trace/ftrace.c#L6336" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0/source/kernel/trace/ftrace.c#L6336">ftrace_filter_pid_sched_switch_probe</a></code>.</li><li>Updates tracers that use PID filtering to have <code><a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0/source/kernel/trace/ftrace.c#L146" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0/source/kernel/trace/ftrace.c#L146">ftrace_pid_func</a></code> as their tracing handler.</li></ol><p>Effectively, the 3rd step enables filtering. <code>ftrace_pid_func</code> is very simple: It is called instead of the original tracing handler and checks whether the current task should be traced or not, by reading <code>tr-&gt;trace_buffer.data-&gt;ftrace_ignore_pid</code>. Iff tracing should be performed, it calls the original handler.</p><p>Let’s see where this field is updated. <code>ftrace_pid_write</code> has previously registered <code>ftrace_filter_pid_sched_switch_probe</code> for the <code>sched_switch</code> event. This handler will be called <em>for each task switch in the system.</em> It knows which is the next task to run.</p><pre>static void
ftrace_filter_pid_sched_switch_probe(void *data, bool preempt,
                                     struct task_struct *prev, struct task_struct *next)
{
    struct trace_array *tr = data;
    struct trace_pid_list *pid_list;
    pid_list = rcu_dereference_sched(tr-&gt;function_pids);
    this_cpu_write(tr-&gt;trace_buffer.data-&gt;ftrace_ignore_pid,
            trace_ignore_this_task(pid_list, next));
}</pre><p>&nbsp;It calls <code><a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0/source/kernel/trace/trace.c#L354" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.0/source/kernel/trace/trace.c#L354">trace_ignore_this_task</a></code> to see whether the new task’s PID was marked for tracing:</p><pre>bool
trace_ignore_this_task(struct trace_pid_list *filtered_pids, struct task_struct *task)
{
   /*
    * Return false, because if filtered_pids does not exist,
    * all pids are good to trace.
    */
    if (!filtered_pids)
        return false;

    return !trace_find_filtered_pid(filtered_pids, task-&gt;pid);
}</pre><p>The result is written into the <code>ftrace_ignore_pid</code> field, itself a percpu⁶ variable. This is a caching optimization: instead of filtering PIDs through the list whenever a task hits a traced function, the check of a PID is done <strong>once</strong> on task switch, and later the tracing decision is a mere cache read of this single boolean. Neat, and a very nice use of percpu as well! The result will be automatically invalidated upon the next call to <code>ftrace_filter_pid_sched_switch_probe</code>, which will write a new value for the next task.</p><p>I think we know enough. If we can update the percpu <code>ftrace_ignore_pid</code>, we can control whether tracing is enabled for the current CPU. If we can set it once we want to start tracing and unset it once we want to stop, we can use it to limit filtering at will.</p><p>So, I started writing a kernel module to work this out. Shortly enough, I recalled I worked on a MicroPython port for the Linux kernel⁷ just for such occasions! Using it, we can quickly define a few hooks that’ll do the job.</p><p>Our goal: given an input TCP packet that matches a precondition (say, destination port is 9000) we’d like to get its ftrace call-graph of <code>tcp_v4_rcv</code>.</p><p>We’ll start with a hook that’ll do the actual filtering on the packets. It has to be called <em>before </em>ftrace-graph, otherwise, we won’t be able to control the filtering! If I hook <code>tcp_v4_rcv</code> itself with ftrace, it runs after the ftrace-graph filtering decision, which is too late for us. I’m sure there’s a way around it, but I didn’t bother checking — instead, I hooked the <code>tcp_protocol-&gt;handler</code> pointer, which is used to call <code>tcp_v4_rcv</code>. This way, we’re surely called before it.</p><pre>def my_pre_tcp_v4_rcv(skb):
    # TODO: do the filtering stuff...
    return tcp_v4_rcv(skb)

cb = callback(my_pre_tcp_v4_rcv)
net_protocol_s = partial_struct("net_protocol")
net_protocol_s(tcp_protocol).handler = cb.ptr()</pre><p>At this point, we have the <code>sk_buff</code> and we can make the tracing decision. If we wish to trace, we can write to <code>tr-&gt;trace_buffer.data-&gt;ftrace_ignore_pid</code>… Which is not in the exported headers, sadly.</p><p>I wanted this to be fully compatible with standard kernel headers, so accessing unexported structs is a bad idea. A workaround is to hook <code>trace_ignore_this_task</code> with a simple handler that returns <code>1</code> only for our traced task. Then we can call <code>ftrace_filter_pid_sched_switch_probe</code>, as if a scheduler switch has happened. It will update the tracing status for the current task — and since we forced <code>trace_ignore_this_task()</code> …</p></div></div></section></div>

September 9, 2020 | https://othacehe.org/hosting-a-blog-using-only-scheme.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://othacehe.org/hosting-a-blog-using-only-scheme.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've discovered static blog generators using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> to
write a <a href="https://levelocestrigolo.org/">travel blog</a> a few years ago.</p><p>While it gets the job done, and allowed me to write articles using <a href="https://www.orgmode.org/">Org
mode</a>, I would not recommend it. I found it too
complex for my modest needs.</p><p>Being quite involved in <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">GNU Guix</a>, I decided to have a
look to <a href="https://dthompson.us/projects/haunt.html">Haunt</a> that is currently
used for the GNU Guix website.</p><p>Haunt defines itself as <em>a simple, functional, hackable static site generator
that gives authors the ability to treat websites as Scheme programs.</em></p><h2>Writing the blog using Haunt</h2><p>I chose to get started using the blog of David Thomson, the creator of Haunt
itself. Haunt is well
<a href="https://dthompson.us/manuals/haunt/index.html">documented</a> and writing a
website mostly consists in creating a site object, this way:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>site</span> <span>#:title</span> <span>"Othacehe"</span>
      <span>#:domain</span> <span>"othacehe.org"</span>
      <span>#:build-directory</span> <span>"/tmp/website"</span>
      <span>#:default-metadata</span>
      <span>'</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>author</span> <span>.</span> <span>"Mathieu Othacehe"</span><span>)</span>
        <span>(</span><span>email</span>  <span>.</span> <span>"othacehe@gnu.org"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
      <span>#:readers</span> <span>(</span><span>list</span> <span>commonmark-reader*</span><span>)</span>
      <span>#:builders</span> <span>(</span><span>list</span> <span>(</span><span>blog</span> <span>#:theme</span> <span>my-theme</span>
                             <span>#:collections</span> <span>%collections</span><span>)</span>
                       <span>(</span><span>atom-feed</span><span>)</span>
                       <span>(</span><span>atom-feeds-by-tag</span><span>)</span>
                       <span>index-page</span>
                       <span>projects-page</span>
                       <span>(</span><span>static-directory</span> <span>"css"</span><span>)</span>
                       <span>(</span><span>static-directory</span> <span>"fonts"</span><span>)</span>
                       <span>(</span><span>static-directory</span> <span>"files"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Pretty straightforward, compared to Hugo complex directory organization. The
most problematical part for me here are the three letters CSS. My strong
aversion for web design forbids me to roll-out my own theme.</p><p>One advantage of Hugo is the impressive collection of available website
themes. Haunt being for now less popular, I opted for the exact same theme as
David.</p><p>Then, a few lines of Scheme later, the website was ready. You can have a look
to my
<a href="https://gitlab.com/mothacehe/website/-/blob/master/haunt.scm">haunt.scm</a>. This
very file contains the whole configuration of the website, all the rest is
static content.</p><h2>Building the website</h2><p>The operation of <strong>building the website</strong> roughly consists in calling Haunt to
convert the Scheme files and the post articles into a bunch of HTML files.</p><p>This can be done by invoking this command:</p><pre><code>$ haunt build</code></pre><p>To run this command you obviously need to have <strong>haunt</strong> installed, but also
<strong>guile-syntax-highlight</strong> that is used for highlighting code snippets. As I'd
like the building process to be self-contained, I use GNU Guix for this
operation.</p><p>I won't go into details here but the idea is to write a
<a href="https://gitlab.com/mothacehe/website/-/blob/master/.guix.scm">.guix.scm</a> file
that specifies the build dependencies and the required command to build the
website.</p><p>Then, all you have to do is:</p><pre><code>$ guix build -f .guix.scm
...
build completed successfully
successfully built /gnu/store/19fx3njl6sr53nraayrvfzgb209g6mml-my-web-site.drv
/gnu/store/cgs02fcvmb3p7rni0nlb7wp85yd3mnkm-my-web-site
</code></pre><p>This returns a <em>store</em> directory that contains the built website. The only
requirement here is to have GNU Guix available.</p><p>Now, we need to find a way to deploy this directory on a web server,
and believe it or not, that's the fun part!</p><h2>Deploying the website</h2><p>I've been previously hosting stuff on a friend's server. I'd like to take my
independence, but I don't want to use a machine at home, as I'm frequently
moving.</p><p>This means that I need to find a hosting company. The choice is tricky because
I don't want to run Dockers, Kubernetes or type a bunch of <code>apt install</code>
commands and edit brutally some <code>/etc/</code> configuration files.</p><p>I would prefer the hosted machine to run <em>Guix System</em> so that I can pursue my
Scheme-only experiment.</p><p>Turns out GNU Guix has a <em>deploy</em> command that is able to:</p><ul><li>Deploy a Guix System configuration on a remote machine using SSH.</li><li>Spawn a remote DigitalOcean virtual machine and deploy a Guix System
configuration on it.</li></ul><p>The second option is very tempting, so I had a closer look at the mechanics.
It appears that <em>Guix System</em> is not supported as a distribution by
DigitalOcean. The employed trick for deployment is to spawn an <em>Ubuntu</em> VM, or
<em>droplet</em> as it is fancily called, and install <em>Guix System</em> from there.</p><p>I'm not fond of this approach and I would prefer to have <em>Guix System</em>
directly deployed. Luckily, I discovered that DigitalOcean supports running
<em>custom images</em>, that's exactly what we need.</p><p>I decided to proceed this way:</p><ul><li>Write an <code>os.scm</code> file that describes the configuration of a Guix System
distribution able to host my website.</li><li>Create a disk-image from this file and upload it on DigitalOcean.</li><li>Spawn a <em>droplet</em> using that disk-image and run it.</li></ul><p>Let's try it. We first need the <code>os.scm</code> configuration file. Here it is:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>use-modules</span> <span>(</span><span>gnu</span><span>)</span>

   <span>%base-services</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>It is a bit lengthy, but keep in mind that it will allow us to run a custom
<em>Guix System</em> distribution that behaves exactly as we want, out of the box.</p><p>Most of the work is to describe the five services we need:</p><ul><li>A DHCP server, so that the <em>droplet</em> can figure out its public IP address.</li><li>An OpenSSH server, so that we can connect to the <em>droplet</em> via SSH.</li><li>An Nginx web server hosting the website.</li><li>A certbot service so that we have proper HTTPS support.</li><li>A service that will periodically fetch the website sources from the Gitlab
repository, build them and deploy them.</li></ul><p>You can have a look to the documentation
<a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Services.html">here</a> for the exact
syntax of this file.</p><p>Then, we need to produce a disk-image out of this configuration file. It can
be done that way:</p><pre><code>$ guix system disk-image os.scm  -L ~/maintenance/hydra/modules/ --image-size=5G
...
/gnu/store/hca2zg51in1dnhaqkljfkvl8gyipmzni-disk-image</code></pre><p>The extra <em>-L</em> option is required here because the
<em>static-web-site-service-type</em> is not defined in GNU Guix itself, but in an
external repository, available
<a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix/maintenance.git/">here</a>. As stated
previously, this service will create a cron job that fetches the website
sources from my Gitlab repository, build them and deploy them. To save some
extra space, let's also convert this raw disk-image into a compressed
<strong>qcow2</strong> image:</p><pre><code>$ qemu-img convert -c -f raw -O qcow2 /gnu/store/hca2zg...-disk-image do.qcow2</code></pre><p>The resulting image that weighs around 500MiB can then be uploaded to
DigitalOcean, and a <em>droplet</em> using this custom image can be started from the
web interface.</p><p>A few other manipulations are required to set up the DNS records, but nothing
original.</p><p>That's it, using almost only Scheme, I was able to write and deploy this
blog. This setup should be autonomous and the only work left is to write some
articles, commit them, and wait for the <em>droplet</em> to fetch, build and deploy
them.</p><p>If for some reason I need to edit the configuration of the <em>droplet</em> in the
future, I have two options:</p><ul><li>Create a new disk-image and spawn a <em>droplet</em> from it.</li><li>Reconfigure the existing <em>droplet</em> using <code>guix deploy</code> via SSH.</li></ul><p>The two options are equally valid but the second one should go faster as it
does not involve uploading a new image. Anyway, we will maybe explore those
options in a future article.</p><p>Stay tuned.</p></div></div>]]>

September 9, 2020 | https://confused.ai/posts/intercepting-zoom-tls-encryption-bpf-uprobes | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://confused.ai/posts/intercepting-zoom-tls-encryption-bpf-uprobes">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I originally wrote an earlier version of this post at the end of March, when I was working on adding uprobes support to <a href="https://github.com/redsift/redbpf">redbpf</a>. I wanted to blog about the work I was doing and needed an application to instrument for the purpose of this post. At that time Zoom's popularity was rising quickly, and I happened to read somewhere that it supported this creepy attention tracking feature that allowed meeting hosts to monitor if attendees were paying attention. I figured I could try to use uprobes to snoop into the data Zoom was sending to their servers and see how the tracking worked.</p><p>But then Zoom quickly started getting under a lot of fire. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoombombing">Zoombombing</a> became a thing, several security issues were discovered and pretty much everyone started piling on the company. Considering all that, I was advised and ultimately decided not to publish the post.</p><p>Now things seem to have settled, Zoom <a href="https://blog.zoom.us/a-message-to-our-users/">improved their security</a> and by popular demand <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115000538083-Attendee-attention-tracking">got rid of attention tracking</a>. So I think I can finally publish this! I edited out the part about attention tracking (which no longer exists) and a couple of other things that could potentially get me in trouble.</p><p><strong>TLDR:</strong> I wrote a command line tool that uses BPF uprobes to intercept the TLS encrypted data that zoom sends over the network, and here I'm going to show the process I went through to write it. After I wrote this post I made the tool generic so that it can now instrument any program that uses OpenSSL. I published the code at <a href="https://github.com/alessandrod/snuffy">https://github.com/alessandrod/snuffy</a>.</p><h2>Instrumenting applications with uprobes</h2><p>Uprobes let you instrument user space applications by attaching custom code to arbitrary locations inside a target process. It's a bit like running an application in a debugger, setting breakpoints and fiddling around, but programmatically and without the overhead of a debugger.</p><p>An uprobe must be <a href="https://ingraind.org/api/cargo_bpf/#building">compiled</a> and <a href="https://ingraind.org/api/redbpf/load/struct.Loader.html">loaded</a> like any other BPF program, then it can be attached with the following API:</p><pre><code><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>attach_uprobe</span><span>(</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>self</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>    fn_name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>    offset</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>u64</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>    target</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>    pid</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>pid_t</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p><a href="https://ingraind.org/api/redbpf/struct.UProbe.html#method.attach_uprobe">attach_uprobe()</a> parses the <code>target</code> ELF binary or shared library, looks up the function <code>fn_name</code>, and once the target is running it injects the probe code at the resolved address. If <code>offset</code> is non-zero, its value is added to the address of <code>fn_name</code>. If <code>fn_name</code> is <code>None</code>, then <code>offset</code> is interpreted as starting from the beginning of the target's <code>.text</code> section. Finally if a <code>pid</code> is given, the probe will only be attached to the process with the given id.</p><p>In the rest of the post I'm going to show some examples of uprobes, focusing on the code that gets compiled to BPF bytecode, loaded in the kernel and then injected in the target process (in our case zoom). I'm not going to show much of the user-space code that loads the probes. That part is pretty standard rust code that does some setup, then prints out the data coming from the probes as it receives it. If you're interested you can still find all the user-space code at <a href="https://github.com/alessandrod/snuffy/blob/master/src/main.rs">https://github.com/alessandrod/snuffy/blob/master/src/main.rs</a>.</p><h2>Poking into Zoom</h2><p>We're going to use uprobes to inspect the network traffic between the zoom client and the company's servers. Zoom uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">Transport Layer Security</a> to encrypt the data. In order to intercept the <em>unencrypted</em> data, we need to find out which TLS library is used by the client, then attach uprobes to strategic places inside it.</p><p>Let's start with searching for common TLS symbols using <code>objdump</code>:</p><pre><code><span>$ objdump -CT /opt/zoom/zoom | grep -iE "ssl|gnutls"
</span>000000000080d5b0 g    DF .text	0000000000000013  Base        PreMeetingUIMgr::sig_blockUnknownSSLCertChanged()
<!-- -->000000000080d590 g    DF .text	0000000000000013  Base        PreMeetingUIMgr::sig_sslCertWarningChanged()

Once they are triggered, they get passed a <a href="https://ingraind.org/api/redbpf_probes/kprobe/struct.Registers.html">Registers</a> argument through which they can access memory.</p><p>The <code>SSL_write_entry</code> probe is the simplest. It reads the registers containing the values of the <code>buf</code> and <code>num</code> arguments passed to <code>SSL_write</code>, and sends a copy of the buffer to user-space before it gets encrypted.</p><p>The <code>SSL_read_entry</code> probe is similar in that it reads the content of the <code>ssl</code>, <code>buf</code> and <code>num</code> arguments passed to <code>SSL_read</code>. It doesn't send the buffer to user-space though. Remember the data is decrypted <em>after</em> <code>SSL_read</code> returns, so we need a second uprobe that we attach to the <em>return address</em> of the function. That's what <code>SSL_read_ret</code> is for. It's similar to the other two probes, but is annotated with <a href="https://ingraind.org/api/redbpf_probes/uprobe/prelude/attr.uretprobe.html">#[uretprobe]</a>, which means that it will trigger once the function it's attached to <em>returns</em>.</p><p>But why do we need two probes for <code>SSL_read</code>, why not just have <code>SSL_read_ret</code>? The answer is that when <code>SSL_read</code> returns, it's likely that the registers that used to contain the function arguments were modified, so we need to read their values at the start of the function and store them so we can retrieve them later. This is a very common pattern when writing BPF code.</p><p>Finally if zoom linked to OpenSSL dynamically or if debugging symbols were present, the user-space code to attach the probes would be as simple as:</p><pre><code><span>use</span><span> </span><span>redbpf</span><span>::</span><span>load</span><span>::</span><span>Loader</span><span>;</span><span>

            <div>
              <p><span>7 August 2020</span><span>• PRESSRELEASE</span></p><p>On August 7, the WHO reports more than 1 million recorded COVID-19 infections in Africa and calls it a turning point. Yet, the number of people who are sick or deceased on the continent is relatively low. How is that possible? In an article in Science, LUMC researchers and partners in Africa highlight the possible causes and add the hypothesis that the distinct wiring of the immune system might also be playing a role in the relatively low COVID-19 death rates in Africa.</p>

<p>          According to the authors, many predicted a very dark scenario for Africa with millions of COVID-19 deaths as many countries on the continent grapple with poverty, poor health systems and unhygienic conditions. However, factors such as country lockdowns, bans on mass gatherings, young population age, and less diabetes and cardiovascular diseases probably contributed to the dampened COVID-19 death rates so far.&nbsp;          </p>
<h2>          Intense exposure to microorganisms          
</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.lumc.nl/cen/ima/80813054048221/1964392/covid-in-africa.jpg" alt="Diagnosis of COVID-19 in the laboratory in CERMEL, Gabon. Photo: Curtsy of Professor Ayloa Akim Adegnika." title="Diagnosis of COVID-19 in the laboratory in CERMEL, Gabon. Photo: Curtsy of Professor Ayloa Akim Adegnika." width="395" height="260"></p><p>          LUMC LEaDing fellow Simon Jochems and Professor of Parasitology Maria Yazdanbakhsh, with their co-authors, write in Science that the more intense exposure to microorganisms and parasites might also play an important role in the reported low death rate per capita in Africa compared to many other parts of the world. This exposure leads to a distinct wiring of the immune system. Yazdanbakhsh: “We have shown together with our partners in low to middle income countries that the immune system of people living in less urban areas is very distinct. This is not just because of genetics, but more importantly due to environmental factors. Of note, the largest burden of disease of COVID-19 in Africa is found in South-Africa, the most developed country on the continent, accounting for over 50% of cases.”          </p>
<p>          Previous research has shown that the immune system of someone living in the Netherlands is very distinct from a person with the same age and sex living in Senegal, Gabon or Indonesia. But more importantly, someone living in an urban area of these countries has even a more distinct immune system than a genetically similar person living in a rural area of the same country. “A distinct immune system will also mean a distinct response to SARS-CoV-2. For example, one of the immune cells in the lungs that leads to the cytokine storm, might be better regulated in Africans and therefore cause less havoc upon infection with SARS-CoV-2”, explains Jochems, an expert in mucosal immunology and in particular of the airways.          </p>
<h2>          Africa in COVID-19 research roadmap          
</h2>
<p>          Therefore, Africa should be included in the COVID-19 research roadmap, states Yazdanbakhsh. “Understanding the variability in the epidemiology of COVID-19 and identifying the key factors that contribute to the course of the pandemic, can help us develop innovative policies, therapies and vaccines that help the global fight against this and possibly future pandemics.”          </p>
<p>          “What is contributing most strongly to the pattern of COVID-19: social distancing, ban on large gatherings, socioeconomic segregation, or washing hands? Why is young age protective? Which cells or signals in the immune system need to be triggered to prevent the excessive inflammation? The answers to all these questions, through multisectoral research, would provide us with the knowledge that we need to stop the pandemic."&nbsp;          </p>
<h2>          LUMC Global programme          
</h2>
<p>          The long term and sustained relations between LUMC and African research partners has been essential in being able to publish these insights. Yazdanbakhsh: “In order to understand global health issues, looking at and working closely together with researchers in continents such as Africa is indispensable.” This is the reason why the LUMC will put extra effort in its international outreach through the LUMC Global programme.          </p>

      Revealing a Forgotten Chinese Compute History: Stone MS-240x Typewriter (1): Background
    </h2> 
    
  </header>
  <!-- /.post-info -->
  <div>
    <p>While typewriters for European languages was available since the 1800s, Chinese typewriter was always hard to build. In the late 80s in PR China, a company, Stone Company (四通公司), in coordination with Mitsui &amp; Co., Ltd, released a series of revolutionary Chinese typewriters. It was adequately priced, user friendly, and from a n engineer's point of view, a masterpiece in engineering.</p>
<p>With help of Mr Wang Jizhi (王缉志), the Chief Scientist at Stone Co and inventor of Stone Chinese typewriter, I was able to obtain some technical documentation on the original Stone typewriter. This series of article discusses about the background, the technical details, and the long term effects of the revolutionary typewriter.</p>
<div id="background">
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>CJK computing is hard. Depending which standard to take, there are 4800 (常用國字標準字體表 / List of Frequently used National Character Standard Font) or 4400 (常用漢字表 / List of Jōyō Kanji) or 3500 (通用规范汉字表 / List of Commonly Used Standard Chinese Characters) frequently used characters. Considering not-so-frequently-used-but-necessary characters, we'll be looking at something around 10k characters.</p>
<p>As we know, there're only 7 bits in ASCII, which means it can hold up to 127 characters. The reason being 7 bits? To reduce cost. Apparently, ASCII is not enough to support anything that's not English. Pioneers in Japan opted to use 8 bit encoding (JIS X 0201) to allow Katakana -- well, that's better than nothing. Unfortunately, Kanji or even Hiragana are not available.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, a very large amount of internal encodings was released by multiple companies and government entities. But there're one common thing -- all characters were encoded with multiple bytes (2 or 4, depending on amount of characters to support).</p>
<p>Another problem is CJK font. With so many characters to support and display, font is a big problem. If we use 12x12 pixels to display each CJK character, it would take a whopping amount of 18 bytes of space! For an entire set of Chinese characters included in GB2312, it will take around 122 KB of space. In the 70s or 80s, memory are extremely expensive. The IBM PC comes with just 64KB of RAM and 64 KB of ROM and costs 1565 USD in 1981. Remember, PR China was still in extreme poverty, and take home pay for an average teacher is just 30 RMB (10 USD) per month. Nobody wants to use 13 years worth of salary to buy a IBM PC yet _still_ can't use your language! A solution must be made!</p>
<p>Well, the solution back then was hardware based. Mask ROM is a really good solution to store large amount of data in the 80s. With a specifically built, IBM PC compatible display adapter, the display adapter is able to display CJK characters if the screen is in text mode. However, the add-on card is not cheap, as it retails at around 2000 USD, more expensive than a PC!</p>
<p>The most common use of computers in the 80s is word processing. Businesses and government entities literally just buy the computers for typesetting, and schools buy them to print stuff on mimeograph wax papers for the students. So, naturally, the 80-20 rule kicks in: if 80% of the users are just buying the computers for typesetting and printing, why buy an expensive PC, an expensive add-on card, and a printer, why not just release a Chinese typewriter?</p>
<p>Well, the answer is, there were Chinese typewriters already, but they all suck.</p>
<p>Most typewriters are imported from Japan and have a built-in thermal printer. Not a good choice in China, as thermal papers has to be imported. Also, thermal paper are just not good for archival purposes. Besides that, you can't use thermal printer to print on wax papers.</p>
<p>Some other typewriters are not user friendly, and some of them have fonts not suitable for use in China. This might be a surprise to non-CJK users, but the reality is, different culture sometimes use different variants to write the same character, and while still perfectly readable by other Chinese character using cultures, it feels foreign and strange.</p>
<p>So here comes the Stone Chinese Typewriter, a typewriter that's very user friendly, with localized Chinese fonts, a 24 pin dot matrix printer, and more importantly, only costs around 13500 RMB in total (~ 30k USD), almost 1/5 the price for a complete set of Chinese computer.</p>
<p>Some interesting fact on the manufacturing process: the electrical boards and parts was imported from Japan costing around 6000 RMB. When arrived at Beijing, SOTEC (Stone Office Terminal Equipment Co, a wholly owned subsidiary of Stone Co) assembles the machine, put the EPROM containing the software in, and performs QA checks. The machine will then be sold to the Office Automation Department of Stone Co at 9000 RMB. The OA department sells the machine to dealers across the country at around 11000 RMB. The total BOM cost is at around 50% of the retail price, much lower than the standard rate of 30% in consumer electronics industry such as TV sets.</p>
</div>
<div id="technical-overview">
<h2>Technical Overview</h2>
<p>I'm not going to talk a whole lot about technical details in this article. This will come later when I finish writing the emulator for the typewriter. However, I'd still like to share some high level overview on the machine itself.</p>
<p>The original MS-2400 typewriter is actually a computer. This should not be a surprise to anyone, as you really needed a serious computer to perform word processing tasks.</p>
<p>The hardware was designed by ALPS Electric in Japan, and all software was architectured by Mr Wang Jizhi and designed by himself with a small team.</p>
<p>NEC V20, an Intel 8088 clone, is the heart of the system. However, this is not a IBM PC clone. The similarity with PC really stops here, as BIOS, IO devices, and even the keyboard are not PC compatible. Heck, even the PIT are not compatible!</p>
<p>This machine featured 64 KB of RAM, 64 KB of EPROM for BIOS and word processor, 576 KB Chinese Character Generator (2 * 256 KB, 1 * 128 KB mask ROM), a 32 KB Chinese dictionary (not for looking up words, but for converting keystrokes to Chinese characters, later commonly known as Input Method), and another optional 32 KB Chinese dictionary for secondary input method.</p>
<p>There are no video output capability for MS-2400. The display is a 240x64 LCD controlled by OKI MSM6255 LCD controller.</p>
<p>There's also a Ni-Cd battery in the machine, which could back up the memory for around 30 days.</p>
<p>To support the printer and keyboard, there are 4 timers with 3 modes (including NMI). The printer can print up to 20 characters per second.</p>
<p>The external memory is audio cassette. It has standard 3.5 mm audio jacks to interface with an external recording device.</p>
<div id="the-os">
<h3>The OS</h3>
<p>No, there are no OS. The BIOS itself is the OS. As the machine is not designed to run any PC OS, ALPS simply implemented everything as software interrupts. As the BIOS is mapped to the fixed F000:8000 address, all programs can just execute in place, saving precious memory. Even the Chinese font loading feature was done in the BIOS itself, so that user program (the word processor itself) don't have to worry anything about the hardware at all.</p>
</div>
<div id="development">
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>The development of word processor software was done on an IBM PC. Mr Shimadzu from ALPS Electric provided Mr Wang a BIOS routine reference manual, and Mr Wang first implemented the same BIOS routine on an IBM PC.</p>
<p>From there, all the development work are much easier, as the dev team can simply stay in China and develop everything locally to save cost on travel. Remember, China was still poor, and you just can't afford to have an entire team to stay in Japan for months.</p>
</div>
<div id="memory-maps">
<h3>Memory Maps</h3>
<p>All the flash memory are hard wired to the processor. This enables execution in place. All the software are in the flash memory, as there're no easy way to use external programs. The only external storage interface is a 1200bps audio interface.</p>
</div>
<div id="interrupts-as-api">
<h3>Interrupts as API</h3>
<p>This shouldn't be a surprise as well. After all, we're talking about a real mode x86 machine. The interrupts itself is the "stable API", and different team members would solely rely on interrupts to call each other's subroutines.</p>
</div>
<div id="event-driven">
<h3>Event Driven</h3>
<p>The word processing software itself is event driven. The machine is just looping forever, waiting for a hardware interrupt to come, and the request will be dispatched by the ISR.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we'll be discussing about the disassembled BIOS of the machine. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>Open letter to DY Logunov et al., authors of:</p>



<p><strong>“Safety and immunogenicity of an rAd26 and rAd5 vector-based heterologous prime-boost COVID-19 vaccine in two formulations: two open, non-randomised phase 1/2 studies from Russia.” Lancet. 2020;0(0). doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31866-3</strong></p>



<p>Available at:</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31866-3/fulltext">https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31866-3/fulltext</a></p>



<p>and to Richard Horton (editor of The Lancet).</p>



<p>OBJECT.</p>



<p>The study reports the results of a phase 1/2 study on an adenovirus-based vaccine, using Ad5 and Ad26 vectors for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 as antigen, and two different formulations (liquid and lyophilized).</p>



<p>During the current pandemic, the extreme public interest and expectations for an effective vaccine are understandable. However, the very same reasons should motivate the scientific community to pay even more attention to the scientific evidence and the underlying data, and it is thus of utmost importance that they are fully available for close scrutiny. Numerical data for all the experiments and original FACS files in fcs format, for example, would be of great help in evaluating the present study, enabling direct reproduction of &nbsp;all analyses and findings, rather than trying to do so from data abstracted or inferred from the figures.<br>While the research described in this study is potentially significant, the presentation of the data raises several concerns which require access to the original data to fully investigate. These are detailed below.</p>



<p>POTENTIAL DATA INCONSISTENCIES IN FIGURES 2, 3 AND 4.</p>



<p>In&nbsp;<strong>figure 2</strong>, the authors report the reciprocal titre of RBD IgG and neutralizing antibodies at different time points, for all the patient groups (challenged with different formulations).<br>As evident by the following reproduction, there are several data patterns which appear repeatedly for the reported experiments. To this end, connecting measurements for each individual across time points would be highly beneficial in reporting (and hence) interpreting the results. This suggestion also applies to similar measurements in the other manuscript figures.</p>

<p><br>In the red boxes, 9 out of 9 volunteers challenged with rAd26-S appear to have identical antibody titres at 21 and 28 days; this is also true for 7 out of 9 volunteers challenged with rAd5-S (yellow boxes). Furthermore, in the cyan boxes we can see all the experimental points differing for a constant value in two completely unrelated experiments; and 8 out of 9 experimental points are completely preserved among other two completely unrelated volunteer groups (green boxes).</p>



<p>While we understand that in this case the variable under study is discrete (representing the reciprocal of a dilution), still it seems to us that on the ground of simple probabilistic evaluations the fact of observing so many data points preserved among different experiments is highly unlikely.</p>



<p>For&nbsp;<strong>figure 3</strong>, intended to present the results of the cellular response to the different formulations used for challenging the volunteers, in the following reproduction repeated experimental point patterns are boxed with the same colours as in the previous case, with an important difference: in this case, the variable under study (cell proliferation %) is continuous in nature, rendering the coincidence of data points among different experiments even less likely.</p>

<p>For&nbsp;<strong>figure 4</strong>, which is intended to show the neutralizing antibody formation against the adenovirus vectors used for the vaccine, problems like those observed for figure 2 are again apparent. The coloured boxes in the following reproduction are to be intended as in the previous cases.</p>

<p>Please note that, in lack of the original numerical data, no conclusions can be definitively drawn on the reliability of the data presented, especially regarding the apparent duplications detected.</p>



<p>FURTHER CONCERNS.</p>



<p>The authors did not specify enough characteristics of the convalescent patients used as a control for the evaluation of the humoral response in figure 2. How were they matched to the different groups of enrolled volunteers? Since there are several convalescent control patients which apparently are seronegative and are also negative for neutralizing antibodies, it is also crucial to know when their plasma was collected – for each patient, how many days passed since symptoms and seronegativization occurred? How many convalescent controls were used for the graphs in figure 2?</p>

</span>
					</p><div>
						<p><span>For blind and visually impaired people like me, accessibility is the difference between us being able to use a website and clicking off it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2>How screen readers work</h2>
<p><span>Screen readers allow blind and visually impaired people to use computers, phones and tablets independently. Most screen readers use software, and a Text To Speech (TTS) engine, which is what converts the text from the screen reader into speech. Screen readers convert the text displayed on screen into a format that blind users can process.</span></p>
<p><span>Screen readers read out loud everything that’s on the screen and allow people to navigate using touch gestures and shortcut keys. They also work with other output devices such as a braille display.</span></p>
<p><span>As a screen reader user, here are the most common issues I encounter on a daily basis.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2>Unlabelled links and buttons</h2>
<p><span>Screen reader users rely on links and buttons to navigate around a website and to find the information we need. If links and buttons are not labelled correctly or if at all, then it makes it difficult for screen reader users to find the information they need. Ultimately, unlabelled links make it much harder to navigate the website easily, quickly and independently.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, when linking to an about page, ‘click here’ doesn’t give any clue as to where it leads to, but ‘find out more about who we are’ is clear.</span></p>
<p><span>If links and buttons are labelled correctly, screen readers can read the label out loud. It means that blind and visually impaired people don’t have to press the link or button without knowing where it will take them.</span></p>
<p><span>As well as unlabelled elements, links and buttons that do not have a clear description are also really frustrating. They must have a clear description of where they will lead to when pressed, rather than ‘click here’. Never make your users guess where a link will take them or force them into a trial-and-error situation. This makes for tedious user experience.</span></p>
<h2>No image descriptions</h2>
<p><span>This is probably the most common issue I encounter when browsing the web.&nbsp;</span><span>Using image descriptions is essential for accessibility. Image descriptions are also known as alt text (alternative text) which is a written description of an image.</span></p>
<p><span>Screen readers read image descriptions out loud. This means that blind and visually impaired people can understand the content of the image in an accessible way.&nbsp;</span><span>If images do not have alt text, then screen readers will simply say “image” or “graphic” which gives no context or meaning.</span></p>
<p><span>Images often convey valuable information. It’s therefore important that people with a visual impairment can access this information as well.&nbsp;</span><span>Alt text should be clearly written and give an accurate description of the image.</span></p>
<p><strong>Check out <a href="https://bighack.org/how-to-write-better-alt-text-descriptions-for-accessibility/">our tips for writing better alt text</a> to ensure your images are fully accessible.</strong></p>
<h2>Poor use of headings</h2>
<p><span>For quick and easy navigation, many screen reader users navigate using various elements on the page such as headings. They are a great way to find the information we need quickly and effectively. Especially when they follow a logical heading structure with H1s, H2s and H3s helping to prioritise the content.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x.jpg" alt="Logical heading structure begins with Heading 1, with Heading 2 sitting beneath heading 1. Heading 3 sits within heading 2 and so on." width="1958" height="1236" srcset="https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x.jpg 1958w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-300x189.jpg 300w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-768x485.jpg 768w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-1536x970.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1958px) 100vw, 1958px" data-srcset="https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x.jpg 1958w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-300x189.jpg 300w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-768x485.jpg 768w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-1536x970.jpg 1536w" data-src="https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></p>
<p><span>If websites don’t use headings, it means screen reader users are unable to use the keyboard shortcuts to navigate through the webpage this way. If that’s the case, we have to resort to tabbing or arrowing through a long web page to find the information we need.</span></p>
<p>Headings also help to break up the web content visually and improve readability. Other elements that screen reader users use to navigate webpages include links, lists or landmarks.</p>
<h2>Inaccessible web forms</h2>
<p><span>Most websites use forms in one way or another. Whether it’s to help you search for a product or to get in touch through a contact form. However, when these forms are not labelled, or not labelled correctly, it means we cannot use them.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, if a search box is not labelled, it means screen reader users have no idea of the purpose of that box. It means people who use screen readers cannot access the same functionality.</span></p>
<p><span>Contact forms are an effective way for customers to get in touch with your brand or business. And as a screen reader user, there’s nothing more frustrating than these forms being labelled incorrectly.</span></p>
<p><span>Especially CAPTCHA checkout requirements. Without an option to hear the audio, it’s not accessible. It means we are unable to fill in the form independently. I often have to enlist help from a sighted person, but this isn’t possible for everyone.</span><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<h2>Auto-playing audio and video</h2>
<p><span>Most people will know how annoying it is to load a web page with noisy adverts that start playing suddenly. But for screen reader users, it can be even more alarming. When video or audio starts playing automatically, it can drown out the voice of the screen reader. This makes it harder to find the pause or stop buttons.</span></p>
<p><span>(And if these buttons are unlabelled, then it’s practically impossible for me to stop the video quickly which causes extra frustration.) If I’m unable to stop the sound or video, I normally click off.</span></p>
<p><span>The solution? Make sure there’s no auto-playing video or audio when your website loads. If you really want to use video, make sure the audio is muted and the user can pause, stop or hide the media player.</span></p>
<p><span>These issues may seem small to sighted users. But they’re the difference between me being able to use a website independently or not. And they make a huge difference when implemented correctly.</span></p>

quite probably you remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActiveX">ActiveX</a> controls. Most
frequently this involved bulky popups on pages with these controls having to display something
more complex than a few blocks of text.</p>

<p>Or, remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_applet">Java applets</a>? They became
available in 1995, and later they weren’t limited to just Windows and Internet Explorer. I remember
I had to use Java applets on macOS as recently as 2013, which chronologically is closer to the
present time than the 90s are. (Feeling so old anyway! 👴)</p>

<p>Seems like ActiveX and Java applets were necessities mostly in the enterprise world, but
Macromedia Flash (later known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash">Adobe Flash</a>)
was certainly much more widely known to consumers. It was a requirement in the early days of streaming
video (even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/27/7926001/youtube-drops-flash-for-html5-video-default">YouTube required
Flash</a>
to work back then!), but also a major driver in browser gaming in late 2000s and early 2010s.
We certainly could blame Flash for making our browser windows look like this:</p>

<p>While ActiveX has seemingly failed to reach a significant adoption, Microsoft made yet another
attempt with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Silverlight">Silverlight</a>:</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://desiatov.com/static/silverlight-b8600e7fe201dbc24998a9aacecd3684-da6d6.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

<p>In the meantime, Google was working on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Native_Client">its own thing for
Chrome</a>:</p>

<p>It would be fair to say that these attempts failed to establish wide adoption, especially
after both consumers and businesses started shifting to mobile. Here’s how all these forays ended
according to Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft dropped ActiveX support from the Windows Store edition of Internet Explorer 10 in
Windows 8. In 2015 Microsoft released Microsoft Edge, the replacement for Internet Explorer with
no support for ActiveX, this marked the end of the technology in Microsoft’s web browser
development.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Beginning in 2013, major web browsers began to phase out support for the underlying technology
applets used to run, with applets becoming completely unable to be run by 2015–2017. Java applets
were deprecated since Java 9 in 2017 and removed from Java SE 11 (18.9), released in September
2018.</p>

and will cease support, distribution, and security updates for Flash Player.</p>

<h2>But JavaScript solved all these problems, didn’t it?</h2>
<p>Most of these browser add-ons were introduced before modern JavaScript and HTML5 became available,
so one could argue you no longer need browser add-ons at all. Well, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/06/27/web-without-javascript">some
purists</a> even say browsers
should have never supported JavaScript or any scripting whatsoever in the first place. Nevertheless,
there are enough use cases for browser scripting and browser apps in general that are hard to avoid.
When looking at the history of browser plugins in general, it’s hard not to notice a few themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distributing productivity apps via browsers is convenient in a lot of cases.</li>
<li>Browser gaming made a lot of sense, especially for casual games.</li>
<li>In both of these scenarios browsers had to display something more complex than text and a few
static images.</li>
</ul>

    </p>
<p><small>The modern casual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense">tower defense game genre</a>
arguably was reborn due to the popularity of Adobe Flash and browser gaming, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Element_TD">Flash Element
TD</a> being a classic example.</small></p>
<p>Even though native apps were (and in many situations still are) objectively better for users, early
browser apps were attempting to build their own ad-hoc app stores before the App Store existed.
You didn’t have to buy a CD with an application and install it and manage it on your disk. You
didn’t have to install updates manually and migrate your data. There was no need to uninstall apps,
you just close a corresponding browser tab and forget about it.</p>
<p>And when browser scripting capabilities became advanced enough, some people started seeing the
allure of making a browser version of their app the only version they provided. Browsers are
cross-platform, aren’t they? Just wrap your JavaScript app code in a browser-like container (say
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(software_framework)">Electron</a>) and distribute that instead
of your native app. </p>
<p>But eventually not only the JavaScript APIs became more complex, the language itself could no longer
accommodate what developers wanted. Not everyone liked JavaScript syntax (remember
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoffeeScript">CoffeeScript</a>?) or semantics (I couldn’t help but
notice that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript">TypeScript</a> has grown in popularity in recent
years). But it’s hard to transpile an arbitrary programming language to JavaScript, the latter was
not built with that goal in mind.</p>
<p>Corollary, the JavaScript interpreter itself has both memory and performance overhead. Having a
garbage collector built in makes it even harder to transpile languages with different memory models
to JavaScript. The allure of having only one language to write all your apps for all platforms is
still there, but why do you have to be confined to JavaScript itself, even as a target language?</p>
<h2>How WebAssembly actually started</h2>
<p>With the death of browser plugins, at least we can praise the interoperability efforts of browser
vendors. Some lowest common denominator of JavaScript is supported in all browsers, and there is a
clear incentive for the vendors to keep up. With the demand to go beyond JavaScript, there were
initial attempts to support low level programming with asm.js in 2013:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Much of this performance gain over normal JavaScript [with asm.js was] due to 100% type consistency
and virtually no garbage collection (memory is manually managed in a large typed array).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><small><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asm.js">“asm.js”</a> article on Wikipedia.</small></p>
<p>Syntactically this still looked pretty much like JavaScript, but when you have a lot of low level code,
the resulting file can get big pretty quickly, and the size of your code is pretty important when your
users download it frequently. As you weren’t supposed to write asm.js code manually most of the time,
and it was designed primarily as compilation target, it made sense to invent a binary format for it.
That’s basically how WebAssembly started:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WebAssembly was first announced in 2015, and the first demonstration was executing Unity’s Angry
Bots in Firefox, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge. The precursor technologies were asm.js from
Mozilla and Google Native Client, and the initial implementation was based on the feature set of
asm.js.</p>

<h2>What WebAssembly got right</h2>
<p>Now you’re no longer restricted to JavaScript as a target language for browser apps. As soon as
<a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> got WebAssembly backend more or less ready, it allowed compilers built
on top of LLVM (for C, C++, Rust, Swift and many more) to adopt it without rewriting everything from
scratch. This unlocked the browser environment to a huge amount of pre-existing software that can
also run close to native speed if optimized well.</p>
<p>Not only can you run fun little projects such as <a href="https://sandspiel.club/">Sandspiel</a> and
<a href="https://orb.farm/">orb.farm</a> in your browser tab, but complex games such as <a href="https://www.continuation-labs.com/projects/d3wasm/">Doom
3</a> (at least its demo version) are available too.
Both <a href="https://blogs.unity3d.com/2018/08/15/webassembly-is-here/">Unity</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/unrealengine/status/932624595722559490">Unreal
Engine</a> announced their support for
WebAssembly, and while we may not see AAA games running in browsers on their initial release date,
this still gives enough confidence in the maturity of the platform.</p>

<p>We’re excited by the possibilities that WebAssembly opens up. Perhaps, by integrating with

reduce latency by running on Cloudflare, as close to the player as possible. Maybe, with the help

<p>This blogpost presents intuition and experimental results for Gated Linear Networks, a new family of neural networks introduced by DeepMind in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.01526.pdf">recent paper</a>. Accompanying implementations in JAX, NumPy, PyTorch and TensorFlow can be found <a href="https://github.com/aiwabdn/pygln">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-gated-linear-network">What is a Gated Linear Network?</h2>

<p>A <strong>Gated Linear Network (GLN)</strong> is a collection of <strong>data-dependent neurons</strong>, arranged in a sequence of layers. Instead of predicting the target output only at the final layer, as is usually the case in deep learning, each neuron predicts the output directly, computes the error and updates its weights locally in an online fashion. In the following, we will explain the various components of a GLN in more detail. We will start off by describing how a <strong>neuron</strong> works.</p>

<p>Imagine an expert who, given an input, is supposed to make a <strong>binary decision</strong> and report their prediction as a probability value. This expert considers two types of data when making their decision: the input itself, and a set of prediction probabilities for the same decision from a panel of other experts. The expert then performs the following steps to arrive at their own decision:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Conditioned on the input, choose one decision rule from a fixed set of rules which the expert maintains internally. In the paper, this process is implemented as <strong>halfspace gating</strong> and called the <strong>context function</strong>, since the input provides the “context” which determines how the decision is made. This context function is akin to <strong>locality-sensitive hashing</strong>, as similar inputs are supposed to map to the same decision rule.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the chosen decision rule to combine the prediction probabilities of the panel of other experts. In the paper, each decision rule consists of a set of weights which are used to aggregate the panel probabilities via <strong>geometric mixing</strong>. So the expert effectively refines the decisions of the panel, relying more on some experts than on others, depending on the context, i.e. the input.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By comparing their prediction with the expected output, the expert adjusts the selected set of weights which has produced this decision, by shifting them slightly in the direction which encourages the correct decision in the future.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The following awesome stick figure sketch attempts to visualize this:</p>

<p><img src="https://aiwabdn.github.io/pygln/assets/images/expert2.png" alt="panel-of-experts"></p>

<p>We can think of the layers in a GLN as panels of such experts. Each expert/neuron in a layer considers the previous layer as their panel of experts. Consequently, the prediction of the target output gets iteratively refined through the sequence of layers, until a last single-neuron layer makes the final decision, which is taken as the network output. Different from typical deep neural networks, however, the output of each neuron is directly interpretable and updated locally, as opposed to globally via backpropagation through the entire network.</p>

<h2 id="core-concepts">Core concepts</h2>

<p>With that intuition in place, let us look at the main mathematical concepts underlying a neuron in more detail. Henceforth, we will refer to an “expert” as a <strong>neuron</strong> and to a “panel” as a <strong>layer</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="halfspace-gating">Halfspace gating</h3>

<p>We have seen how each neuron has its own <strong>context function</strong> which it uses to choose a decision rule conditioned on the input. Since the neuron should use the same decision rule for similar inputs, the context function should map regions of the input space to the same context. One way to achieve this is to divide the space into <strong>halfspaces</strong> and compute region membership based on which halfspace an input point belongs to, but other methods, for instance, based on a fixed number of representative points, could be used instead.</p>

<p>Let’s consider a two-dimensional input space and an input point \((x_0, y_0)\). Any straight line divides the space into two halves, and our point lies either to the left (0) or right (1) of the line. So every line gives us a binary value indicating, very roughly, in which region of the input space our point is located.</p>

<p><img src="https://aiwabdn.github.io/pygln/assets/images/context_function.png" alt="context-function"></p>

<p>We can consider the point’s position relative to multiple lines and combine the binary results to form a binary string. In general, if we draw \(n\) lines, we get a binary string of length \(n\) with \(2^n\) possible values, i.e., sub-regions. This operation forms the basis of how the <strong>context function</strong> computes context identifiers given an input point. A neuron interprets this binary string as number and uses it as index into an array of \(2^n\) different set of weights, thus making a <strong>data-dependent choice</strong> of which linear function to apply.</p>

<p>In the figure above, the context function consists of \(3\) lines, shown in red, green and blue, which divide the space into \(2^3 = 8\) regions, indexed by integers from \([0, 7]\). When passed through the context function, input \((x_0, y_0)\) produces the binary string <em>“010”</em>, i.e. index \(2\), and point \((x_1, y_1)\) produces <em>“110”</em>, i.e. index \(6\).</p>

<p>Let’s see how that might look in code.</p>

<h3 id="geometric-mixing">Geometric mixing</h3>

<p>A neuron takes the probabilistic predictions of the previous layer and combines them using the context-selected weights to produce a prediction of its own. This is implemented as <strong>geometric mixing</strong>, that is, a dot product of the weights and the prediction logits of the previous layer and subsequent sigmoid:</p><p>

\[\mathrm{GEO}^1_w(p) = \sigma(w^\mathrm{T} \cdot \sigma^{-1}(p)) = \frac{\prod_{i=1}^{d}p_i^{w_i}}{\prod_{i=1}^{d}p_i^{w_i} + \prod_{i=1}^{d}(1 - p_i)^{w_i}},\]

</p><p>where \(\mathrm{GEO}^1_w(p)\) represents the mixed output when the ground truth is \(1\).</p>

<p>Conceptually, this implements a kind of voting mechanism:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If all weights are \(0\), i.e. no weight is given to any input, then the output is \(0.5\).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If all weights have the uniform value \(\frac{1}{d}\) (\(d\) being the number of neurons in the previous layer), i.e. equal weighting, then the output is the geometric mean of the predictions of the previous layer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, <strong>vetoing</strong> is possible in the sense that if one neuron from the previous layer has predicted a probability close to \(0\) and the weight assigned to that prediction is greater than \(0\), then the output is pushed towards \(0\).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As the neuron sees more samples, it learns which of the predictions of the previous layer to pay more attention to. So in a sense a neuron behaves like an expert who, given a certain type of input, learns the best way to combine decisions from other experts based on their area of expertise, to arrive at their own judgement. This also demonstrates the difference between a GLN and a normal neural network. Usually, the neurons of the intermediate layers of a neural network learn to combine “features” from the previous layers to produce a higher-order “feature” value. However, the features themselves do not have any (extrinsic) semantic meaning or obvious interpretation. That is why the weights of intermediate layers can only be updated via backpropagation after the final output has been computed, since it is the only interpretable value and can thus be optimized. A neuron in a GLN, on the other hand, is directly predicting the output and can consequently learn immediately from its mistakes.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="online-gradient-descent">Online gradient descent</h3>

<p>Now that we know how a neuron chooses weights based on the input, and uses them to mix the outputs of a previous layer of neurons to produce its own output, let’s see how it learns to update the weights in training.</p>

<p>Using the standard logarithmic loss, it can be shown that the gradient consists of scaling the difference between the output and the ground truth \(y\) by the logit of the output probability:</p><p>

\[\nabla \mathcal{L}^\mathrm{GEO}(w) = \nabla \big( -\log \mathrm{GEO}^y_w(p) \big) = \big( \mathrm{GEO}^1_w(p) - y \big) \cdot \mathrm{logit}(p).\]

</p><p>This value is then multiplied with the learning rate to arrive at the update for the weights used for the current data point by the neuron. This update can be performed for every neuron as soon as it predicts the output, so there is no need for a separate forward and backward pass during training. Contrary to a regular deep neural network, where the loss is computed at the final layer and the gradients are propagated backwards, layer by layer, a GLN will hence not suffer from vanishing/exploding gradients. Moreover, given enough expressive …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>The original founders of the major programming languages and computer systems are still alive today. They’ve had every opportunity to change with the times. They, after all, know innovation. They inspired us. They still do.</p>

<p>I’ll never understand a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Pollock">Jackson Polloc</a> painting, but I do understand this art shown above.</p>
<p>The first two guys listed have very valid reasons for making their sites this way, distilled down perfectly to the last drop of the purest logic. The last two guys are just trolling us.</p>
<p><em>I was going to list <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck">Mark Zuckerberg’s</a> homepage (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091101062708/http://www.facebook.com/zuck">archive 1</a>) (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200805074602/https://www.facebook.com/zuck">archive 2</a>) (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200831024214if_/https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0251986/">archive 3</a>) but it turns out he is sharing it with about 2.7 billion other people. It also presented compatibility issues by being listed on the same page with Richard Stallman.</em></p>

<h2 id="why-basic-flat-html-sites-are-best-for-most-of-us">Why Basic Flat HTML Sites Are Best for Most of Us</h2>
<h3 id="html-site--longevity">HTML Site = Longevity</h3>
<p>Being a zealous Christian, I’m a big fan of longevity. And, to me, there is nothing more enduring on the web than a basic HTML website.</p>
<p>You can host an HTML site, literally, for FREE, beautiful and complex…and it will be here later on when future post-world-war-3 generations finally find the <a href="https://archiveprogram.github.com/">GitHub Archive Program</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200831170906/https://archiveprogram.github.com/">archive</a>) (provided you use <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200831111818/https://pages.github.com/">archive</a>), I think…).</p>
<p>Lets be realistic. If you are like most people, you will probably abandon your site when you realize its pointless. But if you did it in HTML, it will still be here 20 years from now, even if you never touched it again. Just ask Linus Torvolds.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200731110209/https://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/syntaxerror.png">WordPress and other CMS’s will not do that for you…</a>)</p>
<h3 id="static-sites-can-handle-traffic">Static Sites Can Handle Traffic</h3>
<p>If you go viral and get inundated with traffic, an HTML flat site can handle it. Even if its running on a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/web-server/">Raspberry Pi</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200708214027/https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/web-server/">archive</a>).

The set up is fairly straight forward: model an A/B test as sampling from two beta distributions, sample from each distribution a lot, then compare the results.</p><p>This simulation approach often first appears as a clever little trick to solve a more complex math problem, but in fact is a primative form of Monte-Carlo Integration and turns out to one of the only ways to really solve this problem. By exploring this topic deeper in this post we'll see some of the myths that many people have about analytic solutions as well as demonstrating why Monte-carlo methods are so essential to Bayesian statistics.</p></div><h2>Background: A conversation about election results</h2><div><p>An interesting conversation happened on Twitter recently.

So it is not inconsistent, nor suprising for someone to believe a candidate has 71% chance of success and they still lose. Even when looking at typical p-values, we wait for 95% percent certainty before making claims (and many feel this is a pretty weak belief). But for some reason whenever election polls come up, it seems even very statistically minded people suddenly think that 51% chance is a high probability.</p><p>I retweeted Nate Silver's forecast, mentioned my annoyance and provided an example of another case with a similar probability of winning:</p></div></div></div><div data-block-json="{&quot;cache_age&quot;:&quot;3153600000&quot;,&quot;authorUrl&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/willkurt&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:550,&quot;height&quot;:null,&quot;hSize&quot;:null,&quot;resolveObject&quot;:&quot;Tweet&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;<blockquote class=\&quot;twitter-tweet\&quot;><p dir=\&quot;ltr\&quot; lang=\&quot;en\&quot;>This time can we all remember that rarely in statistics would we judge P(H|D) = 0.71 as a strong belief in anything. <br><br>For comparison if in an A/B test we had these results:<br><br>A has 2 successes in 15 trials<br>B has 3 successes in 14 trials<br><br>This roughly how strong our belief in B is <a href=\&quot;https://t.co/bB4PiB5Tao\&quot;>https://t.co/bB4PiB5Tao</a></p>\u2014 Will Kurt (@willkurt) <a href=\&quot;https://twitter.com/willkurt/status/1293575032975884288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\&quot;>August 12, 2020</a></blockquote>\n<script async=\&quot;\&quot; src=\&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\&quot; charset=\&quot;utf-8\&quot;></script>&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/willkurt/status/1293575032975884288&quot;,&quot;resolvedBy&quot;:&quot;twitter&quot;,&quot;floatDir&quot;:null,&quot;authorName&quot;:&quot;Will Kurt&quot;,&quot;version&quot;:&quot;1.0&quot;,&quot;resolved&quot;:true,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;rich&quot;,&quot;providerName&quot;:&quot;Twitter&quot;,&quot;providerUrl&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com&quot;}" data-block-type="22" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597610689295_6372"><div><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>This time can we all remember that rarely in statistics would we judge P(H|D) = 0.71 as a strong belief in anything. </p><p>For comparison if in an A/B test we had these results:</p><p>A has 2 successes in 15 trials<br>B has 3 successes in 14 trials</p><p>This roughly how strong our belief in B is <a href="https://t.co/bB4PiB5Tao">https://t.co/bB4PiB5Tao</a></p></div>— Will Kurt (@willkurt) <a href="https://twitter.com/willkurt/status/1293575032975884288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 12, 2020</a></blockquote>

What we are really doing here is equalivant to using a Monte-Carlo simulation to integrate over the distribution of the difference between two Beta distributed random variables. After the next two sections it will be more clear that what's happening here is a surprisingly sophisticated operation that is, in my opinion, the easiest method of solving this problem as well as not truly a brute force solution.</p></div><h2><br>Analytic versus Easy</h2><div><p>When we see computational solutions to mathematical problems our first instinct is typically to feel that we are avoiding solving the problem <em>analytically.</em> An analytical solution is one that uses mathematical analysis to find a closed form solution.</p><p>A strivial example, suppose I wanted to find the value that minimized \(f(x) = (x+3)^2\)</p><p>In R I could brute force this by looking over a range of answers like this:</p></div></div></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597610689295_13626"><div><pre><span>f</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>-</span> <span>function</span>(<span>x</span>){

It's also a bit messy because if we had iterated by an incredment that didn't include -3 exactly (say by 0.031) we would not get the exact answer.</p><p>If we know some basic calculus we know that our minimum has to be where the derivative is at 0. We can very easily work out that</p><p>$$f'(x) = 2(x+3)$$<br>And that</p><p>$$2(x + 3) = 0 $$</p><p>When</p><p>$$ x = -3 $$</p><p>Knowning basic calculus this later solution becomes much easier. </p><p>But even with the calculus is part is hard, often solving it once makes future solutions much easier. Take for example if you wanted to find the maximum likelihood for a normal distribution with a mean of \(\mu\) and standard deviation of \(\sigma\)</p><p>To solve this we start with our PDF for the normal distribution \(\varphi\):</p><p>$$\varphi(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2}$$</p><p>Now computing the derivative of this is not necessarily "easy" but it's certainly something we can do. All we really care about is when</p><p>$$\varphi'(x) = 0$$</p><p>Which we can find out happens when (computing the deriviative of course is left as an exercise for the reader):</p><p>$$\frac{\mu-x}{\sigma}$$</p></div><div><p>This allows us to reallize the amazing fact that for any normal distribution we come across, we know that the maximum likelihood estimate is the sample is when \(x = \mu\)!</p><p>Even though our calculus might take us a bit of work, once this is done the problem of doing maximum likelihood estimation for any Normal distribution truly does become easy!</p></div><h3><br>Proposing an Analytic solution to our problem</h3><div><p>Let's revisit our original problem this time attempting to find an analytic solution. This is a very interesting case because arguably this is the simplest Bayesian hypothesis test you can imagine.</p><p>Recall that we have two random variable representing our beliefs in each test. These are distributed according the the posterior which we described earlier.</p><p>$$A \sim \text{Beta}(2+1, 13+1)$$<br>$$B \sim \text{Beta}(3+1,11+1)$$</p><p>Here is where I skipped some steps in reasoning. What we want to know is:</p><p>$$P(B &gt;A)$$</p></div><div><p>Which is not expressed in a particularly useful mathematical way. A better way to solve this is to consider this as the sum (or difference in this case) of two random variables. What we really want to know is:</p><p>$$P(B - A &gt; 0)$$</p><p>In order to solve this problem we can think of a new random variable \(X\) which is going to be the difference between B and A:</p><p>$$X = B - A$$</p><p>Finally we'll suppose we have a probability density function for \(X\) we'll call \(\text{pdf}_X\). If we know \(\text{pdf}_X\) our solution is pretty close, we just need to integrate between 0 and the max domain of this distribution:</p><p>$$P(B &gt; A) = P(B - A &gt; 0) = \int_{x=0}^{\text{max}}\text{pdf}_{X}(x)$$</p><p>Already this is starting to look a bit complicated, but there's one big problem ahead. Unlike Normally distributed random variables, we have no equivalent of the Normal sum theorem (we'll cover this in a bit) for Beta distributed random variables. </p><p>What does \(\text{pdf}_X\) look like? For starters we know it's not a Beta distribution itself. We can see this because we know the domain (or support) of this distribution is not \([0,1]\). Because they are Beta distributed, A and B can both take on values from 0 to 1, which means the maximum result of this difference is 1 but the minimum is -1. So whatever this distribution is, its domain is \([-1,1]\) meaning it cannot be a Beta distribution.</p><p>We can use various rules about sum of random variables to determine the mean and variance of this distribution, but without knowing the exact form of this distribution we are unable to solve the integral analytically. </p><p>Here we can see that even in this profoundly simple problem the analytical solution is frustratingly …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></section></div></div></div></div>

            <!-- content --><p>Today we are going to discuss a change to server security that is going to make waves in the home lab and secondary markets for servers and components in the future. During our recent <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/dell-emc-poweredge-c6525-review-2u4n-amd-epyc-kilo-thread-server/">Dell EMC PowerEdge C6525 review</a> we briefly mentioned that AMD EPYC CPUs in the system are vendor locked to Dell EMC systems. This is not a Dell-specific concern. We have confirmed that other vendors are supporting the feature behind this. For the large vendors, their platform security teams are pushing to build more secure platforms for their customers, and that is going to have future impacts on the secondary server market and home labs.</p>
<p>In this article, we are going to cover the basics of what is happening. We are going to discuss the motivations, and why this is going to be more common in the future. Finally, we are going to discuss what those in the industry can do to keep the secondary server market operating well. If you work with partners or resellers who dip into used parts bins or even have the potential to purchase grey market CPUs, send them this article or accompanying video. The current market has a large disconnect between what some large customers are asking for, and large vendors are delivering on and what others in the market know is happening.<span id="more-46716"></span></p>

<h2>Background: How we learned this was a “thing”</h2>
<p>In 2018 we did a <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/dell-emc-poweredge-r7415-review/">Dell EMC PowerEdge R7415 review</a> and as part of that review, we started our normal process of trying different CPUs in the system. Early in that process, we used an AMD EPYC 7251 CPU, the low-end 8-core model, and noticed something curious. It would not work in our other test systems after.</p>
<p>After a bit of research, we found it was because Dell EMC was vendor locking the chips to Dell systems. We did not know exactly why, but we were told was a security feature. At this point, and even to this day two years later, not every vendor takes advantage of all of the AMD EPYC security features. What that practically means is that what we saw with the Dell EMC system is not what we saw with other systems. For example, we were able to interchangeably use CPUs in Supermicro and Tyan systems, but we could not use those systems once they went into a Dell EMC server.</p>

<p>We found we were not alone. Laboratories, VARs, and other organizations were finding that transferring AMD EPYC CPUs from one vendor’s system to another, was not the simple process it was on the Intel Xeon side. It did not always work.</p>
<p>We knew it was a security feature and thought that most who are buying servers would be informed of this by their sales reps or channel partners. After I personally got a lot of texts, e-mails, instant messaging, and comments on our C6525 video and article, I realized that this actually may be a situation where many people do not know what is going on.</p>

<p>This experience that we had, apparently is one that is not overly common yet. That makes sense because the systems that utilize the enhanced security levels are still largely new, and being used by their first buyers. Also, AMD still has a smaller market share than Intel. A big reason, by the way, that Intel Xeon does not have this issue is that they do not have the security feature that AMD has. Vendors have come out and stated that their AMD EPYC systems are more secure than their Intel Xeon systems, and this behavior is a byproduct of that enhanced security.</p>
<p>Next, we are going to dive into the feature of AMD processors (and what will be more common in future CPUs from other vendors.)</p>
<h2>AMD EPYC Secure Processor Platform Secure Boot (PSB)</h2>
<p>Let us start with the high-level slide. This is effectively the same slide on the AMD Secure Processor that we saw with the AMD EPYC 7001 series launch, but this is from the EPYC 7002 series. AMD EPYC CPUs may be x86, but they have an embedded Arm Cortex-A5 microcontroller that runs its own OS that is independent of the main system. This AMD Secure Processor is the backbone of AMD’s security push as it provides features such as key management and hardware root of trust for the platform.</p>
<figure id="attachment_36705" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-36705"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-epyc-7002-series-rome-delivers-a-knockout/amd-epyc-7002-platform-secure-processor/" rel="attachment wp-att-36705"><img src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor.jpg" alt="AMD EPYC 7002 Platform Secure Processor" width="1792" height="918" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor.jpg 1792w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor-400x205.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor-800x410.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor-696x357.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor-1068x547.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor-820x420.jpg 820w" sizes="(max-width: 1792px) 100vw, 1792px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-36705">AMD EPYC 7002 Platform Secure Processor</figcaption></figure>
<p>AMD spends time <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-confirms-cts-labs-exploits-requiring-admin-access/">patching this solution</a>&nbsp;to make it more secure, but it is generally fairly hard to reach without some extremely low-level access in a system. We are going to come back to the “Enables hardware validated boot” line shortly, but it is important to understand that this secure processor underpins many of AMD’s best security features.</p>
<p>For example, at STH we use EPYC’s Secure Memory Encryption and Secure Encrypted Virtualization heavily. With AMD EPYC, we do not have to manually manage keys. Instead, the ephemeral keys are managed for us by the AMD Secure Processor. This is the basis for what is really the building wave of confidential computing offerings such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/google-cloud-confidential-computing-enabled-by-amd-epyc-sev/">Google Cloud Confidential Computing Enabled by AMD EPYC SEV</a>. Intel has its secure boot features and SGX that will be enhanced greatly with <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/the-2021-intel-ice-pickle-how-2021-will-be-crunch-time/">Ice Lake Xeons</a>, but for now, AMD has this capability while Intel does not. When big vendors say AMD is more secure, the AMD Secure Processor is a cornerstone of those offerings.</p>

<p>Let us discuss that “Enables hardware validated boot” line. While traditionally CPUs just fire up in whatever platform they are in, AMD has intelligence in their CPU due to the Arm-based AMD Secure Processor. EPYC CPUs are designed to be a bit more intelligent about the platforms they are in, and interact with server platform security to act as this root of trust that would not be possible if they effectively just booted up in any system.</p>
<p>Here is a statement from AMD describing the AMD Platform Secure Boot.</p>
<p><em>The AMD Platform Secure Boot Feature (PSB) is a mitigation for firmware Advanced Persistent Threats. It is a defense-in-depth feature. PSB extends AMD’s silicon root of trust to protect the OEM’s BIOS.&nbsp; This allows the OEM to establish an unbroken chain of trust from AMD’s silicon root of trust to the OEM’s BIOS using PSB, and then from the OEM’s BIOS to the OS Bootloader using UEFI secure boot. This provides a very powerful defense against remote attackers seeking to embed malware into a platform’s firmware.</em></p>
<p><em>An OEM who trusts only their own cryptographically signed BIOS code to run on their platforms will use a PSB enabled motherboard and set one-time-programmable fuses in the processor to bind the processor to the OEM’s firmware code signing key. AMD processors are shipped unlocked from the factory, and can initially be used with any OEM’s motherboard. But once they are used with a motherboard with PSB enabled, the security fuses will be set, and from that point on, that processor can only be used with motherboards that use the same code signing key. (<strong>Source</strong>: AMD statement to STH)</em></p>
<p>That is a lot to take in. We asked HPE about this. Their response mirrored what the above was describing. HPE firmware, when a system is first turned on, performs this binding process where the AMD EPYC CPU expects to see HPE signed firmware. If you alter the HPE firmware on the system, the check fails and the system will not work. That means if your HPE motherboard fails, you can replace it and put your CPU in another HPE motherboard with signed HPE firmware. It also means if the server platform’s firmware is not signed by HPE, the processor will see it as evidence of tampering and not work.</p>
<p><strong>Edit: 2020-09-09</strong> – HPE clarified that they are doing this in a different manner than Dell after initially confirming that they were using the AMD PSB feature. After this went live, HPE sent us the following:</p>
<p><em>HPE does not use the same security technique that Dell is using for a BIOS hardware root of trust. HPE does not burn, fuse, or permanently store our public key into AMD processors which ship with our products. HPE uses a unique approach to authenticate our BIOS and BMC firmware: HPE fuses our hardware – or silicon – root of trust into our own BMC silicon to ensure only authenticated firmware is executed.&nbsp; Thus, while we implement a hardware root of trust for our BIOS and BMC firmware, the processors that ship with our servers are not locked to our platforms. (<strong>Source</strong>: HPE)</em></p>
<p>What is at least interesting there is that HPE was initially claiming feature parity with Dell to us, and from the comments on this article were saying they used this feature in sales pitches, but now are saying they are not blowing the eFuses.</p>

<p>Here is where the concern develops, and not necessarily for AMD, the OEM, or most of the initial customer base. Customers want more security. The OEMs want to create a secure hardware environment because that is what their customers want. AMD is implementing an advanced security solution beyond what Intel Xeons have giving the OEMs and end-customers what they want. Effectively, when these are sold as new systems, this is exactly what everyone involved wants.</p>
<p>If everyone is getting what they want, then where is the concern, that is what we are going to cover next.</p>

<p>and to Richard Horton (editor of The Lancet).</p>



<p>OBJECT.</p>



<p>The study reports the results of a phase 1/2 study on an adenovirus-based vaccine, using Ad5 and Ad26 vectors for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 as antigen, and two different formulations (liquid and lyophilized).</p>



<p>During the current pandemic, the extreme public interest and expectations for an effective vaccine are understandable. However, the very same reasons should motivate the scientific community to pay even more attention to the scientific evidence and the underlying data, and it is thus of utmost importance that they are fully available for close scrutiny. Numerical data for all the experiments and original FACS files in fcs format, for example, would be of great help in evaluating the present study, enabling direct reproduction of &nbsp;all analyses and findings, rather than trying to do so from data abstracted or inferred from the figures.<br>While the research described in this study is potentially significant, the presentation of the data raises several concerns which require access to the original data to fully investigate. These are detailed below.</p>



<p>POTENTIAL DATA INCONSISTENCIES IN FIGURES 2, 3 AND 4.</p>



<p>In&nbsp;<strong>figure 2</strong>, the authors report the reciprocal titre of RBD IgG and neutralizing antibodies at different time points, for all the patient groups (challenged with different formulations).<br>As evident by the following reproduction, there are several data patterns which appear repeatedly for the reported experiments. To this end, connecting measurements for each individual across time points would be highly beneficial in reporting (and hence) interpreting the results. This suggestion also applies to similar measurements in the other manuscript figures.</p>

<p><br>In the red boxes, 9 out of 9 volunteers challenged with rAd26-S appear to have identical antibody titres at 21 and 28 days; this is also true for 7 out of 9 volunteers challenged with rAd5-S (yellow boxes). Furthermore, in the cyan boxes we can see all the experimental points differing for a constant value in two completely unrelated experiments; and 8 out of 9 experimental points are completely preserved among other two completely unrelated volunteer groups (green boxes).</p>



<p>While we understand that in this case the variable under study is discrete (representing the reciprocal of a dilution), still it seems to us that on the ground of simple probabilistic evaluations the fact of observing so many data points preserved among different experiments is highly unlikely.</p>



<p>For&nbsp;<strong>figure 3</strong>, intended to present the results of the cellular response to the different formulations used for challenging the volunteers, in the following reproduction repeated experimental point patterns are boxed with the same colours as in the previous case, with an important difference: in this case, the variable under study (cell proliferation %) is continuous in nature, rendering the coincidence of data points among different experiments even less likely.</p>

<p>Please note that, in lack of the original numerical data, no conclusions can be definitively drawn on the reliability of the data presented, especially regarding the apparent duplications detected.</p>



<p>FURTHER CONCERNS.</p>



<p>The authors did not specify enough characteristics of the convalescent patients used as a control for the evaluation of the humoral response in figure 2. How were they matched to the different groups of enrolled volunteers? Since there are several convalescent control patients which apparently are seronegative and are also negative for neutralizing antibodies, it is also crucial to know when their plasma was collected – for each patient, how many days passed since symptoms and seronegativization occurred? How many convalescent controls were used for the graphs in figure 2?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>
	Disney has publicly thanked a Chinese government agency accused of human rights abuses in Xinjiang for its help in making "Mulan" — a revelation that has provoked a storm of criticism online.</p>
<p>
	Disney acknowledges several Chinese government bodies in the credits for the live-action remake of the 1998 animated picture of the same name, but a few in particular have raised red flags: The Xinjiang government's publicity department and the Public Security and Tourism bureaus for Turpan, a city of about <a href="http://www.tlf.gov.cn/zjtluf/rkyy/rkgk.htm" target="_blank">633,400 people</a> just outside Xinjiang's capital Urumqi.</p>
<p>
	Disney did not respond to a request for comment from CNN Business to its media inquiry line, and to U.S. press officers about the film and the credits. It's not clear how much of "Mulan" may have been shot in Xinjiang, though people who worked on the movie have said on social media and in interviews that they scouted and filmed locations there.</p>
<p>
	The U.S. State Department estimates that since 2015 as many as <a href="https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/120418_Busby_Testimony.pdf" target="_blank">two million of the Muslim-majority Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities</a> have been imprisoned in enormous re-education camps in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>
	The Turpan Public Security Bureau has been listed by the U.S. government as an organization involved in <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/10/09/2019-22210/addition-of-certain-entities-to-the-entity-list" target="_blank">"human rights violations and abuses"</a> in the region.</p>
<p>
	Beijing has long defended the crackdown in Xinjiang as necessary to tackle extremism and terrorism, and said it is in line with Chinese law and international practice, calling accusations of mass detentions a "groundless lie" and "sensational rumor." A spokesperson for the country's foreign ministry on Tuesday reiterated its defense of what it calls its Xinjiang "vocational skills education and training centers." CNN Business has reached out to the Xinjiang government and Turpan's tourism bureau, but Turpan's Public Security bureau could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>
	"There are no so-called concentration camps in Xinjiang," said China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian. "The establishment of vocational skills education and training centers in Xinjiang in accordance with the law is a useful attempt and active exploration for preventive counter-terrorism and de-radicalization."</p>
<p>
	But the connections between Xinjiang and "Mulan" have ignited widespread criticism on social media since its release Friday on Disney+, the company's streaming service. Human rights advocates are now calling on Disney to make public any agreements with the Chinese government over filming in the region.</p>
<p>
	"[It's] deeply disturbing that Disney thought it was okay to partner with, and also thank, government departments, specifically propaganda departments, and a public security bureau from a region in China that is<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/30/asia/xinjiang-sterilization-women-human-rights-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank"> complicit with genocide," </a>said Isaac Stone Fish, senior fellow at the Asia Society, a New York based non-profit organization focused on raising awareness of Asia.</p>
<h3>
	A FILM PLAGUED BY SETBACKS</h3>
<p>
	Disney hoped that "Mulan" would be a major success at the lucrative Chinese box office, now the second-largest in the world. The company spoke last year about its dedication to making the film culturally accurate — remarks that were reported in Chinese state media.</p>
<p>
	"We spent a lot of time in the beginning with scholars, experts and people from the region. And we spent a great deal of time in China," said Sean Bailey, president of Walt Disney Studios Motion Picture Production, at a Disney expo event last year, reported the state-run news agency Xinhua. Bailey added that the studio "not only has a Chinese cast but also brought in a Chinese producer to make the movie with them," the outlet noted.</p>
<p>
	Eschewing the musicality of Disney's earlier animated feature of the same name, one box office analyst told CNN Business earlier this year that the live-action epic was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/13/media/disney-mulan-coronavirus/index.html" target="_blank">"tailor-made for success."</a></p>
<p>
	But the film — which is based on a traditional Chinese legend about <a href="http://www.womenofchina.cn/womenofchina/html1/history/1706/4656-1.htm" target="_blank">a female warrior</a> who disguised herself as a man and took her father's place in the army — has already faced controversy and setbacks.</p>
<p>
	In August 2019, pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong called for a boycott of "Mulan" after the lead actor expressed support for Hong Kong police on her social media account.</p>
<p>
	"I support the Hong Kong police. You can all attack me now. What a shame for Hong Kong," Liu Yifei, a Chinese-born U.S. citizen who plays the titular Hua Mulan, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/16/asia/china-mulan-actor-protests-intl-hnk-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">posted to her official Weibo account.</a> At the time, Hong Kong police faced allegations of excessive violence against protesters. (Hong Kong police <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/20/asia/hong-kong-protests-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank">defended their actions</a> in September 2019, saying they had been "so restrained.")</p>
<p>
	Then in March, Disney was forced to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/12/media/mulan-delay-coronavirus/index.html" target="_blank">delay the film's release</a> as the coronavirus pandemic shuttered movie theaters.</p>
<p>
	Even now, its rollout has been stilted. The film was released as a US$30 <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/04/media/mulan-disney-china-international-release/index.html" target="_blank">video-on-demand </a>last Friday on Disney+, which is only available in certain markets, including the United States. It makes its debut in Chinese theaters this weekend. (Disney+ is not available in China.)</p>
<p>
	The release of the film has renewed the controversy surrounding it, however. Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/04/entertainment/mulan-boycott-hong-kong-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">Thailand and Taiwan</a> have once again called on people to boycott the film because of Yifei's remarks last year.</p>
<p>
	And it's not even clear that the film will win over Chinese audiences, who were already chilly toward the original animated version because of its westernized flair and unfaithful retelling of the original legend.</p>
<p>
	After the release of the trailer in 2019, Chinese state-run media Global Times criticized the film for using<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1157286.shtml" target="_blank"> Japanese "ninja gestures"</a> and Chinese stereotypes.</p>
<h3>
	CALLS FOR TRANSPARENCY</h3>
<p>
	Allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang stretch back years.</p>
<p>
	In recent years, the Xinjiang government has allegedly undertaken a large campaign to imprison and re-educate Muslim minorities in the region, especially the large Uyghur population.</p>
<p>
	Evidence of widespread human rights abuse has trickled out from inside the region, including <a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/02/asia/xinjiang-china-karakax-document-intl-hnk/" target="_blank">lengthy detentions,</a> abuse, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/26/asia/china-xinjiang-leaks-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank">indoctrination</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/30/asia/xinjiang-sterilization-women-human-rights-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank">mass birth control</a> — which experts have described as evidence of "genocide."</p>
<p>
	In 2017, Mulan director Niki Caro posted a photo from Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang<strong> </strong>and said she was <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BZle-neFOc-/?utm_source=ig_embed" target="_blank">scouting out locations</a> for the film. And in an interview in September<strong> </strong>with Conde Nast traveler, Mulan production designer Grant Major discussed filming in Xinjiang's <a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/story/on-location-mulan" target="_blank">Taklamakan Desert</a>, in the region's far southwest.</p>
<p>
	Adrian Zenz, a leading academic<strong> </strong>at the Victims of Communism Foundation who has helped break major stories from Xinjiang, said that the earliest documented case of a re-education center in the region was in Turpan in 2013.</p>
<p>
	Zenz said that while it was possible Disney didn't know about the growing number of detention centers set up across Xinjiang, the widespread oppression in the region was impossible to miss.</p>
<p>
	"There were police stations and checkpoints all over Xinjiang by late 2016, not to be missed," he said.</p>
<p>
	Foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao dismissed Zenz's claims and accused him of making a living "through making Xinjiang-related rumors and slandering China." He also claimed there had been no cases of violence or terrorism in Xinjiang for "more than three consecutive years."</p>
<p>
	Turpan was also the setting for one of the worst outbreaks of ethnic violence in Xinjiang in recent years, when 35 people died during an attack on a police station in Lukqun township, in 2013, <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/kindle/2013-07/05/content_16731473.htm" target="_blank">according to state media.</a></p>
<p>
	Yaqiu Wang, a China researcher for Human Rights Watch, called for Disney to <a href="https://twitter.com/Yaqiu/status/1303002585155149825" target="_blank">disclose what assistance</a> it had received from Xinjiang authorities and what agreements it had made with the regional government.</p>
<p>
	And<strong> </strong>Asia Society fellow Stone Fish said that many companies were accustomed to making small concessions to the ruling Communist Party to access the Chinese market.</p>
<p>
	"Studios feel like they need to make these compromises to be in Beijing, but you can slightly censor your movies to get into the Chinese market, you can bring Chinese movies that shouldn't be in the States because of poor quality or because of propaganda elements into the States. And you can do that and maintain your integrity, mostly intact," he said.</p>
<p>
	"You don't need to take these extra steps that Disney is taking, and they're rightly getting excoriated for it."</p>

  <p>Should you join a big company or start a startup?</p>
<p>This frequently debated question paints a picture of a world where the only choice is between being a cog at a giant semi-monopoly, or taking investment money in the hopes of one day growing to be head cog at a giant semi-monopoly.</p>
<p>Role models matter. So I made a list of small companies that I admire. Neither giants nor startups - just people making a living writing software on their own terms.</p>
<h2 id="sqlite"><a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">sqlite</a></h2>
<p>Sqlite is an existence proof that you don't need a thousand engineers to have an impact. It's been around since the early 90s, is one of the <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html">most shipped</a> pieces of software in existence and is widely respected for its <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/testing.html">exceptional testing methodology</a>. Yet it was written almost entirely by a few people:</p>
<pre><span>jamie@machine:~/sqlite$ git shortlog -s -n | head -n 5
 14012	drh
  4297	dan
  1663	danielk1977
  1099	mistachkin
   175	shane
</span></pre>
<p>Their growth plans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hwaci is a small company but it is also closely held and debt-free and has low fixed costs, which means that it is largely immune to buy-outs, take-overs, and market down-turns. Hwaci intends to continue operating in its current form, and at roughly its current size until at least the year 2050. We expect to be here when you need us, even if that need is many years in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sqlite is also interesting because although the code is open source they operate on a cathedral model, generally <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html">refusing or rewriting</a> outside contributions.</p>
<h2 id="pinboard"><a href="https://pinboard.in/">pinboard</a></h2>
<p>Pinboard is a single-person operation that has been making a solid income year on year <a href="https://blog.pinboard.in/2019/07/i_cant_stop_winning/">since 2010</a>. It somehow still leaves Maciej enough free time to go around <a href="https://idlewords.com/2019/5/">teaching politicians how to not get hacked</a> and <a href="https://idlewords.com/talks/senate_testimony.2019.5.htm">explaining privacy to the senate</a>. All the while <a href="https://blog.pinboard.in/2017/06/pinboard_acquires_delicious/">destroying his competition</a> using highly advanced tactics such as <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/fan_is_a_tool_using_animal.htm">listening to his customers</a> and not operating at a loss.</p>
<p>But if Maciej had done nothing else he would still be on this list for his beautiful talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vt8zqhHe_c">Barely Succeed! It's Easier!</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We live in a remarkable time when small teams (or even lone programmers) can successfully compete against internet giants. But while the last few years have seen an explosion of product ideas, there has been far less innovation in how to actually build a business. Silicon Valley is stuck in an outdated 'grow or die' mentality that overvalues risk, while investors dismiss sustainable, interesting projects for being too practical. So who needs investors anyway?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll talk about some alternative definitions of success that are more achievable (and more fun!) than the Silicon Valley casino. It turns out that staying small offers some surprising advantages, not just in the day-to-day experience of work, but in marketing and getting customers to love your project. Best of all, there's plenty more room at the bottom.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If your goal is to do meaningful work you love, you may be much closer to realizing your dreams than you think.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="tarsnap"><a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/">tarsnap</a></h2>
<p>Another single-person operation, tarsnap has reported been profitable <a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/about.html">since 2009</a> and shows no sign of going anywhere, even lowering it's prices over the years as storage became cheaper. It's saved me on multiple occasions and it's so simple, reliable and cheap that I think of it almost like a utility - tarsnap having an outage would be more surprising to me than water not coming out of my taps.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting things about tarsnap is that it could <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2014/04/03/fantasy-tarsnap/">easily be making more money</a>. If tarsnap had investors or shareholders, they would have <strong>already forced Colin to do so</strong>. In other words, the only reason that Colin gets to continue running the kind of business that he <strong>wants</strong> to run is that he owns it entirely and noone can force him to maximize profit instead.</p>
<h2 id="sublime"><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">sublime</a></h2>
<p>Version 1.0 came out in <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/one-point-oh">2008</a> and they're still going strong today, making enough to <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/small-tech/">hire an extra developer</a> and <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/sublime-merge">launch a separate product</a>.</p>
<p>Sublime is notable for surviving despite massive open-source competition in a field where people hate to pay for tools. As <a href="https://thume.ca/2017/03/04/my-text-editor-journey-vim-spacemacs-atom-and-sublime-text/">Tristan Hume points out</a>, it's really the only editor that has managed to remain both fast and consistent while still supporting a large plugin ecosystem. These kind of end-to-end qualities are perhaps one of the main advantages for small teams with a long time horizon.</p>
<h2 id="zig"><a href="https://ziglang.org/">zig</a></h2>
<p>Zig has been around <a href="https://andrewkelley.me/post/full-time-zig.html">only a few years</a> but I'm already wildly impressed by the quality of thought and engineering that has gone into it.</p>
<p>The Zig Software Foundation is a non-profit, currently funded entirely by donations and working towards being able to employ a second full-time developer. They explicitly chose to be a non-profit out of concern over how profit incentives creep into daily decision making:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In You Weren’t Meant to Have a Boss, Paul Graham makes an analogy between animals in the zoo (employees) and animals in the wild (startup founders). I think he’s on to something, but when you start a startup, you still have a boss. In fact, you have the same boss. At the end of the day, it is an inescapable fact that you must do what makes a profit, for the shareholders.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The difference in incentives makes a structural difference that permeates every part of an organization. Windows users wake up one day and find ads in their start menu. Will Debian Linux ever try to put ads into any of its software? The concept is absurd.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zig was explicitly designed to be a <a href="https://ziglang.org/#Small-simple-language">small, simple language</a>, allowing it to be maintained indefinitely by a small, committed team.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ZSF is a small organization and makes efficient use of monetary resources.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t see the need for ZSF to grow beyond a handful of people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Maciej <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vt8zqhHe_c&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2144">puts it</a>, one of the advantages of being small is that you can speak with a human voice. This comes across clearly from the zig team, who are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8f48iYKxgg">resolutely human</a> instead of projecting some impassive facade of professionalism.</p>
