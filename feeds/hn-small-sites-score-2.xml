<p><em>A close look at the psychology of wine, how marketing affects your perceptions, and why you’re paying too much for wine.</em></p>



<p>In 2002, four Wall Street businessmen sat down for dinner at the Balthazar in New York City. They ordered a Mouton Rothschild 1989 for the table.</p>



<p>The Balthazar menu lists this wine at $2,000. It’s not hard to see why. The Mouton Rothschild 1989 is an exceptional wine, produced from grapes grown on 205 acres near Pauillac, just northwest of Bordeaux. At the time the grapes were grown, the vineyard was owned by Philippine de Rothschild, a member of the infamous Rothschild family at the center of banking in Europe from the eighteenth century onward. According to the <a href="https://www.liz-palmer.com/wine-review-chateau-mouton-rothschild-1989/">tasting notes</a> of Liz Palmer, the noted wine critic, the Mouton Rothschild 1989 is “a lovely Pauillac that has reached its plateau of maturity; notably dark ruby in colour; It has an engaging cedar and tobacco bouquet with hints of mint; not much fruit concentration; the palate follows suit – is medium-bodied and continues the aromatic theme of cedar and tobacco; demonstrates great persistence; well-defined – ‘old school’.” At a tasting in 2018, Jane Anson, the Bordeaux correspondent for <em>Decanter </em>magazine, gave it 97 points out of a possible 100.</p>



<p>That was the wine they ordered.</p>



<p>But it wasn’t the wine they got.</p>



<p>Instead, their server brought them an $18 Pinot Noir.</p>



<p>There had been a mix-up. The staff had poured the two wines into two decanters and sent the wrong decanter to the table.</p>



<p>Five minutes later, the restaurant manager rushed to their table to explain what had happened.</p>



<p>How did they these businessmen react? With incredulity, that a restaurant could make such a costly mistake? That their dinner had been ruined?</p>



<p>Nope.</p>



<p>Though they suspected what they were drinking wasn’t the wine they had ordered, they didn’t realize they were drinking an $18 Pinot Noir.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, a few tables away, the beneficiaries of the mistake—a couple who ordered the $18 Pinot Noir—didn’t realize it, either. In fact, as they unknowingly drank the $2,000 Mouton Rothschild 1989 they “jokingly pretended to be drinking an expensive wine.”<span id="easy-footnote-1-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-65224613" title="Mercer, C. (2020) NY restaurant couple mistakenly served $2000 Mouton 1989 after ordering $18 Pinot. <em>Decanter</em>. October 22, 2020."><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>



<p>How could this have happened?</p>



<p>Not the mistake in the kitchen: the swapped decanters, the wrong wine at the wrong tables.</p>



<p>The real mistake was a mistake in perception: that an $18 Pinot Noir and a $2,000 Mouton Rothschild 1989 could be confused in the first place.</p>



<p>In today’s post, we’re going to take a deep dive into the world of expensive wine. We’ll see if expensive wine really tastes better or if the mix-up at the Balthazar was a one-off mistake. We’ll explore the ways price signals quality. We’ll look at how expectations influence perceptions. And we’ll finish with a definitive guide to buying great wine.</p>



<p>Sometimes you can answer a question with a statement supported by data, science, and story.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The answer to the question—<em>does expensive wine really taste better?</em>—is not such an answer. Instead, this answer is a series of layers, each one more complicated than the last, and each one introducing a new set of questions—and a new set of revelations about taste, status, and perception.</p>



<h2>People can’t tell the difference between expensive wine and cheap wine</h2>



<p>When people don’t know the price, they like cheap wine just as much as expensive wine.&nbsp;Between April 2007 and February 2008, Robin Goldstein and his colleagues conducted 6,175 blind tests with 506 participants tasting 523 wines that ranged in price from $1.65 to $150.00 per bottle. About 12% of the participants had taken a sommelier course or had some kind of training. The test was double-blind: neither the person drinking the wine nor the person serving the wine knew the price. After each taste, participants rated it either “Bad,” Okay,” “Good,” or “Great.” Goldstein found that, on the whole, people actually gave <em>higher </em>ratings for cheap wine than expensive wine. However, compared to non-experts, the experts rated expensive wine more favorably. It seems that everyone likes cheap wine more than expensive wine, though experts are better at rating expensive wines compared to non-experts.<span id="easy-footnote-2-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-65224613" title="Goldstein, R., Almenberg, J., Dreber, A., Emerson, J. W., Herschkowitsch, A., &amp;amp; Katz, J. (2008). Do more expensive wines taste better? Evidence from a large sample of blind tastings. <em>Journal of Wine Economics</em>, 3(1), 1-9."><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>



<p>Other blind tastings have produced the same results. In 2011, Johan Almenberg and Anna Dreber of the Stockholm School of Economics had 135 people rate a $40 wine and 131 people rate a $5 wine, both on a scale of 1 to 100. They split the tasters into three groups:</p>



<ol><li>Some people learned the price <em>before </em>they tasted it.&nbsp;</li><li>Others learned the price <em>after </em>they tasted it, but before they rated it.&nbsp;</li><li>And a third group did a blind tasting: they never learned the price and only tasted and rated the wine.</li></ol>



<p>Of this third group, people rated the cheap wine a 60.0 and the expensive wine a 58.5. To them, the $5 wine tasted better than the $40 wine!<span id="easy-footnote-3-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-65224613" title="Almenberg, J., &amp;amp; Dreber, A. (2011).

<p>For many people, a $40 wine sounds expensive. But for others, such as sommeliers, wine critics, and others, a $40 wine is still well below the threshold of what a great wine should cost. What if we compare a $40 wine (expensive to some, but cheap to others) to a $400 or $4,000 wine? In 2013, Vanessa Harrar and her colleagues conducted a blind tasting of seven sparkling wines, including six Champagnes. There were fifteen tasters, including four who considered themselves experts and five who considered themselves novices. This tasting, too, revealed no correlation between price and rating. Cheap Champagnes taste better than expensive Champagnes. In fact, of the wines sampled, the lowest rating was a Perrier-Jouët Belle Epoque Blanc de Blanc 2002, priced at £400; while the highest rated wines were a Mumm Vintage 2004 (£40) and a Perrier-Jouet Belle Epoque 2004 (£100). It seems that not only do cheap wines taste the same as expensive wines, but expensive wines taste the same as <em>very</em> expensive wines, too. <span id="easy-footnote-4-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-65224613" title="Harrar, V., Smith, B., Deroy, O. et al. Grape expectations: how the proportion of white grape in Champagne affects the ratings of experts and social drinkers in a blind tasting. <em>Flavour </em>2, 25 (2013)."><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>



<p>Follow-up studies confirmed this. The next year, Robert H. Ashton published the results of his tasting session in the <em>Journal of Wine Economics</em>. In his study, 48 people, all members of a wine appreciation club at Duke University, tasted six wines each. They rated each wine on a scale of 1 to 10. As before, people thought the cheaper wines tasted better. In fact, in one of the tastings, the most expensive wine (a $119 bottle) was ranked a 3.70 and the cheapest wine (a $22 bottle) was ranked a 4.00.<span id="easy-footnote-5-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-65224613" title="Ashton, R.

<p>These and numerous other studies point in the same direction: in blind taste tests, people can’t distinguish cheap wine from expensive wine.</p>



<h2>People can’t tell the difference between two wines</h2>



<p>There’s a deeper issue, though. The real reason people can’t distinguish expensive wine from cheap wine is because they can’t distinguish <em>any </em>wine from <em>any other</em> wine—at least at rates that are no better than chance. In a series of two tastings, Roman Weil, the former co-chairman of the Oenonomy Society of the US, poured two wines into four glasses: one wine split between two glasses and the other wine split between the other two glasses. Then, he took one of the four glasses away, and served the remaining three glasses in the tasting. Thus, two of the three glasses were poured from the same bottle, and one of the three glasses from its own bottle. (If this is getting confusing, scroll down to the image.) Weil asked people to identify which two were the same and which one was different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How did people do?</p>



<p>Not great.</p>



<p>In the first tasting, people identified the wines from the same vintage only 41.5% of the time. That’s not very good when you consider that people would correctly pick the two wines from the same bottle 33.3% of the time if they made decisions at random: there are three glasses, so picking the two of three glasses at random would be correct 1 in 3 times. <span id="easy-footnote-6-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-6-65224613" title="Weil, R.L. (2001). Parker v. Prial: The death of the vintage chart. <em>Chance</em>, 14, 27–3"><sup>6</sup></a></span></p>



<p>Weil’s second tasting produced similar results. This time, Weil had 395 people compare 855 pairs of regular wines and reserve wines, which are usually produced from superior grapes. People correctly identified only 346 of the 855 pairs, or roughly 40.5% of pairs, compared to the 33.3% that would be expected from random chance. Then, in a final step, Weil asked the 346 people who got it right to tell him which wine was the regular wine, and which wine was the reserve—the purportedly better wine. Of the 346 people, 170 people (49.1%) preferred the regular wine and 176 (50.9%) preferred the reserve—rates that are virtually the same as picking one of the wines at random (50.0%).<span id="easy-footnote-7-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-7-65224613" title="Weil, R.L.

<p>Weil’s studies show that people can tell two wines apart at rates that are barely better than chance (1 in 3) , and when they can, they pick the better wine at rates equal to chance (1 in 2).</p>



<p>Wine is an acquired taste. It takes time, training, and practice to tell good wine from bad (which could, itself, be evidence that great wine isn’t objectively great, though I digress). Perhaps expert tasters would perform better?</p>



<p>Unfortunately not. Professionals don’t do any better than novices: even people who are trained to taste, describe, and recommend wine for a living—and whose recommendations carry enormous weight within the industry and beyond—can’t tell one wine from another in a blind test. One of the first studies to reveal these inconsistencies took place at the wine competition of the California State Fair between 2005 and 2008. The competition is the oldest in the United States, and its judges include, “winemakers, wine buyers, wine critics and professors of enology and viticulture,” according to Robert T. Hodgson, the retired statistics professor and 35-year owner of the Fieldbrook Winery in California who conducted the study. Wineries are happy to pay more than $1 million collectively in entry fees to have their wine judged at the fair, since a gold medal awarded by judges at the fair can propel an unknown wine to the top of the market.<span id="easy-footnote-8-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-8-65224613" title="Hodgson, R.T.

<p>Typically, judges at the state fair taste between four and six flights of wine per day, and each flight contains 30 wines. However, Hodgson served them a second flight that contained …</p></div></article></div>

			<p><span>T</span>his past summer, my wife and I ventured to an area near Mount Adams in southwestern Washington state to census bumblebees. We camped there over the weekend as we took part in the Pacific Northwest Bumblebee Atlas survey. Scientists want to fill gaps in their knowledge about the bees. Learning about the relative number of different species, and their floral resources over a broad area, provides invaluable information, particularly when some species are in decline. I was helping to determine where conservation efforts may be needed. Survey participants choose a territory where they capture and photograph bumblebees on two occasions. I still marvel at the variety in the photos we took—bees with coloration incorporating rusty bands of hair, black stubby hairs, white patches, orange bands, and a brilliant, lemon-yellow covering of long hairs. <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/90/something-green/the-fungal-evangelist-who-would-save-the-bees" target="_blank">Bumblebees</a> are really quite beautiful when observed more closely.</p><figure data-alt="Hainze_BREAKER"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18113_ca9eac0c76de0cab71d5b50951fe4c5f.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>FIGHT OF THE BUMBLEBEE:</strong> A 2017 global study found that one-third of assessed bumblebee species were in decline. The U.S. is studying whether to place the western bumblebee on the endangered species list.</span><span>Stephen Ausmus, USDA ARS / Wikimedia</span></figcaption></figure><p>There is some risk involved, of course. Bumblebees have a painful sting and, unlike the honeybee, with its barbed stinger, the sharp, smooth bumblebee stinger can sting multiple times. Insect stings may serve two purposes. The first is to incapacitate prey. The second is to ward off predators. Bumblebees feed solely on pollen and flower nectar. So they would not sting to subdue prey. A bumblebee nest full of honey and nearly immobile larvae, though, is highly attractive to predators. The bumblebee sting is a weapon used for defense—a mechanism to escape predation from animals that may be 50,000 to 100,000 times their size.<sup>1</sup> And judging by the way most people respond, it works pretty well. The sting of the honeybee has been used as a reference point by sting pain connoisseur, Justin Schmidt. He rates the bumblebee and <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/3/in-transit/tracking-honeybees-to-save-them" target="_blank">honeybee</a> stings as a pedestrian 2 on his scale of 1-4.<sup>2</sup> But that’s a sufficient wallop for people to keep their distance from these bees—and that’s the way the bees like it.<br></p><p>The unparalleled success of insects as a group of organisms results from their ability to escape existential threats. They’re escape artists. They’ve evolved multiple means of eluding the larger animals that endanger them—by stinging, biting, flying, jumping, running, startling, hiding in crevices, and using camouflage as well as chemical defenses. Yet these masters at evading far larger animals face a threat more pernicious than predation today. The resulting decline in the number of insects and in the number of insect species is increasingly well documented. Why should this be alarming? Insects play significant roles as food or in the growth of food for many organisms, including human beings. Insects are also recyclers, decomposing plant matter and animal dung and contributing to the organic content of soils.</p><blockquote><p>It’s not all honey and butterflies in our relationship with insects.</p> </blockquote><p>It’s been said that if human beings disappeared, we would not be missed. Insects and other organisms would thrive. Yet we and many other animals <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/73/play/we-need-insects-more-than-they-need-us" target="_blank">would not survive were insects to disappear</a>. The plight of the island marble butterfly (<i>Euchloe ausonides insulanis</i>) and the western bumblebee (<i>Bombus occidentalis</i>) exemplify the multiple stressors on insect survival in the <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/90/something-green/dawn-of-the-heliocene" target="_blank">Anthropocene</a>, the proposed name for a new epoch in which human-generated change outstrips the effect of natural forces on the Earth. What responsibilities, if any, do we bear toward these insects? And what can each of us do to stem the tide of global insect decline?<br></p><p>In my recent book, <i>Nature Underfoot</i>, I argue that we crush, poison, and destroy insects and their habitat at our own peril. Yet reasons for acting to prevent insect decline run much deeper than self-interest. Humans cause habitat loss, produce pesticides, and import non-native species. We bear, according to certain strands of philosophical and religious thought, responsibility for the catastrophic losses insects experience today. Some say that insects have moral value since they strive to achieve their ends, just as we and other animals do. Others argue that insects have <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/72/quandary/human-exceptionalism-stifles-progress" target="_blank">moral value as a part of God’s creation</a>. Scientists point to the value of insects in global ecosystems, or the value implied by tens or hundreds of thousands of years involved in the evolution of an insect species.</p><p><span>T</span>he insect apocalypse has captured headlines, but the situation is more nuanced than that. Scientists find an increase in the overall numbers of arthropods in the Arctic, but a decline in diversity. Certain habitats in the Arctic are also affected more than others.<sup>3</sup> In Puerto Rico, insect declines initially attributed to climate change may have resulted instead from hurricanes.<sup>4</sup> Some insect species have even increased in numbers—mainly those that are tolerant of human activities or that benefit from associating with humans or from <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/78/atmospheres/is-net-zero-emissions-an-impossible-goal" target="_blank">climate change</a>.</p><p>Despite that, the general trend is negative as climate change, habitat destruction (in the form of deforestation, urbanization, and <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/66/clockwork/herbicide-is-whats-for-dinner" target="_blank">intensification of agriculture</a>), and pesticides take their toll. These forces are overtaking the insects. They are coming so quickly that even these spectacularly successful evolutionary improvisers do not have time to escape. It’s often difficult for scientists to identify a single contributing factor. A new paper, introducing a special issue on the plight of insects, published in the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>, referred to the decline of these tiny creatures as “death by a thousand cuts.”<sup>5</sup></p><figure data-alt="Hainze_BREAKER-2"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18112_d05c25e6e6c5d4898161e0aaf700d9c7.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><strong>EDGE OF EXTINCTION:</strong> The Lazarus-like return of the island marble butterfly is remarkable, but the pressures that endanger its prairie habitats remain.</figcaption></figure><p>There is a paucity of long-term records for insect populations. The best historical records are for moths and butterflies in Europe and North America. The story of the island marble butterfly, a grassland species, illustrates the myriad forces arrayed against insects. It was declared endangered in the United States in May of 2020. It is charmingly small—mostly white on the tops of the wings and mottled green, yellow, and white on the undersides. Perhaps its colorful camouflage is a way of escaping predation. This little butterfly was thought to be extinct since 1908, when it was last collected on Gabriola Island, British Columbia. Quite by accident 90 years later, while conducting a survey of butterflies in Puget Sound prairie habitats, a Washington state biologist, John Fleckenstein, collected two of these butterflies on San Juan Island. Neither Fleckenstein, nor his colleague, Ann Potter, could identify the butterflies as they reviewed his collection. So, Potter took the butterflies to a butterfly conference in Corvallis, Oregon, where experts were ecstatic to see the butterfly once thought extinct!<sup>6</sup><br></p><p>The Lazarus-like return of the island marble butterfly is remarkable, but the pressures that endanger it remain. The prairie habitats where the butterfly is found have been farmed, used for pasture, and developed for housing, destroying much of its original habitat. The butterfly caterpillars feed and develop on plants in the mustard family. The native mustard, Menzies’ pepperweed (<i>Lepidium virginicum</i> var. <i>menziesii</i>), that must have originally supported the butterfly, is often found surrounding lagoons on San Juan Island. These plants and the island marble butterfly are damaged by winter storm surges, which will become more serious as climate change causes sea levels to rise. Fortunately, the butterfly has adapted to feeding on two non-native plants, field mustard (<i>Brassica rapa</i>) and tumble mustard (<i>Sisymbrium altissimum</i>) that grow elsewhere on the island.</p><blockquote><p>We and many animals wouldn’t survive if insects disappeared.</p> </blockquote><p>Other invasive species have had a more deleterious effect on the island marble butterfly. The brown garden snail (<i>Cornu aspersum</i>), brought from Europe to the west coast as a source of escargot, competes with the island marble butterfly in consuming field mustard and tumble mustard. The European rabbit (<i>Oryctolagus cuniculus</i>) develops large populations in the San Juan Islands and also feeds on butterfly host plants. Deer, though native in the San Juans, are destructive of prairie habitat. Deer numbers are very high there because their predators, such as wolves, cougars, and bears, were eliminated by European settlers. Deer not only destroy island marble butterfly habitat, but they may ingest eggs and caterpillars in the process. Island marble butterflies also suffer from predation by native spiders and by a European paper wasp (<i>Polistes dominula</i>).<sup>7</sup><br></p><p>A vigorous and widely distributed population of butterflies could withstand the <a href="https://nautil.us/blog/fear-is-good-for-the-forest" target="_blank">pressure of predation</a>, but it poses a significant risk for the tiny, localized population of island marble butterflies. Death by a thousand cuts. Habitat destruction, loss of food plants, invasive species, climate change, and predation are primarily human-driven problems. Fortunately, what is believed to be the last island marble butterfly population falls within the boundaries of the San Juan National Historic Park. Here, the park service is actively rearing and releasing butterflies and making a significant effort to preserve their habitat. The island marble butterfly is in a fragile state but hopefully its new endangered status will yield another amazing recovery.</p><div>

Typically we assume that if we get more things done each day, we’re highly productive. But the assumption couldn’t be more wrong.</p><p>Productivity is not about getting all things done, it’s about getting the most important things done, those with the most impact to reach your goals.</p><p>When we think of someone productive, a friend or colleague, we tend to picture someone “busy” pushing through those tasks ticking them off one by one, trapped under an ever-growing pile of work. </p><p>It’s easy to think that busy people with a lot of output are productive, but the actual work they produce might be of little use. Being busy with many tasks, work-responsibilities, and long working hours does not mean that you are productive.</p><p>To become more productive, focus on the tasks that bring you closer to your goals, and consistently do so. Not everything is essential. No matter what you’re working on, there are tasks that you shouldn’t do or delegate, and only a few that are truly important.</p><p><strong>James Clear</strong>, the author of bestseller Atomic Habits, puts it in this way:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span> “Being productive is about maintaining a steady, average speed on a few things, not maximum on everything.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p><strong>Darius Foroux</strong>, author and productivity guru, says:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span>“Productivity is when you focus on relevant output, getting the right things done. Things that improve your career, business, organization.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="what-does-productivity-mean-to-you">What does productivity mean to you?</h2><p>Before you put your head down and start thinking about becoming more productive, think about “why” you have this urge, what’s driving you. A standard answer that you might think of is; having more free time to do the things you enjoy doing. </p><p>If you can do more with less, surely you can reach your goals sooner, leaving you with time to focus on other goals in life. Is it a career goal you have, more time to read books, more time with your family or friends? Having clarity around what’s driving your actions will help you when things get tough.</p><h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-increasing-personal-productivity">What are the benefits of increasing personal productivity?</h2><p>We all have 24 hours in a day, it’s up to each of us to determine how we want to use those hours. Productive people get more done with less effort, allowing them to focus on what was driving them in the first place. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>There are clear benefits of improving your personal productivity, focus on the tasks with the most impact, the right things, and you’ll achieve more, and get better results.</p><p>Other benefits can be:</p><ol><li><strong>Reduce Stress</strong><br>When you become more organized and start to achieve your most impactful tasks on time, you will feel less stressed. Instead of running around trying to accomplish everything, you can focus on what matters the most. Your personal well-being increases, e.g., you feel happy and comfortable.</li><li><strong>Increase Engagement</strong><br>Increased productivity and engagement are closely related to each other. More productive people are usually also more passionate and engaged in the work they do. <a href="https://hbr.org/2013/07/employee-engagement-does-more">Harvard Business Review</a> pointed out that higher engagement leads to a 22% increase in productivity. </li><li><strong>Improve self-confidence</strong><br>Improving productivity also allows you to learn more in less time. And, when you get better at what you do, you’ll also increase your confidence. In other words, productive people will learn more, get better at what they do, and become more self-confident.</li></ol><h2 id="how-to-become-more-productive">How to become more productive</h2><p>As highlighted earlier in this article, it’s a significant difference between “movement” and “achievement.” Checking off tasks will allow you to feel more accomplished, but it won’t ensure that you move closer to your goals. Whatever strategy or technique you go with, and there are plenty to choose from, the most important thing to remember is to go with the one you feel most comfortable with.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Like everything else in life, to make a change, it requires time and focus. So you need to look for a strategy that you can stick with and create a habit around.</p><p>To get you started, <strong>here are some of the most common and practical productivity strategies:</strong></p><h2 id="the-pomodoro-method">The Pomodoro Method</h2><p>Perhaps one of the most known and researched methods out there, and for a good reason, it’s simple and it works. This method can help you keep focus by getting things done in shorter bursts. </p><p>In-between, you take frequent breaks that can either be short or long, depending on how many tasks you’ve completed. You don’t need any particular tools to get started, all you need is a timer. In short, here’s how it works:</p><ul><li>Start on a task that you want to accomplish</li><li>Set the timer on 25 minutes (This block is referred to as the “Pomodoro”)</li><li>Work on the task until the timer rings, put a checkmark on a paper</li><li>Take a 5-minutes break</li><li>After completing 4 “Pomodoros” take a 15-20 minutes break</li></ul><p>The main idea behind this popular technique is that the timer creates a sense of urgency, allowing you to keep focused and not give in to distractions. <a href="https://blog.doit.io/the-pomodoro-technique-boost-your-productivity/">Learn more about the Pomodoro Method.</a> </p><h2 id="eat-that-frog-method">Eat That Frog Method</h2><p>Mark Twain once said, “Eat a live frog first thing in the morning, and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.” Applied to the real world, the “frog” would symbolize the most impactful and essential task you have to complete on a given day, week, or month. </p><p>If you eat that frog in the morning, or when you are the most productive, then you’ll get more done. <a href="https://blog.doit.io/eat-that-frog/">Learn more about the Eat that Frog method.</a></p><h2 id="the-eisenhower-matrix">The Eisenhower Matrix</h2><p>Former President and five-star general, Dwight Eisenhower, had an extraordinary capability of being productive for more extended periods. One of his most essential productivity strategies is called the Eisenhower Matrix (or Box), and it’s a simple decision-making tool that you can easily incorporate in your daily routines. </p><p>The matrix labels tasks, depending on their level of importance and urgency. Learn more about <a href="https://blog.doit.io/the-eisenhower-matrix/">how to use the Eisenhower Matrix in this article.</a></p><h2 id="focus-on-one-thing">Focus on ONE thing</h2><p>A productive person doesn’t necessarily do more work, they focus their work on the right things. And If you then focus your energy on “one” right thing after the other, you’ll accomplish more, and you’re likely to achieve your goals quicker. </p><p>This is, however, not just about focusing on one thing in your life period. It’s about being critical of what you choose to focus your energy on, where you have the most impact, and eliminate waste. Hone in on what matters and let go of everything else. This technique is not as simple as it may sound, but if you learn to master it, you can achieve almost anything. Learn more about <a href="https://blog.doit.io/focus-on-one-thing-leads-to-better-work/">how focusing on one thing can help you.</a></p><h2 id="the-ivy-lee-method">The Ivy Lee Method</h2><p>This 100-years old, 15-minutes method has been used by many professionals to increase their productivity. Why does it work? It’s dead simple. Here’s how it works:</p><ul><li>At the end of each day, write down the six most important tasks that you need to complete the following day. Not more than six.</li><li>Prioritize and stack rank these tasks in order of importance</li><li>Next day, start with your most important task and don’t more to the next task until you’ve completed the first one.</li><li>Work through the list of the tasks in the prioritized order.

the strongest safety guarantees of any language under the sun, it does offer moderate safety, and works well
as a Lua replacement. The following steps are required to author factorio mods in TS:</p>

<p>It is assumed that the reader has installed node &amp; yarn before proceeding further.</p>
<p>Let's get to work.</p>
<h2>Bootstrapping a barebones mod</h2>
<p>The following command can be run to bootstrap a fresh mod project <em>automatically</em>:</p>
<!-- <Shell children='$ yarn create factorio-mod <mod-name>' /> -->
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> yarn create factorio-mod &lt;mod-name&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>For demonstration purposes, I will create a mod called <code>vroom</code>. This mod will make the character accelerate as he runs, allowing the player to travel at warp speed!</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> yarn create factorio-mod vroom</span>
...
Victory! Your mod is ready to roll. Execute the following commands to get going:
  - cd "/Users/cdaringe/src/vroom"
  - yarn start
✨  Done in 5.75s.</code></pre>
<p>This step automatically installs the aforementioned dependencies and sets up the compiler toolchain.
If you want to do these steps manually, please see the <a href="https://github.com/cdaringe/vroom">vroom</a> codebase, and replicate the artifacts hosted there. <a href="https://mods.factorio.com/mod/vroom">@mods.factorio.com</a></p>
<h2>Understanding the barebones mod</h2>
<p>Let us <code>cd "path/to/vroom"</code>, and study the content. If you
are familiar with the <a href="https://wiki.factorio.com/Tutorial:Mod_structure">factorio mod directory stucture</a>,
this should look quite familiar.</p>
<pre><code>~/src/vroom via ⬢ v15.0.1

 <!-- `.trim()} /> -->
<ul>
<li><code>info.json</code> - the entrypont to all factorio mods, pre-populated with some essentials</li>
<li><code>control.ts</code> - this file will compile to <code>control.lua</code>, which Factorio uses to run your mod!</li>
<li><code>tsconfig.json</code> - typescript configuration, critically including <a href="https://typescripttolua.github.io/docs/configuration">TypescriptToLua configuration</a></li>
<li><code>package.json</code> &amp; <code>node_modules</code> - resources to support your TS development experience :)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's open up <code>control.ts</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onTick = <span>(<span>_evt: OnTickPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  game.print(serpent.block({
    <span>hello</span>: <span>"world"</span>,
    <span>its_nice</span>: <span>"to see you"</span>
  }));
};

script.on_event(defines.events.on_tick, onTick);</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>script.on_event</code> - typed</li>
<li><code>game</code> - typed</li>
<li><code>serpent</code> - typed</li>
<li><code>evt</code> - typed, via casting</li>
</ul>
<p>Boom! Types for everything!</p>
<p>...but not quite. The Factorio Lua documentation is <em>lossy</em>, and has many cases where we simply <em>cannot</em> parse correct type definitions from the Factorio website. Until the factorio development team publicly supports  machine-readable API documentation, <code>factorio-type-kit</code> TypeScript provisions will generally only be 70-80%+ complete. Thus, TypeScript users will be periodically disappointed to find <code>any</code> or <code>unknown</code> types in various interfaces. With that said, <code>factorio-type-kit</code> users are welcome to manually backfill essential definitions to make our community's development kit better.</p>
<h2>Starting the mod compiler</h2>
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> yarn start</span></code></pre>
<p>Momentarily after launching the watching compiler, <code>control.lua</code> should be emitted. Open it up:</p>
<pre><code>onTick = <span><span>function</span><span>(_evt)</span></span>
    game.<span>print</span>(
        serpent.block({hello = <span>"world"</span>, its_nice = <span>"to see you"</span>})
    )
<span>end</span>
script.on_event(defines.events.on_tick, onTick)</code></pre>
<p>The TypeScriptToLua compiler does a fanstastic job on producing readable Lua.</p>
<h2>Implementing vroom</h2>
<p>The very first thing the <code>vroom</code> mod needs to do is detect when the player is in motion.</p>
<p>Rather that pull up the documentation, I'll just open up another call <code>script.on_event</code>, then
begin typing in <code>defines.events.</code>. After intellisense presents me options, I will select <code>on_player_changed_position</code>. The type definitions tell me a callback is also required. I will enter in <code>onPositionChanged</code>.</p>
<pre><code>script.on_event(
  defines.events.on_player_changed_position,
  onPositionChange
);</code></pre>
<p><code>onPositionChange</code> is not defined yet. Let's discuss what it needs to do then draft it.
First, it needs to get the player's current speed. Next, the speed needs to increase when running. Because the purpose of the mod is to accelerate the user, we multiply the previous speed by a scalar every so often.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onPositionChange = <span>(<span>evt: OnPlayerChangedPositionPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  <span>const</span> player = game.get_player(evt.player_index);
  <span>if</span> (player.walking_state.walking) {
    
  }
};</code></pre>
<p>Immediately take note that we have manually specified the type of <code>evt</code> as <code>OnPlayerChangedPositionPayload</code>. All factorio script event types follow the event naming convention: <code>&lt;CamelCased-EventName&gt;Payload</code>. A future version may automatically apply types to the <code>on_event</code> callback, so you not need cast.</p>
<p>The first thing I noticed was that <code>evt</code> did not have a reference directly to the player I needed.
It does contain the <code>player_id</code> however, and with that ID we can call the <code>get_player</code> method on the global <code>game</code> instance. <code>get_player</code> returns an instance of a <code>LuaPlayer</code>, contains a <code>walking_state</code> property. Let's use <em>that</em>. We know that we <em>only</em> want to speed up the player if he is in motion, so let's further wrap our logic inside a conditional--<code>if (player.walking_state.walking) { ... }</code>.</p>
<p>Next up, how do we actually speed up the player? After searching the API documentation, I concluded that there was not a direct value specifying a velocity of the character. However, I did come across <code>character_running_speed_modifier</code>, which the type definitions told me is of type <code>number</code>. Unexpectedly, through trial and error, I learned that <code>character_running_speed_modifier</code> could be zero. <code>Speed * 0 = 0</code>, so Factorio likely does a 0 check internally before calculating the player's speed. We will have to do a similar check. Notice that typescript did not me help uncover my bug! Anything of type <code>number</code> can rightfully be zero, so shame on me! Defensive programmers everywhere are saying "you should have seen this coming", and they would be correct :). Equipped with this knowledge, let's fill in the rest.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onPositionChange = <span>(<span>evt: OnPlayerChangedPositionPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  <span>const</span> player = game.get_player(evt.player_index);
  <span>if</span> (player.walking_state.walking) {
    <span>const</span> lastSpeed = player.character_running_speed_modifier;
    <span>const</span> baseSpeed = lastSpeed == <span>0</span> ? <span>1</span> : lastSpeed;
    player.character_running_speed_modifier = baseSpeed * <span>1.01</span>;
  }
};</code></pre>
<p>When our player stops running, we want to restart the acceleration process for the next time he runs.
My original approach was to listen for <code>keyup</code> events. Alas, Factorio has no key events. How else could I determine if the player has stopped running, and thus safely reset the speed modifier? Easy! On every tick of the game, I can check all players for motion--and turn off the multiplier if they are stopped!</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onTick = <span>(<span>_evt: OnTickPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  <span>Object</span>.entries(game.players).forEach(<span>(<span>[_id, player]</span>) =&gt;</span> {
    <span>if</span> (
      player.character_running_speed_modifier &gt; <span>0</span> &amp;&amp;
      !player.walking_state.walking
    ) {
      player.character_running_speed_modifier = <span>0</span>;
    }
  });
};</code></pre>
<p>That is, for every player, if there is a positive speed modifier and and the player is not walking, zero out the modifier.</p>
<p>Why didn't we just do a <code>game.players.forEach</code>? <code>game.players</code> isn't an array, so that won't work. TypeScript protected us from making that mistake! What about <code>Object.entries(game.players).forEach</code>? Yep, that worked! Why did we not do <code>Object.values(...)</code>? Because <code>game.players</code> is a <a href="https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/LuaGameScript.html#LuaGameScript.players">special dictionary</a> in Lua. Not all iterables map cleanly between languages. <code>Object.values(...)</code> wouldn't have given us compiler error, but still would have failed. Improved typing is needed to protect against these failures. While TypeScriptToLua generally helps out a great deal protect us from writing erroneous code, it is only as good as its applied type constraints.</p>
<p>When using JS standard library provisions, as we did above, the compiler will add a typescript-lua polyfill, <code>lualib_bundle</code>. The emitted Lua perhaps is not as elegant:</p>
<pre><code><span>require</span>(<span>"lualib_bundle"</span>);

onTick = <span><span>function</span><span>(_evt)</span></span>
    __TS__ArrayForEach(
        __TS__ObjectEntries(game.players),
        <span><span>function</span><span>(____, ____bindingPattern0)</span></span>
            <span>local</span> _id = ____bindingPattern0[<span>1</span>]
            <span>local</span> player
            player = ____bindingPattern0[<span>2</span>]
            <span>if</span> (player.character_running_speed_modifier &gt; <span>0</span>) <span>and</span> (<span>not</span> player.walking_state.walking) <span>then</span>
                player.character_running_speed_modifier = <span>0</span>
            <span>end</span>
        <span>end</span>
    )
<span>end</span></code></pre>
<p>Even with the extra boilerplate generated, the code is still quite readable. Could be cleaner! Surely as the TypeScriptToLua compiler evolves in time, it will be.</p>
<h2>Deploy it</h2>
<p>I do not yet have clean, polished package &amp; deploy scripts, but I do have functional ones.
Do your best to cover your eyes. Running <code>yarn install_mod</code> syncs the mod into the local Factorio installation. Coupled with a watch script, every code change immediately syncs in the game folder, and requires only a scenario reload to exercise the new scripts.</p>
<pre><code>"scripts": {
  "clean:install": "rm -rf ~/Library/Application\\ Support/factorio/mods/vroom*",
  "copy:install": "VERSION=$(cat info.json | jq -r .version) &amp;&amp; rsync -r --exclude node_modules --exclude '.git*' --exclude build --exclude 'npm*' --exclude README.md --exclude package.json --exclude '*.lock'  ./ ~/Library/Application\\ Support/factorio/mods/vroom_$VERSION/",

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As I was sitting at work, coming up with a way to solve some synchronization issue between our relational database and a search index, it got me thinking… Is it possible to have a database that can handle this stuff for me, the way, for example, Postgres handles the creation and maintenance of an index? Just one <strong>CREATE INDEX</strong> away from efficient and fast queries. What about a database that can serve every need: storing and reading data effectively, scaling smoothly as the workload increases, being able to run complex searches, do batch and stream processing for analytical purposes and work with every other access pattern we can imagine.</p><p>Almost any organization that handles data uses a relational database in its stack. It makes sense, it’s a battle-tested technology that stood the test of time. For a large percent of the applications, the need won’t arise for a different kind of data system. Take Postgres for example: it’s highly scalable, it has transactions with ACID properties, materialized views, supports partitioning and replication, joins, views, triggers, stored procedures, hot backups, all that kind of stuff. We can go
along way with it without having to worry about problems with the dataflow in our system. But of course, not all data models are suitable for Postgres, and even though it supports things like full-text searches and JSON columns, some times it is more suitable or easier even, to use different technology.</p><p>But even though relational databases have come a very long way, still they are not designed to handle every possible workload, so we resort to having to combine multiple systems to handle this broad variety: we use Redis for caching, Elasticsearch for searching, Kafka for stream processing, and many more similar tools and technologies, each of them serving a very narrow purpose in handling our different use cases.</p><p>But is there a way to unify the interface across these systems?</p><p>These technologies are great at what they do, we just need something that nicely ties them together instead of putting that burden on our applications. Putting the application in this role is too much of a responsibility, storing and transporting the data from one place to another as well as handling all of the business logic is a sure way of making those systems permanently inconsistent with each other.</p><p>Instead, if we can figure out a way of making these diverse components work nicely together, we will have a much more reliable solution. Kinda like the pipe in Unix, allowing the user to compose different workflows together out of simpler programs, by sending the output of one command to another, for further processing.</p><p>Now I know there are tools today that handle some of these cases that I mentioned, and they are getting better each day, but they’re far from simple to operate and maintain, and more importantly, they’re not of declarative nature.</p><p>Instead of relying on tools, is it possible to have some abstraction akin to SQL, some declarative language that will hide away the complexities of storing and synchronizing the data across the different data systems, making it easier to combine the disparate technologies, while also providing escape hatches in case the need arises to access the underlying storage directly?</p><p>Taking inspiration from the UNIX philosophy which emphasizes building complex systems out of simpler, extensible, and modular components, can we apply the same principles here, to our future data systems?</p></div></div>]]>

                            For many children of the '80s, a good portion of your childhood probably revolved around sitting too close to the TV, clutching a plastic safety cone-colored hand gun and blasting waterfowl out of a pixilated sky in <em>Duck Hunt </em>(also, trying to blow that dog’s head off when he laughed at you). The <em>Duck Hunt</em> gun, officially called the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Zapper, seems downright primitive next to the Nintendo’s Wii and Microsoft’s Kinect, but in the late 80s, it filled plenty of young heads with wonder. How did that thing work?
                        
</p><h4>Annie Get Your Zapper</h4><p>
    
                            The Zapper’s ancestry goes back to the mid 1930s, when the first so-called “light guns” appeared after the development of light-sensing vacuum tubes. In the first light gun game, <a href="http://www.pinrepair.com/arcade/rayolit.htm">Ray-O-Lite</a> (developed in 1936 by Seeburg, a company that made parts and systems for jukeboxes), players shot at small moving targets mounted with light sensors using a gun that emitted a beam of light. When the beam struck a sensor, the targets – ducks, coincidentally – registered the “hit” and a point was scored.
                        
</p><p>
    
                            Light guns hit home video game consoles with <em>Shooting Gallery</em> on the Magnavox Odyssey in 1972. Because the included shotgun-style light gun was only usable on a Magnavox television, the game flopped. The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Zapper then fell into the hands of American kids in October 1985, when it was released in a bundle with the NES, a controller and a few games. Early versions of the peripheral were dark gray, but the color of the sci-fi ray gun-inspired Zapper was changed a few years later when a federal regulation required that toy and imitation firearms be “blaze orange” (color #12199, to be exact) so they wouldn’t be mistaken for the real deal.
                        
</p><p>
    
                            While there were a number of Zapper-compatible games released for the NES (when I was a kid and my dad worked from home, we wasted plenty of afternoons away playing <em>Hogan’s Alley</em>), most lived in the shadow of the iconic <em>Duck Hunt</em>, the most recognizable and popular Zapper game.
                        
</p><h4>Gone in a Flash</h4><p>
    
                            While older light guns like the Ray-O-Lite rifle emitted beams of light, the Zapper and many other recent light guns work by receiving light through a photodiode on or in the barrel and using that light to figure out where on the TV screen you're aiming.
                        
</p><p>
    
                            This target flashing method helped Nintendo overcome a weakness of older light gun games: cheaters racking up high scores by pointing the gun at a steady light source, like a lamp, and hitting the first target right out of the gate.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wikitext">

<p><span>March 17, 2014</span>
</p>
<p>Remember <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/" rel="nofollow">Galton’s experiments on visual imagination?</a> Some people just don’t have it. And they never figured it out. They assumed no one had it, and when people talked about being able to picture objects in their minds, they were speaking metaphorically.
</p>
<p>And the people who <em>did</em> have good visual imaginations didn’t catch them. The people without imaginations mastered this “metaphorical way of talking” so well that they passed for normal. No one figured it out until Galton sat everyone down together and said “Hey, can we be really really clear about exactly how literal we’re being here?” and everyone realized they were describing different experiences.
</p>
<p>I thought about this recently during a conversation with Ozy:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ozy:</strong> I am currently eating chickpeas and rice and I am <em>delighted</em> by the fact that I can eat this <em>whenever I want</em>. The nice thing about DISCOVERING YOUR FOOD PREFERENCES is that suddenly all the food in my cupboards is food I like and am looking forward to eating. And usually I get food I like by, like, luck? So this is excitement.
</p>
<p><strong>Scott:</strong> I don’t understand, why didn’t you buy things like that before?
</p>
<p><strong>Ozy:</strong> It took me a while to have enough of a sense of the food I like for “make a list of the food I like” to be a viable grocery-list-making strategy.
</p>
<p><strong>Scott:</strong> I’ve got to admit I’m confused and intrigued by your “don’t know my own preferences” thing.
</p>
<p><strong>Ozy:</strong> Hrm. Well, it’s sort of like… you know how sometimes you pretend to like something because it’s high-status, and if you do it well enough you <em>actually believe</em> you like the thing? Unless I pay a lot of attention <em>all</em> my preferences end up being not “what I actually enjoy” but like “what is high status” or “what will keep people from getting angry at me”
</p>
<p><strong>Scott:</strong> How does that apply to food?
</p>
<p><strong>Ozy:</strong> Well, sometimes people will tell you a certain food is high-status or healthy or a thing that everyone enjoys, and then I would like it. And a lot of times I just ate whatever was in front of me or ordered whatever the cheapest vegetarian thing on the menu was. And I… sort of vaguely had a sense that some things were more pleasurable to eat than other things but I didn’t like <em>keep track</em> of what they were or anything. Because if I knew I might like the <em>wrong things</em>. And also because I didn’t intuitively grasp that the “liking” thing everyone was talking about was related to pleasure and not to like popularity/status.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So the fact that people talk about what foods they like about a zillion times a day isn’t enough to make everyone realize liking foods is a thing.
</p>
<p>But it gets worse. A high school friend posted on Facebook a link to <a href="http://www.quora.com/Graduate-School/Is-going-for-a-Ph-D-worth-it-if-Im-extremely-passionate-about-a-field-but-dont-really-want-to-spend-my-20s-poor-toiling-away-in-a-lab-and-living-in-a-city-that-I-dont-particularly-want-to-live-in/answer/Mark-Eichenlaub?srid=slK&amp;share=1" rel="nofollow">a really interesting answer on Quora</a>. It makes you log on, so I’ll copy the relevant part below:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have anosmia, which means I lack smell the way a blind person lacks sight. What’s surprising about this is that I didn’t even know it for the first half of my life.
</p>
<p>Each night I would tell my mom, “Dinner smells great!” I teased my sister about her stinky feet. I held my nose when I ate Brussels sprouts. In gardens, I bent down and took a whiff of the roses. I yelled “gross” when someone farted. I never thought twice about any of it for fourteen years.
</p>
<p>Then, in freshman English class, I had an assignment to write about the Garden of Eden using details from all five senses. Working on this one night, I sat in my room imagining a peach. I watched the juice ooze out as I squeezed at the soft fuzz. I felt the wet, sappy liquid drip from my fingers down onto my palm. As the mushy heart of the fruit compressed, I could hear it squishing, and when I took that first bite I could taste the little bit of tartness that followed the incredible sweet sensation flooding my mouth.
</p>
<p>But I had to write about smell, too, and I was stopped dead by the question of what a peach smelled like. Good. That was all I could come up with. I tried to think of other things. Garbage smelled bad. Perfume smelled good. Popcorn good. Poop bad. But how so? What was the difference? What were the nuances? In just a few minutes’ reflection I realized that, despite years of believing the contrary, I never had and never would smell a peach.
</p>
<p>All my behavior to that point indicated that I had smell. No one suspected I didn’t. For years I simply hadn’t known what it was that was supposed to be there. I just thought the way it was for me was how it was for everyone. It took the right stimulus before I finally discovered the gap.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So I guess you can just <em>not be able to smell</em> and not know it.
</p>
<p>This makes me wonder what universal human experiences I and my friends are missing out on without realizing it.
</p>
<p>I know one friend’s answer. He discovered he was color-blind sometime in his teens. This still surprises me. People are always taking Ishihara tests (those colorful dotted circles with numbers inside of them) and discovering they’re color blind. Going through life with everyone else saying “The light was red, but now it’s green” and thinking it was weird that they were making such a big deal about subtle variations in shades of brownish-gray, but it was probably one of those metaphors.
</p>
<p>As for me? I took a surprisingly long time to realize I was asexual. When I was a virgin, I figured sex was one of those things that seemed gross before you did it, and then you realized how great it was. Afterwards, I figured it was something that didn’t get good until you were skilled at it and had been in a relationship long enough to truly appreciate the other person. In retrospect, pretty much every aspect of male sexual culture is a counterargument to that theory, but I guess it’s just really hard for my brain to generate “you are a mental mutant” as a hypothesis.
</p>
<p>But even bigger than that, I think I might not have had emotions, at least not fully, for about five years as a teenager when I was on SSRIs. I even sort of noticed myself not having emotions, but dismissed that as an odd thing to happen and probably other people were just being really overexuberant about things. Later I learned emotional blunting is a commonly reported side effect of SSRIs and I was probably just really not experiencing emotions. When I came off them it took me several years to get used to having normal-intensity feelings again, but it wasn’t a sudden revelation, like “Wow, I was missing a fundamental human experience for the past several years!” Just a sense of things being different which was hard to cash out.
</p>
<p>As always, I wonder if a lot of what other people interpret through vague social things might be biological, or at least more <em>complicatedly</em> social. I can’t enjoy jazz music even a little – the best I can do is pick up something sort of like a beat and half-heartedly feel like maybe I could snap my fingers to it if I could build up the energy. My brother fell in love with jazz as soon as he heard it and is now a professional jazz musician who has dedicated his life to it. Are we listening to the same thing when we hear a jazz tune? Or am I like a guy who can’t smell trying to appreciate perfume?

	  <p>Introduction</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/photography/T/w/Two-Surfers-On-The-Beach/Two-Surfers-On-The-Beach-Ireland.html"><img alt="Two surfers on the beach" title="Two surfers on the beach" src="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/photography/photos/T/w/Two-Surfers-On-The-Beach-225x150.jpg" width="225" height="150"></a></p><p>
            This documentation presents the UNIX kernel I wrote
            in 1994-1995.  It's an almost complete implementation of the
            POSIX.1 standard (IEEE Std 1003.1-1988).  My main motivation
            was learning about operating systems design and
            architecture, kernel algorithms, resource allocation,
            process scheduling, memory management policies, etc.  The
            result is a new POSIX compliant UNIX kernel with many
            features real operating systems have: virtual memory, demand
            paging, protection, swapping, etc.  It is not perfect, it
            probably has bugs, but in time they will get fixed and the
            kernel will become more stable.  Since many high-quality
            free software packages are available on the Internet, coming
            especially from the GNU project, I have ported many of them
	    to my system, with the idea of getting real functionality.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  As of December 2007, Thix has been taken over by 
	  <a href="mailto:paulhulme@thix.eu">Paul Hulme</a>.  His work
       	  will be distributed through <a href="http://thix.eu/">thix.eu</a>.
          </p>

          <p>Status</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/photography/B/a/Batroun-Village-Club-Amphitheatre/Batroun-Village-Club-Amphitheatre-Lebanon.html"><img alt="Batroun Village Club Amphitheatre" title="Batroun Village Club Amphitheatre" src="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/photography/photos/B/a/Batroun-Village-Club-Amphitheatre-225x150.jpg" width="225" height="150"></a></p><p>
            The Thix Operating System is fully functional at this time.
            Many free software packages have been succesfully
            compiled/run under it, including development tools such as
            the GNU C/C++ Compiler suite.  However, there is no
            networking support and the only drivers available are for
            floppy disks, (E)IDE hard disks, printers, virtual
            terminals, mem, kmem and null.
          </p>
          <p>
            The format of the executable is still a.out which is very
            hard to maintain due to its so many variants.  Maybe I'll
            switch to ELF one day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thix has been developped under Linux with GCC.  Many thanks
            to all the people that made this possible.

          <p>
            December 2006, i.e. 10 years later...  Yeah, it's been
            <em>that</em> long since I touched this stuff.  I could
            never get Thix to work in VMware, not straight out of the
            box anyway, but now that I got a Mac and <a href="http://parallels.com/" rel="external-parallels" title="Parallels">Parallels</a> seems to handle it quite
            well (minor keyboard issues notwithstanding), I figured I'd
            put an image out there for people to play with.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have created 3 images that can be useful for a number of
            things (development, study, or plain curiosity).  The first
            one is a <a href="http://vmware.com/" rel="external-vmware" title="VMware">VMware</a> image with an old distribution of
            S.u.S.E Linux (circa 1996).  This distribution has the old
            versions of GCC and binutils required to compile Thix.  I've
            set up two accounts, <em>root</em> and <em>tudor</em>, both
            using the account name as the password.  The <em>tudor</em>
            account contains the sources for the kernel and all the tools
            that have been ported to Thix.  I tried getting the same Linux
            version to install in Parallels under Mac OS X (Tiger) as well
            as convert the VMware image to Parallels once installed, and
	    failed miserably in both cases, so for now development is under
	    VMware and testing under Parallels.
          </p>
          <p>
            The more exciting part though are the other two images, one
            which is a full installation of Thix complete with a rescue
            floppy disk.  These are raw images (the disk one corresponds
            to an IDE disk with C/H/S=163/16/63 geometry).  Unfortunately,
            I couldn't get Thix to work in VMware, so these images, as you
            can tell from the file extensions, are for Parallels.
          </p>

          <p>
            ... now back to the old stuff.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thix is distributed under the GNU Public Licence.  You can
            download the <a href="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/thix/download/src/thix-0.3.7.tar.gz"> Thix
            kernel sources</a> and the <a href="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/thix/download/src/tfs-0.2.1.tar.gz">sources of the fsck</a>
            utility, a great tool in repairing damaged Thix File
            Systems.  To get an idea of how Thix works, you can download
            the raw compressed image of a 3.5" bootable <a href="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/thix/download/demo/thix-demo.bin.gz">demo floppy</a>.
            Uncompress it with gunzip, dump it on a formatted 3.5"
            floppy and boot from it.  At the login prompt type
            <em>root</em> to enter as superuser or <em>guest</em> to log
            in as an ordinary user.  The <em>root</em> password is
            <em>root</em> and the <em>guest</em> password is
            <em>guest</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are curious and want to install the entire Thix
            distribution (including the GNU C compiler and the related
            utilities), just download the sources (you will need them
            anyway), and read the installation instructions in the
            INSTALL file.
          </p>
          <p>
            Basically, you will have to download the <a href="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/thix/download/dist/thix-install.bin.gz"> install floppy</a>
            and the packages in the distribution:

<p>One of the central challenges in data science (DS) and machine learning (ML) is
managing and maintaining data quality. As an ML engineer and  practitioner who
frequently constructs, cleans, explores, and models proprietary (i.e. non-benchmark)
datasets, "bad data" makes all the difference between accurate versus misleading
data visualizations, statistical inferences, and models. In this article I want
to hone in on three problems that are fairly unique to DS/ML practice when it comes to
dealing with tabular data in the Python ecosystem using <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a>,
which is one of the de facto tools for data manipulation in the DS/ML toolchain.</p>

</div>

<div>
<h3 id="Data-Integrity-Errors-Fail-Silently">Data Integrity Errors Fail Silently<a href="#Data-Integrity-Errors-Fail-Silently"> </a></h3>
</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>Tooling for type safety is improving in the Python ecosystem with the broad adoption
of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html">typing</a> module and
projects like <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a>, which eases the developer
experience for writing readable, reliable code.</p>
<p>However, for most DS/ML work, this isn't quite sufficient. This is because
logical data types don't always capture the statistical distributions of the
variables under study, which is a key thing to do when, for example, your data
distribution shifts as a result of a world-wide pandemic,
<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/11/1001563/covid-pandemic-broken-ai-machine-learning-amazon-retail-fraud-humans-in-the-loop/">causing ML models to break</a>
in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>Having systems in place that fail early (and loudly 🔊) when the data distribution
is not what you assumed is one of the critical pieces to building reliable
production systems, and we need better tooling for this.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>Another important tool in the developer's arsenal is testing. There are many
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1617296279">books</a>, <a href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests">articles</a>, and
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5357601/whats-the-difference-between-unit-tests-and-integration-tests">discussions</a>
available online about different types of testing techniques and how to put them
into practice. I won't dive deeply into it here, but in short, testing your code
makes it easier to change it and know when you've broken something while at the same time serving as
documentation.</p>
<p>Even in exploratory or research contexts, it's a good idea to write tests for your
code because it strengthens your confidence in the robustness of the insights that
you're taking away from your analysis.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>The challenge with testing software compounds when processing data for the
purpose of statistical analysis and modeling.</p>
<p>Consider a machine learning pipeline that creates a predictive model from
survey responses. The barriers to testing data and transformation code
tends to be much higher than the business logic that processes survey responses
and stores raw values in a database because the latter tends to be simpler
and more atomic by design.</p>
<p>By <em>atomic</em> ⚛ I mean that each piece of data that's filled out by respondents
and stored in the database can be tested in isolation without having to
analyze the aggregate statistical patterns across a larger sample of responses.
On the other hand, for my statistical analysis to make sense, the overall
integrity of the statistical distribution 📊 of the responses needs to be taken
into account.</p>

<h3 id="Technical-Debt:-No-Tests-==-Legacy-Code">Technical Debt: <code>No Tests == Legacy Code</code><a href="#Technical-Debt:-No-Tests-==-Legacy-Code"> </a></h3>
</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>Because the effort that goes into exploring, cleaning, and figuring out how to
test my dataset is so high, I'm discouraged from writing tests for my pipeline
code. As the famous software development quip goes:</p>
<blockquote><p>"legacy code is code without tests"</p>
<ul>
<li>Michael C. Feathers, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Robert-Martin/dp/0131177052">Working Effectively with Legacy Code</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>But you might think: "but when I put my code in production, surely I
– or one of my collaborators – will write tests then?". The thing is,
regardless of who writes those tests or when they're written, someone'll have to
do it at some point, so the sooner and more quickly you can climb
the technical debt mountain 🏔 the better!</p>
<p>In the rest of this post I'll try to convince you that statistical typing gives
us the tools we need to do just that.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>If you've used strong, statically-typed languages before, or the <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a>
static type checker with type-hinting in Python, you may have noticed that type definitions can
often catch nasty type-related bugs 🐞 that render certain kinds of unit tests unnecessary. Other
tools, like <a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/">pydantic</a>, enforce types at runtime via a
data parsing model.</p>

<p>Statistical typing extends the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type">logical data types</a>
to the class of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_data_type">statistical data types</a>
and, ultimately, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_probability_distributions">probability distributions</a>.
Statistical data types builds on top of logical data types, and in fact there's considerable overlap between the two.</p>
<p>For example, the <em>binary</em> logical data type is also a statistical data type. The key
difference is that statistical data types hold additional semantics that govern the kinds
of statistical operations that we can perform on variables of a particular type and
probability distributions that describe those variables.</p>

from the data type, set/range of values, or even what distribution a particular
variable is drawn from? This is the goal of statistical typing: to enumerate a
practical set of constraints that specify what should be considered valid data for
a particular dataset.</p>
<p>For example, we might want a <em>categorical</em> variable to be drawn <em>somewhat</em> uniformly
from a set of values <code>{A, B, C}</code>. We can express this as a hypothesis test that
causes our pipeline to fail if any one of the values occurs significantly more
frequently than the others, given a pre-defined level of statistical significance.</p>
<p>Or we may want a <em>real-valued</em> variable to be drawn roughly from a normal
distribution with mean <code>µ</code> and variance <code>σ</code>, which can also be specified with an
alpha value that we deem acceptable for a particular analysis.</p>
<p>In essence, a statistical typing implementation involves specifying three kinds
of metadata for a given set of variables:</p>
<ol>
<li>logical data types, e.g. <code>int</code>, <code>str</code>, <code>float</code>, etc.</li>
<li>deterministic properties, e.g. <code>categorical</code> values and <code>real-valued</code> ranges</li>
<li>probabilistic properties, e.g. sufficient statistics like <code>mean</code> and <code>standard deviation</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The challenge presented by item <em>3</em> is obvious: discovering the underlying
probability distributions of real-world data is often non-trivial. However,
even if we can only express or automatically infer these metadata up to point
<em>2</em>, we can still get something quite powerful 💪: <strong>property-based testing of statistical
analysis code</strong>.</p>

<p>With a statistically-typed dataframe, not only can we validate real-world data to
ensure that our assumptions about them hold up, but we can also test our data
transformation, analysis, and modeling code <em>given valid samples</em> according to
our schema definition. Statistical typing effectively gives DS/ML practitioners
the tools to easily isolate their code from real-world data, providing a convenient
way of implementing unit tests.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>Let me illustrate how these concepts would work in practice with a toy problem using
<a href="https://github.com/pandera-dev/pandera">pandera</a>, a runtime data validation library
for <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas dataframes</a> that I've been developing over
the last few years.</p>
<p>Suppose you're building a predictive model of house prices given features about
different houses:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>In the raw data above you can see that we have the following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>feature 1: <code>square_footage</code></li>
<li>feature 2: <code>n_bedrooms</code></li>
<li>feature 3: <code>property_type</code></li>
<li>target: <code>price</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Our modeling pipeline will involve two steps:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<h3 id="Defining-Schemas-with-pandera">Defining Schemas with <code>pandera</code><a href="#Defining-Schemas-with-pandera"> </a></h3>
</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>At its core, <code>pandera</code> provides a flexible and expressive API for defining
dataframe schemas and seamlessly integrating data validation logic into your
data analysis pipelines, all while separating the concerns of data cleaning
and validation.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>In the code above, we can see that we're defining a <code>BaseSchema</code>, which shares
columns that are common between the raw and processed data. We're also making
sure that the columns are coerced to the expected data types during validation.</p>
<p><code>RawData</code> and <code>ProcessedData</code> inherit from <code>BaseSchema</code>, and just by looking
at them we can see the difference that we expect between the raw and processed data:
our <code>process_data</code> function should convert the <code>property_type</code> categorical
variable into a set of dummy variables.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<h3 id="Runtime-Data-Testing">Runtime Data Testing<a href="#Runtime-Data-Testing"> </a></h3><p>Now we use python's type-hinting syntax to annotate the <code>process_data</code> and
<code>train_model</code> functions, decorating them with <code>@pa.check_types</code> to make sure
that the inputs and outputs are validated at runtime:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Now every time we run our pipeline our data is validated as it passes through
the various transformations:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>So if we pass invalid data into <code>run_pipeline</code>, we should get an error:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Here, <code>pandera</code> tells exactly what went wrong: the <code>property_type</code>
column has an invalid category <code>unknown</code> at the 0th entry.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<h3 id="Property-based-Testing">Property-based Testing<a href="#Property-based-Testing"> </a></h3><p>But wait, there's more! Since we've already defined our schemas, we can isolate
the processing and model-training code from real-world data to test that
each component in your pipeline is functioning as expected.</p>
<p><code>pandera</code> builds on top of the <a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/">hypothesis</a>
package to generate synthetic data from search strategies that try to find
the simplest case that would falsify your tests:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>We could run this as a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html">unittest</a>
or <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/">pytest</a> suite, but for now we can just run the
tests manually like so:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>So if we were to incorrectly implement any of the components in our pipeline,
we'd see errors early on. In this case, we're just going to return the raw data
without the dummified <code>property_type</code> variable.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Here, our test suite catches the fact that <code>property_type_condo</code> doesn't exist
in our processed data output.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>We can get some more intuition about what's going on with the data synthesis
strategies by interactively generating data using the <code>example</code> method.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Under the hood, <code>pandera</code> is collecting all of the schema properties and
converting it into a search strategy using the
<a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/numpy.html#pandas">pandas-supported hypothesis strategies</a>.
Currently, one limitation that you can see from the <code>ProcessedData</code> example above is that the
generated data doesn't quite capture the joint distribution between the <code>property_type_*</code> dummy
variables, as the second row contains <code>1</code>s for all of the property types. Depending on</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div id="articleBody"><p dir="ltr"> workers with a universal basic income did not reduce the amount of effort they put into their work, according to an experiment conducted by Spanish economists, a sign that the policy initiative could help mitigate inequalities and debunking a common criticism of the proposal.</p><p dir="ltr">Examining a universal basic income worth about one-fifth of workers' median wages, the researchers also found that the threat of being replaced by robots did not impact workersâ€™ productivity, nor did a tax on firms when they replace a worker with a robot or automated process, though the latter successfully created a disincentive for managers.</p><p dir="ltr">Their <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00676-8">research</a>, published last month in <em>Humanities and Social Sciences Communications</em>, utilized a behavioral economics lab set up by FundaciÃ³n COTEC, a nonprofit organization honorarily led by the king of Spain that promotes innovation as a driver of economic and social development. The foundation aimed to understand how automation and universal basic income may impact entrepreneurs, companies and the public sector.</p><p dir="ltr">Researchers recruited 900 individuals to take part in the experiment, 59% of whom were female and 98% of whom were university students. The average age was 21, with a minimum age of 19 and a maximum age of 30. Participants were asked to work on a set of tasks and were paid based on their performance. Researchers then introduced several different scenarios, such as replacing certain participants with robots and creating a universal basic income worth about one-fifth of the workersâ€™ median pay, to see how worker productivity was impacted.</p><p dir="ltr">Though it was a laboratory experiment, Angel SÃ¡nchez, a co-author of the research and professor at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, said the researchers wanted to ensure their findings would be applicable in real-world situations, so the money given to participants had to be earned.</p><p dir="ltr">â€œItâ€™s not like I just give you money and then you donâ€™t feel you should care much about what to do with it,â€� SÃ¡nchez said. â€œNo â€” you earned it and youâ€™re going to feel itâ€™s yours and you donâ€™t want to throw it away. And thatâ€™s key in the experiment because thatâ€™s what we think gives external validity to the experiment.â€�</p><p dir="ltr">The researchers also vetted their experiment with the FundaciÃ³n COTEC board of trustees, many of whom are part of Spainâ€™s largest companies, â€œand they think this experiment made perfect sense, of course as a stylization of real life,â€� SÃ¡nchez said.</p><p dir="ltr">Though most of the experiment participants were university students, SÃ¡nchez said this, too, adds to the robustness of their methods â€” 40.9% of people under 25 in Spain are unemployed, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, the highest youth unemployment rate for OECD companies.</p><p dir="ltr">â€œSo we thought that they would be, for this particular problem, a very good audience because this is something that touches upon what they are going through now,â€� SÃ¡nchez said. â€œSo in that respect, Iâ€™m more confident.â€�</p><p dir="ltr">He added, though, that the results of the experiment are likely applicable outside Spain. Finland, for example, experimented in 2017 and 2018 with a universal basic income and <a href="https://www.kela.fi/web/en/news-archive/-/asset_publisher/lN08GY2nIrZo/content/results-of-the-basic-income-experiment-small-employment-effects-better-perceived-economic-security-and-mental-wellbeing">found</a> that it improved individualsâ€™ mental and economic well-being, though the employment effects were small, which SÃ¡nchez said disproves the common argument that a universal basic income would cause fewer people to work.</p><p dir="ltr">The Spanish government, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, has <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52707551">begun</a> its own nationwide experiment with a monthly basic income, providing approximately $500 to each adult in the program. Spain is prioritizing families, including single-parent households, and hopes to reach 1 million homes with the initiative.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, SÃ¡nchez said he hopes to see more research done on robots and automation, especially around how a tax on substituting a human with a robot might impact the economy.</p><p dir="ltr">â€œItâ€™s probably something governments could try at least on a smaller scale for some sectors and see what happens,â€� he said. â€œBecause this is something that, outside of this experiment, I havenâ€™t seen.â€�</p><p dir="ltr">Though a worker-replacement tax could help pay for a universal basic income, SÃ¡nchez and his colleagues also wrote in their research that an automation tax might impede technical change, which could pose long-term problems for society.</p><p dir="ltr">â€œSo other theoretical studies would be useful, too, in whatâ€™s the way to either prevent workers from being substituted by machines or to get money from the guys that are now using machines to compensate the workers that are laid off,â€� SÃ¡nchez said. â€œThese two schemes need a lot of research. Thereâ€™s very little done there.â€�</p><p dir="ltr"><em>The study â€œRobots, labor markets, and universal basic income,â€� published Dec. 16, 2020, in Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, was authored by Antonio Cabrales, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; PenÃ©lope HernÃ¡ndez, Universitat de ValÃ¨ncia; and Angel SÃ¡nchez, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.</em></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> It is a mystery often mentioned in the foundations of mathematics that our best and strongest mathematical theories seem to be linearly ordered and indeed well-ordered by consistency strength. Given any two of the familiar large cardinal hypotheses, for example, generally one of them proves the consistency of the other. Why should this be? The phenomenon is seen as significant for the philosophy of mathematics, perhaps pointing us toward the ultimately correct mathematical theories. And yet, we know as a purely formal matter that the hierarchy of consistency strength is not well-ordered. It is ill-founded, densely ordered, and nonlinear. The statements usually used to illustrate these features are often dismissed as unnatural or as Gödelian trickery. In this talk, I aim to overcome that criticism—as well as I am able to—by presenting a variety of natural hypotheses that reveal ill-foundedness in consistency strength, density in the hierarchy of consistency strength, and incomparability in consistency strength. </p>



<p>The talk should be generally accessible to university logic students, requiring little beyond familiarity with the incompleteness theorem and some elementary ideas from computability theory.</p>

      <h3 id="accidental-habit-development-a-year-of-walking">Accidental Habit Development: A year of walking</h3><p>I'm terrible at setting new habits. I've tried every habit app, journal method, hiding things, etc and I'm still at around 10% success rate of choosing a new habit and sticking to it.</p><p>One thing I've learned: I'm equally terrible at the habit of using habit apps.</p><p>Nearly by accident, I set a new habit in 2020 that has been consistent for 320 straight days: taking a walk. February last year, I set a (tiny) goal of walking for at least 10 minutes. Every day. I used the Streaks App, but connected to Apple Heatlh. Any time I started a walk on the Apple Watch, the time was automatically tracked in Streaks. No manual tracking required. Any time I completed a walk of 10 minutes or more, I'd get a push notification from Streaks happily encouraging me for completing my task and updating my progress.</p><p>When I first started, I was consistent because of a nascent willpower. I'd set a goal in a moment of aspriation and wanted it done. Walking 10 minutes was also <strong>easy</strong>: if I was close to missing a day, I'd feel silly not to walk 5 minutes away from my house and back. The Streaks app also acted as a safety net. If I hadn't completed a walk, I'd get a notification <strong>prompt</strong> that I was about to "break the streak". FOMO kicked in and I'd dutifully get up and start a brisk walk. It was also <strong>automated</strong>, I didn't have to build the habit of using a habit app, everything just worked. </p><p>Here's why:</p><ul><li><strong>Ease:</strong> Instead of trying to make a big change, the task was very achievable, even when motivation was low. It's more important to build consistency. The snowball rolling down the top of the mountain.</li><li><strong>Automated:</strong> The main value of a habit app is showing progress and keeping you honest (see prompts below). The problem is they require a separate behavior: tracking if your goal is done! Because the tracking is coupled with the behavior (taking a walk updates the Streaks app), all the value is received with no extra effort.</li><li><strong>Prompts: </strong>The system defaults to "internal" prompts: I should walk because I want to. But, if it's an off day or motivation is low, the Streaks app detects when a miss is imminent and sends a notification. It's like a safety net for habit development.</li></ul><p>Over time something changed... I wasn't doing the walk because it was easy. I was walking because it was just something I did."You're awake, time to walk." Walks became more than just a basic way to improve fitness. They became thinking time, time to call my Dad, or jot notes and thoughts. Now I walk 1-2 hours every morning (have had to wake up earlier for this) and can't imagine giving it up.</p><figure><img src="https://kylewill.blog/content/images/2021/01/Slice-1--52-.png"></figure><h3 id="how-does-behavior-science-explain-why-this-works">How does behavior science explain why this works?</h3><p>BJ Fogg founded the Behavior Design Lab at Stanford and has popularized the <a href="https://behaviormodel.org/">"Fogg Behavior Model" (FBM)</a>. The FBM states that each <strong>behavior</strong> consists of: sufficient <strong>motivation</strong>, sufficient <strong>ability</strong>, and the presence of a <strong>prompt</strong>. Without all three, the behavior doesn't happen. </p><figure><img src="https://kylewill.blog/content/images/2021/01/image.jpeg"><figcaption>Credit: BJ Fogg (behaviormodel.org)</figcaption></figure><blockquote>Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt</blockquote><p>This explains why the walking habit stuck while others have not. The behavior required very little motivation or ability. Most importantly, loading the next prompt required zero behavior. The act of walking loaded up the next prompt and Streaks could know whether to alert to a potential miss. </p><p>What if I could apply the same principles to other habits? A system to <strong>automatically prompt</strong> <strong>easy</strong> habits?</p><h3 id="automated-information-diet-habits">Automated Information Diet Habits</h3><p>One key 2021 focus for me is my information diet. There's a glut of urgent, must-know-now, break-neck-paced news coming out the past year. And it's not slowing down. I want to stay informed, but doom-scrolling doesn't help.</p><p>The first part of improving my information diet involved setting limits on <strong>neutral-bad inputs: </strong>increase social media (Twitter/LinkedIn for me) use, mindless reddit browser, etc. h/t to Brendan Short's "<a href="https://whatilearned.substack.com/">What I Learned</a>" Substack for ideas to limit Screen Time. </p><p>The second part involves increasing input of <strong>good inputs.</strong> I'm trying to increase the time I spend reading books and long form articles. And I've found a system (10 days in) that uses the same principle as the walk habit.</p><p><strong>Here's how the system works high-level:</strong></p><figure><img src="https://kylewill.blog/content/images/2021/01/Slice-2--10-.png"></figure><ol><li>Whenever I open an app for long-form articles or books (Pocket, Kindle) a timer is started in Streaks automatically</li><li>When I close the app, the timer is stopped</li><li>When the cumulative goal time (10 minutes for now) is reached, the daily Streak is marked complete</li></ol><p>That's it. That's the system. It hits all the necessary ingredients:</p><ul><li><strong>Ease:</strong> The goals are simple 10 minutes reading a book and 10 minutes reading for learning. And since the goal is cumulative time, dropping into a book for 2 minutes still has positive reinforcement. </li><li><strong>Automatic: </strong>No need to separately track the goal. The act of doing the task is coupled with tracking the goal.</li><li><strong>Prompts:</strong> The Streaks app notifies externally if I'm about to miss a streak. But I'm also testing a new passive prompt: app recommendations. I've replaced half my home screen with a widget that displays "Siri recommended apps". Based on how you use your phone, apps are suggested to open. I'm noticing Kindle and Pocket showing up in this list more and more over the past ten days. </li></ul><p>So far, I'm 100% covering every day (even though not every day has been high motivation). Excited to share more as the habits build momentum.</p><hr><h3 id="how-exactly-the-system-works-and-how-you-can-use-it-too-">How exactly the system works. And how you can use it too.</h3><p>The secret to automatically tracking my reading involves the Streaks habit app, and Apple's built-in Shortcuts app. </p><p>Shortcuts allow for setting up workflows on your iPhone/iPad similar to IFTTT or Zapier but for apps. They also include "Personal Automations" that automatically run shortcuts when certain conditions are true: connecting to WiFi, arriving home, or (importantly) when certain apps are opened or closed. </p><p>I created two shortcuts that accept the name (or keyword) of a Timed Task in Streaks, and start or stop respectively the timer for that task. </p><p>For each app I want to trigger a Timed Task, I create a "Start" and "Stop" Personal Automation that includes the name (or keyword) of the desired Task and starts when a given app is opened or closed. </p><h3 id="running-this-yourself-">Running this yourself. </h3><figure><iframe width="356" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Ak0p6VFDT4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>How the automatic tracking looks at the end.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p><ul><li>Install the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/streaks/id963034692?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4">Streaks App</a> and setup at least one <em>timed </em>task.

    <p><a href="https://github.com/hermitcore/rusty-hermit">RustyHermit</a> is a unikernel, which is completely written Rust. <a href="http://unikernel.org/">Unikernels</a> are application images that directly contain the kernel as a library, so they do not require an installed operating system (OS).&nbsp;They are typical used in virtualized environments, which build the backbone of typical cloud / edge infrastructures.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>


<h2 id="virtualization-designs">Virtualization Designs</h2>
<p>Common virtualized environments are based on classical <strong><em>virtual machines</em></strong>. In this case, complete machines are emulated or virtualized and common operating systems are running on both host and guest site:</p>
<p><img src="https://rust-osdev.com/showcase/rusty-hermit/common_vm.png" alt="Structure of a common virtualitation environment"></p>
<p>This technique is established (VMware, Hyper-V, etc.) and widely used. However, it introduces additional overhead especially regarding memory consumption and performance.</p>
<p>An alternative approach to common virtual machines is <strong><em>OS-level
virtualization</em></strong>, where the&nbsp;kernel&nbsp;allows the existence of multiple
isolated&nbsp;user space&nbsp;instances. These isolated instances are also known
as container. A typical representative is LXC or Docker and promise less
overhead in comparison to common virtual machines. However, the
isolation between the processes is weaker and may provide less security.</p>
<h2 id="unikernels">Unikernels</h2>
<p>Often only one application (e.g. a web server) is running in the container or the virtual machine. In this case, a <em>unikernel</em> is an attractive solution. The kernel is provided as static library and linked to the application. As the images directly contain the OS kernel, unikernels can directly be booted inside a virtual machine and do not require the typical software stack containing a Linux kernel and its userland within the VM.</p>
<p>Unikernels do not provide system calls in the classical sense, as everything is running with the privilege level of a kernel and what is typically done via system calls is provided via a common function call. At first glance, this sounds more insecure than previous approaches. However, these kernels are expected to run within a virtual machine, which isolates the application from the real system. In addition, common compiler analysis is used to check the complete software stack and unneeded components can even be removed, which can reduce the attack surface of the application.</p>
<p><img src="https://rust-osdev.com/showcase/rusty-hermit/libos.png" alt="Structure of a library operating system"></p>
<p>Well known unikernels are kernels such as <a href="https://mirage.io/">MirageOS</a>
and <a href="http://www.unikraft.org/">Unikraft</a>. MirageOS is written in OCaml,
while Unikraft still uses C as programming language. In contrast to these
kernels, RustyHermit is completely written in Rust to benefit from
Rust's performance and security behavior.</p>
<h2 id="rustyhermit">RustyHermit</h2>
<p>In principle, every existing
Rust application can be built on top of RustyHermit. However, unikernels
are a single tasking operating system. Consequently, the support of the
system call <code>fork</code> and inter-process communication are missing. In
addition, a classical C library is missing, which is typical used as
interface to the operating system. Every crate, which bypasses the
standard runtime and tries to communicate directly to operating system
does not work without modifications. However, many applications do not
depend on these features and work on RustyHermit.</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>Unikernels can be highly optimized. For instance, we optimized the
network stack of RustyHermit. RustyHermit uses
<a href="https://github.com/smoltcp-rs/smoltcp">smoltcp</a> as network stack, which
is completely written in Rust. As interface between guest and host
operating system, we use
<a href="https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Virtio">Virtio</a>, which is in a
para-virtualized driver for KVM and widely used in virtualized Linux
environments.</p>
<p>The following figure compares Linux with RustyHermit,
where both are running as guests inside a virtual machine running on top
of a Linux-based host system:</p>
<p><img src="https://rust-osdev.com/showcase/rusty-hermit/bandwidth.png" alt="Bandwidth of the RustyHermit's exerimental network interface"></p>
<p>Especially for small messages RustHermit
is faster in than Linux.</p>
<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
<p>RustyHermit is also a research project to evaluate new operating
system designs, which improves the scalability and the security of operating systems in cloud environments. For instance, RustyHermit provides classical
techniques to improve the security behavior like stack guards and
separating the application stack from the libOS stack. However, a
library operating system typically uses a common function call to enter
the kernel. A classical separation of user- and kernel space by
entering a higher privilege level is missing.</p>
<p>We presented in a
<a href="https://www.ssrg.ece.vt.edu/papers/vee20-mpk.pdf">paper</a> a modified
version of RustyHermit, which provides an intra-unikernel isolation with
<em>Intel Memory Protection Keys</em> (MPK). MPK is a relatively new hardware
primitive that provides per-thread permission control over groups of
pages in a single address space with <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc19/presentation/park-soyeon">negligible switching overhead</a>,
making it a compelling candidate for use in unikernels.</p>
<p>MPK is requiring modification of page tables at a small performance cost. Four previously-unused bits of each page table entry (the 62nd to the 59th on x86-64) are exploited by MPK. Since MPK exploits four bits of the page table entry, it supports up to 15 protection keys.
MPK controls per-thread permission on groups of pages. Each core has a PKRU register (32 bits) containing a permission value. The value of the PKRU register defines the permission of the thread currently running on that core for each group of pages containing a protection key in their page table entries. Unlike page-table-level permission, MPK provides thread-local memory permission.</p>
<p>We provide user / kernel separation so we simply see the entire application as an untrusted component, independently of application-specific characteristics such as the language it is written in or the level of skill of the application’s programmer. In addition, we divide the kernel code into trusted and untrusted components. Trusted kernel components represent pieces of code written with a memory-safe language, i.e., offering strong security guarantees. Untrusted kernel components correspond to code written either in memory-unsafe languages or in unsafe Rust code blocks.</p>
<p>By entering the library operating system through the application binary interface the protection keys will be automatically changed, which allows access to the kernel stack and the kernel heap. Unauthorized access from within the application will trigger a pagefault, which will be handled by the library operating system.</p>
<h3 id="example-project">Example Project</h3>
<p>To give you an example on how to build an RustyHermit application, lets create a new cargo project:</p>
<pre><code><span>cargo</span><span> new hello_world
</span><span>cd</span><span> hello_world
</span></code></pre>
<p>RustyHermit currently requires the nightly versions of the Rust toolchain.
To simplify the workflow, we recommend to create the configuration
<em>rust-toolchain</em> as follows to define the required components and to
tested version of nightly compiler:</p>
<pre><code><span>[toolchain]
</span><span>channel </span><span>= "</span><span>nightly-2020-12-23</span><span>"
</span><span>components </span><span>= [ "</span><span>rustfmt</span><span>", "</span><span>rust-src</span><span>", "</span><span>llvm-tools-preview</span><span>"]
</span><span>targets </span><span>= [ "</span><span>x86_64-unknown-hermit</span><span>" ]
</span></code></pre>
<p>The configuration file specifies the required components and the version of the nightly compiler to use.</p>
<p>The RustyHermit's target <code>x86_64-unknown-hermit</code> is part of Rust
supported platforms, but doesn't belong to the <em>tier 1</em> platforms,
which means that official binary releases aren't available and the
standard runtime must be build from scratch.
To simplify this build process, we recommend to create the configuration
file <code>.cargo/config</code> as follows:</p>
<pre><code><span>[unstable]
</span><span>build-std </span><span>= ["</span><span>std</span><span>", "</span><span>core</span><span>", "</span><span>alloc</span><span>", "</span><span>panic_abort</span><span>"]

[build]
</span><span>target </span><span>= "</span><span>x86_64-unknown-hermit</span><span>"
</span></code></pre>
<p>To bind the library operating system to the application, we have to add the crate <a href="https://crates.io/crates/hermit-sys"><code>hermit-sys</code></a> to the dependencies in the file <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span># Cargo.toml

</span><span>features </span><span>= ["</span><span>smoltcp</span><span>"]
</span></code></pre>
<p>The feature <code>smoltcp</code> is required if your application tries
to establish a TCP connection. In this case, the library operating systems
includes the TCP/stack <a href="https://github.com/smoltcp-rs/smoltcp">smoltcp</a>.
In addition <em>hermit-sys</em> depends on the tool <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-download">cargo-download</a> to download required components and must be installed with the command <code>cargo install cargo-download</code>.
Finally, the application can be build with the common command <code>cargo build</code>.</p>
<p>The result is a 64-bit excutable in the <a href="https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/elf/elf.pdf">executable link format</a> (ELF).
To start the application within a common virtual machine, a loader is required, which initialize the processor and start the applications.
We provide a simple loader on <a href="https://github.com/hermitcore/rusty-loader">GitHub</a>.
A makefile to build the loader is part of the project.
After that, Qemu can be used to start RustyHermit in a VM as follows:</p>
<pre><code><span>qemu-system-x86_64 -display</span><span> none</span><span> -smp</span><span> 1</span><span> -m</span><span> 64M</span><span> -serial</span><span> stdio</span><span>  -kernel</span><span> path_to_loader/rusty-loader</span><span> -initrd</span><span> path_to_app/app</span><span> -cpu</span><span> qemu64,apic,fsgsbase,rdtscp,xsave,fxsr
</span></code></pre>
<p>To improve the performance, KVM can be used to use the virtualization extension of modern processors.</p>
<pre><code><span>qemu-system-x86_64 -display</span><span> none</span><span> -smp</span><span> 1</span><span> -m</span><span> 64M</span><span> -serial</span><span> stdio</span><span>  -kernel</span><span> path_to_loader/rusty-loader</span><span> -initrd</span><span> path_to_hello_world/hello_world</span><span> -enable-kvm -cpu</span><span> host
</span></code></pre><h3 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h3>
<p>For the near future, we plan to stabilize the interface to the hardware.
For instance, the support of <a href="https://virtio-fs.gitlab.io/">Virtio-fs</a>
is in an early stage. In addition, the integration into Rust standard
library isn't finalized yet and the current version runs only on x86. In the
future, we want to also support aarch64 as processor architecture.</p>

				<p>I consider myself a software craftsman. As every craftsman, I take good care of my craft. I create it, I augment it, and occasionally I reduce it. </p><p>Adding new features always makes me happy and I can understand why. I augment something that I really care about, making it even better. What I find difficult to understand is why I take so much joy when I am deleting code.</p><p>It just doesn't make sense. Every line of code I wrote has cost me time and/or mental effort. Sometimes a significant amount of both. I should feel bad when I figure out that I don't need this massive block of code or this feature is just useless and needs to be removed. </p><p>My only explanation is that it has to do with my mental model when building and understanding software. By default, I try to fit the entire program I am working on in my mind. By fit, I mean that, at some capacity, I try to be able to "dry run" the program myself. I can "calculate" what output the program might produce when certain inputs are given. </p><p>And I do this almost all the time while developing. When modifying a method, when refactoring some part of the code, when moving variables around. I quickly perform "tests" to ensure that I am not breaking anything.</p><p>(Ideally, software is split into self-contained modules for this exact reason: to be able to work on a module without the need to understand almost anything outside of it. But in reality, this rarely happens. Modules are rarely self-contained and small enough projects are not split into modules at all. Anyway, this is a subject for another time.)</p><p>Therefore, I suspect that the joy I get when I have to delete some code is not for the deletion per se. The joy comes from the simplification. If the codebase is reduced then it will be easier to "fit" it in my mind when trying to "dry run" it.</p><p>This better understanding leads to increased happiness when working on the codebase and the joy I am referring to. I am not happy about getting rid of something I spend time and energy on in the past. I am happy because the reduced code size will require less mental effort when working on that project.</p><hr><p><a href="https://www.rockandnull.com/subscribe/"><strong>Subscribe to our non-annoying-once-a-month digest :)</strong></a></p><hr><p>So there you go. Go and delete that unneeded feature without feeling guilty about the joy you get. Until another feature takes its place and you are back to square 0 :)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <section itemprop="articleBody"> <p>SwiftUI was introduced to the world at WWDC in June 2019. While the main goal for SwiftUI is to build rich user interfaces on iOS and other Apple platforms, it can also be used to do other fun things.</p> <p>I couldn’t resist using SwiftUI from the command line, and I wrote about it in <a href="https://medium.com/@eneko/rasterizing-swiftui-views-from-the-command-line-80d974356c4a">Rasterizing SwiftUI views from the command line</a> to showcase how to generate static images (PNG, JPEG, etc). I published the code in GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/eneko/ConsoleUI">ConsoleUI</a>.</p> <p>Last December I used this same technique to generate social media preview images for this blog. I wrote <a href="https://www.enekoalonso.com/articles/issue-13">Generating Social Media preview images with SwiftUI and GitHub Actions</a> so other people like you could do it too.</p> <p>Today, I’m writing about generating application icons for iOS with SwiftUI. You guessed it: from the command line.</p> <h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2> <p>You can start by cloning my <a href="https://github.com/eneko/ConsoleUI">ConsoleUI</a> repo, which I have updated today to run on Xcode 12.4 with the latest SwiftUI available. Feel free to begin with an empty project too. If you do this, you’d probably want to follow the steps on the README file from that repo, or refer back to my first article on this topic.</p> <p>Xcode does not support live previews on Swift packages yet (FB8979344). To allow for realtime previews follow these steps:</p> <ol> <li>Generate an Xcode project (<code>swift package generate-xcodeproj</code>)</li> <li>Add a macOS target to the project</li> <li>Add your view to the macOS target (target <code>Foo</code> on the screenshot below)</li> </ol> <p>The generated project and target files don’t need to be committed to your repository, but you can do it if that makes it easier for later use.</p> <p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32922/105608907-b6c90800-5d5a-11eb-80d9-32de73138e75.png" alt="MySwiftUIView"></p> <p>If you cloned <code>ConsoleUI</code>, at this point you should be able to run the following commands:</p> <div><div><pre><code>swift build                  <span># build project</span>

<h4>Everything you’d find in a great downtown.</h4>



<p>The Block at Bell Works is home to a diverse, growing roster of retailers and restaurants, all centered around its dramatic, quarter-mile atrium, which has been repurposed as an enclosed pedestrian street we call “The Block.” Visitors can stroll along the thriving, climate-controlled avenue that offers all the appeal of an urban ‘main street’, including an expansive food hall, pour-over coffee bar, and an array of retailers. The Block also hosts the monthly pop-up Bell Street Farmer’s Market, where local artists, artisans and other vendors put their unique creations on display.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>On January 14 this year, Google bought Fitbit (a &nbsp;wearables company) for 2.1 billion dollars!</p><p>The question is why a big name like Google buy a smaller company like Fitbit and such an acquisition is worth billions of dollars?!</p><p>The same question goes for many big names and another question comes up because these big companies have very talented engineers who are able to replicate what small ones can do. So what makes big companies think about buying more in the first place?</p><p>Reasons may differ from one company to another; it may also interchange with another reason, but we can distill some important reasons why acquisitions can happen to small brilliant startups.</p><h2>Increasing market share</h2><p>Acquiring a startup from a big company point of view can make the big one have the small company’s clients hence its market share will increase. That’s what happened when Uber acquired Careem for $3.1B to <a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/uber-careem/" target="_blank">expand the greater Middle East region</a></p><h2>Geographical diversification</h2><p>When a dominant company sees potential in a specific geographic region, it looks for a rising startup that has a strong chance of growth.</p><p>However, this is the riskiest reason for acquisition because of the differences in culture, management, marketing, and sales between the acquired company and the corporate.</p><p>Example: Amazon acquiring Souq.com (<a href="https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/why-amazon-acquired-souqcom/" target="_blank">the biggest e-commerce player in the Middle East</a>) for $580M in cash</p><h2>Product diversification</h2><p>Companies develop their businesses by diversifying their products into new ones to expand their sales from new products and acquire new customers.</p><p>Examples: </p><ul role="list"><li>Acquiring Google to many small companies that are not in its primary market (search engines)</li><li>Facebook acquiring Oculus (the Virtual Reality company) as Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-facebook-bought-oculus-2014-11" target="_blank">reported</a>, “a new communication platform.”</li><li>Amazon acquiring Twitch (the video live streaming service)</li></ul><h2>Eliminating potential competition</h2><p>In 2012, Facebook bought Instagram — the 13-employee company that time which had 15 million users. Acquired for 1 billion dollars.</p><p>Two years later, Facebook bought WhatsApp — a 50-employee company that had 450 million active users at that time. The acquisition was worth $19B!</p><p>Eliminating a potential competition for Facebook in the long-term was a big reason why the acquisitions for WhatsApp and Instagram happened. It’s quite intuitive that we use our phones, the more data the platform collects, so the more money!</p><p>On the other hand, Blockbuster — an 84,300-employee company in 2004 founded in 1987 which could have bought Netflix for $50 million but the CEO considered that as a joke. </p><p>Blockbuster had 400+ stores and was dominating in the video rental industry until Netflix left it behind and now Blockbuster has just 3 employees and 1 store in Dallas!</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Reasons vary when a big firm acquires a startup whether to increase their market share, enter a new market region, diversify their products, or eliminate potential competition.</p><p>Whatever the reason is, it should always end up with high profitability to the acquirer in the long run and an instant revenue to the acquired one.</p><h2><a href="http://bit.ly/3mneyrK" target="_blank">Click here</a> to get fresh content to your inbox</h2><h2>Resources</h2><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/netflix-blockbuster-meeting-marc-randolph-reed-hastings-john-antioco.html" target="_blank">Blockbuster Could Have Bought Netflix for $50 Million, but the CEO Thought It Was a Joke</a></li><li><a href="https://ar.quora.com/%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B0%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AA" target="_blank">لماذا تشتري الشركات الكبري الشركات الناشئة</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Alphabet" target="_blank">List of companies acquired by Google</a></li><li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/19/crazy-like-a-facebook-fox/" target="_blank">A Year Later, $19 Billion For WhatsApp Doesn’t Sound So Crazy</a></li><li><a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/uber-careem/" target="_blank">Uber to Acquire Careem To Expand the Greater Middle East Regional Opportunity Together</a></li><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-facebook-bought-oculus-2014-11" target="_blank">The Real Reason Facebook Bought Oculus</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/why-amazon-acquired-souqcom/" target="_blank">Why Amazon Acquired Souq.com</a></li><li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/03/amazon-souq-com-completed/" target="_blank">Amazon completes its acquisition of Middle Eastern e-commerce firm Souq</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-nears-deal-to-acquire-twitch" target="_blank">Amazon to Acquire Twitch for $970 Million — The Information</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_LLC" target="_blank">Blockbuster | wiki</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gazprom-energy.co.uk/blog/diversifying-and-entering-new-markets-how-to-plan-for-success/" target="_blank">Diversifying and entering new markets: How to plan for success</a></li></ul><p>Published on my new medium publication:&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/the-brainwave/why-big-companies-buy-small-ones-be95211b29a6?sk=bac17084562fedf6550f86504955921e">Brainwave</a>, make sure to follow it!<br></p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
 		
<p><span>01</span> Intro</p>



<p>Sparked by <a href="https://twitter.com/dwr/status/1273307320911450112">an interesting Twitter discussion</a>, I’ve spent a lot of time recently thinking about different proof-of-work mechanisms. </p>



<p>When I say proof-of-work, I’m not talking about consensus algorithms like the ones that some crypto currencies use. I’m talking about social networks.</p>



<p>At their core, social networks are primarily about one thing: Building social capital through signaling. As I wrote in <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling as a Service</a>, signaling can be broken down into three different components:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Signaling Message</strong><br>A hidden status subtext you’re trying to convey about yourself</li><li><strong>Signaling Distribution</strong><br>The channel through which you’re communicating your signaling message</li><li><strong>Signaling Amplification</strong><br>Ways to boost your signaling message to compete against status rivals</li></ul>



<p>For example: A Patagonia vest signals both a prosocial attitude (<em>“I care about the environment</em>“) as well as wealth (“<em>I can afford to spend $500 on a jacket</em>“). Depending on where you live, it might also signal something about <a href="https://vcstarterkit.com/">your occupation</a>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/patagucci.png"></p><p>In order to signal these messages to others and build actual social capital you need a signaling distribution channel. One option would be to wear the vest in public where others can see it – but there are obvious physical constraints to the size of the audience you’d be able to reach.</p>



<p>This is where social networks come in.</p>



<p>Their primary role is to distribute signaling messages at scale and transform them into quantifiable social capital (in the form of likes and followers).</p>



<p>As social networks grow, they increase the potential reach of your signaling messages – but they also get crowded with status rivals. This is why social networks typically provide you with a set of signaling amplification tools. These tools help you boost your signaling messages and stand out from the crowd.</p>



<p>In <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling as a Service</a> I compared signaling amplification to <a href="https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service">Eugene Wei’s idea of proof-of-work hurdles</a>, which he describes as follows:</p>



<p><i>Almost every social network of note had an early signature proof of work hurdle. For Facebook it was posting some witty text-based status update. For Instagram, it was posting an interesting square photo. For Vine, an entertaining 6-second video. For Twitter, it was writing an amusing bit of text of 140 characters or fewer. Pinterest? Pinning a compelling photo. You can likely derive the proof of work for other networks like Quora and Reddit and Twitch and so on. Successful social networks don’t pose trick questions at the start, it’s usually clear what they want from you.</i></p>



<p>But the more I think about it, the less I like the comparison. I actually think that Eugene’s proof-of-work theory only scratches the surface of what social networks actually do.</p>



<p>Let me explain.</p>



<p><span>02</span> A closer look at proof mechanisms</p>



<p>Take a look at this very cliché Instagram picture. The photographer clearly put a lot of thought and effort into its composition and applied different filters and editing tools to make it look nicer.</p>



<figure>
<img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/creativework.png">
<figcaption><span>Full disclosure: I actually took this picture from Unsplash. No influencers were harmed during the production of this blog post.<br></span>
</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s a perfect example of Eugene’s definition of proof-of-work. <br>Proof-of-<strong><em>creative</em></strong>-work, to be more exact. </p>



<p>Editing your photo helps to amplify your signaling message and sets you apart within Instagram’s status arena (aka the newsfeed). It also adds additional signaling messages to your post: <em>“Look how great a photographer I am”</em> or <em>“I’m a creative person”</em>.</p>



<p>But those are not the main signaling messages you are communicating here. What you really want to tell your followers with this photo is something along the lines of <em>“I’m a world-traveler”</em> and <em>“I’m in a happy relationship”</em> <span>(which in turn are also just signaling proxies for wealth and mating worthiness)</span>. </p>



<p>The photo and the location tag are your proof points.</p>



<figure><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/igexample02-1.png">
<figcaption><span>If you look closely, you’ll notice additional hidden signaling messages in the form of Allbirds sneakers and what’s most likely a Patagonia vest → proof-of-ownership<br></span>
</figcaption></figure>



<p>Social networks are therefore not only signaling distribution (and amplification) networks – they also allow users to prove their signaling messages. </p>



<p>The creative proof-of-work is just pretext and helps to boost your post. What’s more important are the additional proof mechanisms that social networks provide. In the case of Instagram those are photos and location tags.</p>



<p>Instagram is essentially “pics or it didn’t happen”-as-a-service.</p>



<p><span>03</span> Implications for new social networks</p>



<p>When new social networks emerge they have to introduce new proof mechanisms to differentiate themselves from existing incumbents. These can either be novel proof-of-creative-work hurdles or completely new proof-of-x mechanisms.</p>



<p>TikTok is a good example for proof-of-<em>creative</em>-work innovation. The app provides creators with a powerful set of video editing tools that have opened a whole new level of creativity. </p>



<p>The cost to participate in TikTok’s status game is a lot higher than Instagram’s <span>(compare a well-made dance choreography on TikTok to your median Instagram travel post)</span> – but its powerful feed algorithms also make discovery easier and thus reward users faster and with more social capital. </p>



<p>TikTok doesn’t add any new proof points beyond its novel creative work hurdle though. You can signal and prove your creativity but you could achieve the same by uploading your video to Instagram.</p>



<p>Strava, on the other hand, introduced an entirely new proof mechanism: Proof-of-physical-activity. By using your phone’s GPS sensor (or a 3rd-party fitness tracker), users can actually prove how much and fast they ran or cycled. In contrast to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/20/grounded-private-jet-hire-helps-russians-fake-lavish-lifestyles/">Instagram</a> <a href="https://www.vice.com/da/article/wdaqgw/instagrams-ballers-discount-private-jets-324">photos</a>, Strava’s proof mechanism is a lot harder to fake <span>(though there are <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fake+strava+5k+downhill&amp;oq=fake+strava+5k+downhill">exceptions</a>)</span>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/stravaproof.png"></p><p>What’s great about Strava is that it reinforces a behavior that’s actually good for you: While the status game that initially got you into the app might be zero sum, the actual physical exercise you have to put in to compete has a very positive, compounding effect.</p>



<p>The question is: What other social networks should we build that could have similar positive feedback loops? And what are their proof mechanisms?</p>



<p><span>04</span> Strava for X</p>



<p>Let’s start with the two examples in <a href="https://twitter.com/dwr/status/1273307320911450112">this tweet</a>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tweetstrava.png"></p><p>I love the idea of a <strong>Strava for Cooking</strong> – but I’m very skeptical that it can be built. Why? Because the necessary proof mechanisms don’t exist.</p>



<p>The primary metric you optimize on when cooking is taste. But how would you measure or quantify taste? The closest proxy to taste that we have is optics: How good does the meal that you cooked look? This can easily be proved with a photo .. but that’s a proof-of-work mechanism that Instagram already offers (including filters to make your food look nicer). As long as no one comes up with a better proof mechanism for cooking, I think it’s unlikely that we will see a successful social network in the space.</p>



<p>I’m more optimistic about <strong>Strava for Learning</strong>.</p>



<p>While the activity of learning itself might be hard to quantify, you can measure the outcome of learning: knowledge. Has anyone built a multiplayer version of <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> yet? Flash cards would be a perfect proof-of-knowledge mechanism and could easily be turned into a game where you compete against friends.</p>



<p>Similar to physical activity in the Strava example, learning is not something that most people enjoy doing. As TikTok founder <a href="https://youtu.be/wTyg2E44pBA?t=245">Alex Zhu points out</a>, education goes a little against human nature. In combination with a strong enough signaling mechanism however, you can get users to participate. It’s kind of the opposite of <a href="https://cdixon.org/2015/01/31/come-for-the-tool-stay-for-the-network">Chris Dixon’s famous “Come for the tool, stay for the network” strategy</a>. Come for the status, stay for the tool.</p>



<p>A related product I’d love to see is <strong>Strava for Reading</strong>. Imagine an eBook reader that not only tracks how much time you spend reading but also *what* you are reading. Based on these proof-of-(reading)-work mechanisms you could build streaks or GitHub-contributions-like visualizations that incentivize users to read more (and more regularly).</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/githubforreading.png"></p><p>You could even build leaderboards for different topics based on the content of the books and articles you read. Or think about a score that indicated how balanced your reading behavior per topic was (to incentivize users to read takes on political topics from different perspectives).</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I think it’s unlikely that we will see a product like I described anytime soon. <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1086659965719404544">The world’s largest bookstore, most popular eBook reader, and biggest social network for books</a> are all owned by a company that has very little competency in design and user-facing product innovation.</p>



<p>(Side note: Amazon’s monopoly on books might be the most underrated sub-optimal equilibrium in tech.)</p>



<p>Another app that would be interesting is a social investing app. Think “Robinhood but as a social network”. It seems like investing is already quite a social activity – just look at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-26/reddit-s-profane-greedy-traders-are-shaking-up-the-stock-market">communities like r/wallstreetbets</a>. As <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1250703738634829824">patio11 pointed out</a>, Robinhood already feels more like a game than a finance app.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/robinhood.png"></p><p>So why not build an investing app that opens with a feed of all your friends’ investments and their returns over time? Instead of sharing screenshots on Reddit and Instagram you could prove your investments right in the app.</p>



<p><strong>Note that an app like this would not be about signaling wealth. It’s about signaling <em>being right</em> and the ability to prove it</strong>. This is probably an even stronger and more engaging mechanism than signaling wealth – and the reason why I’m still bullish on prediction markets.</p>



<p>Perhaps a well-designed, consumer-friendly prediction market app would be the ultimate proof-of-x social network. <strong>Strava for being right.</strong></p>



<p><span>05</span> A Closing Ask</p>



<p>While we are on the topic of being right: Do you agree with my thoughts in this post? What other social networks and proof-of-x mechanisms would you like to see?</p>

				<p>
					<span>UPDATE JAN 24, 2021:</span><br>Over the weekend Moderna announced the release of lot number 013M20A, manufactured approximately January 21st (according to our estimate based on each lot's expiration date). For more on how we arrive at these estimates, see <em>Where The Data Comes From</em>, below.
					
					Moderna's U.S. COVID-19 vaccine delivery rate averaged 476,000 doses per day during the latter half of December, but has dropped substantially in the new year, currently averaging just 301,000 doses per day since January 1. To put this in perspective: the company would need to sustain a manufacturing rate of 1.1 <em>million</em> doses per day in order to fulfill its commitment to deliver 100 million doses by the end of March...a goal that currently looks unachievable.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>TECH NOTE: A LOT OF TROUBLE</span><br>
					Moderna's vaccine lot number 041L20A <a target="_blank" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-01-18/moderna-vaccine-allergic-reaction-california-batch">made the news</a> last week when a cluster of 6 vaccine recipients in San Diego developed severe allergic reactions, prompting the state of California to place a temporary hold on vaccinations using that lot. Moderna and the FDA are currently investigating the issue.
				</p>
				<p>
					From our perspective as dose-trackers, that event provided both some new information <em>and</em> some additional uncertainty. Our estimates of the number of US doses delivered by Moderna hinge on our assumption regarding lot sizes - how many doses of vaccine bear the same lot number. We base our estimate of that number on <a target="_blank" href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-provides-covid-19-vaccine-supply-update">Moderna's own statement</a>, on January 4, that <em>"approximately 18 million doses have been supplied to the U.S. Government to date,"</em> plus its report of 26 lots delivered up to that time, enabling us to calculate an average of 692,000 doses delivered to the US government per lot.
				</p>
				<p>
					Last week's news regarding lot 041L20A thus surprised us, when <a target="_blank" href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/statement-california-department-public-health-cdph-report">Moderna revealed</a> that the lot in question comprised 1.27 million doses, of which 964,900 had been delivered to the government.
				</p>
				<p>
					For the moment we have chosen to stick with our initial estimate of an average of 692,000 doses delivered to the government per lot, rather than the number revealed this week for lot 041L20A (965,000 doses) because the former is based on the average of 26 lots, whereas the latter is based on a single lot. We will continue to monitor information from several sources, including Moderna itself, and may adjust our lot size estimate in future, as warranted by available evidence.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>WHY THE SLOWDOWN?</span><br>Moderna has not yet publicly discussed the dial-back in its U.S. manufacturing rate, so we're left to speculate. Our best guess is supply chain issues.
				</p>
				<p>
					Previously, Moderna's vaccine was produced exclusively by contract manufacturer <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lonza.com/">Lonza</a> at its Portsmouth NH facility. But that changed this week when Lonza gained <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-swiss/lonza-gets-swiss-ok-to-start-moderna-vaccine-production-paper-idUSKBN29808X">approval</a> from Switzerland's regulatory agency, Swissmedic, to begin manufacturing at its huge Visp, Switzerland facility as well. Lonza's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1682852/000168285220000023/lonzamodernagltafullye.htm">contract</a> with Moderna stipulates that <em>"In no event will LONZA or its Affiliates ship, or be instructed to ship, to the United States any Product Manufactured at any Facility outside of the United States."</em> That means that raw materials like the specialty lipids that go into Moderna's vaccine, which may be in short supply, are now needed by two facilities, only one of which makes vaccine for the U.S. market. The data we report here reflects only U.S. production.
				</p>
		
				<p><span>WHERE THE DATA COMES FROM:</span><br>Pharmaceutical companies normally treat their manufacturing data like state secrets, sharing them with the FDA only because they are required to, and even then only in strictest secrecy, out of the public eye. But these aren't normal times, and so the public has an unusual opportunity to track <a target="_blank" href="https://www.modernatx.com/">Moderna Therapeutics</a>' COVID-19 vaccine production rate with unprecedented clarity.</p>
			
				<p>The company's RNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, authorized by the FDA on December 20th of last year, was rushed to market long before the company knew for sure just how long the product's shelf life would be. At the time, ongoing testing had already established that its shelf life was <em>at least</em> 6 months, but still more testing would be required to reveal how much <em>longer</em> than that it might be safely stored before losing potency. That's a critical void in our knowledge for a vaccine that is America's best hope (so far) for stemming the pandemic that has already killed more than a third of a million Americans. So Moderna took the unusual step of printing no expiration dates on its vaccine vials, instead providing <a target="_blank" href="https://www.modernatx.com/covid19vaccine-eua/providers/vial-lookup">a page on its web site</a> where pharmacists and other interested parties can search for a vial's lot number and learn the company's current best guess regarding its expiration date. That's helpful because the product's current six month shelf life is likely to be found in the near future to be considerably longer than that, so this web page enables the company to revise each production lot's expiration date as future data provides deeper insight.</p>
			
				<p>But that same expiration look-up page also (and apparently unwittingly) reveals to the educated eye everything we need to know in order to track Moderna's vaccine manufacturing pace <em>in real time</em>, eliminating our dependence on the company or the federal government for answers to the critical question of how rapidly it is is cranking out the life-saving vaccine doses that will ultimately bring this deadly pandemic to an end. When you type in a vaccine lot number and click the page's 'Submit' button, Moderna's web server (housed by Amazon Web Services) replies to that query with <a target="_blank" href="https://lnl-dl.s3.amazonaws.com/Moderna/expiry.json">a JSON file</a> listing every lot of vaccine the company has released so far, along with each lot's current expiration date. Back-calculating from that expiry date, using the current 6-month shelf life figure for the vaccine, thus enables us to determine each lot's manufacturing date. And finally, we know how many doses an average lot of vaccine includes, based on the company's <a target="_blank" href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-provides-covid-19-vaccine-supply-update">January 4th announcement</a> that <em>"approximately 18 million doses have been supplied to the U.S. Government to date."</em> The company had produced 26 lots of vaccine in the U.S. by that date, thus allowing us to calculate that an average production lot amounts to about 692,000 doses.</p>

January 24, 2021 | https://petrepopescu.tech/2021/01/you-should-always-do-server-side-validation-always/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://petrepopescu.tech/2021/01/you-should-always-do-server-side-validation-always/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Web technologies have evolved a lot in the past few years, both on the server-side as well as on the client’s side. There are many web frameworks, UI kits, JavaScript libraries and everything you need to easily and rapidly develop a website or web application. JavaScript libraries have matured and gotten very powerful and processing power, even on low-end computers, does not really pose a problem nowadays for most web-apps. Because of this, web applications have gotten more complex, user interfaces fancier and… programmers lazy.</p><p>Because JavaScript frameworks are so powerful, many are tempted to write business logic in the client-side part of the application. While this can save processing power for the server by unloading computational tasks to the user, and is highly recommended when ever possible, it may pose some security problems. This is especially true if the user can submit data to the server via forms or other input method.</p><p>Because of this, always perform server-side validation of any request, even if you (usually) have a client between the server and the user. Let us look at three scenarios and how failing to validate the input received poses a security vulnerability. Furthermore, even though it may seem obvious that there is a problem, this is not always the case and variations from all three scenarios were real problems I saw in real products.</p><h4>Scenario 1: Privilege escalation by altering user role</h4><p>For the first scenario we will be looking at an application that has different roles for registered user. It can be any such web-app, but I will consider it a content management system like WordPress. Here, users can have different roles: Administrator, Editor, Contributor, Normal User. Any user that is Contributor or above can change the role of another user, but he can’t grant higher privileges than what he has. For example, an Editor can’t make somebody else an Administrator.</p><p>To achieve this, the user edit page has a form with the user’s information and a drop-down with the possible user roles. The page is rendered using the template engine (in this example I will be using Twirl from Play Framework) and the acceptable values are indeed supplied by the server. Our malicious user is a ‘Contributor’, so only two roles should be available for him.</p><div><div><pre><code lang="dart">&lt;select&gt;
@for(role&lt;-acceptableUserRoles) {
  &lt;option value="@role.getIdHash()"&gt;@role.getName()&lt;/option&gt;
}
&lt;/select&gt;</code></pre></div><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="388" height="116" src="https://petrepopescu.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://petrepopescu.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.png 388w, https://petrepopescu.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1-300x90.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px"></figure></div></div><p>Now, our programmer thought that he is smart and, for the value, he explicitly set it to an ID Hash. This is the hash of the ID of the role in the database since the app is quite complex and new roles can be added if needed. He even makes sure that the has received when a user is saved is valid and corresponds to an actual role. The method that handles the request looks something like this.</p><pre><code lang="java">public Result saveUserRole(Http.Request request) {
    Form&lt;UserInfoDTO&gt; form = formFactory.form(UserInfoDTO.class).bindFromRequest(request);
    if (form.hasErrors()) return badRequest();
    
    List&lt;Role&gt; roles = rolesDao.getRoles();
    Role submitedRole = null;
    for (Role role:roles) {
        if (role.getIdHash() == form.get().role()) {
            submitedRole = role;
            break;
        }
    }

    if (role == null) return badRequest();

    UserDO user = userDao.find(form.get().userId());
    if (user == null) return notFound();

    user.setRole(role);
    userDao.update(user);

    return ok();
}</code></pre><p>At first glance, everything seems to be ok. The form is validated, the role is validated, the user is requested from the database, and let’s even assume that there is a CSFR token that protects from malicious submits. Can you spot the problem? The server assumes that because the UI code was generated on the server, the role received is one of the roles that the user has permission to offer. There is no check to see if the role that is being attributed is not higher than what the current user has.</p><div><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="542" height="85" src="https://petrepopescu.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://petrepopescu.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-2.png 542w, https://petrepopescu.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-2-300x47.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 542px) 100vw, 542px"></figure></div><p>Our malicious user can simply open the inspector in the browser and edit the HTML to add a new value to the &lt;select&gt;</p></div><p>Yes, he must know the hash, but if other protection mechanisms aren’t in place, he can just brute-force it since he knows the format. If these are default values and not randomly generated at each install, the task can be even easier since the user can install a dummy application on his computer and find the hash this way.</p><h4>Scenario 2: Access to confidential pages by knowing/guessing the URL</h4><p>Another common mistake is failing to check if a user has access to a page or not. There are multiple variations on this, either by failing to validate that a page is accessible to a specific role or by failing to validate the visibility of a page. We will look at both cases here.</p><p>This time we will be dealing with the presentation website for a company and they are about to launch a new product. The editors write the needed materials, prepare the new product page and wait for the product to be revealed in a few days so they can publish the page. Everything is ready, including final URL for the new product page, since it had to be sent to news outlets beforehand.</p><p>One such outlet was not included in the original press release, but because it is a high-profile company and there are rumors about the new product, they want all the juicy info as well. So they begin to try and guess the URL of the new product page. They know the name of the product and based on passed products, have an idea of how the new page’s URL may look like. Since the CMS fails to validate that an article was actually published or not, by accessing the URL the news outlet has all the information they need and can freely publish them faster than any other news site.</p><p>A variation on this can happen in complex systems as well. It is not uncommon for some functionalities or pages of a site to be inaccessible if the user does not have the right role. The developer made a list of pages that are visible for each user and based on that list and the currently logged in user, it builds the menu in the HTML file. This is done in a similar fashion to the select form from the first scenario. If the developer assumes that the user will navigate only by clicking the menu items in the UI, he may oversee server-side validation. This way, an user can access a page that he is not supposed to simply by entering the correct URL. This is a problem quite frequently encountered in web-apps that are not mature or still undergoing development, but with a public version already released.</p><h4>Scenario 3: Server overload by abusing API calls</h4><p>In the next scenario, the problem is not only server-side validation but multiple coding decisions that together caused a server outage. It all started with a reverse-lookup for the coordinates (latitude and longitude) of an address using Google Maps API. The server was to place points on a city based on the address (Country, State/County, City only). The more addresses at a specific location, the bigger a dot would be on the map. If coordinates for the full address could not be found, it would drop the city and try for the State/County, and if that also fails, only for the country.</p><p>Now, for each new address, there would be a call to the Maps API after which the coordinates would be cached so that there won’t be a new call. This was done both for efficiency and for cost reduction since the API calls are taxed. The problem was that if the address was incorrect, nothing would be cached. It was assumed that, since the UI has drop-downs for all three input fields, the values would be correct.</p><p>Now, let’s change the scenario a bit and assume that instead of one user doing POSTs from a web page (something easily manageable via rate limiters), our server actually processes large files with thousands of entries. A typo in one of the countries caused each look-up to fail and as a result, a new call to the API for each entry in the file, rapidly rising costs, slowing down processing, and eventually putting a halt since all tokens available to the API were consumed.</p><p>Was the server-side validation the only culprit? Definitely not, but doing at least basic validations would have helped drastically reduce the number of calls. The list of valid countries is easy to include and even states/counties are doable without a lot of effort.</p><h4>Conclusions</h4><p>At this point, I hope it is obvious why server-side validation of input data is always needed. It may not always be enough to prevent a problem, but it will at least make it more manageable. In some cases, it can only cause minor inconveniences, but it most scenarios it can have serious consequences, data leaks or higher cost for the company.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>Dan Luu has been trying for months to persuade me that I should start a paid newsletter so that I can spend more time researching and writing interesting things. He hardly ever even mentions the existence of his own <a href="https://www.patreon.com/danluu/posts">private patreon posts</a> and still manages to make decent pocket money out of them, so this doesn't seem like an unreasonable idea.</p>
<p>I produce a lot of writing that mostly just gets sent to friends or left to rot on my hard drive. When I get around to turning something into a blog post it <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=scattered-thoughts.net">tends to end up on the Hacker News front page</a>. It still seems kind of crazy to me that anyone might want to pay for my writing, but it also used to seem crazy to me that people would pay for my code. Maybe I'm just not very good at capitalism.</p>
<p>So I'm going to give this a go - any <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/jamii">github sponsors</a> at any tier will get access to all the new posts. Using github instead of substack is maybe a weird choice, but I want to be able to embed katex and interactive demos in the posts and provide code alongside for examples and case studies. I also expect to be releasing more open-source software this year as a side-effect of doing less consulting.</p>

<p>Here are the kinds of things that I might be working on and writing about this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Big projects 
<ul>
<li>Past examples - <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/a-practical-relational-query-compiler-in-500-lines/">A practical relational query compiler in 500 lines of code</a>, <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/relational-ui/">A UI library for a relational language</a>, <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/julia-as-a-platform-for-language-development/">Julia as a platform for language development</a>, <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/reltron/">A UI for exploring relational databases</a></li>
<li>Designing a database query language that supports abstraction. An <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/imp-intro/">ongoing</a> project which is 80% done and just needs a sustained slog to finish the last 80% and produce a clear writeup and demo.</li>
<li>Building a text editor from scratch. An <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Ejamii/focus">existing project</a>, already in daily use. Posts will start with absolute basics (eg how to render simple UI in opengl) and eventually catch up to ongoing development (currently working on editing 1gb files at 60 fps without dropping frames).</li>
<li>Benchmarking streaming systems. A new project for 2021. Existing streaming benchmarks suffer from problems like <a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2015-01-15.md">measuring how well they can parallelize the overhead they added to the original problem</a>, <a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2018-02-11.md">mostly measuring distributed json de/serialization</a> or even just <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2015/10/5/your-load-generator-is-probably-lying-to-you-take-the-red-pi.html">quietly ignoring pauses</a>. I want to figure out how to measure these systems correctly, begin to map out the space of engineering tradeoffs and try to extract some lessons for designers of future systems.</li>
<li>Building an embedabble relational database with incrementally maintained views. Another new project for 2021. An attempt to place the ideas from <a href="https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow/">differential dataflow</a> into a <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/why-isnt-differential-dataflow-more-popular/">more accessible</a> form.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Little projects
<ul>
<li>Past examples - <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/staged-interpreters-in-rust/">Staged interpreters in Rust</a>, <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/zero-copy-deserialization-in-julia/">Zero-copy deserialization in Julia</a>, <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/open-multiple-dispatch-in-zig/">Open multiple dispatch in zig</a>, <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/pinephone-first-steps/">Writing a simple app for the pinephone</a>, <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/vive-experiments/">Vive experiments</a></li>
<li>Ideas for 2021:
<ul>
<li>See if the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9152719">IJON fuzzer</a> can discover new planning bugs in SQL databases</li>
<li>Record my screen for an entire week long coding project. Find out where the time goes and what the bottlenecks are.</li>
<li>Figure out how to measure the battery usage of desktop programs on linux, and find the biggest offenders.</li>
<li>Figure out how to execute arbitrary zig expressions when debugging a running program. Maybe <a href="https://frida.re/">frida</a> can inject them?</li>
<li>There's some folk wisdom that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09930">multiway join algorithms</a> are more robust to planning errors than traditional binary joins. Is this true? Why?</li>
<li>Experiment with using <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/02/securing-firefox-with-webassembly/">embedded wasm sandboxes</a> to prevent memory safety bugs from escalating into vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Figure out how to systematically avoid common benchmarking mistakes eg is it possible to eg combine <a href="https://github.com/plasma-umass/coz">coz</a> and <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/%7Eemery/pubs/stabilizer-asplos13.pdf">stabilizer</a> or will they interfere with each other?</li>
<li>Can differential dataflow handle late-arriving data by using bitemporal timestamps?</li>
<li>Document how to use the <a href="https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy">tracy profiler</a> via C bindings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/">Distilling</a> existing research in my own field eg:
<ul>
<li>Why don't existing query planners work well for streaming systems?</li>
<li>How can we optimize query plans for worst-case performance over a range of input sizes, rather than best-case performance over the current input sizes?</li>
<li>Why do modern databases contain compilers?</li>
<li>How does <a href="https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow/">differential dataflow</a> work? How does it differ from <a href="https://github.com/janestreet/incremental">Incremental</a>? Which approach is better for which problems?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reading
<ul>
<li>Literature reviews, mostly focused on databases, query languages, query planning (especially in streaming systems), compilers, incremental view maintenance, self-adjusting computation</li>
<li>Book summaries. I <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/notes.html">used to publish</a> summaries of everything I read. Even though they aren't linked from anywhere anymore google still sends a few thousand people to them each month, so I guess they must be useful. I typically read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/scattered-thoughts">~100 books</a> per year, of which ~25 are non-fiction, mostly tech, cognitive science, economics, sociology etc. </li>
<li>Other curiosity-driven binges eg <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/qnd-review-of-ppig-1989-2015/">reading every paper ever published in the Psychology of Programming Interest Group</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Random musings eg <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/small-tech/">Small tech</a>, <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/frugality-is-non-linear/">Frugality is non-linear</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I've spent the last 7 years building database engines, query planners, compilers, developer tools and interfaces for <a href="https://materialize.com/">Materialize</a>, <a href="https://www.relational.ai/">RelationalAI</a>, <a href="https://developer.logicblox.com/technology/">LogicBlox</a> and <a href="http://witheve.com/">Eve</a>, as well as various smaller consulting gigs and personal research projects. I expect to be informative when talking about those subjects, and at least entertaining when talking about other subjects.</p>
<p>Some of the posts will also be published on this blog. Others will be exclusive to the newsletter. I expect the schedule to consist of bursts of activity interspersed with weeks of frustrated silence.</p>
<p>It may seem strange, but this is one of the most frightening things I've done in years. I can only see that as a good sign.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>January 24, 2021</p>
      <p>Clubhouse is moving quickly today, but in some ways it feels like the journey started a long time ago. The two of us met back in 2011 through a mutual friend, and we connected over a shared love of social products. Back then, Rohan had been working on ways to help friends find each other in cities, and Paul was building an app called Highlight to help people form friendships with others around them. Over the next ten years we both kept working on social products—experimenting with new apps, failing, and starting again.</p>
      <p>In the fall of 2019, we reconnected over some work that Rohan was doing to help his daughter Lydia, who was born with a rare genetic disease, and eventually that reconnection led to us finally teaming up to work together. Against our better judgment, and with the support of two very patient spouses, we decided to give social apps one last try.</p>
      <p>After a lot of iteration in the audio space, we launched Clubhouse in March of last year. Our goal was to build a social experience that felt more human—where instead of posting, you could gather with other people and talk. Our north star was to create something where you could close the app at the end of the session feeling better than you did when you opened it, because you had deepened friendships, met new people and learned.</p>
      <p>· &nbsp; · &nbsp; ·</p>
      <p>Unlike our other attempts, Clubhouse seemed to strike a real chord with people, and it has accelerated quickly over the past ten months—from a small handful of beta testers into a diverse and growing network of communities. This past week, two million people around the world—musicians, scientists, creators, athletes, comedians, parents, entrepreneurs, stock traders, non-profit leaders, authors, artists, real estate agents, sports fans and more—came to Clubhouse to talk, learn, laugh, be entertained, meet and connect. It’s the most exciting thing we’ve ever been a part of.</p>
      <p>The thing we love most is how voice can bring people together. No matter where you live in the world or what networks you have access to, in Clubhouse you can be in the room—often with people whose lived experience has been very different from your own. In one of the most turbulent and troubled years many of us have experienced, people on Clubhouse have come together for important and nuanced conversations on topics of social justice reform, BLM and anti-racism. When Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, room after room filled the hallways with people discussing constitutional law, sharing stories about RBG’s childhood, and praying in silence together. Each week, parents of children with genetic diseases gather in Clubhouse to discuss medical developments with doctors, researchers and other parents—talking, debating and learning.</p>
      <p>We’ve also been blown away by the brilliance and creativity of the Clubhouse community. Each night in Clubhouse, there are now thousands of rooms filled with people hosting game shows, recapping NBA games, singing opera, discussing philosophy, meeting other musicians, sharing travel tips, running support groups, and meditating together. They’re hosting daily talk shows, performing standup comedy, playing guitar and giving history lectures. In December, forty strangers who met on Clubhouse auditioned, rehearsed, and hosted a full-blown musical production for thousands of people that made national headlines. They are creating entirely new ways for people to come together, all through the power of voice.</p>
      <p>· &nbsp; · &nbsp; ·</p>
      <p>Our focus now is on opening up Clubhouse to the whole world. With that goal in mind for 2021, we have secured a new round in funding, led by Andrew Chen at a16z, who also led our Series A. It’s always been important to us to have investors who care deeply about diversity, and who will work hard to help us make Clubhouse a welcoming and inclusive community. We now have over 180 investors in Clubhouse—large and small, spanning many different races, genders, and areas of expertise, and including many members of our early community. While we’ve never felt that fundraising itself is a milestone, we wanted to share how we plan to use these funds to make the product better each day and to help creators on Clubhouse thrive:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Welcoming more amazing people 🎉</strong> &nbsp; From the earliest days, we’ve wanted to build Clubhouse for everyone. With this in mind, we are thrilled to begin work on our Android app soon, and to add more accessibility and localization features so that people all over the world can experience Clubhouse in a way that feels native to them.</li>
          <li><strong>Keeping the servers up 👩🏽‍💻</strong> &nbsp; We’ve grown faster than expected over the past few months, causing too many people to see red error messages when our servers are struggling. A large portion of the new funding round will go to technology and infrastructure to scale the Clubhouse experience for everyone, so that it’s always fast and performant, regardless of how many people are joining.</li>
          <li><strong>Ensuring you get fast support ⚡️</strong> &nbsp; User safety has always been a top priority for us, and as we welcome more people, it will remain one. This means scaling up our Trust &amp; Safety and Support teams as we grow, continuing to invest in advanced tools to detect and prevent abuse, and increasing the features and training resources available to moderators. We’ll also be aggressively growing our support team so that everyone’s clubs can get same-day approval. :)</li>
          <li><strong>Improving ranking and discovery 🌍</strong> &nbsp; As we’ve grown, the number of conversations happening on Clubhouse has skyrocketed, and it’s our job to help you find the right ones each time you open the app. With this new round of funding we’ll be investing heavily in discovery so that we can show you people, clubs, and rooms that are perfectly tailored to your interests—and help you discover new rooms you never would have thought to look for.</li>
          <li><strong>Investing in creators 👨🏽‍🎤</strong> &nbsp; Creators are the lifeblood of Clubhouse, and we want to make sure that all of the amazing people who host conversations for others are getting recognized for their contributions. Over the next few months, we plan to launch our first tests to allow creators to get paid directly—through features like tipping, tickets or subscriptions. We will also be using a portion of the new funding round to roll out a Creator Grant Program to support emerging Clubhouse creators.</li>
        </ul>
      
      <p>We know we have said this before, but we are so incredibly grateful to everyone who has joined Clubhouse, given us their feedback during Town Halls, shared their stories, and been part of the journey so far. We built Clubhouse to be a blank canvas filled with amazing people, and it is nothing without the incredible people who fill the rooms each day.</p>
      <p>We’re working hard to scale Clubhouse as fast as we can and open it up to everyone soon. In the meantime, anyone can join with an invite from an existing user, or sign up for the <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/">waitlist</a> so we can welcome you in soon. We are also <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/joinclubhouse" target="_blank">hiring in all areas</a>, so if you are excited about our mission, we would love to talk with you.</p>
      <p>Thank you again. It means so much to us to be able to build this product for you, and we’re so excited for this next chapter.</p>
      <p>- Paul, Rohan and the Clubhouse team</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few months ago, I received an email from Revolut (a British fintech company) in which they proudly unveiled their new logo. Previously, Revolut had a distinct and instantly recognizable logo. They replaced it with… something I was sure I had seen before.</p><figure id="w-node-3786e8b28af7-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51cf030355219306e8edf_revolout-logo-old-new.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The previous Revolut logo had a unique font, a recognizable color gradient, and it was slanted. If you were to put 100 financial or tech companies’ logos next to each other, the old logo would be easy to find at a glance.</p><p>If you put the new one in the same 100 logos pile, it would drown in the sea of sameness.</p><h2>Sans serif invasion</h2><p>There is a trend in logo design that started around 2017-2018. It’s as if many companies decided that being unique was a handicap and that it was better to be like everyone else. Or at least, that’s how it feels to me.</p><p>The trend started with fashion logos. Many iconic fashion companies ditched their recognizable logos and switched to a bland and very similar version of a sans serif font.</p><p>The technology sector followed soon after.</p><figure id="w-node-519323ea72d8-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51d96d2b8eae559c71d90_tech-fashion-logos-sans-serif.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>All the quirks, peculiarities, and idiosyncrasies of both tech and fashion logos were dropped and replaced with a simple sans serif font.</p><p>It looked like two huge industries decided to use the services of one designer, and not a particularly inventive one at that.</p><p>The tech industry is in slightly better shape because they didn’t go all in, and at least they kept the colors. With the colors, there’s at least <em>some </em>variability:</p><figure id="w-node-1efc3a7d060a-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51dc4daea171c45c758db_tech-logos-color.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Variability in new fashion logos, in full color:</p><figure id="w-node-b31dea70a84e-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51dd2ab19486dcee8bcea_fashion-logos-color.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Serif and sans serif—what’s the difference?</h3><p>First, what’s the difference between serif and sans serif fonts?</p><figure id="w-node-7e6a894d6cf3-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51e06556217fb8d809964_serif-sans-serif.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The small features on the ends of strokes in some fonts are known as ‘serifs’.</p><p>Fonts without those small features are called ‘sans serif’ (<em>‘sans’</em> means <em>‘without’</em> in French).</p><p>Sans serifs are missing a few of the typical anatomical features (serifs, spurs, swashes and other flourishes). Because of that, this typeface lacks the level of detail and design differentiation that serif typefaces can have.</p><p>While the simplicity of sans serif fonts makes them readable and versatile, it has its drawbacks. Without additional details and features, sans serif fonts have far fewer options for differentiation. While you can vary things like the height, weight, and slant, sans serif fonts simply have fewer features to work with than their more intricate fellow fonts.</p><p>This results in logos that look very similar. Gone are all the elaborate little details of the previous era.</p><p>When you add brands’ tendency to go black-and-white, you end up with a sea of logo sameness which is the opposite of what logos should be.</p><p>The purpose of a logo is to be instantly recognizable, different, memorable, and, if possible, to refer to the brand’s values. Blending into everyone else’s achieves none of these things.</p><h3>Sans serif history</h3><p>Sans serif lettering and fonts, first created in 1816, were popular for their clarity and legibility at a distance in advertising and display use when printed very large or small.</p><p>Because sans serif type was often used for headings and commercial printing, many early sans serif designs did not feature lowercase letters.</p><p>Simple sans serif capitals, without the use of lowercase, became very common in uses such as tombstones of the Victorian period in Britain.</p><p>Also, a significant reason for serif faces in the older days of imprecise letterpress and less consistent paper surface sizing was to compensate for ink spread and aberrations. Serifs on the fonts helped in cases where corners would otherwise fail to fully imprint.</p><h2>Possible reasons</h2><p>What are the possible reasons for this sans serif trend taking over? And why do hardly any of them matter?</p><h3>‘Modern utility’</h3><p>Branding specialists point to the practical benefits of what they call the ‘modern utility’ of sans serif typefaces. Cleaner and more legible, they are better suited to a variety of media and work particularly well online. The purity of these fonts allows the brands to be an empty vessel, ready to accommodate rapidly shifting trends.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> That may be true, but isn’t the whole value of a brand to <em>not</em> be an empty vessel? The big brands have worked decades for their identity and recognition, only to throw most of it away?</p><h3>Simplification</h3><p>Another reason cited by brand specialists is that it’s a natural step for brands to take as they grow from scrappy startups into established brands. The goals have shifted from making noise and standing out to being a trusted, dependable part of people’s everyday lives. That heartfelt personality and idiosyncrasy that defined a brand as they started out, and won over their early adopters, can be a limitation as they aim for broad appeal and bigger revenue.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> Simplification as a reason to blend in for broad appeal? I don’t buy it. Logos should be simple, yes, but they should be simple in a memorable way. Think more in terms of Nike swoosh (simple, memorable),&nbsp; and less in a one-size-fits-all sans serif font.</p><h3>Brands are more than logos now</h3><p>People at the head of these powerful brands know that they are not defined by their logo anymore but by the product or service they provide. They are strong thanks to what they allow <em>you</em> to do with them.</p><p>Before, logo designers would look for a ‘concept’ when designing a logo. That is not necessary anymore: <em>The brand is the concept</em>.</p><p>Their thinking goes that logos may look similar, but what they offer is completely different and effective, and that’s what ultimately counts for the consumer.</p><p>As some brands become words (or even better, verbs) in our daily language (to Google, to Uber, to Skype), they have a lesser need for a recognizable logo. Many of those brands now spend on designing custom typefaces instead of logos: a custom typeface becomes their recognizable voice on every platform or device.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> Some big brands may indeed have a lesser need for a very distinct logo but that doesn't mean that they should get rid of an important differentiator. You don’t see Nike replacing their swoosh logo with sans serif <strong>NIKE</strong> text. If you have something valuable that you <em>can</em> live without, it doesn’t mean that you <em>must</em>.</p><h3>Readability</h3><p>One of the main reasons for the sans serif logo trend is readability. Especially on mobile, but everywhere else as well: from huge billboards to tiny footer links at the bottom of mobile websites.</p><p>After all, that’s the very reason why sans serif fonts were invented: for better readability in advertising headlines.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> Readability is obviously important. Mobile too—it’s where everything happens nowadays. But this is becoming less of an issue with improvements in technologies like retina displays and 4k screens becoming popular.</p><figure id="w-node-38988d1753c7-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51e96e07b893538cbb00b_sans-serif-logos-on-iphone-11.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Here’s how a bunch of logos looks on my iPhone 11</figcaption></figure><p>If it’s easy to fit 30 decently looking logos on one-third of a phone screen, it should be trivial to make one logo, however quirky, look perfect on mobile.</p><p>Revolut seems to be torn here. They did replace the logo everywhere inside the app, but how does their new app icon look like?</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51ed3fd0200eeffdc690d_revolut-app-icon.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>What next?</h2><p>There’s nothing bad in wanting your logo to look simpler, better, mobile-ready, or universal enough to appeal to the broadest possible audience.</p><p>But don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p><p>Shoot for simplicity and legibility, but keep your distinguishing features. Don’t throw away what the brand has been working on for decades.</p><p>Otherwise, you may end up in a situation where you could slap any logo on any product and hardly anyone would notice a difference:</p><figure id="w-node-01df0773e426-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fbf32ea6160018ba6a9cb84_sans-serif-bags.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>One of these bags is real.</figcaption></figure></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>The “Fediverse” is a loose aggregation of federated servers that mainly speak the ActivityPub protocol. One of the most famous services in the Fediverse is “Mastodon.” We joined the Fediverse in the early days of Mastodon to share short-lived information that didn’t fit into a separate article on our website.</p><h2 id="the-issues-that-we-discussed-earlier-this-year">The issues that we discussed earlier this year</h2><p>In May, <a href="https://infosec-handbook.eu/news/2020-05-31-monthly-review/#fediverse">we reconsidered our presence in the Fediverse</a>. Back then, the main issues for us were:</p><ol><li>You can’t migrate your posts if you need to migrate to another Mastodon server.</li><li>You can’t update your posts without losing shares and comments.</li><li>All posts have a character limit, so we can’t say everything we want in a single post.</li><li>Many Fediverse users claim to be the “better and open-minded alternative to Twitter.” We think that this doesn’t reflect reality, as explained below.</li></ol><p>In June, we addressed issues 1 to 3 by introducing a “News” section on our website.</p><h2 id="further-issues-in-the-fediverse-and-other-social-networks">Further issues in the Fediverse and other social networks</h2><p>We also participated in discussions and tried to encourage dialogs in the Fediverse and other forums instead of only posting information. However, these discussions revealed consistent issues:</p><h3 id="the-toxic-us-vs-them-ideology">The toxic “us vs. them” ideology</h3><p>For some groups, it is vital to make a bogeyman out of opposing parties. In the Fediverse, some individuals and groups continuously spread misinformation about “the others” to gain likes and followers. While most of the toxic behavior targets the big tech companies in the USA, some individuals targetting us.</p><h3 id="the-reverse-burden-of-proof">The “reverse burden of proof”</h3><p>When discussing with others, we often encountered the “reverse burden of proof.” Somebody posts negative claims about a product or service. Instead of providing (technical) proof for the claim, the only supporting “fact” is, “everybody knows that this is true.” On the contrary, this person doesn’t accept any (technical) proof that debunks their initial claim. For us, it looks like you don’t need to provide any real facts as long as you satisfy the ideology of some people.</p><h3 id="the-i-read-headlines-only-problem">The “I read headlines only” problem</h3><p>Many people read the headlines of a post and then guess what is written in the remaining article. Such behavior results in misinterpreted information and persistent myths. On the other hand, it became a standard tool for some blogs to gain more readers: Writing, “Critical security vulnerability could leak all of your data” results in more clicks and shares than, “Company fixed potential security vulnerability months ago, which could have leaked some of your data if ever exploited.” This problem kills meaningful discussions instantly.</p><h3 id="the-security-and-privacy-by-assumption-problem">The “security and privacy by assumption” problem</h3><p>Most of you know “security by obscurity,” when security relies on keeping the implementation secret. We see another common issue: “security and privacy by assumption.” Many people share security and privacy tips without ever checking whether these tips work. They just assume that somebody else checked it before.</p><h3 id="and-finally-comparing-apples-to-oranges">And finally, “comparing apples to oranges”</h3><p>For instance, some people claim the Signal messenger became insecure after introducing the Signal PIN because a server-side attacker could now access your data. The base for this claim is the assumption that a server-side party extracts encrypted information from the volatile main memory of a server, exploits an unpatched security vulnerability in Intel CPUs to extract a key, and successfully guesses a user-provided password.</p><p>While the attack looks anything but trivial as these people describe it, they then argue that their favorite messenger is far more secure due to being decentralized. They compare the encryption mechanism of instant messenger A with something else. Suppose you look at the same feature of their favorite messenger. In that case, you see that their messenger doesn’t offer any server-side protection. In their case, a server-side party can directly access your data in cleartext—this is trivial.</p><h3 id="im-privacy-friendly-please-donate">“I’m privacy-friendly; please donate”</h3><p>The issues mentioned above are also prevalent on other social networks like Twitter. Just like on Twitter, you see “privacy-friendly” companies trying to gain more paying customers or some bloggers heavily involved in influencer marketing. While most of them claim that this is for a “good cause,” it is ultimately all about money.</p><h3 id="decentralization-still-isnt-a-privacy-feature">Decentralization still isn’t a privacy feature</h3><p>Now, some people may insist that at least security and privacy are far better “due to the decentralized nature” of the Fediverse. As we wrote several times before, “decentralization” isn’t a privacy feature.</p><p>Search engines like Google can discover and index all of your public posts in the Fediverse. By default, you can see the social graphs of all accounts, as followers are public. Especially Mastodon servers come with privacy policies that don’t meet the European GDPR requirements. Many (Mastodon) servers seem to run an outdated version, indicating inadequate security practices.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Should you become part of the Fediverse by creating an account? It isn’t up to us to decide this, of course.</p><p>If you only want to read the content of others, we recommend subscribing to their RSS feeds. Your RSS subscriptions are private and more decentralized than any Fediverse account. And you need to manage one account less on the internet.</p><p>If you want to be an active part of the Fediverse, be prepared for the same problems as on any other social network. We decided to leave the Fediverse for now.</p><h2>Read also</h2><ul><li><a href="https://infosec-handbook.eu/news/2020-12-20-contact-and-feed/">On contacting us, and subscribing to our RSS feed</a></li><li><a href="https://infosec-handbook.eu/news/2020-11-08-rss-update/">Update of our RSS/Atom feed</a></li><li><a href="https://infosec-handbook.eu/news/2020-08-02-tls-insights/">TLS usage of InfoSec Handbook readers</a></li><li><a href="https://infosec-handbook.eu/news/2020-08-01-introducing-the-news-section/">Introducing the 'News' section</a></li></ul></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>MONTREAL -- 
	A team of researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute believe they have found an effective weapon against COVID-19: colchicine, an oral tablet already known and used for other diseases.</p>
<p>
	For Dr. Jean-Claude Tardif, who led the study, this is a "major scientific discovery," he said. Colchicine is the first "effective oral drug to treat out-of-hospital patients."</p>
<p>
	"To be able to offer this, from Quebec, and for the planet, we are very happy," said Tardif.</p>
<p>
	<a href="https://www.colcorona.net/" target="_blank">The ColCorona study</a> involved 4,159 patients whose diagnosis of COVID-19 had been confirmed by a nasopharyngeal test (PCR).</p>

<p>
	Analysis of the study found that colchicine resulted in reductions in hospitalizations by 25 per cent, the need for mechanical ventilation by 50 per cent, and deaths by 44 per cent.</p>
<p>
	"This is the first hope for patients who have COVID, who are worried and who hope that they will not have complications," said Tardif. Previously, "there were no tablets that could be taken by mouth and reduce the risks."</p>
<p>
	Tardif said he believes that prescribing the drug could help reduce congestion in hospitals quickly and reduce health-care costs in Quebec and elsewhere.</p>
<p>
	"Our study showed the effectiveness of treatment using colchicine to prevent the phenomenon of the major inflammatory storm and reduce complications related to COVID-19," he said.</p>
<p>
	As colchicine is a well-understood drug, it could be used very quickly to treat people with COVID-19, the researcher says.</p>
<p>
	"Colchicine is old as it is -- we've been treating gout with it for hundreds of years -- so it's available in pharmacies," Tardif said, speaking in French.</p>
<p>
	"So any doctor, tomorrow, who reads this can definitely decide to prescribe if he wants."</p>
<p>
	On Friday evening, Quebec Premier Francois Legault called the study "big news" on social networks.</p>
<p>
	In the spring, Legault said the Colcorona study was one of the largest studies in the world researching ways to fight the virus.</p>
<p>
	The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was deployed in Canada, the United States, Europe, South America and South Africa.</p>
<p>
	"It was a double-blind study, meaning neither the patient, nor the team that ran the study, including me, knew whether the patient was taking the placebo or the drug," explained Tardif.</p>
<p>
	"There was just one group, independent from us, which was aware."</p>
<p>
	He said the team is "very proud of the work accomplished -- it is a clinically convincing result," adding that he assembled a spectacular team from all over Quebec including microbiologists, intensive care specialists, statisticians, computer scientists and epidemiologists.</p>
<p>
	The Centre de Coordination des Essais Cliniques de Montréal (MHICC) of the Montreal Heart Institute coordinated the study.</p>
<p>
	<em>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 23, 2021.</em></p>

As January 6 unfolded on Capitol Hill, there was a rapid shift in language, from “<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gop-senators-reverse-objections-electoral-college-certification-protesters/story?id=75099780" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>protesters</span></a>,” “<a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2021/0112/How-a-mob-stormed-the-Capitol-and-how-to-stop-another-assault" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>supporters</span></a>,” and “<a href="https://theconversation.com/nonprofits-helped-organize-the-pro-trump-rally-before-the-capitol-siege-but-they-probably-wont-suffer-any-consequences-153271" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>rally</span></a>” to “<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress-combat-veteran-military-experience" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>siege</span></a>,” “<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/ex-firefighter-robert-sanford-arrested-for-allegedly-hurling-fire-extinguisher-at-cops-during-capitol-riots" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>rioters</span></a>,” and “<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/08/1015929/archive-capitol-insurrection-trump-maga-footage/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>insurrection</span></a>.” These choices — on the day of the attack and in its aftermath — matched the descent of a seemingly peaceful protest into a violent and dangerous attack on the seat of the U.S. federal government.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Using 5,057 article titles about the Capitol Riot from 398 sources across the political spectrum, The Factual examined how the events and aftermath of January 6 are most commonly described in U.S. and global media. This includes the differences in language between left- and right-leaning publications, as well as how the terminology used compares to <a href="https://blog.thefactual.com/protest-riot-headlines-george-floyd" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>our analysis</span></a> of coverage of the George Floyd protests this summer.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Note: An article’s title is not always a perfect representation of its content, but titles matter deeply in shaping readers’ perceptions of what media outlets are writing, whether there are contrasting views between political parties, and whether/how an event matters — especially in the social media era.</em></p>
<h4><strong>The Words Used to Describe January 6</strong></h4>
<p>The U.S. media ecosystem includes hundreds of outlets, reflecting the myriad ideologies, political alignments, and niche areas of interest that motivate the American populace. They help define the core issues that drive American political and social discourse, and the words they use are central to how Americans understand current events. It should be no surprise, then, that the ways the media talks about the events of January 6 are key to building a consensus about what happened and unpacking how such an event may impact the U.S. going forward.</p>
<p>While there are some clear differences in the way the left and right talk about the Capitol Riot, instances of agreement are a good place to start. For example, there seems to be broad consensus that January 6 constituted a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/capitol-police-intelligence-report-before-capitol-breach-warned-congress-itself-could-be-targeted" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>riot</span></a>, not something less intense like a <a href="https://theprint.in/world/terrorism-or-protest-how-the-us-media-saw-the-siege-of-the-capitol/582443/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>protest</span></a> or something more intense like a <a href="https://theconversation.com/was-it-a-coup-no-but-siege-on-us-capitol-was-the-election-violence-of-a-fragile-democracy-152803" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>coup</span></a>. Around 40% of article titles from both left-leaning (41.3%) and right-leaning (38.2%) outlets in our sample used the term “riot.” While the term “protest” was twice as likely to appear in titles from the right, the term appeared in just 5.5% of all articles, demonstrating that the term was inadequate to capture the day’s events. Meanwhile, “rally,” the purported nature of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stop-the-steal-organizer-gop-members-helped-him-plan-rally-2021-1" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>pro-Trump gatherings</span></a> prior to the riot, appeared in just 1.2% of titles.</p>

<p>Other words were used with roughly similar frequency regardless of the publisher’s political bias. Reporting from across the political spectrum mentions “violent” or “violence,” “siege,” and “police” about the same amount, reflecting at least a partial shared understanding of the lengthy clashes between police and the numerous rioters. Further, just 16 of the 5,057 article titles included the word “peaceful.”</p>

<p>A third of article titles on the left (33%) and a quarter of those on the right (26%) mention Trump, highlighting a shared understanding of his proximity to the events of January 6. However, there are some clear differences in usage. While many of the article titles from the right are <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/donald-trump-pressure-condemn-violence-capitol-twitter-rage" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>ambiguous</span></a> about Trump’s role, articles from the left directly accentuate his <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-55574780" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>connection</span></a> to the riot, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/us/politics/trump-video-capitol-riot.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>slow condemnation</span></a> of the violence, and <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/01/trump-capitol-attack-impeachment-evidence-insurrection.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>culpability</span></a> in the aftermath.<img src="https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png?width=403&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-01-23 at 6.34.26 PM" width="403" srcset="https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png?width=202&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png 202w, https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png?width=403&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png 403w, https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png?width=605&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png 605w, https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png?width=806&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png 806w, https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png?width=1008&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png 1008w, https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png?width=1209&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png 1209w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px"></p>
<div><p>Language also varied when discussing the behavior of the rioters. Article titles on the left were more likely to mention “mob,” “attack,” and “insurrection,” zeroing in on how pro-Trump supporters engaged in <a href="https://www.axios.com/mob-violence-trump-republicans-condemn-d508f105-aa77-435f-bd81-f4e74b011694.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>violent action</span></a> against DC Capitol Police and invaded the Capitol building.</p><p><img src="https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png?width=409&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-01-23 at 6.34.33 PM" width="409" srcset="https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png?width=205&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png 205w, https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png?width=409&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png 409w, https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png?width=614&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png 614w, https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png?width=818&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png 818w, https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png?width=1023&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png 1023w, https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png?width=1227&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png 1227w" sizes="(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px"></p></div>
<div><p>Overall, these differences in terminology reflect the political landscape in the aftermath of January 6 in two ways: (1) a central consensus clearly labels the event as a riot and shares some broad interpretations of the day’s events, and (2) on average, left-leaning interpretations accentuate the violent, seditious nature of events while right-leaning publications take a softer tone.</p></div>
<h4><strong>How These Words Compare to the George Floyd Protests</strong></h4>
<p>Just as many saw fundamentally different responses to the George Floyd protests and the Capitol Riot, The Factual’s data reveals a few differences in the way these events were described in the media. (This analysis uses an <a href="https://blog.thefactual.com/protest-riot-headlines-george-floyd" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>earlier study</span></a> we conducted based on a similarly sized dataset of 4,958 article titles from the 10 days following George Floyd’s killing.)</p>
<p>Most prominently, the George Floyd protests were far more likely to be described using the word “protest” (44.9%) and far less likely to involve “riot” (2.9%) than the Capitol Riot. The events on Capitol Hill were 10 times as likely to be described as an “attack,” while the George Floyd protests were 5 times more likely to be described as “peaceful.” This makes intuitive sense since the George Floyd protests encompass hundreds of separate events and were <a href="https://time.com/5886348/report-peaceful-protests/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>93% peaceful</span></a>. The Capitol Riot, on the other hand, refers specifically to a single event where numerous <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/injured-police-officers-were-evacuated-from-capitol-hill-protests-2021-1" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>violent incidents</span></a> took place. Importantly, however, this highlights that efforts to equate the Capitol Riot with the George Floyd protests — for whatever purpose — are of <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/false-equivalency-black-lives-matter-capitol-siege-experts/story?id=75251279" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>limited use</span></a>.</p>

<p>There is also generally more agreement between left- and right-leaning outlets about what terminology to use to describe the Capitol Riot. <a href="https://blog.thefactual.com/protest-riot-headlines-george-floyd" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Our analysis</span></a> of coverage of the George Floyd protests showed larger divergences between left and right, for example, in terms of usage of “protest” or “riot”:</p>
<p>[A]rticles from outlets on the right featured “riot,” “riots,” or “rioting” in 12.9% of all article titles, while only 2.6% of article titles on the left featured those terms. Similarly, article titles on the right were twice as likely (8.1%) to use some variation of the word “loot” than the left (3.8%). Conversely, articles on the left were 10% more likely (43.7%) to feature a variation of the term “protest” than those on the right (33.8%), and 7.8% of articles on the left featured the term “non-violent,” which didn’t appear in any article titles on the right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though Trump played a prominent role during the George Floyd protests, particularly relating to his use of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/us/politics/trump-walk-lafayette-square.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>federal forces</span></a> like the National Guard, he was in retrospect a secondary player in the national upheaval over institutional racism and police brutality; he was mentioned in 9.4% of article titles from that period. By contrast, he was three times as likely to be mentioned in titles related to the Capitol Riot (31.1%). Conversely, the police were mentioned repeatedly during the George Floyd protests (40.5%), unsurprising given their centrality to the upheaval, but were mentioned with less frequency in relation to the Capitol Riot. Despite their varied interactions both <a href="https://reason.com/2021/01/07/capitol-police-failed-to-contain-a-riot-then-killed-a-woman-in-the-chaos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fighting</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/capitol-police-chief-several-officers-suspended-siege" rel="noopener" target="_blank">assisting</a> the rioters, “police” only appeared in 10.9% of all articles related to the events in DC.&nbsp;</p>

<div><p>A further way media coverage has differed is through the words that fail to appear in coverage of the events on Capitol Hill. For example, instances of looting during this summer’s protests were used by some to try to delegitimize the entire Black Lives Matter movement. In our sample about the George Floyd protests, “looting” — to "steal goods from (a place), typically during a war or riot"<span>&nbsp;—</span> was mentioned in 3.4% of article titles, slightly more than the 2.9% of articles that mentioned “riot.” By contrast, though 39.1% of article titles about January 6 included the word “riot” and even as assailants broke into the Capitol building, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackbrewster/2021/01/08/clyburns-ipad-laptop-from-pelosis-office-items-stolen-destroyed-in-capitol-attack/?sh=37d9d46d5963" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>stole government property</span></a>, and evidence was <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/jan/9/horned-man-west-va-lawmaker-man-holding-pelosis-le/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>widely published</span></a> of them doing so, there wasn’t a single mention of “looting” in the 5,057 article titles in our sample.&nbsp;</p></div>

<h4><strong>How Far Apart</strong></h4>
<p>Regardless of the words one uses to describe the political division in the U.S., it is apparent that there is some distance between the left and right on the future of the country, the optimal direction for policy, and especially how to think about the last four years. However, the words used to describe the Capitol Riot suggest more unity than one might expect, at least in terms of the media’s portrayal of what will likely be the most memorable day of the Trump administration. Media coverage from across the political spectrum is certainly in greater agreement about the character of events in DC than it was about the George Floyd protests this summer. If the desire is to rein in partisan division, coming to a set of common terms to describe the events of January 6 is a good start.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve been working with React since 2016 and still there isn’t a single best practice when it comes to application structure and design.</p>
<p>While there are best practices on the micro level, most teams build their own “thing” when it comes to architecture.</p>
<p>Of course, there isn’t a universal best practice that can be applied to all businesses and applications. But there are some general rules that we can follow to build a productive codebase.</p>
<p>The purpose of a software’s architecture and design is to keep it productive and flexible. Developers need to work on it effectively and modify it without rewriting its core.</p>
<p>This article is a collection of principles and rules that have proven to be effective for me and the teams I’ve worked with.</p>
<p>I outline good practices about components, application structure, testing, styling, state management and data fetching. Some of the examples are oversimplified so we can focus on the principle not on the implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Take everything here as an opinion</strong>, not an absolute. There’s more than one way to build software.</p>

<p>Favor functional components - they have a simpler syntax. No lifecycle methods, constructors or boilerplate. You can express the same logic with less characters without losing readability.</p>
<p>Unless you need an error boundary they should be your go-to approach. The mental model you need to keep in your head is a lot smaller.</p>

<h3 id="write-consistent-components">Write Consistent Components <a href="#write-consistent-components">#</a></h3>
<p>Stick to the same style for your components. Put helper functions in the same place, export the same way and follow the same naming patterns.</p>
<p>There isn’t a real benefit of one approach over the other</p>
<p>No matter if you’re exporting at the bottom of the file or directly in the definition of the component, pick one and stick to it.</p>
<h3 id="name-components">Name Components <a href="#name-components">#</a></h3>
<p>Always name your components. It helps when you’re reading an error stack trace and using the React Dev Tools.</p>
<p>It’s also easier to find where you are when developing if the component’s name is inside the file.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code>
<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>form</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>...</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>form</span><span>&gt;</span></span>


<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>function</span> <span>Form</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>form</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>...</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>form</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="organize-helper-functions">Organize Helper Functions <a href="#organize-helper-functions">#</a></h3>
<p>Helper functions that don’t need to hold a closure over the components should be moved outside. The ideal place is before the component definition so the file can be readable from top to bottom.</p>
<p>That reduces the noise in the component and leaves inside only those that need to be there.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code>
<span>function</span> <span>Component</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> date <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>function</span> <span>parseDate</span><span>(</span><span>rawDate</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>


<span>function</span> <span>parseDate</span><span>(</span><span>date</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>function</span> <span>Component</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> date <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Date is </span><span>{</span><span>parseDate</span><span>(</span>date<span>)</span><span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You want to keep the least amount of helper functions inside the definition. Move as many as possible outside and pass the values from state as arguments.</p>
<p>Composing your logic out of pure functions that rely only on input makes it easier to track bugs and extend.</p>

<h3 id="component-length">Component Length <a href="#component-length">#</a></h3>
<p>A React component is just a function that gets props and returns markup. They adhere to the same software design principles.</p>
<p>If a function is doing too many things, extract some of the logic and call another function. It’s the same with components - if you have too much functionality, split it in smaller components and call them instead.</p>
<p>If a part of the markup is complex, requires loops and conditionals - extract it.</p>
<p>Rely on props and callbacks for communication and data. Lines of code are not an objective measure. Think about responsibilities and abstractions instead.</p>

<p>when something needs more clarity open a code block and give additional information. The markup is a part of the logic so when you feel that something needs more clarity - provide it.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>Component</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span>{</span><span>}</span><span>
      </span><span>{</span>user<span>.</span>subscribed <span>?</span> <span>null</span> <span>:</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>SubscriptionPlans</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>}</span><span>

  <span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="use-error-boundaries">Use Error Boundaries <a href="#use-error-boundaries">#</a></h3>
<p>An error in one component shouldn’t bring down the entire UI. There are rare cases in which we want to take down the whole page or redirect if a critical error happens. Most of the times we’d be fine if we just hide a specific element from the screen.</p>
<p>In a function that deals with data you may have multiple try/catch statements. Put error boundaries to use not just on the top level. Wrap elements on the screen that can exist separately to avoid cascading failures.</p>

<h3 id="destructure-props">Destructure Props <a href="#destructure-props">#</a></h3>
<p>Most React components are just functions. They get props and return markup. In a normal function you use the arguments it is passed directly, so it makes sense to apply the same principle here. No need to repeat <code>props</code> everywhere.</p>
<p>A reason not to destructure the props would be to distinguish what is external and what is internal state. But in a regular function there is no distinction between arguments and variables. Don’t create unnecessary patterns.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code>
<span>function</span> <span>Input</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>input</span> <span>value</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>props<span>.</span>value<span>}</span></span> <span>onChange</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>props<span>.</span>onChange<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>
<span>}</span>


<span>function</span> <span>Component</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> value<span>,</span> onChange <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>state<span>,</span> setState<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>''</span><span>)</span>

  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>...</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="number-of-props">Number of Props <a href="#number-of-props">#</a></h3>
<p>The question of how many props should a component receive is a subjective one. The number of props that a component has is correlated to how much it’s doing. The more props you pass to it the more responsibilities it has.</p>
<p>A high number of props is a signal that a component is doing too much.</p>
<p>If I go above 5 props I consider whether this component should be split. In some cases, it may just need a lot of data. An input field, for example, may have a lot of props. In others it’s a sign that something needs to be extracted.</p>
<p>Note: The more props a component takes, the more reasons to rerender.</p>
<h3 id="objects-instead-of-primitives">Pass Objects Instead of Primitives <a href="#objects-instead-of-primitives">#</a></h3>
<p>One way to limit the amount of props is to pass an object instead of primitive values. Rather than passing down the user name, email and settings one by one you can group them together. This also …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While there may be subtle improvement in <a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/tesla">Tesla</a>’s Full Self-Driving Beta since its first iteration was launched back in October, <a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/waymo">Waymo</a> CEO, John Krafcik, seems to have an impression that there is a limit for Tesla’s current autonomous driving efforts. In an interview with the German business publication <a href="https://www.manager-magazin.de/consent-a-?targetUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manager-magazin.de%2Funternehmen%2Fautoindustrie%2Fwaymo-john-krafcik-ueber-den-vorsprung-des-google-roboterautos-a-00000000-0002-0001-0000-000174925837" target="_blank" rel="noopener">manager magazin</a>, Krafcik had said that the electric car maker is never a competitor to Waymo, seeing Tesla’s tech as just a “really good driver assistance system.”</p>
<p>Waymo’s vehicles, equipped with a different kinds of sensors including LiDAR, are built to be operated to be driverless.</p>
<p>Waymo has even asked its users not to touch its autonomous cars’ steering wheel while the cars are in operation.</p>
<p>In contrast, Tesla’s Full Self-Driving Beta, and also the company’s tech Navigate on Autopilot, still need human touch as drivers still need to keep their hands on the steering wheel in preparation for manual involvement.</p>

<p>Tesla’s aim, which is to design a full self-driving suite via a vision-based system that depends on incremental improvements, will be rolled out over time.</p>
<p>Through steady updates which are developed on real-world driving data collected and gathered from its fleet, Tesla is hoping to roll out a version of its FSD suite which will totally be a hands-off system.</p>
<p>Once Tesla achieves this, the Electric Vehicle(<a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/ev">EV</a>) maker aims to starts its own ride-hailing service, dubbed by Elon Musk as the Robotaxi Network.</p>

<p>According to the John Krafcik, this is a misconception. He also observed that between Tesla’s camera-based approach and Waymo’s more robust sensor suite, his company’s sensors is of better advantage over Tesla’s electric cars.</p>
<p>“It’s a misconception that you can just keep developing a driver assistance system till a day you can miraculously leap to a fully autonomous driving system. In terms of robustness and accuracy, take an example, our sensors are orders of magnitude better than what is seen on the road from other manufacturers,” said Krafcik.</p>
<p>One of the noted criticism against Waymo’s autonomous vehicles is their high cost, especially when considering their sensor suite which includes expensive components.</p>
<p>However, the CEO, noted that the cost of its cars are really overestimated, most especially as the price of some sensors such as LiDAR has clearly gone down over the years. Today, Krafcik believes that the cost of a Waymo car is actually on the same range as a moderately-equipped Mercedes-Benz S-Class.</p>
<p>John Krafcik also noted that he is expecting the cost of hardware per mile of Waymo’s autonomous cars to come in at about $0.30/mile before maintenance and service costs, this includes fleet technicians and customer support <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johanmoreno/2021/01/22/waymo-ceo-says-tesla-is-not-a-competitor-gives-estimated-cost-of-autonomous-vehicles/?sh=2b3325e4541b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">services</a>.</p>
<p>Today, comparing this to ride-hailing services, such as Uber and Lyft, who are operating at about $2-$3/mile.</p>
<p>Tesla, however, on the other hand, aims at achieving an $0.18/mile operating cost for its Robotaxi Network.</p>

<p>Sci-Hub is&nbsp;since 2011&nbsp;the world´s most celebrated – and despised – «shadow library», performing&nbsp;«pirate style»&nbsp;copying and republishing&nbsp;for free of subscription based&nbsp;academic articles.&nbsp;The initiator, Alexandra Elbakyan&nbsp;(32)&nbsp;of Kazakhstan,&nbsp;has given&nbsp;a number of interviews but&nbsp;here Finnish library activist and philosopher&nbsp;Mikael Böök&nbsp;in an e-mail interview&nbsp;asks&nbsp;his own&nbsp;specific and&nbsp;very&nbsp;current&nbsp;questions.&nbsp;Just now she´s in the news with a lawsuit against her&nbsp;by&nbsp;Elsevier, Wiley&nbsp;etc.&nbsp;We also get her opinions on Plan S, on joining IFLA and on her alleged&nbsp;Russian&nbsp;communist espionage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&gt;&gt; <a href="https://bibliotekettarsaka.com/english-version/">About this blog</a></p>



<p>First Mikael explains his idea and approach for&nbsp;his&nbsp;interview:</p>



<p>It was not possible for me to meet up «physically» with Alexandra Elbakyan for this interview. Nor was it absolutely necessary. Having found her contact details on the Net, I asked her, at the beginning of December 2020, if she was willing to dialog with me about e-books, libraries and so called «shadow libraries». I told her that I had just finished a general essay (here [<a href="http://www.kaapeli.fi/book/#English"><u>http://www.kaapeli.fi/book/#English</u></a>]) on e-books in public libraries, and in the Z-Library, which is a so called «shadow library»; now I needed to consult her for another essay on the question of open access to scientific literature and Sci-Hub. Alexandra accepted to start an exchange of views with me, whereupon I formulated a first set of questions for her. She made clear that it would take some time for her to answer them. Waiting for her answers, I spent hours on the web, and reading books, trying to deepen my knowledge about the situation of the open access movement in general, and Sci-Hub in particular. This process led to the questions and answers which are published below.</p>



<p>– <em>Would you like to tell a little about yourself and your background so that people who become interested can then go, for instance, to your blog Engineuring.wordpress.com to find out more?</em></p>



<p>– I’m from Kazakhstan, and I was born in&nbsp;an&nbsp;engineering family. My grandmother was an engineering surveyor and mother a computer&nbsp;programming engineer. So I started creating websites when I was 12 years old and wrote my first computer program in Delphi language when I was 14. Back then a game named Tamagotchi was popular, it is a virtual pet that you can feed, groom and it grows. I was trying to program a Tamagotchi with artificial intelligence inside, so it will also behave as a real animal. I became gradually interested in how cognition works, so I collected a lot of e-books about neuroscience, artificial neural networks and so on. At the university I got interested in&nbsp;the&nbsp;technology of Brain-Machine Interfaces, that can connect your brain to&nbsp;a computer&nbsp;directly. So I started thinking how we can merge our consciousness into&nbsp;a computer&nbsp;using such technologies.</p>

<p>After graduating from Kazakh National Tech University&nbsp;in 2009, I applied to a PhD program in&nbsp;the United&nbsp;States to study bioengineering and such technologies, but was not accepted.&nbsp;So I remained in Kazakhstan and started working as a computer programmer.</p>



<p>I also participated in online forums for scientists. Here I learned that many researchers had a problem with access to academic journals and books, because it was very expensive. So I used my programming skills to create a Sci-Hub web application. Using that application any person can read expensive academic literature absolutely for free! The program immediately became very popular among Russian researchers and then, in the whole world. Today more than 500,000 researchers and students of science use Sci-Hub every day to get access to academic journals.</p>



<p>– <em>In your blog you write that Sci-Hub resembles a so called web scraper. Grateful if you can open the meaning of this technical term a little. And can you then outline the history of Sci-Hub and illustrate how it is being used as a webservice? For instance, it is known that over the years, there has been a certain division of labour between Sci-Hub and Library Genesis (Libgen). What do Sci-Hub and Library Genesis have in common? How do they differ?</em></p>



<p>– Sci-Hub in its essence is a web scraper: A program that downloads web pages from the Internet, processes them, extracts information from these web pages, and saves some information in the database. We have those paid websites with academic journals that many researchers are unable to afford. So what Sci-Hub does in its core, it downloads information from these paid websites, and then provides this information for free to the users.</p>



<p>So how exactly&nbsp;does&nbsp;Sci-Hub download information from paid websites? Some universities are subscribed to these websites. So when you open such&nbsp;a&nbsp;website from the university, it will provide all information for free. Next, all universities provide&nbsp;<em>proxy servers</em>. Using such&nbsp;a&nbsp;proxy server a student or a professor can open these websites&nbsp;<em>as if</em>they open&nbsp;it&nbsp;from&nbsp;the&nbsp;university, while being at home. See? Sci-Hub collects many passwords from students and professors. Then it uses proxy servers to access the websites&nbsp;<em>as if</em>&nbsp;they are accessed from universities that have subscriptions.&nbsp;Using a proxy to access the website, Sci-Hub web scraper downloads paid academic journals and provides them to its users for free.</p>

<p>That is the core of Sci-Hub: a&nbsp;web scraper<em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>working through&nbsp;password-protected&nbsp;<em>proxy servers</em>.</p>



<p>There is a widespread&nbsp;<em>lie</em>&nbsp;that Sci-Hub is a search engine while in fact it never had any search function at all.&nbsp;What&nbsp;a&nbsp;search engine such as Google does,&nbsp;is&nbsp;it gets a bunch of keywords from users, then it surveys web pages on the Internet, looking for such keywords. If some web page contains such keywords, it is displayed to the user. There is no similarities to Sci-Hub.&nbsp;Yes, search engines also&nbsp;contain&nbsp;web scrapers to download web pages from the whole Internet. Then they extract keywords from these web pages and store them in database. When&nbsp;a&nbsp;user is looking for some keyword,&nbsp;a&nbsp;search engine checks&nbsp;its database for matching&nbsp;web pages.&nbsp;And sometimes you can look up for free versions of academic journals using&nbsp;a&nbsp;search engine such as Google.&nbsp;But that is&nbsp;very&nbsp;different from what Sci-Hub does.</p>



<p>Library Genesis is another website that is different from Sci-Hub. Basically it is a huge database that stores millions of academic ebooks. It exists, as far as I know, from 2007 or 2008, and contains also a search engine to look up books in that database.</p>



<p>I created Sci-Hub to access academic journals in 2011 and after that&nbsp;Library Genesis had an idea to store academic journals in their database too, not only books.&nbsp;So they asked me if they&nbsp;could&nbsp;save research articles that Sci-Hub downloads in their database, and we started collaborating. At the beginning Sci-Hub worked without any database at all. Then it started using LibGen database to save the articles, so there will be no need to download them again every time they&nbsp;are&nbsp;requested.</p>



<p>Starting from 2014-2015 Sci-Hub has its own databases and it does not rely on LibGen, but still all new articles downloaded by Sci-Hub are uploaded to LibGen.</p>



<p>So the difference between Sci-Hub and LibGen is that Sci-Hub is primarily an article-download engine, while LibGen is a database without an integrated algorithm to download new articles.</p>



<p>– <em>Sci-Hub and Libgen are often mentioned among the so called ‘shadow libraries’ (in the Wikipedia, for instance, and in the 2018 book «Shadow Libraries» edited by Joe Karaganis.) Then there is yet another ‘shadow library’ which I myself stumbled upon and started to explorate even before I had heard about Libgen. I am surprised that almost nobody talks about the Z-Library. What do you know about that one? (I for one know practically nothing except that it is big, seemingly Moscow-based and maintained on a server in China.) By the way, is the epithet ‘shadow library’ an apt description of a service like Sci-Hub which gives the researchers ‘open access’ to the articles of their colleagues?</em></p>



<p>I remember there&nbsp;were&nbsp;some mistakes in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Sci-Hub description in that «Shadow Libraries» book by Karaganis, but I do not remember exactly which mistakes. I was very angry when I read the book:&nbsp;They could&nbsp;have&nbsp;asked&nbsp;me to proof-read their chapter about Sci-Hub before publishing, but they didn´t!</p>

<p>As far as Z-Library is concerned, I know that is a website that basically mirrors Library Genesis books database, including the database of Sci-Hub articles.</p>



<p>Why nobody talks about Z-Library and everyone talks about Sci-Hub? Sometimes people even have conspiracy theories why Sci-Hub got such fame and recognition. What can I say? Sci-Hub is actually the&nbsp;<em>first</em>&nbsp;website to provide free access to academic journals on a massive scale. Before Sci-Hub there existed websites such as Gigapedia or library.nu, Library Genesis and others that provided academic&nbsp;<em>books</em>&nbsp;for free, but not&nbsp;<em>journal articles</em>. Sci-Hub became the&nbsp;<em>first</em>&nbsp;website to target that academic journals problem!</p>



<p>For a long time the existence of Sci-Hub was censored in the media. Sci-Hub started in 2011 and immediately became popular among researchers but… even in 2015 articles discussing the problem of access to academic journals did not mention Sci-Hub!</p>



<p>Then in 2015 the lawsuit from Elsevier came, that included both Sci-Hub, Library Genesis and its mirrors such as Z-Library. A website named TorrentFreak published a short article about the lawsuit, and it listed Sci-Hub… as a mirror of Library Genesis! I read the article and became extremely angry. Then I contacted the journalist to correct the mistake, and they …</p></div></div>

		<p>We bought a new house last year and as I was moving my old Apple IIe computer from my old attic over to my new attic, I thought it would be fun to hook it up and see if it still worked.&nbsp; To make a long story short … it worked!&nbsp; (Scroll down to see some pictures and even a video clip of my working Apple IIe.)</p>
<p><strong>To make a long story even longer … here are all the gory and geeky details:</strong></p>
<p>Back in 1983, when I was only 13 years old and in 8th grade in Central Illinois, my parents bought me an Apple IIe computer for Christmas.&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time I had no computer training but I think there were a couple of APPLE II computers in my school.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1983-christmas-apple-iie-unwrapping-scaled.jpg"><img src="http://www.leucht.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1983-christmas-apple-iie-unwrapping-400x303.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="303" srcset="http://www.leucht.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1983-christmas-apple-iie-unwrapping-400x303.jpg 400w, http://www.leucht.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1983-christmas-apple-iie-unwrapping-1024x775.jpg 1024w, http://www.leucht.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1983-christmas-apple-iie-unwrapping-768x581.jpg 768w, http://www.leucht.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1983-christmas-apple-iie-unwrapping-1536x1162.jpg 1536w, http://www.leucht.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1983-christmas-apple-iie-unwrapping-2048x1550.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></a></p>
<p>Well, now that I look at the photo of my sister and I unwrapping it, I guess it was technically a gift for the both of us.&nbsp; But I think we both knew it was really mine!&nbsp; 🙂</p>
<p>Here’s an old and humorous Apple II commercial:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/05M80HHNB6s?rel=0" width="480" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Purchase Details:</strong></p>
<p>The cost of my Apple IIe computer in November of 1983 was $995 plus $115 for the standard green phosphor monitor for a grand total of $1,165 including 5% sales tax.&nbsp; That translates to nearly $2,700 in 2012 dollars.&nbsp; Yes, that’s a lot of money for a 13 year old kid’s Christmas present.&nbsp; The Apple IIe had only been on the market for less than a year when I got mine so it was not extremely popular yet. To hook it up to your own television, you would pay $70 for a modulator rather than $115 for the green monitor, but the resolution would not be as sharp on a television screen as it was on the computer monitor.&nbsp; We eventually did get the TV modulator, though, so I could use the computer in full color.&nbsp; Full color for an Apple IIe was only 15 colors, by the way.</p>
<p>My parents bought the computer from Wallace Micro-Mart on University Street in Peoria, Illinois.&nbsp; I believe the salesman there, who was listed as “Howell” on the hand written carbon receipt, lived in our same home town.&nbsp; At the bottom of the receipt it says that “Wallace has been serving the Peoria Community for over 10 years”.</p>
<p>I google’d Wallace Micro-Mart and all I found was this old commercial for an Apple Lisa computer:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/3R8fArhOWso?rel=0" width="480" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Geeky Specs:</strong></p>
<p>The Apple IIe came with 64KB of memory standard, but it was expandable to 1 Megabyte and also had lots of expansion slots for various accessories.&nbsp; It ran at a screaming 1 Megahertz and had an 8 bit data bus.&nbsp; It had 2 text display modes and 4 graphics display modes.&nbsp; The text modes were 40 or 80 columns at 24 lines.&nbsp; The graphics modes were 40×48 or 80×48 block low resolution modes and 280×192 or 560×192 pixel high resolution modes.&nbsp; For comparison, the Apple IIe high res graphics modes were about the same pixel resolution as your most common cell phones used in the year 2005 … and those old cell phones definitely had way more memory than the Apple IIe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Apple IIe contained Applesoft BASIC in ROM and booted into it if no floppy disk was found during boot.</p>
<p><strong>Unboxed Nearly 30 Years Later:</strong></p>
<p>Here is a photo of the computer in 2011 when I unboxed it during the move.&nbsp; It is basically a big case containing a keyboard, power supply, motherboard and that’s about it.&nbsp; It did not come with a mouse, nor did any of the Apple software support a mouse for the Apple II series of computers.&nbsp; I believe the Apple IIe came with one floppy drive and I think we bought the second one later.</p>
<p>The keys on the keyboard had some serious friction resistance and the keys were not very easy to push down.&nbsp; I think the key wiggle tolerances were pretty tight and the plastic-to-plastic friction caused quite a bit of resistance if you didn’t push the keys in the exact proper direction.&nbsp; Typing on this keyboard was seriously loud.&nbsp; Click, click, click!</p>
<p>There were some unique keys on these old Apple keyboards.&nbsp; Notice the outlined apple key which was called the open-apple and the solid white apple key which was called the closed-apple or solid-apple.&nbsp; The key sequence of simultaneous Control-OpenApple-Reset would reboot the machine immediately.&nbsp; Control-ClosedApple-Reset would enter BIOS setup before rebooting.&nbsp; Control-ClosedApple-OpenApple-Reset would perform a self test during reboot.&nbsp; Those are some crazy key sequences.</p>

<p>Here is the green phosphor “Monitor II”, as Apple called it.&nbsp; It had one single RCA style input connector and that’s it.&nbsp; No audio jacks, no output jacks, nothing.&nbsp; This thing was pretty old school and very basic.&nbsp; The serial number on this monitor is actually written by hand.&nbsp; The one cool feature was that the actual glass CRT was mounted on an axis that tilted up and down for a more direct viewing angle.&nbsp; The user just pushed on the darker green plastic frame around the glass CRT to tilt the glass up and down.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/02" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/02.JPG?m=1440971774" alt="" width="640" height="480"></a></p>
<p>Here is what the motherboard looks like inside the case.&nbsp; The lid was basically held down with a couple of hard plastic velcro type devices.&nbsp; There are 8 expansion slots and I was using four of them when I packed mine up for storage back in the late 80s.</p>
<p>The tiny card on the far left is the 80 column card and it is plugged into the auxiliary slot.&nbsp; This card just let the computer display 80 columns rather than the default 40 columns.&nbsp; This card also added more memory to the computer.</p>
<p>The long card on the left in slot 1 is the parallel interface card.&nbsp; It sure took a lot of electronics to interface to a parallel printer back then!</p>
<p>The short card in the middle in slot 4 is a Covox sound card.&nbsp; This card intercepted the sound going from the motherboard (yellow and red wires ) to the built-in speaker (black wires).&nbsp; The built-in speaker is mounted under the keyboard pointing straight down.&nbsp; This Covox sound card also had a headphone jack mounted directly on the card itself.&nbsp; I thought that was terribly inconvenient, so I de-soldered it from the card and mounted it into the plastic hole cover on the back of the computer.&nbsp; The brown wires are connecting the card to the headphone jack.&nbsp; I was pretty handy with a soldering iron, even when I was young.&nbsp; 🙂</p>
<p>The medium length card on the right in slot 6 is the floppy disk drive controller.&nbsp; Both disk drives are connected to that card using standard flat ribbon cables and nothing else.&nbsp; PC users are used to connecting power cables separately from data cables, but the power and data are both in these ribbon cables.&nbsp; Convenient … and also just a little scary.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/3.JPG?m=1440971950" alt="" width="480" height="640"></a></p>
<p>This is a 5 and a quarter inch magnetic floppy disk that holds the operating system.&nbsp; Do you remember these floppy disks?&nbsp; Some floppy disks were double sided, so you could flip them over and use the other side and get twice the data onto them.&nbsp; You had to punch out a notch in a specific place on the disk in order to make it read-only.&nbsp; Then you had to put a sticker over that hole in order to write to it again.&nbsp; Computer stores sold special notch cutters, but most of us users just used a standard hole punch numerous times until we got the notch created in the right place in order to open up the microswitch in the disk drive.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/4.JPG?m=1440971830" alt="" width="480" height="640"></a></p>
<p>30 years ago, I loved that Apple gave stickers away with their hardware and they still do it today and I still love it!&nbsp; This was a folder containing the receipt and some manuals and it also contained some really cool full color apple logo decals.&nbsp; I never used the decals.&nbsp; I just checked EBay and people are selling these vintage rainbow Apple stickers for 20 bucks each!&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; I guess they are a true collectors item now that they are 30 years old.</p>

<p>The owners manual was spiral bound.&nbsp; It took you though the internals for a computer and then walked you through the DOS command line commands and also introduced you to Applesoft BASIC programming.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/6.JPG?m=1440971927" alt="" width="480" height="640"></a></p>
<p>Ah, the good old dot matrix printer.&nbsp; Man, these things were loud.&nbsp; And how annoying was it to keep these things feeding the paper properly?&nbsp; These things were part typewriter and part printer.&nbsp; When somebody invented laserjets, we never looked back, did we?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/10.JPG?m=1440971781" alt="" width="640" height="480"></a></p>
<p>I actually still had an un-opened ribbon for the dot matrix printer.&nbsp; It probably dried out a year after I packed this thing up and went to college, though.&nbsp; I don’t remember how much these ribbons cost, but I do remember trying to squeeze every last drop of ink out of them.&nbsp; We used to reuse them multiple times and some people went as far as trying to re-ink them.&nbsp; I guess we still do the same thing today with our inkjet cartridges and our toner cartridges, though.&nbsp; The more things change, the more they stay the same!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/11.JPG?m=1440971788" alt="" width="480" height="640"></a></p>
<p>Here is a photo of the command line after one of my personal boot disks had been booted up.&nbsp; This was just a disk that had some small Applesoft BASIC programs on it.&nbsp; This particular program printed some text to the screen and exited.&nbsp; Very much beginner stuff.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/20.JPG?m=1440971794" alt="" width="640" height="480"></a></p>
<p>If you typed CATALOG from the command line, the computer would show you the list of files on the floppy disk.&nbsp; File type (A=Applesoft BASIC, B=Binary, I=Integer Basic, T=Text) and file size (disk sectors) and file name were shown.&nbsp; Notice that file names can have spaces.&nbsp; UNIX did not allow this initially and neither did the early DOS for PCs, but Apple did.&nbsp; Now pretty much every OS does allow it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/21.JPG?m=1440971803" alt="" width="640" height="480"></a></p>
<p>This image shows a listing of a small Applesoft BASIC program.&nbsp; It was written on the command line, line for line, then it was tested and if it worked, it was written to the disk as a file.&nbsp; In Applesoft BASIC you did not start with an empty file on disk and write characters to that file.&nbsp; You created your program directly in the computer’s memory and copied it to disk later.&nbsp; There was no plain text editor app that I’m aware of.&nbsp; No computer manufacturer does that anymore, for good reasons.</p>
<p>In this particular program, it draws some boxes on the screen with the HPLOT commands.&nbsp; Then it creates an artificial delay using the old school empty for/next loop.&nbsp; Then it repeats the box drawing sequence three times with a for/next loop, part of which has scrolled off the screen.&nbsp; After three cycles of the box drawing sequence, it runs a subroutine, which is not necessary in this case since it is only called once.&nbsp; But …</p></div></div>

<p>The credit for the title goes to Jeff Moser and his excellent <a href="http://www.moserware.com/2008/02/does-your-code-pass-turkey-test.html">post</a> which he authored in 2008. He basically discussed the dangers of improper localization and took a clever approach, stating «“The Turkey Test.” It’s very simple: will your code work properly on a person’s machine in or around the country of Turkey?”». The Turkish alphabet is based on Latin letters but there are few interesting properties of the Turkish alphabet such that
Jeff proposes if your code works fine in Turkish culture, then chances are good it is resilient to possible localization problems in other cultures using the Latin alphabet. Perhaps this is a bit overstatement as there are too many different languages and alphabets. However, unless we have a specific focus in a particular language or have dedicated people working on each language, in practice it’s next to impossible to have bug-free localization in our applications. In that aspect, I believe the Turkey test is a low effort way to do basic
smoke test on localization for your development process.</p>

<p>In his post, Jeff discusses the localization problems mostly from a .NET point of view. In this post, however, I will try to follow Jeff’s footprints but from a JavaScript point of view.</p>

<h2 id="dotted-and-dotless-i">Dotted and dotless I</h2>

<p>Well, the obvious question is why “Turkey”? One of the main reasons to use the Turkish alphabet for testing is that that the Turkish alphabet has two “I” letters. One with a dot and one without.
Namely the upper case  “I” and “İ and lower case “ı” and “i”. And yet there is even a dedicated Wikipedia [article] about it (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dotted_and_dotless_I).</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-23-Does-your-code-pass-the-Turkey-test/i-i.png" alt="i-i"></p>

<p>The challenge with these “I”s usually occurs when you try to do a case insensitive equality comparison. As a Turkish, I have been burned very badly because of “I” issues.</p>

<h2 id="problems-with-oracle-fixed-a-long-time-ago">Problems with Oracle (fixed a long time ago)</h2>

<p>One particular case I remember is I was developing an application for a bank. We had done extensive testing of the application in the local development environment.
But once we deployed the application to the bank’s prod machines, it immediately crashed.</p>

<p>After 13 hours of investigation (at that time my debugging skills wasn’t so sharp so I mostly relied on the logs), I realized my query was in the form of
“select description from …” and Oracle database will always capitalize the column names in its results returning a column with “DESCRIPTION”. 
The developers of ODP.NET were aware of this inconsistency so as a workaround they were calling ToUpper to match the column names from your query. However,
if your code runs within Turkish culture then <strong>ToUpper</strong> call will transform the column name to “DESCRİPTİON” and boom! your code would bail out with a cryptic exception.
Luckily only 3 years later Oracle has fixed the issue by using <strong>ToUpperInvariant</strong> instead of <strong>ToUpper</strong></p>

<h2 id="javascript-world">JavaScript world</h2>

<p>Having reiterated the problem on .NET, let’s explore the situation with the browsers. The browsers take the current culture from the operating system on macOS
and Linux. And on windows depending on the browser they may obey “preferred language” settings.  The following one-liner should help you to get the current culture of the browser:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>getLanguage</span> <span>=</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>userLanguage</span> 
  <span>||</span> <span>(</span><span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>languages</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>languages</span><span>.</span><span>length</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>languages</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>])</span> 
  <span>||</span> <span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>language</span> <span>||</span> <span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>browserLanguage</span> <span>||</span> <span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>systemLanguage</span> <span>||</span> <span>'</span><span>en</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Perhaps one of the easiest ways to make case-insensitive but 
safe comparisons are to use ToLocalUpperCase and ToLocalLowerCase:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>city</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>istanbul</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>.</span><span>toLocaleUpperCase</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>en-US</span><span>'</span><span>));</span>
<span>// expected output: "ISTANBUL"</span>

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>.</span><span>toLocaleUpperCase</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>TR</span><span>'</span><span>));</span>
<span>// expected output: "İSTANBUL"</span>

<span>const</span> <span>cityU</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>İSTANBUL</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>cityU</span><span>.</span><span>toLocaleLowerCase</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>en-US</span><span>'</span><span>));</span>
<span>// expected output: "i̇stanbul"</span>

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>cityU</span><span>.</span><span>toLocaleLowerCase</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>TR</span><span>'</span><span>));</span>
<span>// expected output: "istanbul"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Notice the interesting dot on top of the i for lower-case en-us transformation. I have no idea what it is.</p>

<h2 id="javascript-internationalization-objects">JavaScript Internationalization objects</h2>

<p>JavaScript also offers several built-in objects for internationalization.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Intl</li>
  <li>Intl.Collator</li>
  <li>Intl.DateTimeFormat</li>
  <li>Intl.ListFormat</li>
  <li>Intl.NumberFormat</li>
  <li>Intl.PluralRules</li>
  <li>Intl.RelativeTimeFormat</li>
  <li>Intl.Locale</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl">mdn</a></p>

<p>Although I appreciate the effort, I personally find these APIs relatively limited. The internationalization API extends towards interesting problems like pluralization,
however, if you review the API, it’s mostly geared towards formatting and displaying but relatively weak when it comes to parsing. First, let’s visit our original
problem. Is there another API we could compare “İSTANBUL” with “istanbul” case-insensitively and find them equal?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>İSTANBUL</span><span>'</span><span>;</span> 
<span>const</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>istanbul</span><span>'</span><span>;</span> 

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>localeCompare</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>en</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>sensitivity</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>base</span><span>'</span> <span>}));</span>
<span>// expected output: 0</span>

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>localeCompare</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>tr</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>sensitivity</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>accent</span><span>'</span> <span>}));</span>
<span>// expected output: 0</span>

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>localeCompare</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>en</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>sensitivity</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>accent</span><span>'</span> <span>}));</span>
<span>// expected output: 1</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It seems to work expectedly.  What about the dotless I case?
Let’s compare ‘IĞDIR’ and ‘ığdır’ which are considered equal in Turkish case-insensitively.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>IĞDIR</span><span>'</span><span>;</span> 
<span>const</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>ığdır</span><span>'</span><span>;</span> 

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>localeCompare</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>en</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>sensitivity</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>base</span><span>'</span> <span>}));</span>
<span>// expected output: -1</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>localeCompare</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>tr</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>sensitivity</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>base</span><span>'</span> <span>}));</span>
<span>// expected output: 0</span>

<span>// expected output: -1</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Notice here you must set the culture to ‘tr’ otherwise it won’t work.</p>

<h2 id="date-and-time">Date and Time</h2>
<p>Most languages have different formats for dates so if we have <strong>05/01/2021</strong> does it mean January 5 or May 5?. Some people would argue we should use 
<strong>2021-05-01</strong> but then your users will complain. How about 01 MAY 2021, this is good but then you have to localize MAY. So pick your poison. To make things more complicated, languages like Turkish use “.” instead of “/” as a date separator.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there is no built-in way to parse such strings to convert JavaScript date objects. You have to rely on external libs like moment.js and
there goes another 75 kb to your bundle.</p>

<p>Finally, I should add that, <strong>1 PM</strong> is shown as <strong>13.00</strong> in Turkish culture. That’s one more thing you should consider.</p>

<h2 id="numbers">Numbers</h2>

<p>Well, it’s a well-known fact that different languages use different symbols for thousands and decimals separators. But being uncareful with number localization has dire consequences. In Turkish thousands is split by dot “.” and for the decimal separator “,” is used. For example
<em>1.234,56</em> is one thousand two hundred thirty-four point fifty-six. In .NET if you try parsing in Turkish culture</p>



<p>What do you think the output will be? Well, it is <strong>1234</strong> as the .NET parser completely ignores the thousands separator even if that wasn’t your intention.
What about the situation in JavaScript? You are completely on your own. parseFloat is just using en-US culture and that’s fixed.</p>

<p>That’s not all. How many digits are there? 10 you say? <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20040309-00/?p=40333">Raymond Chen disagrees</a> 
Well at least from a .NET standpoint Arabic digits are also considered as digits. In JavaScript, you are on your own again.</p>

<h2 id="currency">Currency</h2>
<p>Well, the simple fact is in Turkish and many other languages the currency symbol is written after the numeric value not before as in <strong>100$</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="percentage-symbol">Percentage symbol</h2>

<p>In Turkish, the percentage symbol comes before e.g <strong>%50</strong></p>

<h2 id="other-alphabets">Other alphabets</h2>

<p>Let’s see some peculiarities with other Alphabets. One might think “Z” is probably the last letter in Latin alphabets. Enter the nordic languages</p>

<p>Danish and Norwegian Alphabets:
A	B	C	D	E	F	G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W	X	Y	Z	Æ	Ø	Å</p>

<p>As you can see there are three letters coming after Z.</p>

<p>In the Icelandic alphabet, Z is obsoleted!!!</p>

<p>Ok, but at least we cans say Z is the last letter if we consider plain English letters. Unfortunately no. Here’s the Estonian alphabet:</p>

<p>A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, R, S, Š, Z, Ž, T, U, V, Õ, Ä, Ö, Ü.</p>

<p>Some alphabets like Dutch has digraphs like “IJ” which is sometimes considered a single letter. Some fun facts taken from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IJ_(digraph)">wikipedia article</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In Dutch primary schools, ij used to be taught as being the 25th letter of the alphabet, and some primary school writing materials list ‘ij’ as the 25th letter of the alphabet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a word starting with IJ is capitalised, the entire digraph is capitalised: IJsselmeer, IJmuiden.[5]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On mechanical Dutch typewriters, there is a key that produces ‘ij’ (in a single letterspace, located directly to the right of the L). However, this is not the case on modern computer keyboards.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In word puzzles, ij often fills one square.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And here’s the Nigerian alphabet:</p>

<p>Upper case	A	B	Ɓ	C	D	Ɗ	E	Ǝ	Ẹ	F	G</p>

<p>Lower case	a	b	ɓ	c	d	ɗ	e	ǝ	ẹ	f	g</p>

<p>Upper case	H	I	Ị	J	K	Ƙ	L	M	N	O	Ọ</p>

<p>Lower case	h	i	ị	j	k	ƙ	l	m	n	o	ọ</p>

<p>Upper case	P	R	S	Ṣ	T	U	Ụ	V	W	Y	Z</p>

<p>Lower case	p	r	s	ṣ	t	u	ụ	v	w	y	z</p>

<p>Not only Nigerian alphabet has 3 E letters but they have an I with dot like Turkish but the dot is at the bottom.</p>

<p>If you wonder things can go more interesting than this, ladies and gentleman, I present you Hungarian keyboard:</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-23-Does-your-code-pass-the-Turkey-test/hungary.png" alt="hungarian-keyboard"></p>

<p>My non-elven eyes see there are 4 U’s and 4 O’s with different accents in the Hungarian keyboard most of them being at right hand side :)</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Despite its widespread use, I have a feeling that JavaScript is not on par with backend languages like .NET when it comes to localization capabilities. 
What is the solution? You probably have to rely on third-party libraries. An alternative route might be to use Blazor which brings .NET Runtime into the browser.
That way you can get the benefit of all the Globalization goodies of .NET but your app can still reside in the browser. Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments section.</p>

How to make it more sustainable?</p><div><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/iter_fusion_reactor_plasma.jpg" alt="Figure 1: Inside the Korean tokamak KSTAR (NFRI)"><figcaption><p>Figure 1: Inside the Korean tokamak <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KSTAR">KSTAR</a> (NFRI)</p></figcaption></figure><p>With corporations like Microsoft, Oracle, and Google truly reinventing
themselves to adapt to an open source world, and typical open source
projects moving towards—oftentimes centralized—governance models, the
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/homesteading/cathedral-bazaar/">Cathedral–Bazaar</a> dichotomy feels increasingly less relevant.</p><p>It was met with
<a href="https://firstmonday.org/article/view/708/618">criticism</a>
even back in the 90s.</p><p>While being an entertaining piece of history with useful takeaways, its
most important achievement was arguably helping create a sense of identity
for hacker culture via the revolutionary Open Source movement, and
promoting the value of the Internet for software development.</p><p>In the Cathedral-Bazaar continuum, contemporary projects like Kubernetes,
Chromium, and VSCode are <i>fusion reactors</i>.</p><p>They have the backing of heavily invested companies with virtually infinite
capital, who are able to staff highly competent teams that not only work
full-time on these projects, but also have enough personpower to maximally
leverage the benefits brought by a gigantic user base.</p><p>Like with fusion power, they seem to be able to leverage a high amount of
energy to generate even more.</p><p>Sometimes, their user base includes <i>other</i> organizations with
endless resources: by means of its success, VSCode is getting
<a href="https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2019/11/21/fb-vs-code.aspx">sizable contributions</a> from Facebook, for example.</p><p>In contrast, the vast majority of open source projects depend almost
exclusively on decentralized volunteer efforts from people sacrificing time
out of their busy schedules and lives to move things forward.</p><p>And yet, projects following this style of development can end up becoming
backbones of modern computing:</p><blockquote><p>The OpenSSL project has been around since 1998. Since the project is open
source, it is an informal group comprised primarily of about a dozen
members throughout the world, most of whom have day jobs, and some of whom
work on a volunteer basis. Being open source, the OpenSSL project’s code
has always been public facing. Any person could download it and modify it
or implement it in their own software.</p><p>[…]</p><p>The fascinating, mind-boggling fact here is that you have this critical
piece of network infrastructure that really runs a large part of the
internet, and there’s basically one guy working on it full time.</p><p>— <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/articles/ssl-heartbleed">Steve Marquess in “It’s Not A Fun Week To Work at OpenSSL, The Mostly
Volunteer Project Responsible for the Heartbleed Bug”, (2014)</a></p></blockquote><p>Heartbleed is a symptom of an ever-existing problem: corporations profit
massively by leveraging typically under-resourced open source projects
while not giving back proportionally, or (most commonly) at all; either
with money or people.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/xkcd_load_bearing_open_source.png" alt="Figure 2: &amp;ldquo;Load-Bearing Internet People&amp;rdquo;"><figcaption><p>Figure 2: <a href="https://xkcd.com/2347/">“Load-Bearing Internet People”</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>After Heartbleed the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_Infrastructure_Initiative">Core Infrastructure Initiative</a>
was created to support software essential to the "functioning of the
Internet and other major information systems".</p><p>Less critical software like Emacs also follows this decentralized
development style, and similarly, lacks resources.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>So if Emacs wants to compete with these tools then it has to have
seamless, context aware code completion and refactoring support, and GNU
tools has to provide Emacs the necessary information to implement these
features.</p></blockquote><p>I agree. But to have that, the only way is to have motivated volunteers
step forward and work on these features. Otherwise we will never have them.</p><p>Right now, no one is working on that, though everyone is talking. [T]he
same as with weather.</p><p>— <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2015-10/msg00646.html">Eli Zaretskii in “Re: IDE” (2014)</a></p></blockquote><p>One way to incentivize contributions is by funding developers. Some (most?)
open source contributors would gladly take income to fund their work.</p><blockquote><p>Long-term my big dream has always been to accumulate enough backing to be
able to work full-time on open-source projects, but whether I’ll achieve
this dream or not is entirely up to you.</p><p>— <a href="https://emacsredux.com/blog/2020/09/13/patronage-revisited/">Bozhidar Batsov in “Patronage Revisited” (2020)</a></p></blockquote><p>While others feel that accepting funding would degrade their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:%5FThe%5FSurprising%5FTruth%5FAbout%5FWhat%5FMotivates%5FUs">intrinsic
motivation</a> to contribute.</p><blockquote><p>I can’t speak for all FLOSS developers, but I can speak for myself: I don’t
want monetary rewarding from users. Mainly for the reason, that I don’t
want to change the relationship with my users. Currently it is mostly a
team attitude, we’re working together to solve the problem. And there is
also no legal obligation for me to work on something I don’t like.</p><p>If I accepted contributions I think many users would get a “but I paid for
that, so do what I want” attitude. I definitely don’t want that. I do FLOSS
in my free time to do something that matters, and for my personal
fulfillment, not for money.</p><p>It will also get harder to do the right thing (in contrary to doing what
the users want) since the users can stop the payments.</p><p>So, no payments for me, thanks.</p><p>— <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/6pjbn0/sustainable%5Femacs%5Fdevelopment%5Fsome%5Fthoughts%5Fand/">cjk101010 in “Sustainable Emacs development - some thoughts and
analysis” (2017)</a></p></blockquote><p>Which is fair: with compensation comes responsibility, timelines,
expectations, and things can get complicated. From the point of view of the
project, there doesn’t seem to be a conflict: capture funding to enable those
who need (or want) it, while still empowering those who don’t, to contribute
on their own terms.</p><p>Not everyone is in a position to spend unpaid time on open source,
especially consistently. “Free” time <a href="https://www.rightattitudes.com/2017/08/08/opportunity-cost/">isn’t free</a>—<em>it costs life</em>. By
funding work, a project might get to see contributions from talented folks
passionate about it who wouldn’t be able to volunteer their time.</p><p>And sometimes, the reason why your PR isn't getting immediate attention
is that the maintainer is busy literally
<a href="https://github.com/fre5h/DoctrineEnumBundle/pull/12#issuecomment-33023169">fighting</a>
a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution_of_Dignity">revolution</a>.</p><p>For Emacs specifically, one problem is that there’s no clear way of funding
“Emacs”. Sending money to the FSF doesn’t guarantee that it will fund Emacs
development. <em>Even if there was</em> a way of “funding Emacs”, the Emacs
community—like many things in life—seems to be roughly divided in two
sides: those who prioritize <em><a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">freedom</a></em>, and those who prioritize <em>progress</em>. So
one would potentially want to fund one side or the other, depending on their
values.</p><p>In the excellent “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0578675862/">Working in Public</a>: The Making and Maintenance of Open
Source Software”, Nadia Eghbal calls attention to a shift in how
individuals support open source. Similarly to platforms like Twitch, more
and more people are funding creators directly instead of projects, as a way
of “incentivizing the ongoing creation of creative work” from developers
who produce things that are in their interests.</p><p>Maintainers of popular Emacs packages, for example, have their own <a href="https://github.com/tarsius/elisp-maintainers">separate
streams of patronage</a>, which receive varying levels of support depending on
their popularity and the value added by what they create.</p><p>For efforts that involve multiple people, like maintaining and evolving
Emacs itself, services like <a href="https://opencollective.com/">Open Collective</a> could be of great assistance by
helping on three fronts:</p><ol><li>providing a legal banking entity</li><li>recurrently collecting funds from individuals and companies</li><li>distributing funds to contributors</li></ol><p>Funds can be transparently collected, and dispersed for specific contract
work, infrastructure costs, and even developer salaries. Take for example
the <a href="https://opencollective.com/babel">Babel</a> project, which draws in enough recurrent income to finance
multiple contractors and a full-time developer earning a San Francisco
salary. An Emacs Open Collective could not only be an answer to “how can I
fund Emacs development?” but also a way to financially support developers
working on it.</p><p>The Clojure community seems to be doing an excellent job at not only
<a href="https://www.clojuriststogether.org/news/q4-2020-funding-announcement/">funding</a>
efforts that are making the whole Clojure ecosystem
better but also at surveying and
<a href="https://www.clojuriststogether.org/news/q3-2020-survey-results/">responding</a>
accordingly to user
feedback.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/sponsors">GitHub Sponsors</a> is another great example of developer empowerment. With it,
not only does GitHub equip people to:</p><ul><li>be more productive by providing great code hosting, bug tracking, wiki,
code reviewing and merging, project management, continuous integration,
documentation, artifact hosting, etc.</li><li>have a broader impact by giving projects more visibility and standardized
workflows that are familiar to others already on the platform</li></ul><p>It also makes it possible for its <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">40 million users</a> to frictionlessly fund
work on open source, and for a large number of maintainers to be
conveniently compensated for their labor. I just started sponsoring someone
with literally two clicks!</p><p>The power of platforms can’t be understated.</p><p>Whether you like GitHub or not, it’s undeniable that it has, and continues
to revolutionize Open Source, simply by providing a significantly better
and unified experience for all aspects of building software.</p><div><p>When there are people making over
<a href="https://changelog.com/posts/i-just-hit-100000-per-year-on-github-sponsors">100k/year</a>
on GitHub Sponsors, you better have a great reason to <b>not</b> try to
<a href="https://github.com/sponsors/neovim">take advantage</a>
of it.</p><p>In the case of Emacs, the reason is <i>freedom</i>.</p></div><p>I wouldn’t mind if Emacs development moved to GitHub, but <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/repo-criteria-evaluation.en.html">I don’t think
it’s ever going to happen</a>. Maybe for good reason: GitHub is backed by a
for-profit corporation and is far from perfect, both in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906213/github-ice-microsoft-software-email-contract-immigration-nonprofit-donation">moral</a> and <a href="https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc">technical</a>
terms. It might be a great tool today, but being a proprietary platform,
its users are at their complete mercy.</p><p>I should point out that from my perspective GitHub has been for the
most part a force for
<a href="https://github.blog/2020-11-16-standing-up-for-developers-youtube-dl-is-back/">good</a>.</p><p>It would be great if main development at least moved from a
mailing-list-driven process to a modern <em>forge</em> style of contribution. It
<a href="https://emba.gnu.org/emacs/emacs">seems that it <em>might</em></a>, but whether or not it will is still <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/28152">unclear</a>.</p><p>In the same way that corporations extract value out of open source, open
source projects should as much as possible leverage “energy” generated by
corporations. In this new open source world, companies have their workforce
contributing millions of person-hours to projects that benefit everyone.
LLVM equips people to build programming languages. LSP gives people potent
software development capabilities. Rails empowers people to build powerful
web applications.</p><blockquote><p>More than 3,000 people have committed man-decades, maybe even
man-centuries, of work for free. Buying all that effort at market rates
would have been hundreds of millions of dollars. Who would have been able
to afford funding that?</p><p>That’s a …</p></blockquote></div></div>

                    Preface to the Wolfpack Edition

This is Geoff Cashman's venerable User's Guide to Empire.  It was written
in 1991, and Empire has evolved quite a bit since then.  Nevertheless, many
players have found it useful through the years, so here it is.  We
reproduce it verbatim except for this preface and corrections of a few
editing mistakes.

				Preface

This guide's intended audience is the beginning player and those players
who have played a game or three and would like to have some insight on some
more subtle aspects of the game.  Some experienced players may find some 
benefit from reading this guide as well.  While you may feel you are an
expert, it is always possible to learn.  Nothing in this guide is intended 
to be difficult to understand, and every effort has been made to make this
guide an easy learning tool.

User's Guide to Empire							 3

				Foreword

It has been over a year now since I first sat down and thought in a serious
way about writing this guide.  It has been a long trip with many interesting
turns and developments.  When I first started, the version of Empire that
this guide has ultimately been written for had not yet been released.  Now,
with this project nearing release I find that yet another new version of
Empire is coming out.  I look on in near despair as I realize that this guide
may very well soon be outdated.  Nevertheless, I feel compelled to release
this information in what might be considered a final form.  

However, I hope that this is not the final form.  With new versions of
Empire coming out in the very near future I hope that some other potential
author steps forward and takes up the banner of educating the new player. 
I caution you though that such a work as this takes quite an effort. 

To the reader and any critics or even cynics that might be reading, I say
that I am not writer.  I never was, and I never intend to be.  There are
certainly enough writers in the world to write almost everything the world
could want to know about in print.  I was never skilled in the art of proper
style for any sort of writing.  Please, be kind and keep this in mind.

I wrote this guide because I felt there was a great need for something of
this nature.  I have watched so many players come to the network looking
for information on Empire, such as the rules, or information on how to play.
One can get information about the various commands available to oneself
within the game, but to understand how to use those commands effectively
and get skilled at running a country is a far greater task.  Many new
players have despaired after playing their first game for lack of the
requisite knowledge to play effectively.  Some come back fighting hard
in the next game, but many just disappear never to be heard from again.
This guide was written with the hope that if the new player is supplied
with the basics, they can advance in skill more quickly than previously
possible and not despair at their first defeat. 

I am hoping that within the near future two other companion guides to 
this one will be written and released to the net.  These two guides will
be intended to make the average player a better player or even expert,
and to teach fledgling deities how to compile and establish a, solicit 
entries for , and effectively run, a game.  Some people have commented
to me that the time spent on these guides would be better spent if I 
were to spend time programming for Empire instead.  It is my belief that
in teaching players to be better players, and teaching deities how to be 
a deity should that guide be released, the potential pool for
programmers of Empire will increase.  

I can not take credit for the idea of this guide.  The need for such
a guide I think was painfully obvious to a great many players.  Some in
fact did engage in projects to fill that need.  Every such attempt has
fallen short, in my humble opinion.  Witness the large number of people


User's Guide to Empire							 4

who still ask the network, "How do I play?" and even more importantly
the lack of sufficient answer to such people's questions.  In my highest
hopes, I dream that someday soon that answer will be "Get a copy of the
User's Guide to Empire, which is available via FTP from xx.xx.xx".

This work was made possible by the contributions of several Empire players.
This work would not have been completed without the insights and assistance 
of many Empire players and deities.  To the Empire community as a whole,
I say thank you for your priceless contributions.

User's Guide to Empire							 6

Chapter 1 :-: What is Empire?

	Empire is a game in which you are pitted against several other
	players in a country vs. country format.  There are economies to
	run, armies to support, policies to generate, and allies and
	enemies to make.  The game supports various features that make
	certain aspects of the game seem to parallel the "realistic"
	world.  These include satellites, planes, banks, parks, etc.
	
	Empire, in the version herein described, is a very complex 
	game.  The closest game that most people will know that is 
	analogous to it is the game known as Risk.  However, Empire is 
	more complex by a factor of at least one hundred.  Nevertheless, 
	as a result of the computer aiding you every step of the way, the 
	game is not difficult to play, though it can be difficult to 
	learn.  If you read this guide thoroughly, and use it as a 
	continuing resource, you can help make learning this game a lot 
	easier. 

	It should be noted that in learning to play this game, you
	may become frustrated or feel daunted by its complexity. 
	Several players have noted that they almost gave up on Empire,
	until one day when everything seemed to start to make sense.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><div><p><em>This is a guest post authored by <a href="https://jacobian.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jacob Kaplan-Moss</a>, co-creator of Django.</em></p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I’ve spent a good deal of my career with my feet in two different worlds. I came up as a web developer and helped create a popular web framework (Django). And I’ve spent a sizable chunk of my career working in information security.
Unfortunately, I’ve seen these two roles clash far too often. Engineering often sees Security as standing in the way of delivery, or as creating meaningless busywork. Security thinks Engineering is irresponsible, willing to ship broken or vulnerable code.</p>
<p>I’ve spent more than a decade trying to bridge this gap. There’s no silver bullet. But, over and over, I’ve seen one practice be quite effective: automated security tests — and particularly integrating security checks and tests into an existing CI pipeline.</p>
<h3>Bringing Security along on the CI/CD journey</h3>
<p>Engineers have largely embraced CI as a critical part of quality assurance, and that a robust test suite that runs on every commit is a huge enabler of velocity. We can be bold about making changes, knowing that the test suite will catch us if we’ve messed up. A mature CI/CD pipeline is a reliable litmus test for good software.</p>
<p>Historically, though, Security has been left out of this CI/CD journey. We’ve relied on manual security assessments; hands-on exercises like threat modelling and threat hunting; and bespoke penetration tests. These are important activities that will always have a place in a mature product security lifecycle, but they increasingly are difficult to integrate into an agile delivery model that relies on incremental changes and automated tests. Much of the friction between modern engineering and security teams can come down to this impedance mismatch.</p>
<p>So, to get Security and Engineering playing well together, one massively useful tool is getting security work integrated into continuous delivery. When done right, Security and Engineering work together to produce automated checks that cover security issues in the same test suite that’s already in CI. This maintains delivery cadence, gives confidence about the security of the product, and — most importantly — gives a place where Security and Engineering collaborate, rather than conflict, to produce secure code.</p>
<p>How does this look in practice? Each organization is different, but there’s a typical progression of maturity that Security and Engineering orgs go through as they build a continuous integration and automation pipeline:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 1: Security finds problems; Engineering fixes them</li>
<li>Level 2: Security and Engineering collaborate to produce test cases and remediations</li>
<li>Level 3: After the issue is fixed, Security and Engineering collaborate to find systemic fixes and develop checks</li>
<li>Level 4: Security and Engineering now also proactively look for new classes of issues and create systemic checks before an actual problem occurs</li>
</ul>
<p>For the rest of this post, I’ll walk through each of these phases with a specific example about a team that systemically fixed an issue with logging sensitive tokens.</p>
<h3>Level 1: Security finds problems; Engineering fixes them</h3>
<p>This is (unfortunately) how many organizations operate. Nobody really works together: Security is off in one corner looking for vulnerabilities (or, worse, waiting for a breach and then responding!). When they find one, they tell Engineering, who (hopefully) fixes the problem.</p>
<p>Let’s begin the example and see how this could shake out in practice. A few months ago, Nathan Brahams <a href="https://r2c.dev/blog/2020/fixing-leaky-logs-how-to-find-a-bug-and-ensure-it-never-returns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote about systemically fixing an issue around accidentally logging sensitive tokens</a>. His article illustrates the steps a quite mature security/engineering organization would take, but I’ll use this issue as a jumping-off-point to imagine how teams earlier in their journey might approach discovering a similar issue.</p>
<p>So, imagine a budding team has found this security issue: SQLAlchemy debug logging is turned on and sensitive tokens are being logged. The issue is fixed with a clever technique that uses a custom <code>ObfuscatedString</code> column that prevents SQLAlchemy from logging the token's value. So, we just swap in <code>ObfuscatedString</code> for the token column. Problem solved, right?</p>
<p>Well, while this does fix the issue, it has many problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Verification</strong>: If Engineering just rolls out this fix, how do we verify that the issue is actually fixed? Usually at this level of maturity, the Security team will manually verify the fix, but that’s error-prone. It’s also slow; if the fix didn’t work or is incomplete, the cycle has to repeat itself.</li>
<li><strong>Regression</strong>: If another engineer, some time later, doesn’t understand this <code>ObfuscatedString</code>, it could get reverted or modified in a way that re-introduces the issue. How would we know if this happens? (Spoiler alert: with an automated test, which we’ll discuss in the next section.)</li>
<li>Is this a one-off issue, or <strong>is it a systemic issue</strong>? Are there other sensitive values elsewhere that might be logged?</li>
<li><strong>Conflict</strong>: Most importantly, this workflow sets up conditions ripe for conflict between Security and Engineering. It creates a dynamic where it’s easy for Engineering to feel like Security’s just creating work for them, and where Security can feel ignored or powerless to fix problems. I’ve never seen this model produce a really healthy relationship; just ones with varying levels of dysfunction. Even when Security helps write the fix, the lack of any sort of robust verification or systemic analysis means it’s very likely they’ll need to come back later with this issue or a similar one again, which both parties will resent.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Level 2: automated tests</h3>
<p>The next rung on the maturity ladder is one that’s becoming increasingly common: instead of just fixing a security issue, Security and Engineering will collaborate on producing a test case (and often the fix). Following along with the example above, we might write a test case that sets up a test model with an <code>ObfuscatedString</code> column, captures some logs, and verifies that the value is correctly obfuscated.</p>
<p>This relatively simple addition fixes a bunch of problems we had before:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Verification</strong>: If the test case passes, we can be confident the security issue is fixed.</li>
<li><strong>Regression</strong>: Because this test case is part of our test suite, if it ever regresses the test case will fail, and we won’t risk re-introducing it to production.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration</strong>: Security and Engineering are now working more closely together, increasing the chances both teams will see this as “our issue” and “our fix”, not “their problem”.</li>
</ul>
<p>But: we still lack any sort of understanding of whether this issue occurs elsewhere, or any sort of holistic fix for the entire class of issues. In the case of logging sensitive tokens, it’s easy to imagine this issue occurring elsewhere. So when — inevitably — a similar issue occurs elsewhere, we’re likely to be bitten again. And this, in turn, will continue to produce the kind of resentment that can be so damaging to Security/Engineering working well together.</p>
<h3>Level 3: systemic fixes and checks</h3>
<p>The next step, then, is for Security and Engineering to work together to find systemic problems and fixes. Things start out as above — it’s important to fix the specific vulnerability first, before getting fancy! But after the specific fix is in, Security and Engineering come together to figure out if this is a systemic problem. If so, they work to develop a check or a fix.</p>
<p>Sometimes this can be a fairly simple holistic fix. For example, <a href="https://r2c.dev/blog/2020/understanding-and-preventing-dos-in-web-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I wrote about ReDoS last time</a>. Discovery of a ReDoS vulnerability might lead to discovering other similar potential problems. That in turn could lead to the decision to switch to <a href="https://github.com/google/re2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">re2</a>, which isn’t vulnerable to ReDoS.</p>
<p>But much of the time, the systemic fix is more complex — there isn’t a simple drop-in replacement that eliminates a class of vulnerabilities. That’s true of this sensitive-logging issue: we don’t have any sort of logging module that can magically know when variables are sensitive, and obfuscate them.</p>
<p>This is where code scanning tools like Semgrep come in. They are a terrifically important part of a mature product security workflow. Traditional testing practices — unit tests, integration tests, etc — are great for reproducing specific security issues, and ensuring that they’re fixed and won’t regress. But they struggle to discover whole classes of security issues, and this is what code scanners enable. Traditional code linters (e.g., Flake8, RuboCop) help to ensure code consistency and find some common issues, but since they have to apply generally to all kinds of projects, they tend to only provide a one-size-fits-all best-practices check. Tools that understand code semantically, like Semgrep, can be used to write tests for <em>your unique codebase</em> and find whole classes of security issues — including, most importantly, new instances of a problem that might be added after the check has been written.</p>
<p>And indeed, that’s what Nathan and his team did: they wrote a Semgrep rule that finds columns with names suggesting they’re sensitive (e.g., containing “token”, “secret”, “key”, etc), and issues a warning.</p>
<p>At this point, we’re in a pretty good spot. New code is continually scanned for this issue, and when found, they are fixed robustly. We have a workflow and tooling that ensures that the original, specific issue is fixed and that it stays fixed, and we ensure that similar issues — present and future — are discovered and fixed. Security and Engineering collaborate on this work, which is now well-automated. There’s still (of course) room for teams to not get along, but we’ve removed some of the most common pain points (verification, regression, conflict between teams).</p>
<p>If suddenly blocking builds with new checks will only increase conflict in your organization, you could softly roll out checks that do not block Engineering and only notify Security. For issues that arise, Security can begin conversations with Engineering to collaborate on both specific and systemic fixes. Once the check is satisfactory to both …</p></div></div></div></section></div>

				<p>The new RP2040 chip by RaspberryPi is amazing. When we got our hands on this beautiful little thing, we did what we always do with new chips and slapped on a Goldfish; our favourite acid bassline synthesizer (we make fish and chips hahahaha).</p>
<p><img src="http://www2.thisisnotrocketscience.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldfish-2021-FrontPanel-300x188.png" alt="" width="300" height="188" srcset="http://www2.thisisnotrocketscience.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldfish-2021-FrontPanel-200x125.png 200w, http://www2.thisisnotrocketscience.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldfish-2021-FrontPanel-300x188.png 300w, http://www2.thisisnotrocketscience.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldfish-2021-FrontPanel-320x202.png 320w, http://www2.thisisnotrocketscience.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldfish-2021-FrontPanel-400x251.png 400w, http://www2.thisisnotrocketscience.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldfish-2021-FrontPanel-600x376.png 600w, http://www2.thisisnotrocketscience.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldfish-2021-FrontPanel-700x441.png 700w, http://www2.thisisnotrocketscience.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldfish-2021-FrontPanel-768x482.png 768w, http://www2.thisisnotrocketscience.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldfish-2021-FrontPanel-800x502.png 800w, http://www2.thisisnotrocketscience.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldfish-2021-FrontPanel.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px">While benchmarking the performance by copy/pasting instances of our entire Goldfish in search of the chips limits, we suddenly found ourselves with a polyphonic synth. We have since rewritten these multiple instances into a 16 voice Poly-Goldfish with 4 oscillators per voice. To celebrate we designed a PCB and brightly coloured frontpanel to give this new Goldfish some dedicated controls.</p>
<p>Bring-up was trivial due to the amazing documentation and the extremely flexible PIO-blocks. The RP2040 is a dream to work with. Childlike giddiness ensued while lying on the carpet and programming in VSCode on an RPi400 talking directly to the RP2040. This is the way to release a chip onto the world: with fantastic documentation, an open toolchain and plenty of examples of how to use everything. There is a tantalizing hint at the start of the data sheet that this is the lowest grade chip of the family they plan to release… we cannot wait to play with the RP4755.</p>

<p>Once these chips hit general availability we will probably share some designs on our <a href="https://github.com/ThisIsNotRocketScience">Github</a>. This chip is now part of our go-to set of tools to make the cool stuff and will very bloody likely be inside our next three modules.</p>

Because of the easy, &nbsp;high quality, multi-platform, FREE and even beginner-friendly toolchain they have built around this chip we can expand the accessibility to the insides of our designs. With these chips it is way easier for us to have you do things like adding your own algorithms, building extra modes or creating personal effects. We can lean on the quality of RaspberryPi platform and this amazing chip.</p>

<p>Without leaving the letter <em>M</em>: <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#moore-s-law"><strong>Moore’s Law</strong></a>, <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#murphy-s-law"><strong>Murphy’s Law</strong></a>, <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#metcalfe-s-law"><strong>Metcalfe’s Law</strong></a>, <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#mooers-law"><strong>Mooers’s Law</strong></a>. I’m not saying an adage should never, ever be named after a person. I’ll admit, <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#moore-s-law"><strong>Moore’s Law</strong></a> and <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#murphy-s-law"><strong>Murphy’s Law</strong></a> have a certain catchiness to them. But the trend of taking a maxim and calling it Person’s Law has resulted in dozens and dozens of these things being produced, and it makes my head spin. Soon every fact or aphorism will be Somebody’s Law. Not only have such adage laws become a cliché, but, as I have found when researching this article, many of the laws are either not named after the person who came up with the idea (ignorance), or are named by the author after themselves (egotism). They are also called “laws” when they aren’t really laws to lend the ideas more credence than they deserve, or at least more memetic value. It’s hard for me not to take on a negative tone in this article after being exposed to such egotism and ignorance. Apologies in advance.</p>
<p>Newton earned his laws. So did Asimov. But now any lazy aphorism can lend your name immortality if you push for it hard enough. Let me give it a go:</p>
<h3 id="taylor-s-law"><a href="#taylor-s-law" aria-label="Anchor link for: taylor-s-law"><img src="https://taylor.gl/link.svg" alt="chain link icon"></a>
Taylor’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>If an adage is named after a person and called a law, there is a 50% chance the law is named after the wrong person, and if not, there is a 50% chance it was named by the author after themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tell your friends. Ironically, I have basically stolen <strong>Stigler’s Law</strong> here (see <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#stigler-s-law">below</a>). Oh well, nothing is new under the sun.</p>
<p>Here are some popular adage laws. There are so many of them, but I bet you’ve heard of at least half. Special thanks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_eponymous_laws">Wikipedia’s list of eponymous laws</a>.:</p>
<h3 id="amara-s-law"><a href="#amara-s-law" aria-label="Anchor link for: amara-s-law"><img src="https://taylor.gl/link.svg" alt="chain link icon"></a>
Amara’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>People overestimate the impact of a given technology initially, then underestimate it. Basically, when the hype bubble bursts, people are disappointed. After that, things return to a reasonable baseline. <em>Named after Roy Amara, the futurist who created the idea.</em></p>

Andy and Bill’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>An increase in hardware computing power will be met with an increase in software demand. Very similar to <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#wirth-s-law">Wirth’s law</a>. <em>Named after Andy Grove, Intel’s former CEO, and Bill Gates, Microsoft’s former CEO. Based on an old joke that, “what Andy gives, Bill takes away.”</em></p>

Benford’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In real-world data sets, the leading digit is much more likely to be a ’1’ than any other digit: the chance is about 30% <em>Named after Frank Benford, who originally called it the Law of Anomalous Numbers, though it was mentioned first by Simon Newcomb decades prior.</em>. </p>

Benford’s Law of Controversy:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Passion is inversely proportional to the amount of real information available.” <em>Stated by Gregory Benford the sci-fi author, not to be confused with Frank Benford, the physicist and engineer who lends their name to the first Benford’s Law.</em> Because we have two “Benford’s laws”, maybe we should stick to Frank Benford’s original name for his law: the Law of Anomalous Numbers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="betteridge-s-law"><a href="#betteridge-s-law" aria-label="Anchor link for: betteridge-s-law"><img src="https://taylor.gl/link.svg" alt="chain link icon"></a>
Betteridge’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Headlines which end in a question mark can be answered by the word “no”. (This really only makes sense for yes-or-no question headlines.) Studies have tried to disprove this law by showing that articles which have yes-or-no headlines are more likely to be answered in the body of the article “yes” than “no”, but these studies are clearly missing the point of the law. <em>Named after the tech journalist Ian Betteridge, who did not create the principle, though he claimed he did. Also referred to earlier as “Davis’ law”, with no reference to who Davis is.</em></p>

Brandolini’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude larger than the energy needed to produce it. <em>Originally called the Bullshit Asymmetry Principle by Alberto Brandolini on Twitter, though the idea has been around since before Twitter was even a thing.</em></p>

Brooks’ Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later” because it takes time for new members of a team to become productive, and because tasks are not infinitely divisible and adding people creates communication and collaboration overhead. <em>Created by Fred Brooks, author of the Mythical Man-Month, and named after himself.</em></p>

Campbell’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Quantitative social metrics often corrupt the process they are intended to measure because people will try to game the metric. <em>Created by the social scientist Donald T. Campbell. Although this law is often worded differently than <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#goodhart-s-law">Goodhart’s law</a>, as described by Campbell it is basically indistinguishable from Goodhart’s law, which was stated before Campbell’s law.</em></p>

Chesterton’s Fence:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don’t know why something is a certain way, leave it alone until you do. If you see a fence or other barrier across a road, some people will immediately try to remove it, but they may be ignorant of the reason for the fence and so could be making a mistake. <em>Named after Gilbert Keith Chesterton who stated it in one of his books. The allegory is clever and original, but the underlying idea is not and is essentially a restating of, “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” or of the Precautionary principle, etc. It’s not technically an adage law, but I included it because I like it.</em></p>

<li>When a famous, elderly scientist claims something is possible, they are almost certainly right. But when they claim something is impossible, they are almost certainly wrong.</li>

<li>“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”</li>
</ol>

    <section>
            <div>
        
<p>In early April, <a href="https://first10em.com/aerosols-droplets-and-airborne-spread/">I wrote a long post covering all the science I could find about aerosols and droplets</a>. The basic summary was that this is an area of medicine with lots of misconceptions, poor assumptions, and incomplete science. There was good evidence that previous coronaviruses were spread by aerosols. There was good evidence that influenza is spread by aerosols. Overall, it seemed very likely that SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 was being spread by aerosols, but the science was pretty weak. There is still a lot we don’t know, but as I update the evidence 6 months later, it is pretty clear that aerosols play an important, and unfortunately still widely ignored, role in the transmission of COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Dispelling some misconceptions</strong></h2>



<p>There are still many who argue strongly against the role of aerosols in transmission of COVID-19. In general, I think these arguments clash with science and have significant logical inconsistencies. Before getting to the evidence that COVID-19 is spread by aerosols, let’s dispel a few widely held misconceptions.</p>



<h3>COVID-19 has a low Ro</h3>



<p>One main argument against aerosol spread points to the Ro, with the assumption that airborne diseases will always spread easily, and therefore have a high Ro. The argument is often framed as, “this disease doesn’t look like measles, and therefore cannot possibly be airborne.” This is bad logic, as infectivity and mechanism of transmission are separate concepts. Some pathogens require higher numbers to reliably cause infections, which will result in a lower Ro no matter how the infection is transmitted. “While many airborne infections are highly contagious, this is not, strictly speaking, part of the definition.” (Tellier 2019)</p>



<p>The logic here is clearly faulty. The argument being used has the basic format: “X is a Y. Z is not like X. Therefore Z cannot be a Y.” This is somewhat like saying “a horse is a mammal, therefore that dog cannot be a mammal because they don’t look the same.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>This logic is especially problematic in the context of aerosol spread because there are other diseases with good evidence of aerosol spread, such as influenza, that look nothing like measles, but a lot like COVID-19. In fact, the prototypical airborne pathogen is tuberculosis, and tuberculosis has an Ro between 1-3 (exactly like COVID-19). (Ma 2018)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, the statement that ‘COVID looks nothing like measles’ is probably untrue. On average, disease transmission is low, but if you look at <a href="#superspreaders">super-spreaders</a>, COVID-19 starts to look a lot like measles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, the arguments based on Ro are both illogical and inconsistent with science. If anything, the Ro of COVID-19 looks exactly like other known airborne diseases (such as tuberculosis), and so this would be an argument in favour of airborne spread.</p>



<h3>Most transmission is short distance</h3>



<p>The equally fallacious corollary to the Ro argument is that “if COVID-19 is transmitted through aerosols, we should see a lot of infections occurring over long distances”. Although it is true that aerosols will disperse much further than droplets, it is faulty logic to define the <em>mode</em> of transmission by the <em>distance</em> of transmission. The concentration of infectious particles falls dramatically with distance, even when those infectious particles are carried by aerosols. They are spread out through 3 dimensional space, and therefore decrease exponentially with distance. Although aerosols <em>can </em>transmit disease over long distances, they are much more likely to transmit disease over a short distance. (Chen 2020)</p>



<p>This illogical step is so ingrained in the infectious diseases literature that most studies just assume droplet spread if there was close contact. This illogical assumption undermines a great deal of the existing infectious disease literature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an interesting historical analogy, for decades it was thought that tuberculosis was transmitted through droplets and fomites, because it occurred most often after close contact. We now know that tuberculosis <em>can only be transmitted through aerosols. </em>(Jimenez 2020)</p>



<p>The existing science refutes the assumption that close contact suggests droplet spread. At the typical conversational distance of about 1 meter, exposure to aerosols is about 2000 times greater than exposure to droplets. (Chen 2020)</p>



<p>The bottom line is that short range disease transmission is definitely consistent with aerosol transmission, and distance cannot be used to define mode of transmission. </p>

Transmission by both aerosols and droplets is highest when close to the patient. Although aerosol transmission can occur at a distance, the vast majority will occur at close range.</figcaption></figure>



<p>So why don’t we see a lot of long range transmission of COVID-19? The primary explanation is simple dilution. The further you are from a patient, the more dilute aerosols become. Risk of aerosol transmission drops off dramatically with increasing distance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The importance of dilution of aerosols is evident in everyday life. You can smell cigarette smoke when you are standing 8 meters away from a smoker, but it is nothing like the obnoxious fumes present if you were standing right next to them. Similarly, cigarette smoke is much worse indoors than out. Imagine each smoke molecule as a virus. You are obviously at much higher risk 1 meter away than you are at 8 meters. (But that doesn’t make smoke a droplet.)</p>



<p>Dilution doesn’t prevent exposure to the virus, but it makes it less probable. With dilution of aerosols, the primary driver of infection is the intrinsic infectivity of the pathogen. If infection occurs after exposure to only a few viral particles, we should expect to see more long range transmission despite the dilution. If larger exposures are required, we will see fewer infections. This is the primary difference between measles and COVID-19.</p>



<p>One final note about long range transmission: we really don’t know how common it is in COVID-19. Identification of long range transmission is incredibly difficult unless there are a very small number of cases. With a small outbreak of measles cases, it is easier to determine exactly where individuals were, and identify airborne transmission. For the vast majority of COVID-19 cases, we do not know how the individual became ill, and so could easily be overlooking long range transmission (especially when the possibility of aerosol transmission is dismissed out of hand in some circles). In fact, there seems to be pretty good evidence of long range transmission in many of the <a href="#superspreader">super-spreader events discussed below</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Our current approach is working</h3>



<p>Another argument occasionally used to dismiss aerosols as a mode of transmission is that our current PPE approach seems to be working in hospitals. First, <a href="https://first10em.com/we-are-not-doing-enough-to-protect-healthcare-workers-from-covid-19/">I would point out that healthcare workers are contracting COVID-19 at a rate that is far higher than the general population</a>, so this argument is pretty weak. Furthermore, as will be explored further below, there are many other factors that significantly dilute aerosols in most hospitals, like excellent ventilation, good distancing, and masking of both patients and providers. Although not quite as good as N95s, well fitting surgical masks will still filter out as much as 80% of infectious aerosols. (Makison Booth 2013) Combined with the low infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, these factors keep us relatively safe even when we stubbornly ignore the science that suggests aerosols are very important in the transmission of COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Particle size</h3>



<p>Many of the arguments against the aerosol spread of COVID-19 rely on incorrect assumptions about particle size. <a href="https://first10em.com/aerosols-droplets-and-airborne-spread/">I went into this at length in the first post</a>, so won’t repeat myself here. The basic summary is that particles of sizes that many articles refer to as droplets actually remain airborne for prolonged periods, and are therefore better classified as aerosols for the purposes of transmission. Just be careful when reading articles, because many don’t define these terms. When I use the term aerosol here, I am referring to any droplet that remains suspended in the air for longer that a few seconds, whatever the size, because that is the feature that matters for infection control. </p>



<h3>The lack of definitive proof</h3>



<p>Some of the arguments against aerosol transmission simply assume droplet transmission and demand “definitive proof” for aerosol transmission. I won’t attempt a treatise on the philosophy of science here, but that is an unreasonable bar.</p>



<p>One version of this argument states that viable SARS-CoV-2 has never been isolated from the air, and therefore we cannot definitively prove airborne transmission. This demand is unreasonable. Measles and tuberculosis are both known to be airborne, and no one has been able to isolate viable pathogens for either from the air. (Jimenez 2020) Furthermore, this is probably an outdated argument, as multiple studies actually have identified viable SARS-CoV-2 in the air. (Lednicky 2020; Santarpia 2020a)&nbsp;</p>



<p>The specifics of whether or not viable virus has been cultured from air samples is irrelevant. The point is that unfair standards are being used when comparing aerosols and droplets. There is no definitive proof that SARS-CoV-2 spreads through large droplets. (Jimenez 2020) It is crazy to require such stringent proof of aerosol transmission, while simultaneously just assuming droplet transmission is occurring. The same standards must be required for both claims. We are unlikely to have ‘definitive proof’ of either claim. Our decisions must be made based on the preponderance of the evidence.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>There is good evidence that COVID-19 spreads through aerosols</strong></h2>



<p>Although there is no “smoking gun”, the evidence that COVID-19 spreads through aerosols is relatively strong. Below I outline the …</p></div></section></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
		

		
		<div itemprop="articleBody">
			



<p>Jeff Bezos — a strong Democratic supporter — and Amazon are aiming to postpone a unionization vote at one of its warehouses in Alabama, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-seeks-to-postpone-alabama-unionization-vote-11611339250?mod=e2tw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a>. Interestingly, Amazon has requested that the National Labor Relations Board reconsider allowing mail-in voting, claiming that the mail-in voting process has “serious and systemic flaws.”</p>
<p>Got that? Bezos and Amazon are doing all they can to prevent any shady activity when workers cast their ballots for unionization, and they are particularly concerned about the integrity of mail-in ballots.</p>
<p>You are likely trying to figure out how that adds up, right? The <em>Washington Post</em>, owned by Bezos, called any claims of mail-in voter fraud by Donald Trump and his supporters dangerous and inexcusable. Amazon even banned Parler from its servers, in part to ensure no one could claim voter fraud occurred from mail-in ballots back in November.</p>
<p>But stop trying to make it make sense. It is not supposed to add up.</p>
<p>In this case, mail-in voting is disadvantageous for Bezos and his e-commerce behemoth. Therefore, they now consider mail-in voting seriously flawed.</p>
<p>An Amazon spokesperson <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/22/tech/amazon-nlrb-union-election/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tells</a> CNN the company is seeking a “valid, fair and successful election” and suggests that only in-person voting can ensure that. Hmm, interesting perspective.</p>
<p>Amazon has, thus far, fended off unions in the United States. If a majority of ballots vote in favor of unionization, hourly Amazon workers would send an L right up to Bezos’ office.</p>
<p>Bamazonunion.com explains that a union at Amazon would “give us the right to collectively bargain over our working conditions including items such as safety standards, training, breaks, pay, benefits, and other important issues that would make our workplace better.”</p>
<p>The NLRB says, “A mail ballot election will enfranchise employees who cannot enter the voting location for health reasons or due to positive COVID tests.” Fearing an unfavorable outcome, however, Amazon now insists that current COVID outbreaks aren’t dangerous enough to warrant this NLRB decision.</p>
<p>Amazon says that Lisa Henderson, NLRB’s Acting Regional Director “reached the remarkable conclusion that any level of infection or potential infection among employees counts as an ‘outbreak.'” <em>O</em><em>nly</em> 218 people employees, 2.88%, at its Bessemer facility tested positive during the 14-day period ending on January 7, which Amazon does not consider an “outbreak” apparently. This is quite the change of perspective. Imagine the coverage from the <em>Washington Post</em> if similar questions had been asked before November.</p>
<p>Mail-in voting has never been about the health of Americans or ensuring that each voice counts. As always, our country’s most powerful figures in both Washington and Silicon Valley base their opinions solely on the outcomes that increase their own power, finances, and flexibility.</p>
<p>Hypocritical, but sadly, all too predictable.</p>

A shitty implementation of a good abstraction causes no net harm to the code base. A bad abstraction or missing layer causes everything to rot. &nbsp;</li><li>Java isn't that terrible of a language.</li><li>Clever code isn't usually good code. Clarity trumps all other concerns.</li><li>Bad code can be written in any paradigm</li><li>So called "best practices" are contextual and not broadly applicable. Blindly following them makes you an idiot</li><li>Designing scalable systems when you don't need to makes you a <i>bad engineer</i>.</li><li>Static analysis is useful</li><li>DRY is about avoiding a specific problem, not an end goal unto itself.</li><li>In general, RDBMS &gt; NoSql</li><li>Functional programming is another tool, not a panacea.</li></ul><h2>Opinions I've picked up along the way</h2><ul><li>YAGNI, SOLID, DRY. In that order.</li><li>Pencil and paper are the best programming tools and vastly under used</li><li>Trading purity in exchange for practicality is usually a good call</li><li>Adding more technology is rarely a good call</li><li>Talking directly to the customer always reveals more about the problem, in less time, and with higher accuracy</li><li>The word "scalable" has a mystical and stupefying power over the mind of the software engineer. Its mere utterance can whip them into a depraved frenzy. Grim actions have been justified using this word</li><li>Despite being called "engineers," most decision are pure cargo-cult with no backing analysis, data, or numbers</li><li>90% – <i>maybe</i> 93% – of project managers, could probably disappear tomorrow to either no effect or a net gain in efficiency.</li><li>After performing over 100 interviews: interviewing is thoroughly broken. I also have no idea how to actually make it better.</li></ul><h2>Old opinions unchanged:</h2><ul><li>People who stress over code style, linting rules, or other minutia are insane weirdos</li><li>Code coverage has absolutely nothing to do with code quality</li><li>Monoliths are pretty good in most circumstances</li><li>TDD purists are just <i>the worst</i>. Their frail little minds can't process the existence of different workflows.</li></ul><p>&nbsp; We'll see which of these have flipped or changed at year 10.</p></article></div></div></div></div>]]>
